5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b> Due to additional training on new intercept methods and the vagaries of squadron transfers, the war ended before he would be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its {{starboard}} wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted <b>belly</b> <b>landing</b> in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because {{they had gone to}} look for water before the guerrillas arrived.|$|E

25|$|Lydia made an {{additional}} kill on July 16, 1943. That day, six Yaks encountered 30 German Ju-88 bombers with six escorts. The female ace downed a bomber and shared a victory with a comrade, but her fighter was hit {{and she had}} to make a <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were {{a number}} of foreign {{customers}} for the SB. They were mostly satisfied with the aircraft's performance. There were some complaints about the high noise level, cramped crew compartments, hard undercarriage suspension and in particular about the front gunner's position, which could be reached only through a hatch under the fuselage, preventing the gunner from escaping {{in the event of a}} ditching or <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b> Czechoslovakia signed an agreement to produce ANT-40 as Avia B-71.|$|E
25|$|In all, Lockheed built a {{total of}} 35 Orions costing $25,000 each new. It is not known if any survived past the 1940s except the one that survives to the present day. This lone {{remaining}} Orion was originally built as an experimental Altair with a metal fuselage. This Altair (built in 1931) was damaged in a <b>belly</b> <b>landing</b> accident in Columbus, Ohio, in 1933. It was returned to Lockheed where it was converted in 1934 to an Orion 9C configuration by the original designer of the Orion, Richard A. von Hake, and others who worked for free during a slow period when the Lockheed factory was going into bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|The Lockheed Martin Stalker {{was created}} in 2006 by the same Skunk Works team {{responsible}} for the Desert Hawk.

25|$|A second aircraft, (NR12048), {{powered by}} a 535hp Pratt & Whitney Wasp was built as the LC-DW300 Super Solution, {{retaining}} the fixed undercarriage of the original, for the 1931 Bendix Trophy which it won, piloted by Jimmy Doolittle. This aircraft was modified with retractable landing gear for the 1932 Bendix Trophy but on a test flight the gear failed to lower and Doolittle was forced to <b>belly</b> <b>land</b> the aircraft, forcing withdrawal from the race.|$|R
25|$|Many Allied fighter gun cameras often {{revealed}} that aircraft {{which had been}} claimed destroyed as '109's were often Arado Ar 96 trainers with a cadet pilot at the controls. To counter this non-combat flights were only {{to be carried out}} at dawn and dusk. The Luftwaffe expanded aircraft warning systems and devised radio signals to warn flights of intruders. If attacked, poorly armed aircraft were to dive down to tree-top level, and if necessary, the pilot was to <b>belly</b> <b>land</b> and take cover, as pilots were far more important than aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Needing a {{location}} to shoot all takeoffs and landings for the 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High, including the spectacular B-17 Flying Fortress <b>belly</b> <b>landing</b> sequence {{early in the}} film, director Henry King selected Ozark since its dark runways more closely matched wartime bases in England {{as opposed to the}} light-colored runways at nearby Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, the primary shoot location. Since the field had been allowed to overgrow during its inactive status, it was also an ideal location for the character Harvey Stovall to post-war reminisce about his World War II service (which is seen {{at the beginning of the}} film) before the crew mowed and dressed the field to start the rest of shooting.|$|E
25|$|When Israel finally {{launched}} Operation Focus on June 5, Bir Gifgafa was {{the target}} of the very first formation to take off from Hatzor at 07:14. The four Ouragans, led by Captain Ran Alon, struck the field at 07:45, hitting the runway and destroying several aircraft, including one MiG-21 which had just taken off. The MiG was downed by Captain David Yariv, who was himself subsequently hit by anti-aircraft fire and killed. The fierce anti-aircraft fire took its toll on the other aircraft as well, with a second Ouragan forced to perform a <b>belly</b> <b>landing</b> upon returning to Ramat David, while Captain Mordechai Lavon became a prisoner of war after ejecting his stricken aircraft over the Mediterranean and swimming ashore at Gaza.|$|E
25|$|F1CZs of 3 Squadron downed two Angolan MiG-21s in 1981 and 1982. On 6 November 1981, during Operation Daisy, two F1CZs were {{vectored}} by GCI {{to intercept}} two MiG-21s heading south. Major Johan Rankin shot down the wingman with cannon fire, as the missiles failed to lock {{on to the}} MiGs. On 5 October 1982, while escorting a Canberra of 12 Squadron on a photo-reconnaissance sortie, Major Rankin and his wingman engaged two MiG-21s on an intercept course. He fired two Magic AAMs {{at one of the}} MiGs, damaging the aircraft with the second missile. Rankin then attacked the second MiG and destroyed it with cannon fire. The first MiG was able to return to base, but sustained additional damage making a <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E

50|$|In June 1944 I Gruppe moved westwards to St. Dizier {{and later}} to Epinoy. In {{the early hours of}} 21 July Lt. Horst Prenzel (Staffelkapitan 1./JG 301) landed his Me 109G-6 at RAF Manston by mistake after a 'Wilde Sau' sortie over the {{invasion}} area. The RAF evaluated the aircraft at the RAE Farnborough, and then passed to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Wittering in August 1944. The same night Fw Manfred Gromil of 1./JG 301 <b>belly</b> <b>landed</b> his G-6 at Manston, due to lack of fuel.|$|R

25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a 24 volt DC {{generator}} on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of <b>belly</b> <b>landing,</b> the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|E

500|$|With {{the first}} prototype's repairs completed, it also joined the flight test program, {{completing}} captive flights. While in flight, the Goblin was stable, easy to fly, and recoverable from spins, although initial estimates of a 648mph (1,043km/h) top speed proved optimistic. The first test flights revealed that turbulence during {{approach to the}} B-29 was significant, leading to the addition of upper and lower fins at the extreme rear fuselage, {{as well as two}} wingtip fins to compensate for the increased directional instability in docking. All the initial flights had the hook secured in a fixed position, but when the hook was stowed and later raised, the resulting buffeting added to the difficulty in attempting a hookup. To address the problem, small aerodynamic fairings were added to the hook well that reduced the buffeting when the hook was extended and retracted. [...] When testing resumed, on the 18 March 1948 test flight, Schoch continued to have difficulty in hooking up, striking and damaging the trapeze's nose-stabilizing section, before resorting to another emergency <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b> After repairs to the trapeze, Schoch flew the first prototype on 8 April 1949, completing a 30-minute free flight test, but after three attempts, abandoned his efforts and resorted to another <b>belly</b> <b>landing</b> at Muroc.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 July 1945, Eastern Airlines Flight 45, a DC-3-201C (NC25647) {{flying from}} Washington, DC to Columbia, {{collided}} in mid-air with USAAF A-26C Invader 44-35553 near Florence, South Carolina. The A-26's vertical tail fin struck {{the left wing}} of the DC-3, displacing the engine which cut into fuselage while the A-26's tail was sheared off; pieces of the fin and rudder also struck the DC-3. The A-26 lost control and crashed; two crew parachuted but only one survived. The DC-3 <b>belly</b> <b>landed</b> in a cornfield although one passenger, a two-year-old boy, died.|$|R
500|$|At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a {{distress}} call to air traffic control, informing {{them that he}} had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. [...] "We're going in," [...] he radioed. Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to <b>belly</b> <b>land</b> the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze.|$|R
2500|$|... 2nd Lieutenant Jesse Bishop (played by Robert Patten), who <b>belly</b> <b>lands</b> in the B-17 next to {{the runway}} at the {{beginning}} of the film and was nominated for the Medal of Honor, had his true life counterpart in Second Lieutenant John C. Morgan. The description of Bishop's fight to control the bomber after his pilot was hit in the head by fragments of a 20mm cannon shell is taken almost verbatim from Morgan's Medal of Honor citation. Details may be found in The 12 O'Clock High Logbook. Robert Patten had been a USAAF Navigator in World War II, the only member of the cast with aircrew experience.|$|R
500|$|One of the Dakotas blew a tyre {{touching}} down on {{the rough}} airstrip; another tried to land on one wheel. Its undercarriage collapsed and it made a <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b> The former was subsequently salvaged, but the latter was a total loss. King sent out patrols that soon located Captain J. A. Chalk's B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion, which was operating in the area. That evening Chalk and King received airdropped messages from Vasey instructing them to occupy Kaiapit as soon as possible, and prepare a landing strip for troop-carrying aircraft. Vasey informed them that only small Japanese parties that had escaped from Lae were in the area, and their morale was very low. Vasey flew in to Leron on 18 September to meet with King. Vasey's orders were simple: [...] "Go to Kaiapit quickly, clean up the Japs and inform division." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1942 he mostly flew escort fighter {{missions}} for Junkers Ju 87 and Ju 88 bombers {{attacking the}} harbors at Ferosero, Polyarnoye, present-day Polyarny, and Murmansk. Weissenberger received the Iron Cross 1st Class (...) on 17 February 1942. On 25 February he claimed two more Hurricanes shot down at 11:15 and 11:22, his {{fourth and fifth}} victories. His Staffel was redesignated as 10.(Z) of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG 5—5th Fighter Wing) on 16 March 1942 and subordinated to JG5. In April 1942 he claimed eight victories, three of which were shot down on 15 April during two combat missions west of Murmansk. On 25 April at 7:20 Weissenberger took off at Kirkenes for an emergency intercept mission against 20 Soviet Petlyakov Pe-2 bombers. He shot down two bombers before his aircraft was hit by the defensive fire. The right engine started burning and {{he was forced to}} disengage from the enemy. Returning to the German lines, he made a safe <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
500|$|McDonnell {{test pilot}} Edwin Schoch was {{assigned}} to the project, riding in the XF-85 while it was stowed aboard the EB-29B, before attempting a [...] "free" [...] flight on 23 August 1948. After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20,000ft (6,000 m), he completed a 10-minute proving flight at speeds between 180 and 250mph (290–400km/h), testing controls and maneuverability. When he attempted a hook-up, it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber's turbulence, as well as being affected by the air cushion created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity. [...] Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect. After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze, Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off. He saved the prototype by making a <b>belly</b> <b>landing</b> on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at Muroc. [...] All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF-85 was repaired and modified. Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem-free dummy dockings with a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star fighter.|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{confusion}} over the circumstance of Specht's death. Lt. Melvin Paisley and his wingman Flight Officer Dave Johnson were flying 366th FG P-47s; Johnson shot down two German fighters before his aircraft was heavily damaged from return fire. Bailing out, he {{landed in a}} field near Asch. A Bf 109 he had shot down had <b>belly</b> <b>landed</b> close by and Johnson rode a borrowed bicycle over to inspect it. The aircraft was intact but the pilot was dead. Johnson took the pilot's identification card and gun and rode back to base. The identification card identified the pilot as an Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel); however, the card actually belonged to Oberleutnant (...) August Engel of 8 Staffel.|$|R
50|$|They almost {{ran into}} Mount Rainier when Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle were fogged in and Herndon again had the {{airplane}} off course. They decided {{to fly to}} Boise, where they could claim the furthest distance record along with the nonstop transpacific. Due to fog, Boise, Spokane, and Pasco, Washington, were unavailable, so they turned back, to Wenatchee, Washington. They <b>belly</b> <b>landed</b> on a strip {{cut out of the}} sagebrush on Fancher Field near what is now East Wenatchee. Pangborn's mother, brother, and a reporter from the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun had already assumed Wenatchee was their destination and were there waiting for their arrival.
