After {{a brief review of}} the statistics of typical wind speed data, a non-Gaussian model for the wind velocity is introduced that is based on a Lévy distribution. It is shown how this distri-bution can be used to derive a stochastic fractional diffusion equation for the wind velocity as a function of time whose solution is characterised by the Lévy index. A Lévy index numerical analysis is then performed on wind velocity data for both rural and urban areas where, in the latter case, the index has a larger value. Finally, an empirical relationship is derived for the power output from a wind turbine in terms of the Lévy index using <b>Betz</b> <b>law.</b> Key word...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} power (i. e. the {{sustainable}} power output {{as a function}} time) of any wind dependent energy converter (including wind turbines and wave energy converters) is determined by many design and environmental factors but timedependent variations in the wind speed are arguably the most important. In this paper we consider a non-Gaussian model for analysing and then simulating wind velocity data. In particular, we consider a Lévy distribution for the statistical characteristics of wind velocity and show how this distribution {{can be used to}} derive a stochastic fractional diffusion equation for the wind velocity as a function of time whose solution is characterised by the L´evy index. A L´evy index based numerical analysis is then performed on wind velocity data for both rural and urban areas where, in the latter case, the index is shown to have a larger value. Finally, an empirical relationship is derived for the power output from a wind turbine in terms of the L´evy index using <b>Betz</b> <b>law</b> and a similar relationship obtained for a wave energy converter. In both cases, it is shown how the average power output as a function of time is (inversely) related to the Lévy index for the wind velocity. It is concluded that these relationships may have value in determining the optimal geographical locations for the construction of wind and wave farms and for monitoring their performance in terms of power quality control...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Betz's</b> <b>law</b> {{indicates}} the maximum power {{that can be}} extracted from the wind, independent of {{the design of a}} wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919, by the German physicist Albert <b>Betz.</b> The <b>law</b> is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized [...] "actuator disk" [...] that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to <b>Betz's</b> <b>law,</b> no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. The factor 16/27 (0.593) is known as Betz's coefficient. Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75% to 80% of the Betz limit.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, {{the wind}} {{velocity}} at the rotor {{may be taken}} as {{the average of the}} upstream and downstream velocities. (This is arguably the most counter-intuitive stage of the derivation of <b>Betz's</b> <b>law.)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Conservation of mass {{requires}} {{that the amount of}} air entering and exiting a turbine must be equal. Accordingly, <b>Betz's</b> <b>law</b> gives the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine as 16/27 (59.3%) of the total kinetic energy of the air flowing through the turbine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Betz's</b> <b>law</b> {{applies to}} all Newtonian fluids, {{including}} wind. If all of the energy coming from wind movement through a turbine were extracted as useful energy, the wind speed afterwards would drop to zero. If the wind stopped moving at the exit of the turbine, then no more fresh wind could get in; it would be blocked. In {{order to keep the}} wind moving through the turbine, {{there has to be some}} wind movement, however small, on the other side with some wind speed greater than zero. <b>Betz's</b> <b>law</b> shows that as air flows through a certain area, and as wind speed slows from losing energy to extraction from a turbine, the airflow must distribute to a wider area. As a result, geometry limits any turbine efficiency to a maximum of 59.3%.|$|R
40|$|We {{all know}} that the wind is intermittent. As a rough measure, wind {{turbines}} can only operate when wind speeds are between 4 metres per second and 24 metres per second. There is a further technical limit, which need not concern us here, <b>Betz’s</b> <b>Law</b> – the maximum theoretical efficiency of a wind turbine is {{the ratio of the}} maximum power obtained from the wind to the total power available from the wind. Thi...|$|R
5000|$|According to <b>Betz's</b> <b>law,</b> {{the maximum}} {{power that is}} {{possible}} to extract from a rotor is , where [...] is the density of air, [...] and [...] are the height and radius of the rotor and [...] is the wind speed. However, in practice the extractable power is about twice lower (one can argue that only {{one half of the}} rotor — the scoop co-moving with the wind — works at each instant of time). Thus, one gets [...]|$|R
25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a conventional}} thermal power station, considered salable energy produced {{as a percent of}} the heating value of the fuel consumed, is typically 33% to 48%. As with all heat engines, their efficiency is limited, and governed by the laws of thermodynamics. Other types of power stations are subject to different efficiency limitations, most hydropower stations in the United States are about 90 percent efficient in converting the energy of falling water into electricity while the efficiency of a wind turbine is limited by <b>Betz's</b> <b>law,</b> to about 59.3%.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to manufacturing limitations, there exist limits within {{the laws of}} physics that govern how much energy can be generated. Traditional open turbine designs are also limited by <b>Betz's</b> <b>law,</b> which states that for a bare turbine in open wind, no more than 16/27 of the total wind kinetic energy can be converted to electrical energy. 59% is not the most efficient rate, so several designs have been made in order to get around this limitation. Designs include the addition of a [...] "Wind-Lens" [...] or using multiple rotors within the diffuser.|$|R
50|$|The {{analysis}} {{is focused on}} comparing the maximum power extraction modes and nothing else. Accordingly, several idealizations are made to simplify the analysis, further considerations are required to apply this analysis to real turbines. For example, in this comparison the effects of axial momentum theory are ignored. Axial momentum theory demonstrates how the wind turbine imparts an influence on the wind which in-turn decelerates the flow and limits the maximum power. For more details see <b>Betz's</b> <b>law.</b> Since this effect {{is the same for}} both lift and drag-based machines it can be ignored for comparison purposes. The topology of the machine can introduce additional losses, for example trailing vorticity in horizontal axis machines degrade the performance at the tip. Typically these losses are minor and can be ignored in this analysis (for example tip loss effects can be reduced with using high aspect-ratio blades).|$|R
40|$|Wind {{power is}} the second largest {{renewable}} resource from which we can obtain electricity, besides hydropower. Wind farms have had significant growth in past decades; however, they require a massive investment to setup including heavy towers, large land scale, and huge blades. Meanwhile, due to <b>Betz’s</b> <b>law,</b> the maximum power that the wind turbine can harvest is only 59. 3 %. Therefore, surfing kites have been proposed as a promising alternative way to generate electricity. This project aims to build a suitable simulation platform to study the modelling and control of kites for power generation. In this thesis, different types of the kite and their controlling methods have been reviewed, and two line surf kites {{have been identified as}} the subjects for the study. By analysing and comparing Newtonian mechanics theory and Kane’ method, the dynamic model of a kite is established. The kite power generation cycle and retraction cycle is then explained according to the model. Glider mode from AeroSim simulation blockset in Simulink library provides a set of tools to develop this non-linear six degree of the freedom kite dynamic model. The simulation results demonstrate the power generation ability of a surf kite. Considering the input constraints, a linear control system is proposed and simulated to make the kite achieve a figure eight configuration needed for power generation. The Simulink toolbox has then been employed to simulate the linear control scheme to determine its stability and performance...|$|R
