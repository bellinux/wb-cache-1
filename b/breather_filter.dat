2500|$|The HDD's {{spindle system}} relies on air density inside the disk {{enclosure}} {{to support the}} heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the <b>breather</b> <b>filter).</b> If the air density is too low, then {{there is not enough}} lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about [...] Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives â€“ they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or [...] "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.|$|E
40|$|Fluid dynamic bearing (FDB) oil and pivot grease {{are used}} as {{lubricant}} in the spindle motor and in the actuator pivot bearing cartridge in the hard disk drive (HDD). The presence of high amount of both FDB oil and pivot grease in hard disk drive {{may lead to the}} drive failure. Determination of FDB oil and pivot grease presence in the HDD after 300 hours, 600 hours and 900 hours of testing in reliability chamber was done by extracting the recirculation filter and adsorbent <b>breather</b> <b>filter</b> in the HDD using hexane as the solvent. The presence of FDB oil and pivot grease in the extracted solvent from the recirculation filter and adsorbent <b>breather</b> <b>filter</b> was determined via gas chromatography (GC) and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). The amount for both FDB oil and pivot grease were found to increase with the HDD test time. At the point of saturation, the internal HDD environment contains 116 ng/sample of FDB oil and 1120 ng/sample of pivot grease based on the recirculation filter extraction. However, this amount of vapors were able to be removed by the adsorbent <b>breather</b> <b>filter</b> as it has yet to reach the maximum amount that it can absorb...|$|E

40|$|The macrobenthic fauna of Navigation Pool No. 8 of the Upper Mississippi River was {{inventoried}} and {{correlated with}} the average physical-chemical conditions encountered in the pool. Forty-one sampling areas, numbered in order of increasing current velocity, were delineated {{on the basis of}} characteristic chemical and physical properties during the summer of 1975. A trend toward decreasing eutrophy occurred from area 1 to area 41. Benthos samples were collected twice during the summer in each of the study areas. One hundred forty-four taxa were found in the 616 Ponar-dredge collections. Over half of the collected taxa were insect nymphs and larvae. A total of 90, 693 representatives of the Phyla Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, and Mollusca were counted, weighed, and identified. Oligochaetes were by far the most ubiquitous and dominant macroinvertebrates. Greatest oligochaete densities were respectively recorded during Sampling Periods I and II in areas 3 (17, 306. 10 /m 2) and 18 (16, 609. 98 /m 2) and in areas 1 (10, 302. 11 /m 2) and 18 (10, 894. 18 /m 2). The qualitative and the quantitative compositions of the benthic communities varied among the 41 study areas. Habitat preferences of particular benthic forms were reflected in the distributional relationships between the macroinvertebrates and the physical-chemical conditions. Benthic production, in terms of the total wet weight/m 2 and the mean number of macroinvertebrates/m 2 in each area, was generally greater in the more eutrophic areas. The more eutrophic areas supported fewer taxa. These taxa generally consisted of pollution-tolerant organisms, such as oligochaetes and certain chironomids, which were capable of burrowing into the depositional-type substrates. More taxa and greater numbers of gill <b>breathers</b> and <b>filter</b> feeders, such as caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, and dipterans, were collected from the less eutrophic areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the design {{compliance}} matrix (DCM) {{is to provide a}} single-source document of all design requirements associated with the fifteen subsystems that make up the rotary mode core sampling (RMCS) system. It is intended to be the baseline requirement document for the RMCS system and to be used in governing all future design and design verification activities associated with it. This document is the DCM for the RMCS system used on Hanford single-shell radioactive waste storage tanks. This includes the Exhauster System, Rotary Mode Core Sample Trucks, Universal Sampling System, Diesel Generator System, Distribution Trailer, X-Ray Cart System, Breathing Air Compressor, Nitrogen Supply Trailer, Casks and Cask Truck, Service Trailer, Core Sampling Riser Equipment, Core Sampling Support Trucks, Foot Clamp, Ramps and Platforms and Purged Camera System.

40|$|Chemical vapor {{emissions}} from underground hazardous waste storage tanks on the Hanford site in eastern Washington State are a potential concern because workers enter the tank farms {{on a regular}} basis for waste retrievals, equipment maintenance, and surveillance. Tank farm contractors {{are in the process of}} retrieving all remaining waste from aging single-shell tanks, some of which date to World War II, and transferring it to newer double-shell tanks. During the waste retrieval process, tank farm workers are potentially exposed to fugitive chemical vapors that can escape from tank headspaces and other emission points. The tanks are known to hold more than 1, 500 different species of chemicals, in addition to radionuclides. Exposure assessments have fully characterized the hazards from chemical vapors in half of the tank farms. Extensive sampling and analysis has been done to characterize the chemical properties of hazardous waste and to evaluate potential health hazards of vapors at the ground surface, where workers perform maintenance and waste transfer activities. Worker concerns. risk communication, and exposure assessment are discussed, including evaluation of the potential hazards of complex mixtures of chemical vapors. Concentrations of vapors above occupational exposure limits-(OEL) were detected only at exhaust stacks and passive <b>breather</b> <b>filter</b> outlets. Beyond five feet from the sources, vapors disperse rapidly. No vapors have been measured above 50 % of their OELs more than five feet from the source. Vapor controls are focused on limited hazard zones around sources. Further evaluations of vapors include analysis of routes of exposure and thorough analysis of nuisance odors...|$|E
50|$|On 29 November 1942, the 94th Fighter Squadron {{flew the}} group's first combat sorties in the Mediterranean theater, {{strafing}} a German airfield and recording several aerial victories. However, {{as the year}} came to a close, the group's morale sagged. Though the move from England to the desert environment added sometimes 200-300 hours {{to the life of}} the liquid-cooled Allisons, few replacement parts and virtually no replacement aircraft were available. Col. Clifford R. Silliman, in charge of Lightning maintenance and repairs for the 1st, 12th and 14th fighter groups, recalled that no hangars, machine shops or service bays were available, forcing ground crews to make repairs in the open air. Crewmen were exposed not only to attack but to virtually incessant blowing sand and dust that continually fouled <b>filters,</b> <b>breathers</b> and lubricants. The searing sun was so intense that mechanics were unable to as much as touch the aluminum surfaces of the fuselage, wings and cowlings with exposed skin, Silliman said. The grating sand found its way not only into engine components and weapons but crewmens' bedding, footwear, clothing, hair, eyes and even their teeth. Pilots recorded some kills, but the loss ratio in air-to-air combat was even at best. For nearly a year, the group moved throughout Algeria and Tunisia, flying bomber escort and providing air coverage for the ground campaign. On 23 February 1943, the group began two days of low-level strafing missions in support of hard-pressed Allied troops at Kasserine Pass, losing several aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Passive {{ventilation}} {{with the}} atmosphere is used to prevent accumulation of waste gases and vapors in the headspaces of 132 of the 177 high-level radioactive waste Tanks at the Hanford Site in Southeastern Washington State. Measurements of the passive ventilation rates are needed for the resolution of two key safety issues associated with the rates of flammable gas production and accumulation and the rates at which organic salt-nitrate salt mixtures dry out. Direct measurement of passive ventilation rates using mass flow meters is not feasible because ventilation occurs va multiple pathways to the atmosphere (i. e., via the <b>filtered</b> <b>breather</b> riser and unsealed tank risers and pits), as well as via underground connections to other tanks, junction boxes, and inactive ventilation systems. The tracer gas method discussed in this report provides a direct measurement of {{the rate at which}} gases are removed by ventilation and an indirect measurement of the ventilation rate. The tracer gas behaves as a surrogate of the waste-generated gases, but it is only diminished via ventilation, whereas the waste gases are continuously released by the waste and may be subject to depletion mechanisms other than ventilation. The fiscal year 1998 tracer studies provide new evidence that significant exchange of air occurs between tanks via the underground cascade pipes. Most of the single-shell waste tanks are connected via 7. 6 -cm diameter cascade pipes to one or two adjacent tanks. Tracer gas studies of the Tank U- 102 /U- 103 system indicated that the ventilation occurring via the cascade line could be a significant fraction of the total ventilation. In this two-tank cascade, air evidently flowed from Tank U- 103 to Tank U- 102 for a time and then was observed to flow from Tank U- 102 to Tank U- 103...|$|R
