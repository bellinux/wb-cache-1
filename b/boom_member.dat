50|$|The idea {{of forming}} a band came in 1988 as a {{collaboration}} between the Lollypops and Baby <b>Boom</b> <b>members.</b> Together, former Lollypops member Aleksandar Eraković (vocals), former Baby <b>Boom</b> <b>members</b> Dejan Pejović (backing vocals) and Dušan Pavlović (guitar), Goran Redžepi (drums) Dušan Varda (both backing vocals), made several demo recordings. Previously, Eraković, Pejović, and Pavlović went together to the Belgrade school for industrial design (1986-1988), which is where they met. In September 1989 Eraković, Pejović, Pavlović and Redžepi all went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army. On their return from the army service, the two bands merged with Eraković as the lead vocalist, being officially formed as a band in 1990. Other members which joined the band were Dejan Petrović (backing vocals), Dejan Jovanović (bass guitar).|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a spinning symmetrical spacecraft system during the deployment (or retraction) of flexible boom-type appendages were investigated. The effect of flexibility during boom deployment is treated by modelling the deployable members as compound spherical pendula of varying length (according to a control law). The {{orientation of the}} flexible booms {{with respect to the}} hub, is described by a sequence of two Euler angles. The <b>boom</b> <b>members</b> contain a flexural stiffness which can be related to an assumed effective restoring linear spring constant, and structural damping which effects the entire system. Linearized equations of motion for this system, when the boom length is constant, involve periodic coefficients with the frequency of the hub spin. A bounded transformation is found which converts this system into a kinematically equivalent one involving only constant coefficients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs the {{development}} and application of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials to different engineering structures are increasing gradually, composite fiber patching techniques are being considered as alternatives to traditional methods of strengthening and fatigue crack repair in steel structures, such as the <b>boom</b> <b>members</b> of draglines. In general, the dragline <b>boom</b> <b>members</b> are {{in the form of}} circular tube type structure, therefore, application of FRP patching is usually bonded on one side (the outside surface) of the tube structure. In order to examine the efficiency of the repair by single-side patching of FRP material to tube structures, finite element study of cracked steel tube structure is conducted. The objectives of the finite element study are (1) to study the reduction of stress intensity factor (SIF) of cracked steel tube member repaired with FRP patching and (2) to predict the fatigue life of welded steel tube member repaired with FRP patching. The cracked steel circular tube was modeled by using 3 -D brick elements and the adhesive and FRP patching were modeled by using shell elements. The adherend stiffness ratio (Efrp tfrp / Es ts) of this study is about 0. 34. Comparison of the SIF of cracked steel circular tube with and without FRP patching showed that the SIF was reduced significantly for models with FRP patching and the reduction was more than 50 %. Prediction of the fatigue life of cracked circular tube member with and without FRP patching was carried out by means of the Paris equation. Due to the significant reduction of SIF for members with FRP patching, it is shown that the corresponding predicted fatigue life is increased significantly as well. In particular, the increase of fatigue life is about 22 times for model with CFRP sheet patching when the circumference half crack length grows from 25. 4 mm (1 inch) to 63. 5 mm (2. 5 inch) ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} for lending booms in the three biggest new EU Member States (the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland) {{during the process of}} euro adoption. Experiences of some old members (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) and the econometric evidence speak in favour of strong loan increases in Hungary and Poland even though their magnitude may be smaller than in the case of those recently recorded in Ireland and Portugal. Due to estimation problems, the situation in the Czech Republic was more difficult to foresee, but given almost complete interest rate convergence with the euro area only modest increases in lending should be expected there. In conclusion, it may be stated that, given the currently available information, no substantial risk to the banking sectors of the new Member States should be expected.

50|$|Although {{the first}} {{impact of the}} British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their {{inspiration}} more directly from American blues, including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as Lead Belly, who was {{a major influence on}} the Skiffle craze, and Robert Johnson. Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound, often centered on the electric guitar, based on the Chicago blues, particularly after the tour of Britain by Muddy Waters in 1958, which prompted Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to form the band Blues Incorporated. The band involved and inspired many of the figures of the subsequent British blues <b>boom,</b> including <b>members</b> of the Rolling Stones and Cream, combining blues standards and forms with rock instrumentation and emphasis.|$|R

40|$|Generation X {{has often}} been defined as being without role models or inspiration. Nevertheless, it is {{possible}} to detect a sizeable amount of intertextual references in several Quebecer books written by authors of that generation. In Quebec, these young writer's influences are as distinct as they are diverse, varying from Kerouac to Hemingway and from Sartre to Camus. But concerning their Quebecer role model, one name continually returns, that of Rejean Ducharme. The goal of this thesis is to illustrate the presence of ducharmesque universe in three Generation X novels, namely Le souffle de l'harmattan by Sylvain Trudel, Vamp by Christian Mistral and La rage by Louis Hamelin. Within these novels, we will attempt to find the trail of three typical elements to Ducharme's work: the rejection of conformity, the contempt towards a consumer society, and the substitution of a utopian universe for reality. According to Francois Ricard, Ducharme belongs to what he calls the "generation lyrique", which is the eldest baby boomers, while Generation X is composed of Baby <b>Boom's</b> youngest <b>members.</b> Interestingly enough, one should expect such a generational conflict between these two cohorts to incite Generation X writers to despite their predecessor. Hence, this thesis will conclude with a few tentative explanations as to why Generation X authors were so driven to choose Rejean Ducharme, a member of the "generation lyrique", to be their role model...|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} further disorganized by the churn of its rank-and-file members {{in and out}} of the party, {{exemplified}} by the count of Wellington <b>members</b> <b>booming</b> from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932. Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months. The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the Red Worker (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist Maoriland Worker), and by courtroom losses in several libel cases brought against that publication. Party publications were carefully scrutinized, with two issues of the Red Worker and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.|$|R
40|$|The {{airborne}} {{rescue system}} includes a <b>boom</b> with telescoping <b>members</b> for extending {{a line and}} collar to a rescue victim. The boom extends beyond {{the tip of the}} helicopter rotor so that the victim may avoid the rotor downwash. The rescue line is played out and reeled in by winch. The line is temporarily retained under the boom. When the boom is extended, the rescue line passes through clips. When the victim dons the collar and the tension in the line reaches a predetermined level, the clips open and release the line from the boom. Then the rescue line can form a straight line between the victim and the winch, and the victim can be lifted to the helicopter. A translator is utilized to push out or pull in the telescoping members. The translator comprises a tape and a rope. Inside the telescoping members the tape is curled around the rope and the tape has a tube-like configuration. The tape and rope are provided from supply spools...|$|R
40|$|Essential {{features}} of a general formulation for studying librational dynamics of a large class of spacecraft during deployment of flexible members are reviewed. The formulation is applicable {{to a variety of}} missions ranging from deployment of antennas, booms and solar panels to manufacturing of trusses for space platforms using the space shuttle. The governing nonlinear, non-autonomous and coupled equations of motion are extremely difficult to solve even {{with the help of a}} computer, not to mention the cost involved. To get some appreciation as to the complex interactions between flexibility, deployment and attitude dynamics as well as to help pursue stability and control analysis, the equations are linearized about their nominal deflected equilibrium configuration. The procedure is applied to the Space Shuttle based deployment of <b>boom</b> and plate-like <b>members.</b> Results suggest substantial influence of the inertia parameter, flexural rigidity of the appendages, orbit eccentricity, deployment velocity, initial conditions, etc. on the system response. The results should prove useful in planning of the Orbiter based experiments aimed at assessing effectiveness of procedures for studying dynamics and control of flexible orbiting members...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{points out}} to {{ambiguous}} {{relationship between the}} government CR and The government's National Economic Council (NERV).

40|$|Trend {{growth in}} the labor force is a key {{determinant}} of trends in employment and gross domestic product (GDP). Forecasts by Macroeconomic Advisers (MA) have long anticipated a marked slowing in trend growth of the labor force that would contribute to a slowing in potential GDP growth. This is reflected in MA’s forecast that the aggregate rate of labor force participation will trend down, especially after 2010, largely in response to the aging of the baby <b>boom</b> generation, whose <b>members</b> are beginning to approach typical retirement ages. Expectations for a downward trajectory for the participation rate and a slowing in trend labor force growth are not unique. However, this article reports on MA research suggesting that the opposite is possible: that the slowdown in trend labor force growth could be relatively modest and that the trend in the aggregate rate of labor force participation will decline little, if at all, over the next decade.

40|$|A new genus {{and species}} of dromiacean crab, Lucanthonisia praemium, is {{recorded}} from the basal Belsele- Waas Clay <b>Member</b> (<b>Boom</b> Clay Formation; Rupelian, lower Oligocene) as formerly exposed at the Scheerders van Kerchove (SVK) clay pit near Sint-Niklaas, province of Oost-Vlaanderen (northwest Belgium). Extant dromioid crabs either carry foreign objects for camouflage (Dromiidae, Homolodromiidae) or are associated with corals (Dynomenidae). Although having been collected from the basal portion of the Belsele-Waas Clay Member which is rich in phosphatic nodules, preservation of the new form is such that long-term transport is unlikely. Therefore, the species is assumed to have lived hidden amongst and below such nodules, but it cannot be ruled out that it also carried sponges for defence. To our knowledge, representatives of such biota {{have not yet been}} recorded from the Boom Clay Formation. Dromilites eotvoesi from middle Miocene (‘upper Badenian’, Serravallian) strata in the Budapest area (central Hungary) is transferred to the new genus, Lucanthonisia. Lucanthonisia eotvoesi n. comb. differs from L. praemium, the type species, in having shorter, more anteriorly directed lateral spines, more closely spaced and less divergent rostral horns, better-developed epigastric nodes and a less convex carapace longitudinally. Preservation of a partial thoracic sternum in L. praemium gen. nov., sp. nov. allows comparison with dromioid families and tentative placement of the new genus, as well as the allied Basinotopus, in the Dynomenidae...|$|R
40|$|Clay {{formations}} {{are currently}} {{considered as a}} possible host rock for the storage of radioactive waste (RW). The low permeability and large sorption capacity make clay formations suitable sediments for RW deposition. The <b>Boom</b> clay <b>member</b> in Belgium and the Netherlands is currently studied as a reference rock for methodological studies on the disposal and storage of RW (De Craen et al. 2004 a). Iron-­‐containing constituents are assumed to dominate the redox properties of the Boom clay, and have been researched by De Craen (2004 a) and De Craen et al. (2004 b). Here, {{the composition of the}} Boom clay in the Netherlands has been geochemically characterized. Sediment samples originating from Limburg and Zeeland have been analysed, to identify the mineralogy, geochemical composition and redox status The objectives for this research are to determine of the in situ porewater composition, to identify processes that take place in the porewater after perturbation. In addition, the possibility of redox potential determination based on the activities of reactants and products of the Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + couple is assessed. The porewater composition was determined by squeezed porewater from a sediment core, and a leaching method. The composition of the porewater during the leaching method was measured at 4 different points in time, which gives insight in the processes that take place in the porewater after perturbation. The iron speciation was determined by sequential extraction (Claff et al. 2010). This research provided insight on the geochemical porewater composition and the solid fraction content of the Boom clay in the Netherlands. The results from both the leaching and the squeezing method show that the porewater composition has a strong marine influence. The selective enrichment in SO 42 -­‐ and Ca 2 + that was found is probably due to oxidation of pyrite during the storage of the sediment cores. However, only part of the pyrite was oxidized since there is still pyrite present in the sediment. Additionally to pyrite oxidation, sulphate reduction was observed. Sulphate was used as a terminal electron donor during the degradation of organic matter by SRB. Assigning a redox potential to system in our research was found to be very difficult. Pyrite oxidation in the sediment samples made it impossible to constrain a substantiated redox potential for the in situ conditions...|$|R
