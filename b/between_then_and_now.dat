2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E

40|$|Shortly after quantum {{mechanics}} evolved Heitler and London [1] applied the then new {{ideas to the}} problem of molecule formation and chemical valence. Their treatment of the H 2 molecule was qualitatively very successful, and this led to numerous studies by various workers applying the same ideas to other substances. Many of these involved refinements of the original Heitler-London procedure, and within three or four years, a group of ideas and procedures had become reasonably well codified in what was called the valence bond (VB) * method for molecular structure. A few calculations were carried out earlier, but by 1929 Dirac [2] wrote: The general theory of {{quantum mechanics}} is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble.... Since these words were written there has been no reason to feel that they are incorrect in any way.

40|$|Other {{than the}} need for an {{occasional}} message on stewardship, the book of Malachi has received little attention. Such neglect has unintentially relegated the book to a secondary status. Consequently, it is seldom that one thinks of Malachi when considering the OT prophets. This neglect {{is due in part to}} its location in the English Bible and to its question and answer style which may not seem as appealing as the typical prophetic style of proclamation. One only needs to look at the average theological library or to remember the last message from Malachi that was not on stewardship to see this neglect exists. It is hoped that this article will encourage and assist the readers in their study and preaching of Malachi. The best overall commentary is the recent work by W. C. Kaiser, Jr. entitled Malachi: God's Unchanging Love. His purpose is not to do an exege-sis based on sound hermeneutical principles alone but to bridge the gap <b>between</b> the <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> His book is thus an excellent balance between the technical and the practical. His combination of both the descriptive element with the normative element has produced a commentary that rises above the mere informative level. Kaiser includes two appendixes which not only add important supportive material but also help to maintain clarity and flow throughout his exposition of the text. The first appendix deals with contextual, syntactical, verbal, theological and homiletical analysis. His second appendix on the usefulness of commentaries for Bible study and preaching serves not only as an excellent standard for evaluating other commentaries but also for evaluating Kaiser's book on Malachi. His commentary is conservative in stance and easy to understand. His introduction is very good. His balance of the practical and theological with the exegetical and technical, may in large measure be a prototype of a new breed of commentaries. God’s unchangin...|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, Gold {{broke from}} the {{monochromatic}} process to create paintings that allowed {{first for the}} intuitive composition of space and later for painterly mark making. As such, her way of being [...] "color-shy, distrustful {{of the power of}} color or color-names" [...] was replaced by the play of painterly process. With the removal of the monochromatic surface, geometric forms pull to the foreground of the paintings, which were realized by Gold [...] "in accordance with my sense of intuition and reason." [...] Stephen Westfall explains in an Arts Magazine review that [...] "the main differences <b>between</b> Gold’s work <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>now</b> are that she’s drawing more within the boundaries of her interlocking planes, there’s movement to the planes themselves (they’re not as locked into the rectangle of the canvas, even if they remain parallel to it), and there’s a wider color range. Her marks used to be, as she has written, 'a consequence of putting paint down on a surface.' They’re grown into lyrical gestures that resonate with the natural landscape and the figure." [...] These paintings became a transformative step towards an inclusive form of mark making that can be seen in Gold's trajectory toward not only painterly abstraction but the introduction of unabashedly illusionistic representational painting in later works.|$|R

This much was known then, namely, that it was contagious and that those afflicted by it should be segregated. The difference <b>between</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>now</b> is that to-day the leper is more rigidly segregated and more humanely treated. But leprosy itself still remains the same awful and profound mystery. A reading of the reports of the physicians and specialists of all countries reveals the baffling nature of the disease. These leprosy specialists are unanimous on no one phase of the disease. They do not know. In the past they rashly and dogmatically generalized. They generalize no longer. The one possible generalization that can be drawn from all the investigation that has been made is that leprosy is FEEBLY CONTAGIOUS. But in what manner it is feebly contagious is not known. They have isolated the bacillus of leprosy. They can determine by bacteriological examination whether or not a person is a leper; but they are as far away as ever from knowing how that bacillus finds its entrance into the body of a non- leper. They do not know the length of time of incubation. They have tried to inoculate all sorts of animals with leprosy, and have failed.|$|E

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Design de Comunicação e Novos Media, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2012 In {{the last}} half of the twentieth century avant-garde art {{practices}} from Fluxus to Mail Art and Hacker Art have promised the creation of collaborative art and the produc-tion of new models of sharing knowledge. Today, these narrow practices have inspired the structure of the Web 2. 0 platforms, reaching for the first time a huge mass of Internet users. This dissertation proposes to analyze the roots of artistic practices and social in-tervention based on both analog and digital subcultural networked art, showing that the current artistic challenge of the Web 2. 0 platforms lies in the invention of new courses of action and new contents developed by networked communities. A thread connects networked art such as Fluxus, Mail Art, net. art and Hacker Art with Web 2. 0 social networking practices. In order to prove the facts set out in this investigation, we will develop and apply a new conceptual framework for analysis of artistic networking or networked art to a number of case studies. The identification and justification, as well as the definition, description and explanation of the case studies, which are framed within the required characteristics, is an exercise that will demonstrate and validate the links between movements such as Fluxus and Mail Art with the new movements from the 21 st century.

Next to the candle-light show the red and blue coats and white breeches of the soldiers--nearly twenty of them in all besides the ponderous Derriman--the head of the latter, and, indeed, the heads of all who are standing up, being in dangerous proximity to the black beams of the ceiling. There is not one among them who would attach any meaning to 'Vittoria,' or gather from the syllables 'Waterloo' the remotest idea of his own glory or death. Next appears the correct and innocent Anne, little thinking what things Time has in store for her at no great distance off. She looks at Derriman with a half-uneasy smile as he clanks hither and thither, and hopes he will not single her out again to hold a private dialogue with--which, however, he does, irresistibly attracted by the white muslin figure. She must, of course, look a little gracious again now, lest his mood should turn from sentimental to quarrelsome--no impossible contingency with the yeoman-soldier, as her quick perception had noted.|$|E

In two of the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the free negro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away, and in a third--New York--it has been greatly abridged; while it has not been extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though the number of the States has more than doubled. In those days, as I understand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition. In those days Legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective States, but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State constitutions to withhold that power from the Legislatures. In those days, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited, but now Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could not if it would. In those days our Declaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and torn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it.
