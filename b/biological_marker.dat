40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>markers</b> for {{depression}} are {{of great interest}} to aid in elucidating the causes of major depression. We assess currently available <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> to query their validity for aiding in the diagnosis of major depression. We specifically focus on neurotrophic factors, serotonergic markers, biochemical markers, immunological markers, neuroimaging, neurophysiological findings, and neuropsychological markers. We delineate the most robust <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> of major depression. These include decreased platelet imipramine binding, decreased 5 -HT 1 A receptor expression, increase of soluble interleukin- 2 receptor and interleukin- 6 in serum, decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor in serum, hypocholesterolemia, low blood folate levels, and impaired suppression of the dexamethasone suppression test. To date, however, none of these markers are sufficiently specific to contribute to the diagnosis of major depression. Thus, with regard to new diagnostic manuals such as DSM-V and ICD- 11 which are currently assessing whether <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> may be included in diagnostic criteria, no <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> for major depression are currently available for inclusion in the diagnostic criteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigations}} described in this thesis was to seek for answers to two relevant questions in ICUs in resource-rich settings, i. e., can new <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> {{play a role in}} early recognition of AKI, and can new <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> predict recovery of renal function in patients who receive CVVH? A second aim was to answer a relevant question in ICUs in resource-poor settings, i. e., can novel <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> predict development of AKI and need for RRT in patients with severe P. falciparum malaria? Both CyC and NGAL have been suggested promising endogenous <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> for AKI in ICU patients. Results from the prospective observational SCARF study suggests that neither CyC nor NGAL are useful <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> for AKI and need for RRT. The patient population in SCARF is rather heterogeneous. We believe this cohort better reflects the patient populations seen in the ICU in whom the abovementioned questions are relevant. Based on the findings in the SCARF study and its secondary analyses we conclude CyC and NGAL cannot serve as <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> in clinical practice. As suPAR has a good prognostic value in patients with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis or bacteremia, we speculated suPAR to have pathogenetic role in patients with severe P. falciparum. The investigation described in this thesis suggests this to be true. But a prognostic value for suPAR with AKI in this specific patient group was not confirmed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is the {{expression}} of a complex network of mediators. Multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock indeed remain a major cause of death among ICU patients worldwide. Prompt recognition of both the diagnosis and the complicated evolution are essential, hence the importance of using <b>biological</b> <b>markers.</b> The main pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as hundreds of others cellular markers, circulating bioactive molecules or coagulation products are potential <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> that could help to characterize the presence of infection and sepsis. We aimed to review the main <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> that could be used nowadays or possibly in the future, either in clinical or research fields. CONTENTS: A selective review of biologic markers of sepsis focusing on markers of the coagulation cascade, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the available <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> is still not a practical method to be used at the bed-side and is currently restricted to research works. Nowadays the determination of CRP or PCT serum levels can be of great help in the critically ill patient care along with the conventional parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> {{is recognized as}} necessary {{to the future of}} toxicology, epidemiology, and quantitative risk assessment. For <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> to become widely accepted, their validity must be ascertained. This paper explores the range of considerations that compose the concept of validity as it applies to the {{evaluation of}} <b>biological</b> <b>markers.</b> Three broad categories of validity (measurement, internal study, and external) are discussed in the context of evaluating data for use in quantitative risk assessment. Particular attention is given to the importance of measurement validity in the consideration of whether to use <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> in epidemiologic studies. The concepts developed in this presentation are applied to examples derived from the occupational environment. In the first example, measurement of bromine release as a marker of ethylene dibromide toxicity is shown to be of limited use in constructing an accurate quantitative assessment of the risk of developing cancer as a result of long-term, low-level exposure. This example is compared to data obtained from studies of ethylene oxide, in which hemoglobin alkylation is shown to be a valid marker of both exposure and effect...|$|R
