5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out press packs {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E
5|$|The Mauna Ulu {{eruption}} of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu {{was the longest}} flank {{eruption of}} any Hawaiian volcano in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with lava, and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two pit craters, Āloi and Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both pāhoehoe and aā lava erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> as much as 540meters (1772ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters Pauahi and Hiiaka.|$|E

Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E

The French managed {{to save their}} eagles and their one remaining cannon. As they withdrew, they met Marmont's relief column which was marching toward the sound of battle. Immediately, the XI Corps stormed into Graz, smashing down Austrian resistance and ejecting Gyulai's corps from the town. The attackers then ran amok, killing numbers of Austrian wounded and prisoners.|$|E

25|$|After some {{preliminary}} engagements at Campo Baccano and at Trevi, the Saracens were driven to their stronghold on the Garigliano. There, at the Battle of Garigliano, the allies proceeded to lay siege {{to them for}} three months, {{at the end of}} which the Saracens burnt their houses and attempted to <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> of the encirclement. With John leading the way, all were eventually caught and killed, achieving a great victory and removing the ongoing Saracen threat on the Italian mainland. John then confirmed the granting of Traetto to the Duke of Gaeta, as a reward for abandoning his Saracen allies.|$|E
25|$|Poul Anderson, {{in his own}} {{series of}} novels {{depicting}} a space empire modeled on Rome, used a similar setting in The Day of Their Return. Though very different in detail from Asimov's book, Anderson's version also has a setting of a rebellious planet similar to ancient Judea, from which a wave of religious fanaticism is about to <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> into the wider Empire – to be stopped by a decisive action of the protagonist. Also in Anderson's book, the preventing of rebellion and the planet acceptance of Imperial rule is clearly shown as a positive outcome.|$|E
25|$|According {{to later}} information, the terrorists planned to kidnap Chen Honglu (the dual Chinese-American citizen) to trade {{him for a}} Taliban {{commander}} in Afghanistan. As the attack unfolded in the Nanga Parbat base camp, Chen <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> of his tent and tackled one of the militants using martial arts techniques. The militant, named Mujeeb, panicked and shot him, destroying {{the main purpose of}} the mission and infuriating the terrorist commanders. The remaining climbers were then tied up and shot. The attackers then walked for five hours to a remote village where they buried their uniforms and had breakfast before a walking on to another village and dispersing.|$|E

25|$|About 1:30 PM on 8 August 1809, the 600 dragoons of General of Brigade Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's brigade <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> of cover, trotted down to {{the river}} bank, and splashed into the river. They rapidly navigated the deep part of the ford and soon reached the {{shallows}} on the south bank. The 1st Extremadura Hussar Regiment and an infantry battalion from the bridge defenders tried to oppose the French cavalry. Caulaincourt's troopers set upon the Spanish hussars and soon routed them. The victorious French horsemen regrouped and charged the infantry. With its adversaries galloping toward it, the battalion tried to form square, but was unable to close the rear face before the dragoons charged through the gap. As the square broke up, many Spanish foot soldiers were hewn down or surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Hamilcar {{commanded}} the Carthaginian land forces in Sicily from 247 BC to 241 BC, {{during the latter}} stages of the First Punic War. He kept his army intact and led a successful guerrilla war against the Romans in Sicily. Hamilcar retired to Carthage after the peace treaty in 241 BC, following the defeat of Carthage. When the Mercenary War <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> in 240 BC, Hamilcar was recalled to command and was instrumental in concluding that conflict successfully. Hamilcar {{commanded the}} Carthaginian expedition to Spain in 237 BC, and for eight years expanded the territory of Carthage in Spain before dying in battle in 228 BC. He may {{have been responsible for}} creating the strategy which his son Hannibal implemented in the Second Punic War to bring the Roman Republic close to defeat.|$|E
25|$|On that {{election}} day, protests {{by students and}} citizens against the irregularities of the election <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> {{in the city of}} Masan. Initially these protests were quelled with force by local police, but when the body of a student was found floating in the harbor of Masan, the whole country was enraged and protests spread nationwide. On April 19, students from various universities and schools rallied and marched in protest in the Seoul streets, in what would be called the April Revolution. The government declared martial law, called in the army, and suppressed the crowds with open fire. Subsequent protests throughout the country shook the government, and after an escalated protest with university professors taking to the streets on April 25, Rhee submitted his official resignation on April 26 and fled into exile.|$|E

25|$|Liu Xiu {{carried out}} his action, {{and when he}} {{returned}} to Kunyang, he began harassing the sieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun, annoyed, led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. Once that happened, the Han forces inside Kunyang <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> of the city and attacked the other Xin units, and the much larger Xin forces suffered a total collapse. The soldiers largely deserted and went home, unable to be gathered again. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to Luoyang. This was a major blow to Xin, psychologically; after this point on, there would be no hope for it.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Arches {{finally took}} {{evidence}} on the case in May 1770, {{two years after the}} bishop who appointed Bowles, John Egerton, had left the see of Bangor. Richard Williams and John Thomas testified that Bowles had seldom conducted services at St Beuno's, and when he did it was only in English. Another witness, Henry Jones, testified that Bowles had conducted a service at St Beuno's no more than three times. Williams and Jones testified that soon afterwards Bowles tried to minister in Welsh, but his grasp of the language was so poor that none of the congregation could understand him. Several witnesses, including his own curate, declared that when Bowles tried to minister the sacraments at Holy Communion, his Welsh was so bad that many communicants either <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> laughing or had to stifle themselves to avoid doing so. Since then Bowles had but seldom attended St Beuno's, and had employed a Welsh-speaking perpetual curate, John Griffith, to officiate in his stead. Griffith testified that he never saw Bowles conduct a service at St Cwyfan's.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal and his Carthaginians had outgeneraled, outmaneuvered, outfought and obliterated three {{successive}} Roman armies {{since their}} arrival in Italy in 218 BC. The fear of defeat {{had caused the}} current Roman dictator to avoid fighting a pitched battle, {{and when he had}} managed to get the Carthaginians trapped at Ager Falernus, Hannibal had again made fools of the Romans and <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> with his army. All the while the Carthaginians had pillaged Italian property at will, despoiling the Romans while fattening their own pockets. Against this backdrop, the news of Minucius outmaneuvering Hannibal in this skirmish, and the retreat of the Carthaginian army was hailed in Rome as a great “victory”. This provided the political opponents of Fabius, embittered with his strategy, to spring a surprise on the dictator. The Roman army commanded by Fabius had apparently done little except follow Hannibal around and watch him ruin Roman economy, while the same army under a different general had caused Hannibal to retreat. So, the Roman senate sought a way to reward Minucius for his service to the state.|$|E
