50|$|All {{variations}} {{used the}} same 7.65 mm round-nosed cartridge. Many parts were interchangeable, {{with the exception of}} the bayonets of the 89 and 90/91; the barrel shroud made the <b>bayonet</b> <b>ring</b> too wide. The 89 Mauser rejected by Germany in 1884 entered service in 1940 with the second-line units of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium.|$|E
5000|$|... m/1894-14 {{carbines}} have a steel nose piece, not dissimilar to the No.1 Mk3 Lee-Enfield, with a protruding stud {{under the}} muzzle for the <b>bayonet</b> <b>ring.</b> There were two bayonets {{intended for the}} 94-14 carbine. The most prevalent was the m/1914 long bayonet. The second minor bayonet was the very long bladed m/1915 navy bayonet with the edge facing upwards.|$|E
5000|$|The M1917 bayonet was {{designed}} to be used with the US M1917 Enfield [...]30 caliber rifle, {{as well as with the}} seven different U.S. trench shotguns. The blade was 16 inches (40.6 cm) long. It will not fit the M1903 [...]30 caliber (Springfield) or the M1 [...]30 caliber (Garand) US service rifles as they have different <b>bayonet</b> <b>ring</b> (barrel) and attachment stud dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|The quasi-country {{the revolt}} began in, the Princedom of Malagor, {{has long been}} known for its {{independent}} spirit and its rifles; it had long chafed under the Church's studied oppression of it and its artisans. With the new rifles (on Pardal, smoothbore guns and piked made up most of an army. Rifles took far too long to load despite their greater accuracy and range, because balls had to be rammed down the barrel; with the [...] "angels"' introduction of the Minié ball, this issue became moot) the army is considerably superior to conventional Pardalian armies. Other advantages such as <b>bayonet</b> <b>rings,</b> modern meteorology or satellite cartography, or canister shot merely are the icing on the cake.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{connectors}} {{with different}} contact arrangements and <b>bayonet</b> coupling <b>rings</b> {{are also available}} to military specifications. [...] Supplemental military specifications (e.g., MS Drawings, Detail Specifications, and Performance Specifications) are available to assist users with the proper selection of connectors and related components.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>bayonet</b> {{reduced the}} {{effectiveness}} of the Highland charge, but it remained an example of shock tactics, with the key factor being psychological; rather than being an attempt to cut through a solid enemy line, the charge aimed at causing some enemy troops in the opposing line to break ranks before contact, thereby leaving openings which could be exploited to 'roll up' the rest. This happened at the Battle of Tippermuir and the Battle of Falkirk Muir.|$|R
50|$|All {{variations}} {{used the}} same 7.65mm round-nosed cartridge. Many parts were interchangeable, {{with the exception of}} the bayonets of the 89 and 90/91; the barrel shroud made the <b>bayonet</b> <b>ring</b> too wide. The 1889 Mauser rejected by Germany in 1884 entered service in 1940 with the second-line units of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium. A non-rotating Mauser claw extractor was introduced in the Model 92. Several variations of this model participated in rifle trials for the United States Army of that year; the Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen rifle was ultimately chosen.|$|E
5000|$|Six {{electrical}} contacts {{are added to}} the <b>bayonet</b> <b>ring.</b> One is slightly recessed and allows the lens to indicate whether the aperture ring is set at 'A' or not. If it is, a pin on the lens extends slightly and makes contact, while if the lens is at any other setting the pin is retracted and does not make contact. The other five contacts are used to encode the lens's aperture range. Each contact on the lens is either conducting or non-conducting, providing a binary 1 or 0, respectively. Two contacts encode the lens's minimum aperture—, , [...] or although no Pentax K-mount lens has ever had an [...] minimum aperture, OEM lenses often have. The other three contacts encode the lens's maximum aperture; their meaning is dependent on the minimum aperture indicated by the lens.|$|E
50|$|The M4 bayonet was {{introduced}} in 1944 for use with the M1 carbine. It {{was built on the}} M3 fighting knife. Like the M3 fighting knife it was designed for rapid production using a minimum of strategic metals and machine processes, it used a relatively narrow 6.75-inch bayonet-style spear-point blade with a sharpened 3.5-inch secondary edge. The blade was made of carbon steel, and was either blued or parkerized. Production of the grooved leather handle was later simplified by forming the grip of stacked leather washers that were shaped by turning on a lathe, then polished and lacquered. The steel crossguard had an <b>bayonet</b> muzzle <b>ring</b> and the <b>bayonet</b> fastener is on the pommel. Later models used a black molded plastic handle. The basic design would be used for the later M5, M6 and M7 bayonets.|$|R
5000|$|Screw-locking {{versions}} of this connector have also been used in instrumentation, process control and professional audio. In North America this variant is often called a [...] "small Tuchel" [...] connector {{after one of the}} major manufacturers. Tuchel is now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a <b>bayonet</b> locking <b>ring</b> was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines and lighting dimmers and controls through the from the 1960's to the 1980's, an example of this is the microphone input connector and some others on the [...] "Report" [...] family of UHER (brand) tape recorders. The bayonet locking version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bleecon", an example of its use is the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and control desks. A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable mounted socket was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard DIN plugs.|$|R
