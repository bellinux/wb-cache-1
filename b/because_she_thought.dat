5|$|The {{episode was}} shot through special lenses {{to make it}} more {{reminiscent}} of the decade. At Peter's funeral, actress Blair Brown wanted her character Nina Sharp to wear sunglasses, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Nina would not share her emotions at the funeral. Unlike Noble, Brown wore a wig. The scenes at Reiden Lake were actually shot on a parking lot, and the crew placed a covering over it to simulate the cracks normally on a lake.|$|E

Smetana conducted; the stage designs were by Josef Macourek and Josef Jiři Kolár {{produced}} the opera. The role of Mařenka was sung by the theatre's principal soprano, Eleonora von Ehrenberg – who had refused to appear in The Brandenburgers <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> her proffered role was beneath her. The parts of Krušina, Jeník and Kecal were all taken by leading members of the Brandenburgers cast. A celebrated actor, Jindřich Mošna, was engaged to play the Ringmaster, a role which involves little singing skill.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E

5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> he resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit—Romaine thought—of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E

25|$|During the {{serialization}} of Angel Sanctuary, she mistakenly {{titled the}} Gehenna story arc as the Yetzirah arc, and {{was unable to}} correct it as several chapters had already appeared under the title; she corrected it for the tankōban release. As the manga takes place in July 1999, Yuki expressed a goal to complete the series by then. For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor of a happy one, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that it would be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes. She wrote in her final afterword that Setsuna and Sara have reached emotional maturity after their adventures and will live happily together.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, however, of most Islamic scholar {{is that a}} niqab wearer (niqabi), {{in exchange}} for being permitted to wear the niqab and it not being made prohibited, is required only to refrain from criticizing other Muslim women who don't wear the niqab if the other Muslim women cover all their body except for their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it was obligatory, or {{because she had been}} taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes {{to err on the side}} of caution in an incorrect but good faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E

The prosecutor argued that McKinney's murder of Shepard was premeditated and driven by greed. McKinney's defense counsel countered that he had only intended to rob Shepard, but had killed him in a rage when Shepard made a sexual advance towards him. McKinney's girlfriend told police that he had been motivated by anti-gay sentiment, but later recanted her statement, saying that she had lied <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it would help him. Both McKinney and Henderson were convicted of the murder and each sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.|$|E
