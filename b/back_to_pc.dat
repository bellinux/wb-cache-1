50|$|RS-232 serial, 'Centronics' {{parallel}} {{and video}} interfaces were built onto the motherboard, whereas expansion cards were required for almost every function of an IBM PC {{except for the}} CPU, BIOS and built-in RAM. One significant reason behind IBM's separation of functions was reliability - faulty cards, particularly those {{at high risk of}} physical or electrical user damage (i.e. serial, parallel, and video) could be easily and individually replaced, at much lower cost than replacing or servicing the whole system board. In addition, this meant that existing, off-the-shelf hardware could be used, reducing costs and contributing to the fast-tracking of the project. Many years later, when manufacturers were producing reliable hardware, serial, parallel, then video and other interfaces migrated <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>PC</b> clone motherboards.|$|E

Dom escaped <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>PC</b> only {{to be hit by}} a car and found once again by her husband. Mac helped her stage her suicide and made plans to flee the country with her. While in hiding, Dom refused to make love with Mac due to flashbacks of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband. Caught once again, Dom was put into a sanitarium where Mac secretly visited her. Her therapist informed them Dom would need lots of therapy before she would be capable of a real relationship with Mac. While Dom worked on getting better, Mac helped Robert and Anna in their fight against the Cartel. Mac, Robert, Anna, and Bill finally defeated the Cartel and the members were sent to prison. Dominique was finally free to be with Mac after her husband, a member of the Cartel, was killed while escaping from prison. Mac taught her a man can be gentle and kind. They fell in love. Mac's relationship with Dominique became strained later, however, when Mac was informed his brother Robert was killed in a boat explosion after trying to save Anna. Mac had agreed {{to take care of his}} niece, Robin when Robert had left to find Anna. Now Mac was Robin's guardian. All his time with her didn't allow him to focus on Dominique very much. Mac broke up with Dominique when he realized he couldn't love her the way she wanted him to.|$|E

Young barn owl can well adapt its visual and auditory integration to the environmental change, such as prism wearing.

The model well explained the mechanism of the sensory map realignment through axongenesis and synaptogenesis. Simulation results of this model are consistent with the biological data.

Performance of the fabricated chip has shown the synaptogenesis and axogenesis can be emulated in VLSI circuit. The circuit of neural model provides a new method to update signals and reconfigure the switch network (the chip has an automatic reconfigurable network which is used to correct the disparity between signals).

However no test setup is developed so far for testing the memory blocks inside the FPGA. The SRAM blocks of FPGA are designed to work at much higher frequency than the FPGA core logic. Hence testing the SRAMs at higher speed is essential. The conventional memory test circuits cannot be used for this purpose.

40|$|The new Open University course T 184 Robotics and {{the meaning}} of life: a {{practical}} guide to things that think is an introductory course on robotics. It is an undergraduate course taught at a distance over 10 weeks. The course is centred around a web site containing most of the course material, supported by two books: Ruth Aylett Robots: Bringing intelligent machines to life? which is a general survey of the field and Isaac Asimov I, Robot which is used to motivate questions about the relationship between man and machine. On-line conferences provide study support. There is also a strong practical element to the course. This was originally designed around the use of the Lego Mindstorms robotics kit. Besides mechanical components, the kit includes the Lego RCX brick – a programmable microcontroller with memory and interfaces to input and output devices such as touch and light sensors, motors and an IR channel to communicate with a PC. Students can build and program an autonomous wheeled robot to carry out a range of tasks of increasing difficulty. A new programming environment was developed at the Open University specifically to support the needs of adult learners with no prior experience of programming. This provided an opportunity to extend the capabilities of the Mindstorms kit.

A popular approach is to use laser pointers tracked by a camera, but in-teraction techniques using laser pointers tend to be imprecise, error-prone, and slow. Therefore, we have developed a new interaction style, where the laser pointer (or other pointing technique such pointing with a finger or even eye tracking) indicates the region of interest, and then the item there is copied (“snarfed”) to the user’s handheld device, such as a Palm or PocketPC handheld. If the content changes on the PC, the handheld’s copy will be updated as well. Interactions can be performed on the handheld using familiar direct manipula-tion techniques, and then the modified version is sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>PC.</b> The con-tent often must be reformatted to fit {{the properties of the}} handheld to facilitate natural interaction. ...|$|R

Biological data of organisms (nucleotide and amino acid sequences) are stored in databases that contain billions of records. In order to process the vast amount of data in a reasonable time, high-performance analysis systems are developed. The main operation shared by the analysis tools is the search for matching patterns between sequences of data (sequence alignment). In this paper, we present 2 systems that can perform pairwise and multiple sequence alignment operations. Through the optimized design methods, proposed systems achieve up to 3. 6 times more performance compared to the previous designs. The proposed systems are modeled with VHDL; these models are simulated and then mapped on a Mezzanine card that contains an FPGA chip.

40|$|A {{problem with}} image sensors today, {{is that they}} contain defect pixels. By {{utilizing}} an image processing algorithm for defect pixel correction, image quality can be increased and costs per produced sensor can be reduced. This thesis had the goal of designing an embedded FPGA-based system for defect pixel correction. The FPGA in the designed system, is capable of receiving an image with defects, correcting it and sending the result <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a <b>PC.</b> A control function is partitioned in software and runs on a soft core CPU on the FPGA, while detection and correction of defect pixels are done in hardware. A detection algorithm which detects most point defects and some adjacent defects, while avoiding false positives, is designed. The implemented correction algorithm is an adjusted version on the alpha-trimmed mean filter. The algorithms {{are based on a}} single frame approach, using a 3 x 3 squared window of adjacent pixel values.
