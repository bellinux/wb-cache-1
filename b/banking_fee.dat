Moreover, we study the determinants of fee income share in individual banks and discuss the impact of market concentration on the magnitude of banking fees.

40|$|While {{maintaining}} {{financial interests}} {{in both the}} UK and Estonia, with one living in each, business partners Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Kaarmann realized they were seeing a 5 % (or higher) fee penalty when transferring money between countries. Using the median exchange rate provided by Rueters they created a partnership where the business partner in each country would leverage their accounts in that same country to make appropriate payments. In doing so, the partners were able to bypass the fees assessed by the back for exchanging currency. Similar to the partnership above, TransferWise was established by Taavet and Kristo to offset the <b>banking</b> <b>fee</b> structure and make transactions more transparent. Contrary to the existing model that reflects up front transaction fees as well as unfavorable exchange rates, the TransferWise model creates local pools of money in each supported country to both collect funds coming from that country and distribute funds go to that country. For example, when John wants to send money from the UK to Estonia, he submits the appropriate account information to pull the money from and the information {{where the money is}} going. TransferWise then matches that request with Bob who wants to send a similar amount from Estonia to the UK. The money from John in the UK enter the common money pool and then gets distributed to Bob’s friend in the UK. Only local transfers are required...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} both {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of bank fee and commission income in the European Union with a special emphasis on the Czech Republic. Since fee income represents the largest part of non-interest income earned by banks, it remains a major challenge for bank management to set and maintain an appropriate fee policy. However, solving for the optimal fee structure {{has not yet been}} accomplished either on a theoretical level, or in actual practice. In the empirical part of the paper, we analyse <b>banking</b> <b>fee</b> income in EU banking sectors based on three different indicators: the magnitude of net fee and commission income relative to total operating income, to total assets and to gross domestic product. Our results show that the Czech banking sector was not abnormally dependent on fee income compared to other EU countries in the period 2007 - 2012. As a result, we argue that the high profitability of Czech banks cannot be attributed to abnormal banking fees and commission income, but rather that other factors should be considered. We also concluded that the market concentration of the Czech banking sector declined since the Herfindahl index decreased in last years. The rise in competition was caused mainly by new entrants we refer to as ‘low-cost banks’ that offer a limited product portfolio and provide a large part of their services without fees and commissions. Consequently, we have determined that the business models of some low cost banks in the Czech Republic are not sustainable from a longer term perspective...|$|E

40|$|The Reserve Bank has {{conducted}} a survey on bank fees each year since 1997. The results of the latest survey show that banks ’ aggregate fee income was unchanged in 2010. Fee income from households declined as exception fee income and ATM revenue fell sharply, while fee income from businesses grew. Fees from Banking Activities The Reserve Bank’s annual bank fee survey provides information on the fees that commercial banks earn from their Australian operations. 1 It focuses on fee income earned by banks {{in the process of}} taking deposits, making loans and providing payment services. Other forms of non-interest income, such as income earned from funds management and insurance operations, are excluded from the survey. This article summarises the results of the latest survey, relating to banks ’ 2010 financial year. It covers 17 institutions, which together account for around 90 per cent of the total assets of the Australian banking sector. Total domestic fee income in 2010 was unchanged at $ 11. 1 billion from a year earlier, the first time that total fee income has not risen since the survey began in 1997 (Graph 1 and Table 1). This aggregate outcome reflects differing developments, including: a decline in fee income from households; an increase in fee income from businesses; slower growth in fee income from loans, reflecting the slower pace of expansion in banks’ lending to businesses and households; and a continued decline in deposit fee income despite strong growth in deposits. 1 The survey relates to fee income earned by participating banks over the course of their respective financial years. The data from the survey are published on the Reserve Bank’s website: Statistical Table F 6, ‘Domestic <b>Banking</b> <b>Fee</b> Income’. There {{have been a number of}} amendments to the historical data. The main changes stem from revisions to bank bill fee income, particularly acceptance fees, to align their treatment more closely with that in banks ’ statutory accounts, and reclassifications by one bank of some of its household loan and deposit fees...|$|E

The overall increase in fee income is marginally greater that the reduction in margin income. It is argued that banks have responded to falling margin revenue by increasing their range of fee-based services, especially insurance. Increases in fee income are found to pre-date declines in margin income, thus Australian banks were pro-active in the process of disintermediation...|$|R
