5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his <b>ban</b> <b>was</b> imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The <b>ban</b> <b>was</b> overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test <b>ban</b> <b>was</b> provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test <b>ban</b> <b>was</b> also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E

The case also inadvertently revealed that HTC was planning to launch a successor to the HTC One in early 2014.|$|E

5|$|Olsson was in turn {{expelled}} from the Centre Party following the referendum {{which led to the}} forming of the nationalist Sjöbo Party (Swedish: Sjöbopartiet) in March 1991. In the municipal elections the same year, the party received 31% of the votes. This led to Olsson once again becoming Municipal Commissioner, a position he held until 1998, when his party's support was reduced to 15% in municipal elections. Following the Sjöbo party's loss of support, the <b>ban</b> <b>was</b> overturned by Sjöbo's municipal assembly, and Sjöbo accepted its first refugees {{for more than a decade}} in 2001.|$|E

It is alleged that the <b>ban</b> <b>was</b> due to opposition from Muslim organisations or vote-bank politics. Rambhadracharya's participation in the yatra was kept secret. Rambhadracharya was put under house arrest at the home of R C Mishra, his disciple and friend.|$|E
