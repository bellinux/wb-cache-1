25|$|The Oilers {{struggled}} with their small-market status for several years, {{but after the}} wiped-out 2004–05 season, they were aided by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NHL owners and players. This included a league-wide salary cap that essentially forced all teams to conform to a budget, as the Oilers had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> years. A more reasonable conversion rate of Canadian dollar revenues to US dollar payroll {{in the new millennium}} also helped the Oilers to return to profitability. Because of this, Edmonton was able to acquire Chris Pronger (former winner of the Hart and Norris Trophies) and Michael Peca (two-time Frank J. Selke Trophy winner) before the 2005–06 season.|$|E
25|$|Riot grrrl is an {{underground}} feminist punk movement that {{originated in the}} early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It {{is often associated with}} third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> the past several years.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, {{the young}} and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He could not abide advice, least of all from the most {{experienced}} politician and diplomat in Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> decades, as well as build a navy that could match the British. The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was notoriously brutal {{and set the stage}} for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off World War I.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew a large {{mainstream}} audience into fandom; greater demand allowed (even obliged, {{for the sake}} of time management) Buffy actors to charge much higher appearance fees than the Star Trek actors had. This pushed appearances {{out of the reach of}} some volunteer non-profit fan groups towards commercial event promoters. At the same time, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay, which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave.|$|E

The Seattle Timess Pamela Sitt said it [...] "was high on spectacle and low on substance, veering crazily from burlesque to fairy tale to peep show". Doug Elfman of the Las Vegas Review-Journal stated that the tour [...] "is an unfocused bore of false sexuality, horrible songs, trite choreography, unfocused themes and less ambition than a house cat that sits around licking itself all day".

Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating {{that there were no}} financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script.

Knowing {{what we wanted to do}} with Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for Avengers the first time.

Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that [...] "I've been doing the same thing for 30 years {{and all of a sudden}} I'm having the best week of my life" [...] and that he [...] "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future".

500|$|A soundtrack disc was {{included}} in the limited [...] "Augmented Edition". An official album, Deus Ex: Human Revolution Original Soundtrack, was released on November 15, 2011. It was released through Sumthing Else Music Works as a physical and digital release. The album contained 25 tracks created from 50 out of the 200 pieces created for the game. The tracks included both cues from the game and arranged versions used in trailers. McCann chose the tracks to represent the game's story, drawing on the various styles of the music as a whole. He used the official album release to accentuate what he had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> the soundtrack as a whole. He initially wanted the soundtrack to be two discs, but realized that this would lead to repetition, so limited himself to a single disc. The remaining unreleased pieces were left out because of that potential repetition. The soundtrack received praise from multiple music critics: Original Sound Version's Gideon Dabi, commenting on the game's music prior to the album's commercial release, was highly positive about McCann's work, calling it [...] "a tremendous upgrade over its predecessors" [...] and praising its low-key impact. Simon Elchlepp, writing for Video Game Music Online, gave the album 4/5 stars: he called it [...] "a very satisfying experience", praising the score's connection to the game's themes and overall quality despite some perceived missteps about use of its main theme. RPGFan's Liz Maas said that, while it trended towards being generic, with the track [...] " [...] Barrett Boss Fight" [...] being most guilty of this, it managed to remain consistent with its themes and was worth buying.|$|E
