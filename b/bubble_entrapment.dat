Methodology <b>Bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> during irrigation of straight artificial root canals of size 35 or 50 was evaluated by real-time visualizations. The irrigant was delivered by a closed-ended or an open-ended needle positioned at 1 or 3 mm short of working length (WL) and at a flow rate of 0. 033 – 0. 260 mL s− 1. Results were analysed by nonparametric tests at 0. 05 significance. Selected cases were also simulated by a two-phase CFD model. Results A vapor lock was observed in 48 % of the cases investigated experimentally. Increasing the apical size, using an open-ended needle, positioning the needle closer to WL and delivering the irrigant at higher flow rate resulted in significantly smaller vapor lock. An increased contact angle resulted in the entrapment of a larger bubble when a low flow rate was used. Both brief insertion of the needle to WL whilst irrigating at a flow rate of 0. 083 mL s− 1 and delivering the irrigant at 0. 260 mL s− 1 without changing the needle position were capable of removing an established vapor lock.

Using numerical simulations and scaling analysis, we show that the splashing formation depends both on the inertial dynamics of the liquid and the cushioning of the gas. Two asymptotic regimes are identified, characterized by a new dimensionless number $J$: when the gas cushioning is weak, the jet is formed after a sequence of bubbles are entrapped and the jet speed is mostly selected by the Reynolds number of the impact. On the other hand, when the air cushioning is important, the lubrication of the gas beneath the drop and the liquid film controls the dynamics, leading to a single <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> and a weaker jet velocity...|$|E

The initial disc radius and thickness shows excellent agreement with available theoretical models, based on adiabatic compression.

30|$|Additionally, air <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> {{issues are}} also {{commonly}} observed in P 2 P NIL, particularly in large-area, single-step processes [21, 26] as air is easily {{trapped in the}} gaps between resist and mold cavities, resulting in defects on the imprinted structures. The risk of defects is increased when the mold contains depressions or when the resist is deposited as droplets rather than spin-coated, which allows air to be trapped easily [10], which results in the need to conduct the imprinting process under vacuum to prevent trapping of air bubbles as observed in [5, 8, 21].

40|$|Liquid drops play a {{dominant}} role in numerous industrial applications, such as spray coating, spray painting, inkjet printing, lithography processes, and spraying/sprinkling in agriculture or gardening. In {{all of these}} examples, the generation, flight, impact, and spreading of drops are separate stages of the corresponding industrial processes, which are all thoroughly studied for many years. This thesis focuses on drop dynamics, impact phenomena, Leidenfrost drops, and pouring flows. Based on extensive analysis and numerical results, various mechanisms by which drops can deform are resolved in detail, in both fundamental and industrial contexts. The title of the thesis, Dynamics of Deforming Drops, can be explained in two ways. Drops can be deformed and moving drops can deform another liquid surface. Large {{part of the study}} focuses on the small scale deformations of the liquid surface(s) {{at the bottom of the}} impacting drop/object, induced by the force exerted by the gas that is squeezed out between the falling object and the bottom surface. This can result in small air <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment,</b> which is generally undesired in applications. The results of interferometry experiments and Boundary Integral simulations show that there exists a maximal entrained bubble size for some impact velocity. The mechanism of small air <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> applies for impact of a liquid drop onto a solid surface, impact of a liquid drop onto a (deep) pool, and impact of a solid sphere onto a pool. Other covered subjects are the high-speed impact of a train of microdrops on a pool, instabilities at Leidenfrost drops, drop deformation induced by the impact of a picosecond laser-pulse, and pouring flows. The study of the response of drops impacted by a focused laser pulse is motivated by Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is used for the creation of nanometer-sized patterns on electronic chips in, for example, mobile phones. To print the features at high resolution, one needs high energy radiation. In EUV-machines this radiation results from liquid tin sheets that are impacted by a laser-pulse, resulting in the formation of plasma. The fluid dynamics play a crucial role for improving the efficiency of the EUV machine...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{systematic}} {{experimental study of}} the flow behaviour resulting from liquid-liquid impacts has been conducted. Numerous new flow behaviours have been identified including microbubble formation from floating drops, pre-entrapment jetting, multiple primary <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment,</b> downward jets penetrating the entrapped bubble, the break-up of the downward jets to leave drops entrapped inside the entrapped bubble and small vortex ring formation {{in the early stages}} of the post-entrapment jetting regime. These new flow phenomena have been combined with existing flow behaviour to produce the most comprehensive maps (both quantitative and qualitative) describing the splashing morphology of liquid-liquid impacts to date. It was found that six different flow regimes were required to adequately categorise all the flow behaviour. The physics of the cavity formation and collapse were investigated with high speed video and high framing rate particle image velocimetry. The formation and collapse of the cavity can be described as a six stage process. Initially, the cavity expands due to the inertia of the impact and the majority of the displaced fluid is driven into the wave swell. After the energy of the impact has been dissipated, the side walls of the cavity stagnate and the growth of the wave swell also stagnates. This causes the fluid contained in the wall swell to begin flowing downward under the influence of gravity. As the fluid flows down, the base of the cavity stops growing and begins to retract. These actions give rise to a vortex mid way down the cavity and acts to collapse the cavity. The fluid driven by the vortex then converges at the base of the cavity along the axis of symmetry. The formation of the vortex was shown to be centred around a stationary line that forms on the cavities interface. Several interesting properties of this stationary line were discovered. The depth at which the stationary line forms is almost constant for the same drop size and is independent of impact velocity. The dimensionless width of the cavity, Dw ' was shown to scale to Fr 1 3. The formation of the stationary line was also shown to influence how the flow converges at the base. The wider the cavity grows, the greater the rotation the fluid undergoes before converging along the axis of symmetry. Thus, for small width cavities the flow tends to converge while the fluid is being directed downward. While for larger width cavities, the flow tends to converge with a strong upward component. This has lead to the formulation of three different flow convergence criteria: downward convergence, parallel convergence and upward convergence. All jetting modes or lack of jetting can be described using one of the three convergence criteria. For cavities that are small and thus have a downward flow convergence condition, no jetting occurs. This type of flow convergence occurs in the primary vortex ring regime and may assist in the development of strong coherent vortex rings. A parallel flow convergence condition is responsible for forming high-speed jets in both the preentrapment jetting and primary <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> regimes. Here, the flow is similar to two parallel jets impinging on each other. This action forms a stagnation point and a significant rise in the local pressure around this zone follows. This leads to a strong inertial force that drives a small jet of fluid back up into the cavity. Cavity retraction acceleration was measured as high as 90 000 g during this time. The maximum exit velocity of the secondary drops formed from the break up of the thin high-speed jets was measured to be in excess of 30 m/s. In the primary <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> regime it was postulated that multiple stagnation points would form and interact with each other to produce variable jet velocities across the regime. The retraction velocity of the cavity was also shown to have a direct correlation with the exit velocity of the first drop. An upward flow convergence condition was found to be responsible for the thick slow moving jets observed in the post-entrapment jetting regime. All modes of <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> were investigated and the quantity of air each mode can entrap has been estimated. It was found that the most efficient method to produce microbubbles was by forming jets in the post-entrapment jetting regime that pinch off secondary drops with Weber numbers ranging from 6 to 20. This produces drops that fall into the primary microbubble entrapment regime to produce thin films that rupture into thousands of microbubbles. Methods for determining the volume of entrapped air from the break up based on the rupture velocity of the film are presented. The entrapped air in the bulk fluid is equivalent on average to 0. 3...|$|E

Materials containing gas bubbles are considered as a special type of engineering materials and are usually considered as “quasi-saturated” (Faybishenko 1995). In these materials, gas phase could be present as isolated bubbles once the water saturation degree is larger than 85  % (Sparks 1963).

The hot steam condenses on cold water surface what is also called direct contact condensation. Direct contact condensation and condensation induced water-hammer in a horizontal pipe were experimentally investigated at PMK- 2 test facility of the Hungarian Atomic Energy Research Institute KFKI. The cold water is injected through small pipe into lower horizontal part of the section, and then water fills the vertical pipeline and floods the horizontal test section of the pipeline of the PMK- 2 integral test facility. As liquid water floods the horizontal part of the pipeline, the counter current horizontally stratified flow is being observed.

It has been found that at the early stage of the droplet spreading there is no contact line movement, but only direct contact of the droplet outline with the substrate, which results in the formation of an air disc under the impact point. The maximum air disc is reached, when the drop spreading is driven by the movement of the fully wetted contact line. Numerical results showed much more <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> at the interface between liquid and solid for Newtonian droplets.

Measurement of the selenium dopant distribution, using quantitative infrared transmission imaging, indicates that the first sample initially achieved diffusion controlled growth as desired. However, after about 1 cm of growth, the segregation behavior was driven from a diffusion controlled growth regime to a complete mixing regime.

Many turbulent weather conditions can be explained {{on the basis of}} entrainment. Different artificial purposes also utilize the phenomenon of entrainment. One of the examples is an educator pump. These pumps are used in ships to extract water in case of water leakage into the ship. The pump is used to remove the air and the water inside the ship is entrained out by the suction of the pump. Entrainment is used for air <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> in concrete. This helps to strengthen the concrete. Entrainment is also observed in the making of emulsion of one fluid in another, such as margarine. As for artificial processes with stratified liquid layers, the best examples metal extraction industries and nuclear reactors. In both cases gases are formed within liquid layers and cause entrainment. This is unwanted as entrainment causes mixing between two liquids. However in case of desalination plants and other places where mixing is desired, entrainment is enhanced purposely. The mixing of two fluids is generally done by bubbling gas through a tank containing the two fluids. These type of systems are called gas bubble stirred tanks...|$|E

Each pore is contaminated by filling it with an electrochemically inactive blocking organic material (thickened methyl salicylate) before the substrate is placed in a solution containing an electroactive species (Fe(CN) 6 (3 -)). An electrode is fabricated {{at the base of}} each pore and the Faradaic current is used to monitor the decontamination as a function of time. For the largest pore, decontamination driven by ultrasound (generated by a horn type transducer) and bulk fluid flow are compared.

40|$|We report {{observations}} of air <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> when a solid sphere impacts a quiescent liquid surface. Using high-speed imaging, {{we show that}} {{a small amount of}} air is entrapped at the bottom tip of the impacting sphere. This phenomenon is examined across a broad range of impact Reynolds numbers, 0. 2 a Re = (DU 0 /Il) a 1. 2 ' 105. Initially, a thin air pocket is formed due to the lubrication pressure in the air layer between the sphere and the liquid surface. As the liquid surface deforms, the liquid contacts the sphere at a finite radius, producing a thin sheet of air which usually contracts to a nearly hemispherical bubble at the bottom tip of the sphere depending on the impact parameters and liquid properties. When a bubble is formed, the final bubble size increases slightly with the sphere diameter, decreases with impact speed but appears independent of liquid viscosity. In contrast, for the largest viscosities tested herein, the entrapped air remains {{in the form of a}} sheet, which subsequently deforms upon close approach to the base of the tank. The initial contact diameter is found to conform to scalings based on the gas Reynolds number whilst the initial thickness of the air pocket or adimplea scales with a Stokes' number incorporating the influence of the air viscosity, sphere diameter and impact speed and liquid density. © 2011 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence seeded with finite sized particles or bubbles is investigated {{in a series}} of numerical simulations, using the force-coupling method for the particle phase and low wavenumber forcing of the flow to sustain the turbulence. Results are given on the modulation of the turbulence due to massless bubbles, neutrally buoyant particles and inertial particles of specific density 1. 4 at volumetric concentrations of 6 %. Buoyancy forces due to gravity are excluded to emphasize finite size and inertial effects for the bubbles or particles and their interactions with the turbulence. Besides observing the classical entrapment of bubbles and the expulsion of inertial particles by vortex structures, we analyze the Lagrangian statistics for the velocity and acceleration of the dispersed phase. The turbulent fluctuations are damped at mid-range wavenumbers by the bubbles or particles while the smallscale kinetic energy is significantly enhanced. Unexpectedly, the modulation of turbulence depends only slightly on the dispersion characteristics (<b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> in vortices or inertial sweeping of the solid particles) but is closely related to the stresslet component (finite size effect) of the flow disturbances. The pivoting wavenumber characterizing the transition from damped to enhanced energy content is shown to vary with the size of the bubbles or particles. The spectrum for the energy transfer by the particle phase is examined and the possibility of representing this, at large scales, through an additional effective viscosity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the inception of}} cavitation and resulting structures when a sphere collides with a solid surface covered {{with a layer of}} non-Newtonian liquid having a kinematic viscosity of up to (Formula presented.) cSt. We show the existence of shear-stress-induced cavitation during sphere approach towards the base wall (i. e. the pressurization stage) in ultra-viscous films using a synchronized dual-view high-speed imaging system. For the experimental parameters employed, liquids having viscoelastic properties of (Formula presented.) are shown to enable sphere rebound without any prior contact with the solid wall. Cavitation by depressurization (i. e. during rebound) in such non-contact cases is observed to onset after a noticeable delay from when the minimum gap distance is reached. Also, the cavities created originate from remnant bubbles, being the remains of the primary <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> formed by the lubrication pressure of the air during film entry. Cases where physical contact occurs (contact cases) in 10 000 cSt (Formula presented.) cSt films produce cavities attached to the base wall, which extend into an hourglass shape. In contrast, strikingly different structures occur in the most viscous liquids due to the disproportionality in radial expansion and longitudinal extension along the cavity length. Horizontal shear rates calculated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements show the apparent fluid viscosity to vary substantially as the sphere approaches and rebounds away from the base wall. A theoretical model based on the lubrication assumption is solved for the squeeze flow in the regime identified for shear-induced cavity events, to {{investigate the}} criterion for cavity inception in further detail. © 2016 Cambridge University Pres...|$|E
40|$|During the {{continuous}} casting of steel, transient flow events {{can be very}} important to the generation of quality problems, such as shear entrainment, surface level fluctuations and bubble entrainment. These phenomena can be better predicted using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models than the K-ε models, which have been extensively studied. In this work the turbulent transient flow in a water model of a continuous caster has been both simulated using LES models and measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The results of PIV and LES have been compared to validate the LES model and also to enhance the understanding of the prominent transient features of the flow field. The flow near the top surface in PIV was found to contain periods of 5 - 10 s when the velocities were three to four times their mean values, which is of importance to the shear entrainment of the liquid flux. In both simulation and PIV the upper roll structure is found to change chaotically from a single large recirculation structure to a set of distinct vortices. The inlet swirl in PIV is seen to persist more than halfway across the mold, causing a characteristic staircase velocity vector pattern when viewed in a plane parallel to the wide faces. The lower rolls in PIV are significantly asymmetric for very long periods of time (~ 1 -hour) and go through a repeating sequence of features. One of these features involving a short circuit between the upward and downward flow in the lower roll is also seen in the simulation and is of significance to <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the splash}} of a liquid drop on a deep pool of water, bubble en-trapment occurs over a {{limited range of}} Froude number. Using high speed video {{photography}} at framing rates between 10000 - 100000 fps, the <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> regime was studied for water drops impacting on a deep pool of water. It is known that a high speed jet accompanies the entrapment of a bubble. In this study {{it was found that}} preceding the appearance of the high speed jet, a series of high speed droplets, having diameters up to a mag-nitude smaller than droplet previously observed, appears. The speed of these droplets were 50 % higher than those formed from the high speed jets. We believe that these smaller high speed droplets were the result of a focusing of the ejecta sheet into a thin high speed jet. This thin high speed jet breaks up rapidly on formation and cannot be observed above the bath free surface. In conjunction with the upward high speed jet, an entrapped bubble was found to be expelled downwards from the cavity with a high speed downward jet of liquid penetrating into the bubble. If the high speed downward jet penetrated far enough into the bubble, such that its length exceeded Rayleighs wave-length for instability, it broke up to form a single drop within the bubble. The entrapped drop would then bounce around in-side the bubble before the drop coalesced with the bulk liquid through a coalescence cascade with a geometric similarity given by We = 8...|$|E
40|$|Aim(i) To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} needle type and insertion depth, root canal size and irrigant flow rate on the entrapment of air bubbles in the apical part of a root canal (apical vapor lock) during syringe irrigation using experiments and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, (ii) to investigate whether the irrigant contact angle affects <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment,</b> (iii) to examine if an established vapor lock can be removed by syringe irrigation. MethodologyBubble entrapment during irrigation of straight artificial root canals of size 35 or 50 was evaluated by real-time visualizations. The irrigant was delivered by a closed-ended or an open-ended needle positioned at 1 or 3 mm short of working length (WL) and at a flow rate of 0. 033 - 0. 260 mLs(- 1). Results were analysed by nonparametric tests at 0. 05 significance. Selected cases were also simulated by a two-phase CFD model. ResultsA vapor lock was observed in 48 % of the cases investigated experimentally. Increasing the apical size, using an open-ended needle, positioning the needle closer to WL and delivering the irrigant at higher flow rate resulted in significantly smaller vapor lock. An increased contact angle resulted in the entrapment of a larger bubble when a low flow rate was used. Both brief insertion of the needle to WL whilst irrigating at a flow rate of 0. 083 mLs(- 1) and delivering the irrigant at 0. 260 mLs(- 1) without changing the needle position were capable of removing an established vapor lock. ConclusionsApical vapor lock may occur under certain conditions, but appears to be easily prevented or removed by syringe irrigation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} bubble dispersion in turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. The aim of {{this study}} is to describe the main mechanisms yielding preferential bubble accumulation in near-wall structures of the flow. We first proceed to direct numerical simulation of Taylor-Couette flows for three different geometrical configurations (three radius ratios η = R 1 /R 2 : η = 0. 5, η = 0. 72, and η = 0. 91 with the outer cylinder at rest) and Reynolds numbers corresponding to turbulent regime ranging from 3000 to 8000. The statistics of the flow are discussed using two different averaging procedures that permit to characterize the mean azimuthal velocity, the Taylor vortices contribution and the small-scale turbulent fluctuations. The simulations are compared and validated with experimental and numerical data from literature. The second part of this study is devoted to bubble dispersion. Bubble accumulation is analyzed by comparing the dispersion obtained with the full turbulent flow field to bubble dispersion occurring at lower Reynolds numbers in previous works. Several patterns of preferential accumulation of bubbles have been observed depending on bubble size and the effect of gravity. For the smaller size considered, bubbles disperse homogeneously throughout the gap, while for the larger size they accumulate along the inner wall for the large gap width (η = 0. 5). Varying the intensity of buoyancy yields complex evolution of the bubble spatial distribution. For low gravity effect, <b>bubble</b> <b>entrapment</b> is strong leading to accumulation along the inner wall in outflow regions (streaks of low wall shear stress). When buoyancy effect dominates on vortex trapping, bubbles rise through the vortices, while spiral patterns stretched along the inner cylinder are clearly identified. Force balance is analyzed to identify dominating forces leading to this accumulation and accumulation patterns are compared with previous experiments...|$|E
