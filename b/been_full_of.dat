25|$|Through {{the middle}} gate is the Second Courtyard (II. Avlu), or Divan Square (Divan Meydanı). The {{courtyard}} was probably completed around 1465, {{during the reign}} of Mehmed II. It received its final appearance around 1525-1529 {{during the reign of}} Suleyman I. It is surrounded by the former palace hospital, bakery, Janissary quarters, stables, the imperial harem and Divan to the north and the kitchens to the south. At the end of the courtyard, the Gate of Felicity marks the entrance to the Third Courtyard. Numerous artifacts from the Roman and Byzantine periods that have been found on the palace site during recent excavations, including sarcophagi, are on display in the Second Courtyard in front of the imperial kitchens. Located underneath the Second Courtyard is a cistern that dates to Byzantine times. During Ottoman times this courtyard would have <b>been</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> peacocks and gazelles. It was used as a gathering place for courtiers. The Sultan, seated on the gold-plated Bayram throne, used to hold audiences in the second courtyard. Some foreign dignitaries, including The French ambassador Philippe du Fresne-Canaye, have written accounts about these audiences.|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare is also {{careful to}} make the {{distinction}} that Prospero presents himself as a rational, and not an occultist, magician. He does this by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax. Sycorax {{is said to have}} worshipped the devil and <b>been</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> [...] "earthy and abhored commands". She was unable to control Ariel, who was [...] "too delicate" [...] for such dark tasks. Prospero's rational goodness enables him to control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him in a tree. Sycorax's magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible, where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Prospero seeks to set things right in his world through his magic, and once that is done, he renounces it, setting Ariel free.|$|E

The negative reaction by many in the Australia press mirrors Lana's current storyline on Neighbours, which explores the backlash Lana experiences when her sexuality becomes public knowledge at her high school." [...] Norton's colleague, Malinda Lo, later said that many of the website's readers said Lana's storyline had a [...] "profound effect" [...] on them when they were teenagers.

500|$|Two {{major public}} {{buildings}} are readily visible at {{the centre of}} the city– the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city.

The building is [...] long by [...] wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held.

[...] Foreign journalist Harry Hamm was told by Albanian functionaries that [...] "Belishova and Tashko had never made any secret of their pro-Soviet leanings, and that they had maintained their attitude long after the decision had been made to move closer to Peking's general line.

500|$|A {{cross-border}} Selous Scouts raid into Mozambique on 9 August 1976 (dubbed [...] "the Nyadzonya Raid") killed over 1,000 {{people without}} Rhodesian fatalities, with Van der Byl {{insisting that the}} government had irrefutable proof that the raid had targeted a guerrilla training camp. He was unwilling to disclose the nature of the proof, though he invited the UN to conduct its own investigation into the raid. The raid produced a high body count and a major haul of intelligence and captured arms; according to ZANLA's own figures, which were not publicly circulated, most of those present in the camp had been armed guerrillas, though there were some civilians present. In a successful attempt to win global sympathy, ZANU clamoured that Nyadzonya had <b>been</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> unarmed refugees, leading most international opinion to condemn the Rhodesian raid as a massacre. Although cross-border raids into Mozambique had been approved by the Rhodesian cabinet, the depth and severity of the August incursion was greater than had been intended. Van der Byl had sanctioned the incursion largely on his own initiative. Although a tactical success, the incursion caused a final break with Zambia and Mozambique. The South African government was greatly displeased that its earlier diplomatic efforts were compromised and made this clear to Ian Smith. Smith appeared to consider this [...] "the final straw" [...] as far as Van der Byl's defence portfolio was concerned.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has <b>been</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E
