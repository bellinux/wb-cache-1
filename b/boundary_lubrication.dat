50|$|Oilite Plus is {{the same}} bronze alloy as an Oilite, {{impregnated}} with turbine oil and fine particles of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). This reduces the friction by approximately 17% versus standard Oilite material. This material is usually used in applications that exhibit mixed-film or <b>boundary</b> condition <b>lubrication.</b> Situations where this type of lubrication is encountered commonly include oscillating motions, slow speeds, intermittent use, pulsating loads, and uneven loads.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> (also called {{boundary}} film lubrication): The hydrodynamic {{effects are}} negligible. The bodies come into closer contact at their asperities; the heat {{developed by the}} local pressures causes a condition which is called stick-slip, and some asperities break off. At the elevated temperature and pressure conditions, chemically reactive constituents of the lubricant react with the contact surface, forming a highly resistant tenacious layer or film on the moving solid surfaces (boundary film) which is capable of supporting the load and major wear or breakdown is avoided. <b>Boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> is also defined as that regime in which the load is carried by the surface asperities {{rather than by the}} lubricant.|$|E
50|$|Space {{tribology}} is {{a subset}} of the lubrication field dealing with the reliable performance of satellites and spacecraft (including the space station). It encompasses the entire gamut of tribological regimes, including elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), parched EHL, transient EHL, <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication,</b> and mixed lubrication.|$|E
50|$|Elastohydrodynamic lubrication: Mostly for nonconforming {{surfaces}} {{or higher}} load conditions, the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact. Such strain creates a load-bearing area, which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through. Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication, {{the motion of}} the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure, which acts as the bearing force over the contact area. In such high pressure regimes, the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably. At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces. Contact between raised solid features, or asperities, can occur, leading to a mixed-lubrication or <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> regime. In addition to Reynolds equation, elastohydrodynamic theory considers the elastic deflection equation, since in this regime elastic deformation of the surfaces contributes significantly to the lubricant film thickness.|$|E

The dynamics of adsorption, adsorbed mass, and viscoelasticity of the adsorbed layer are quantified by using a quartz crystal microbalance, while <b>boundary</b> layer <b>lubrication</b> behaviors are studied by using lateral force microscopy. Driven by hydrophobic interactions, the silicone surfactant adsorbs following a Langmuir isotherm and forms strongly adsorbed layers on the polymer surfaces with an areal mass directly related to the hydrophobicity of the substrate.

The simulation was applied to the four load stages that constitute an FZG gear micropitting test and actual gear meshing was simulated. It was additionally possible to ascertain the adequacy of the model to shorter load durations because the load stages of the original micropitting test had been periodically interrupted for intermediate monitoring...|$|R
50|$|The {{high oil}} {{consumption}} problem {{associated with the}} Knight double sleeve valve was fixed with the Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve, as perfected by Bristol. The models that had the complex 'junk head' installed a non-return purging valve on it; as liquids cannot be compressed, the presence {{of oil in the}} head space would result in problems. Mike Hewland, after adding an expander ring that worked in reserve, found the oil consumption of his single sleeve valve engines was half that of a similar poppet valve engine. 'In this engine all we really have to lubricate is the crankshaft, the rest seems to lubricate itself' (C&D, Jul 1974). At top dead centre (TDC), the single-sleeve valve rotates in relation to the piston. This prevents <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> problems, as piston ring ridge wear at TDC and bottom dead centre (BDC) does not occur. The Bristol Hercules time between overhauls (TBO) life was rated at 3,000 hours, very good for an aircraft engine, but not so for automotive engines. Sleeve wear was located primarily in the upper part, inside the 'junk head'.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the crankshaft bearing half shells and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication,</b> metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional bearing shells with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|E

[...] The oil film will be swept away leaving nothing but bare metal and the risk of seizure. Carefully scraping the surface will leave the original high quality surface intact, but provide many shallow depressions where the oil film can maintain its depth and surface tension. When scraping is used for this purpose it is more accurately called [...] "frosting", [...] "spotting" [...] or [...] "flaking" [...] as opposed to fully scraping an accurate surface.

40|$|International audienceHybrid {{bearings}}—that is, bearings with ceramic {{rolling elements}} and steel rings—are {{often used in}} applications with reduced (i. e., <b>boundary</b> or mixed) <b>lubrication</b> conditions. The mechanisms by which hybrid bearings perform significantly better than full-steel ones in these cases are so far unclear, although a number of published works have shown experimental results in which appreciable performance benefits were obtained {{by the use of}} hybrid bearings under <b>boundary</b> or mixed <b>lubrication.</b> In this article, the reduced lubrication performance of hybrid rolling contacts, versus full-steel ones, is studied in detail by means of rolling bearing fatigue experiments and a theoretical micropitting model. It is found that the large improvement in surface fatigue resistance of hybrid contacts cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} the unavoidable differences in some of the roughness parameters existing between the full-steel and hybrid contacts. It is also necessary to take into account a considerable reduction in the effective boundary friction coefficient of the hybrid contact. In the numerical micropitting simulations it was found that the boundary friction coefficient of a hybrid contact must be about two times lower than that for the corresponding full-steel contact, in order to be able to predict the experimental observations reasonably well. A similar ratio of the boundary friction coefficients was obtained in a number of dedicated tests, thus confirming the results of the micropitting model. The mechanisms of the strong micropitting resistance of hybrid bearings under reduced lubrication conditions are discussed in detail, shedding new light on the operational tribology and performance capabilities of bearings with rolling elements made of silicon nitride ceramics...|$|R

Force curves revealed a strong fluid dynamic influence at room temperature, which was greatly reduced at elevated temperatures due to the reduced liquid viscosity. A fluid dynamic analysis reveals that bulk viscosity is manifested at large separation but that EAN displays a nonzero slip, indicating a region of different viscosity near the surface. At high temperatures, the reduction in fluid dynamic force reveals step-like force curves, similar to those found at room temperature using much lower scan rates. The ionic liquid boundary layer remains adsorbed to the solid surface even at high temperature, which provides a mechanism for lubrication when fluid dynamic lubrication is strongly reduced. The friction data reveals a decrease in absolute friction force with increasing temperature, which is associated with increased thermal motion and reduced viscosity of the near surface layers but, consistent with the normal force data, <b>boundary</b> layer <b>lubrication</b> was unaffected.

40|$|Part {{of asphalt}} {{pavement}} production is the compaction process of loose mix. The quality of compaction process has {{a profound impact}} {{on the quality of the}} final product. With the advent of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) additive use, the compaction process became more efficient. In 2010 estimated 4 million tons of WMA asphalt were produced using the WMA additive technology (Hansen and Newcomb 2011). The additives allowed for improved compaction (requiring less compactive effort) and compaction at lower-than-typical temperatures. This thesis is focused on quantifying the improved mixture compaction through novel binder testing. The science of tribology has been used to understand and quantify the way certain WMA additives improve compaction process. It has been found that chemical WMA additives are capable of creating <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> films protecting aggregate particles from direct solid-solid contact, hence reducing friction between the particles. The new Asphalt <b>Boundary</b> <b>Lubrication</b> test was developed to quantify the <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> of binders in terms of boundary coefficient of friction.

40|$|<b>Boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{is known}} to be {{significantly}} important in the design of machine parts. The decrease in the efficiency of the system as well as its durability when operating in <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> conditions highlights the importance of this regime. <b>Boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> involves many different physical, chemical and mechanical phenomena which make it difficult to understand the real mechanisms of friction, wear and lubrication. Tribochemistry is undoubtedly {{one of the most important}} processes occurring in <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Modelling such a complicated process needs a robust physical and chemical modelling framework that is capable of capturing different phenomena. The majority of the modelling attempts in <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> covers the contact mechanics of rough surfaces with different numerical approaches. Despite the importance of the tribochemistry and its effect in reducing friction and wear of boundary lubricated contacts, there is no comprehensive modelling framework that considers tribochemistry into the <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> models. In this work, tribochemistry was implemented into the deterministic contact mechanics simulation for elastic-perfectly plastic contact of rough surfaces. A tribochemical model for the growth of the ZDDP antiwear additive was developed based on the thermodynamics of interfaces that combines formation and removal of the tribofilm. The tribochemical model was then coupled with the contact mechanics model which was developed based on potential energy principles. A modification to Archard’s wear equation was proposed which accounts for the role of ZDDP tribofilm in reducing the wear. This model was proposed based on the experimental observations of ZDDP in reducing wear. The numerical framework was then validated against experiments. The wear prediction capability of the model was validated against experiments from Mini-Traction Machine in a rolling/sliding contact. The model is able to predict changes in the topography of the surfaces and this was validated with experiments on a Micro Pitting Rig (MPR). The model shows a good potential in capturing the behaviours in <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> and opens new ways for further developments and testing the effect of different parameters in tribochemistry and wear. It can give insights in better understanding the real mechanisms of tribochemistry and also help in optimizing boundary lubricated contacts. ...|$|E
40|$|Healthy {{articular}} cartilage provides low friction properties to the synovial joint through both fluid film and <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication.</b> <b>Boundary</b> <b>lubrication,</b> mediated by synovial fluid (SF), {{is important in}} reducing articulation-induced shear and wear.

However, clear relationships between the composition [...] <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> function of SF in health and injury, particularly at physiological test surfaces, remains to be established. Therefore, the goal of this dissertation was to further the understanding of the contributions of SF macromolecules, with a focus on HA, to the <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> of articular cartilage under normal and pathophysiologic conditions, and to what extent chemical augmentation of injured SF by HA can restore lubrication function of SF and articular cartilage. SF lubrication function and composition were altered coordinately after acute joint injury. Steady-state friction coefficients were higher, while HA concentration and molecular weight (MW) were shifted to lower levels in injury SF. Supplementation in vitro of the abnormal SF with HA of physiologic MW and concentration led to a marked recovery of <b>boundary</b> <b>lubrication</b> function. Articular cartilage lubrication by HA was markedly dependent on concentration and MW, approaching the low friction coefficients of native SF particularly at the MW and concentration of HA found in normal SF. The depletion of HA from SF led to a marked increase in friction coefficients for both normal and injury SF. Additionally, lubrication function of the HA-depleted SF was recoverable to normal levels upon repletion with high MW HA. Collectively, these results elucidate the role of HA as a boundary lubricant for articular cartilage, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} altered low-friction properties of cartilage following joint injury, and may also aid in the development of targeted clinical treatments and repair strategies designed to restore failed joint lubrication and prevent further cartilage damag...|$|E

Although the mathematical model predicts a "speed effect" for rolling (plots of rolling load against speed looking like a Sommerfeld diagram for a journal bearing), the speeds involved are much faster than present commercial rates. Thus speed effects in the literature must have been caused by a change over from <b>boundary</b> to mixed <b>lubrication</b> and lubricant puddle entrapment in surface microcrevices.
