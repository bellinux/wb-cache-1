40|$|Abstract. Censorship of {{information}} on the Internet has been an increasing problem as the methods have become more sophisticated and increasing resources have been allocated to censor more content. A number of approaches to counteract Internet censorship have been implemented, from censorshipresistant publishing systems to anonymizing proxies. A prerequisite for these systems to function against real attackers is that they also offer <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance.</b> Dust is proposed as a blocking-resistant Internet protocol designed to be used alone or in conjunction with existing systems to resist a number of attacks currently in active use to censor Internet communication. Unlike previous work in censorship resistance, it does not seek to provide anonymity in terms of unlinkability of sender and receiver. Instead it provides <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance</b> against the most common packet filtering techniques currently in use to impose Internet censorship...|$|E

Automation provides a means for obtaining the irrigation efficiency need for high production without prohibitive labor requirements being involved. An integral part of an automatic irrigation system is a soil moisture sensing device. The gypsum electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> might be used as such a sensor. Before electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> {{can be used in}} this capacity, more must be understood about the factors which influence them and their operational behavior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the feasibility of using electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> as soil moisture sensors in automated irrigation systems. The specific factors studied were the nitrogen concentration of the soil solution and soil type. <b>Resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> were placed in air dry soil and different concentrations of nitrogen solution were added. Levels studied were 0, 70, 140, and 210 parts of nitrogen per million parts of distilled water. Soils used were Grundy silt loam and O’Neill loamy sand. Moisture content changes in the soil were produced by placing the soil and <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> on a ceramic plate in a pressure extractor and varying the pressures. Pressures studied were 1 / 3, 1, and 2 bars. Conclusions drawn from the results of this study were: 1) use of present day gypsum electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> as soil moisture sensors in automated systems is not feasible; 2) nitrogen concentration levels of the soil solution up to 210 ppm did not significantly influence, at the 5 % level of significance, gypsum electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> placed in Grundy silt loam and O’Neill loamy sand soils and subjected to pressure differentials of 1 / 3, 1, and 2 bars; 3) uniformity of electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> must be more strictly controlled by using proper manufacturing procedures; 4) nitrogen concentration of the soil solution affected <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> placed in O’Neill loamy sand soil more than blocks placed in Grundy silt loam soil. For blocks in O’Neill loamy sand soil, an increase in nitrogen concentration of the soil solution decreased resistance readings of the blocks. For blocks in Grundy silt loam soil, an increase in nitrogen concentration of the soil solution decreased resistance readings of the blocks except for the 70 ppm nitrogen level which increased resistance readings of the blocks.

Transfer of sensitivity of WISH cells to mouse interferon, possibly through transfer of a membrane receptor, seems unlikely since resistance was transferred in the absence of mouse interferon. From kinetic data and the fact that actinomycin D <b>blocked</b> <b>resistance</b> in human cells for 3 h longer than in mouse cells, it seems unlikely that the mouse antiviral protein itself or its mRNA alone is a likely candidate for the transfer of resistance.

40|$|Antiestrogen {{resistance}} {{is a major}} clinical problem {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer. Altered growth factor signaling with estrogen receptor (ER) -? is associated with the development of resistance. Gene expression profiling was used to identify mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 3 (MKP 3) whose expression was correlated with response to the antiestrogen tamoxifen in both patients and in vitro–derived cell line models. Overexpression of MKP 3 rendered ER-?-positive breast cancer cells resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of tamoxifen and enhanced tamoxifen agonist activity in endometrial cells. MKP 3 overexpression was associated with lower levels of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation in the presence of estrogen but that estrogen deprivation and tamoxifen treatment decreased MKP 3 phosphatase activity, leading to an up-regulation of pERK 1 / 2 MAPK, phosphorylated Ser 118 -ER-?, and cyclin D 1. The MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 blocked tamoxifen-resistant growth. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species was observed with tamoxifen treatment of MKP 3 -overexpressing cells, and antioxidant treatment increased MKP 3 phosphatase activity, thereby <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance.</b> Furthermore, PD 98059 increased the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) in tamoxifen-treated MKP 3 -overexpressing cells, suggesting an interaction between MKP 3 levels, activation of ERK 1 / 2 MAPK, and JNK signaling in human breast cancer cells.

It is also colourful, difficult, interesting, and messy. We have named the paper "An Essay on". An essay means treating a topic freely from different angles, although not forgetting the sources you used. The implication of this is that we are not able or willing to make an encompassing study of the literature on project management 3. We thus know that many angles will not be covered. Furthermore we do not intend a make a negative delineation, indicating what we are not dealing with. We prefer to make a positive delineation, emphasising {{what we are going to}} take up in our essay. Positively phrased we are inspired by 3 sources that will make the foundation for our different angles: 1. Decision making theory (Enderud, 1976) 4. One of the authors has previously with success applied decision-making theory as an approach for analysing organisation change processes 5. Both authors have followed the same line in analysing organisational changes in the Danish public sector 6. That success has inspired us to re-use the distinction between rational, political and anarchic processes in this essay 7. Enderud (1976 : 21 - 22) excludes explicitly the role of the actors’ participation in his presentation of decision models. We find, however this aspect so important that we have decided to include it 2. Buchanan and Boddy´s analysis of the character of change 8 : The authors characterise the change project in to dimensions. One pertains to the activities concerned: Are we dealing with peripheral or core activities of the organisation. The second dimension deals with the magnitude of the change. Buchanan and Boddy use the scale: incremental - radical 9. Furthermore Buchanan and Boddy makes a useful distinction between "public performance" (on stage) of rationally considered and logically phased and visibly participative change and "backstage activity" in the recruitment and maintenance of support and in seeking and <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance</b> (ibid p. 27) 3. We will apply data from our own case studies. We will use a format that we call an illustration, thereby indicating that we "only" illustrate a point. We do not prove it 10.

The space dependence of the measurements made with the subsurface gauge varied depending on the average field soil water content.

Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E 292 V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F 317 V and T 315 I for dasatinib and Y 253 H, E 255 V, and T 315 I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T 315 I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels.

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} emergence of antibiotic resistance amongst pathogenic bacteria {{is a major}} clinical and public health problem. The increase in resistant pathogens, accompanied with {{the small number of}} new antibiotics introduced in recent years, has limited the number of effective antimicrobials. The classical paradigm suggests that antibiotic resistance emerges by selection for pre-existing mutants in the bacterial population exposed to antibiotics. In contrast, recent data suggested that mutations evolve after cells encounter antibiotic therapy. This kind of mutation is known as adaptive mutation, which is activated by the SOS DNA repair and mutagenesis pathways. Accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) is the signal that induces the SOS response by promoting the formation of the RecA filament, which in turn activates the auto-cleavage activity of LexA and allows expression of SOS genes, including the SOS error-prone polymerases. In this project, phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid (PcTs) -based RecA inhibitors were characterized. PcTs molecules were found to potentiate the activity of bactericidal antibiotics and reduce the ability of bacteria to acquire antibiotic resistance mutations. This study highlights the ability of RecA inhibitors to potentiate the activity of antibiotics and provides a strategy for prolonging the life span of existing and newly developed antibiotics. We predicate that RecA inhibitors will be part of an antibiotic “cocktail” that enhances the activity of antibiotics and <b>blocks</b> <b>resistance,</b> which will ultimately prolong antibiotic lifespan...|$|R

Several years of research and recent commercial use have demonstrated the value of Watermark ® <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> for monitoring soil moisture status, evaluating current irrigation practices, and for irrigation scheduling in alfalfa. Experience has demonstrated that routine soil moisture monitoring can significantly improve irrigation management...|$|R
40|$|Non–small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) is {{characterized}} by severe resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that A 549 adenocarcinoma cells permanently differentiate with the anti-metabolites methotrexate (MTX) and gemcitabine (GE) when <b>blocking</b> the <b>resistance</b> mechanism that normally counteracts this process. MTX (1 – 10 M) and GE (1 M) induced growth arrest accompanied by sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation and moderate reduction of c-Myc levels after 96 h, whereas only a low percentage of the cells differentiated. Combination with the mitogen-activated protein ki-nase kinase (MEK) inhibitor 1, 4 -diamino- 2, 3 -dicyano- 1, 4 -bis-(methylthio) butadiene (U 0126) reduced MTX- or GE-induced ERK 1 / 2 over-phosphorylation, nearly abolished c-Myc expres-sion, and provoked radical morphological changes in all cells...|$|R
