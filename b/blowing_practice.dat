50|$|The 2011 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 10 July 2011 at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, England, and won by Fernando Alonso.Changes to {{the circuit}} {{mean that the}} race was {{previously}} classified as being in Northamptonshire, but {{the movement of the}} start-finish line means that the race is now officially classed as being in Buckinghamshire. It was the ninth race of the 2011 season, and saw the introduction of a ban on off-throttle <b>blown</b> diffusers, the <b>practice</b> of forcing the engine to continue to produce exhaust gasses to generate downforce when drivers are not using the throttle.|$|R

"I {{thought it}} was weird that, {{just as we were}} putting out a new album, the rest of the band decided to work on a rap-rock project with Powerdise (one half of Etched In Black, the rap act that made a guest {{appearance}} on 'Strut'). What made it worse was that I wrote all of the lyrics for our songs as was usually the case, but nearly half of the songs on that CD were ones that I had written as well, and they were all just so personal", says August. [...] "The timing for the side project, to my way of thinking, was terrible, and since I was commuting {{an hour and a half}} each way to practice by that point, I basically told them that if they wanted to work on that project during what were supposed to be Devil's Nite practices, they didn't need me to show up, and I started <b>blowing</b> off <b>practices.</b> Lots of them. Way too many, and that was entirely my fault. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised when I found out that we were parting ways, but I still was." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{appears that}} some {{variants}} {{of the instrument}} were loud, shrill, and therefore very hard to blow. A leather strap, called a phorbeiá (φορβεία) in Greek or capistrum in Latin, was worn horizontally around {{the head with a}} hole for the mouth by the auletai to help support the lips and avoid excessive strain on the cheeks due to continuous blowing. Sometimes a second strap was used {{over the top of the}} head to prevent the phorbeiá from slipping down. Aulos players are sometimes depicted with puffed cheeks. The playing technique almost certainly made use of circular breathing, very much like the Sardinian launeddas and Armenian duduk, and this would give the aulos a continuous sound.Although aristocrats with sufficient leisure sometimes practiced aulos-playing as they did the lyre, after the later fifth century the aulos became chiefly associated with professional musicians, often slaves. Nevertheless, such musicians could achieve fame. The Romano-Greek writer Lucian discusses aulos playing in his dialogue Harmonides, in which Alexander the Great's aulete Timotheus discusses fame with his pupil Harmonides. Timotheus advises him to impress the experts within his profession rather than seek popular approval in big public venues. If leading musicians admire him, popular approval will follow. However, Lucian reports that Harmonides died from excessive <b>blowing</b> during <b>practicing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The conch {{shell is}} a major Hindu article of prayer, used as a trumpeting {{announcement}} of all sorts. The God of Preservation, Vishnu, is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life as it {{has come out of}} life-giving waters. In the story of Dhruva the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient India would blow conch shells to announce battle, such as is famously represented {{in the beginning of the}} war of Kurukshetra in the Mahabharata, a famous Hindu epic. The conch shell is also a deep part of Hindu symbolic and religious tradition. Today most Hindus use the conch as a part of their religious <b>practices,</b> <b>blowing</b> it during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells. Shankha also symbolizes the sound that created the universe and stands for knowledge.|$|R
40|$|Percus (2000) {{has argued}} that {{subordinate}} verbs do not admit of trans-parent (de re) readings. In this squib, I will argue that such verbs in English do admit {{of a kind of}} transparent reading. Furthermore, this particular reading suggests that, at some level of syntactic and/or se-mantic analysis, verbs must be decomposed into a primitive action predicate (i. e., do) and a nominal argument describing the action per-formed. That is, this reading suggests that a verb like juggle must be semantically decomposed as a complex predicate do juggling. To keep my discussion here brief, I will presuppose some famil-iarity with Percus 2000, {{as well as with the}} kind of situation-semantics framework Percus assumes (see Kratzer 2008). In the following sec-tion, I introduce the reading of interest. 1 A Transparent Reading of Subordinate Verbs Imagine the following scenario. You and I are roommates. Moreover, we have entered ourselves into a talent competition. The act that we are preparing to perform is, specifically, a juggling routine. Every day at 3 p. m., we go to the gym to practice our juggling. Enter our friend Mary. Mary lives with us and knows that we are in a talent competition. However, Mary doesn’t have any idea what kind of act we will be performing. That is, although Mary knows that we leave for the gym every day at 3 p. m. to practice our act, she has no idea that we are, specifically, juggling. Now, suppose that one day, we decide to <b>blow</b> off <b>practice.</b> That is, at 3 p. m., we tell Mary that we’re leaving to practice, but then decide at the last minute to go to the movies. Suppose that, at the theater, I turn to you and utter sentence (1 a). (1) a. Mary thinks we’re juggling right now. b. Mary thinks we’re doing (our daily) juggling right now...|$|R
40|$|This {{football}} season, {{millions of}} Americans enjoying their favorite pastime might feel pangs of a guilty conscience. Years {{of scientific research}} into the long-term neurological effects of tackle football and a recent settlement between the National Football League (NFL) and thousands of retired NFL players have made football-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) a topic of national conversation. Current and former NFL players and even President Obama {{have participated in the}} conversation, saying that they would hesitate to let their sons play the game for fear of possible brain injury. Because research has uncovered signs of permanent brain damage in players as young as eighteen-years-old, and has suggested that everyday subconcussive <b>blows</b> during football <b>practice</b> could be the cause of such brain damage, one scientist has called for a ban on tackle football at the youth level. In light of these findings, current state laws are inadequate to address the very real risks associated with youth tackle football. In general, these laws do not attempt to prevent concussions, but rather address treatment for concussions following the injury. Furthermore, state laws entirely fail to address the daily, subconcussive blows suffered by youth players. To fully protect their youngest football players from the devastating effects of football-related TBIs, state legislators should ban tackle football for children under fourteen-years-old...|$|R
40|$|Analog speech {{scrambling}} systems, {{as opposed to}} purely digital encryption systems, have existed since the 1920 s. Analog {{speech scrambling}} technology has a checkered past with respect to security. Modern analog speech scrambling systems have successfully tackled the issues of security by using new technological methods that have been borrowed from high fidelity digital audio bit rate reduction systems, namely MPEG audio. The modern technological method of making speech over analog circuits secure involves digitizing speech and manipulating the digitized speech in the frequency and time domain by using digital encryption methods. These methods are in step with psychoacoustic research on secure voice transmission systems. The psycho-acoustical processing of digital audio coupled with digital encryption methods is adequate to make scrambled audio extremely unintelligible under normal telecommunications conditions. Most importantly, {{it is possible for}} people with modest engineering and design talents to design a secure analog voice scrambling system because international standards and common design principals aid in the construction of such telecommunications products. Analog scrambled speech systems have been around for at least 80 years. These systems have been of strategic value to their users by providing immunity from either casual eavesdropping or full <b>blown</b> surveillance as <b>practiced</b> by security intelligence agencies of domestic and foreign origin. Analog voice scrambling is not without a place in the telecommunications infrastructure...|$|R
