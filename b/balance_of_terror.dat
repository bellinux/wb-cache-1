The Medusae had for eons used a reddish, {{artificial}} greenhouse gas to keep their dying world from freezing. The Medusae learned from the first human expedition to their world that the gas rots human flesh, and the Medusae use it as a potent chemical weapon, attempting ecological destruction by means of projectiles fired from the Moon. Their vast spaceships also have very effective plasma weapons, very similar to those the Romulans had in a Star Trek episode called <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror.</b>|$|E

Other changes include a different monolith for the [...] "Dawn of Man" [...] sequence, discarded when early prototypes did not photograph well; the use of Saturn as the final destination of the Discovery mission rather than Jupiter, discarded when the special effects team could not develop a convincing rendition of Saturn's rings; and the finale of the Star Child exploding nuclear weapons carried by Earth-orbiting satellites, which Kubrick discarded for its similarity to his previous film, Dr. Strangelove.

5000|$|In many ways, {{this present}} {{change in the}} <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> {{can be seen as}} the {{complete}} embracement of the switch from the 1950s Eisenhower doctrine of [...] "massive retaliation" [...] to one of [...] "flexible response", which has been growing in importance in the US nuclear war fighting plan/SIOP every decade since.|$|E
5000|$|It {{describes}} the tenuous peace that {{existed between the}} two countries as a result of both governments being terrified at the prospect of a world-destroying nuclear war.

5000|$|Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> {{received}} generally negative reviews. A {{review in}} Fight Night on Channel 9: Saturday Night Horror Films on New York's WOR-TV, 1973-1987 by James Arena gave Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> a C, but noted that [...] "it was just off-beat {{enough to hold}} my interest." [...] Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> was included in Steve Miller's 150 Movies You Should Die Before You See. Miller gave Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> five thumbs down. He especially criticized {{the fact that the}} actors cast as college students were far too old, noting that they were in their late 30's and early 40's. Michael Adams, in his book Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies: A Film Critic's Year-Long Quest to Find the Worst Movie Ever Made, reviewed Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> and found it to be dull and full of padding. Like Miller, he noted that the actors were far too old to play college students. He pointed out that lead George E. Mather was 42 when he filmed Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror.</b> VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever called Ring <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> a [...] "cheaply made flop." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a speech}} {{broadcast}} on Al-Aqsa TV on March 23, 2014 (the tenth {{anniversary of the}} assassination of Sheik Ahmad Yassin), Haniyeh stated (as translated by MEMRI) [...] "Out of deprivation, we shall establish the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror.</b> Out of the ruins, we shall rock Tel Aviv.

5000|$|The first press {{reference}} to the phrase came from Russo-Indian talks, November 21, 1988.

The new world order which he describes is characterized by [...] "non-violence and the principles of peaceful coexistence." [...] He also includes the possibility of a sustained peace, an alternative to the nuclear <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror,</b> dismantling of nuclear weapons systems, significant cuts in strategic arms, and eventually a general and complete disarmament.|$|E
50|$|The first speculations about a {{relaunch}} of the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> {{began in}} December 2009. A Gold Coast Bulletin report detailed {{a variety of}} new attractions for the Gold Coast theme parks including the major relaunch of one of Dreamworlds Big 7 Thrill Rides. Although the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> was not mentioned in the article, amusement park fanatics agreed that the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> would be the most likely to receive the makeover. In February 2010, further fuel was added to the fire when a theme park reporter commented on the possibility of the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> featuring a new, backwards launching vehicle. Towards the end of April 2010, steel framework arrived beside the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terrors</b> launch track. The curved parts confirmed rumours that the tunnel would be extended. In August 2010, Dreamworld officially announced through their website that the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> will cease operations on 18 August 2010 and will reopen as the Tower <b>of</b> <b>Terror</b> II in time for the September school holidays. Dreamworld confirmed the rumour that the launch will be in reverse out of the newly extended 206 m tunnel. The ride was relaunched on 17 September 2010.|$|R

50|$|Partly on the {{recommendation}} of Peter Sellers, Stanley Kubrick asked Southern to help revise the screenplay of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964). The film was based on the Cold War thriller Red Alert (1958) by Peter George, the rights to which Kubrick had secured for $3,000. Kubrick and George's original screenplay (which was to be called Edge of Doom) was a straight political thriller. They then reworked it into a satirical format (provisionally titled The Delicate <b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror)</b> in which the plot of Red Alert was situated as a film-within-a-film made by an alien intelligence.|$|E

5000|$|The Federation is {{described}} as an interstellar federal polity with, as of the year 2373, more than 150 member planets and thousands of colonies spread across some 8,000,000 cubic light years of the Milky Way galaxy; each successive series in the timeline bringing in more races and planets into the Federation. The social structure within the Federation is classless and operates within a money-less [...] "New World Economy". The Federation {{is described}} as stressing, at least nominally, the values of universal liberty, equality, justice, peace, and cooperation. The Federation also maintains its own quasi-militaristic and scientific exploratory agency, known as Starfleet (also written as [...] "Star Fleet" [...] in some texts). Starfleet is seen handling many other governmental processes, often with no other agency's influence, such as border defense (<b>Balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terror,</b> Arena), diplomatic envoy (Mirror Mirror), and has seen extensive use as a defensive military force (Errand of Mercy, Doomsday Machine).|$|E
50|$|The {{committee}} {{argued that}} Israel's security relies {{not on the}} attainment of a nuclear bomb but rather on the nuclear proliferation of the entire region. It was also argued that attaining a nuclear bomb would cause an intensified Arab effort to attain one as well, thus resulting in a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> that might jeopardize the Zionist enterprise. The committee acted behind the scenes {{and led to a}} quiet discussion on the issue among several {{of the members of the}} big parties, including Levi Eshkol, who replaced Ben-Gurion in 1963, and other party leaders such as Haim-Moshe Shapira of the National Religious Party, Pinchas Rosen of the Liberal party, Yaakov Hazan and Mordechai Bentov of Mapam and Ahdut HaAvoda men Yisrael Galili and Yigal Allon. Allon was particularly attentive to the committee and was considered its loyal supporter in the government. The committee ceased its activities after the Six Day War. According to Avner Cohen, its bout was the closest thing in Israeli history to public democratic debate on nuclear policy.|$|E
