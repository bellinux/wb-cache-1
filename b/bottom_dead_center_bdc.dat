No transfer took place at this point since there was no pressure differential; the cylinder was still open to the air and thus at ambient pressure. The overhead valve exhausted directly into the slipstream since no exhaust manifold could be practically fitted to the spinning crankcase and cylinders, partly in order to save weight and prevent excessive amounts of centrifugal forces in flight.|$|R

The throttle valve was fully closed. When the parameters were changed, the stepper motor was adjusted automatically to control the engine speed at 800 r/min. When the θi is changed from 40 to 10 o BTDC, the maximum ITE and the maximum power are observed at λ= 1. 1. As λ increases, the maximum ITE is corresponding to a greater θi.

40|$|The use of {{close-coupled}} post {{injections of}} fuel is an in-cylinder soot-reduction technique that has much promise for high efficiency, heavy-duty diesel engines. Close-coupled post injections, short injections of fuel that occur {{soon after the}} end of the main fuel injection, have been known to reduce engine-out soot at a wide range of engine operating conditions, including variations in injection timing, EGR level, load, boost, and speed. While many studies have investigated the performance of post injections, the details of the mechanism by which soot is reduced remains unclear. In this study, we have measured the efficacy of post injections over a range of load conditions, at constant speed, boost, and rail pressure, in a heavy-duty, optically-accessible research diesel engine. Here, the base load is varied by changing the main-injection duration. Measurements of engine-out soot indicate that not only does the efficacy of a post injection decrease at higher engine loads, but that the range of post-injection durations over which soot reduction is achievable is limited at higher loads. Optical measurements, including natural luminescence of soot and planar laser-induced incandescence of soot, provide information about the spatio-temporal development of in-cylinder soot through the cycle in cases with and without post injections. The optical results indicate that the post injection behaves similarly at different loads, but that its relative efficacy decreases due to the increase in soot resulting from longer main-injection durations.

Nine (one female, eight males) healthy cyclists between the ages of 24 - 50 with a forefoot inversion of 6 degrees or more were filmed riding their bicycles with and without custom forefoot orthotics.

A paired two tailed t-test was used to analyze the data. As a group, the subjects showed no statistically significant differences between the two conditions (p = 0. 147).

This paper focuses on the application of LES quality criteria to ICE and to their correlation, in order to draw a solid background on future LES quality assessments for ICE. In this paper, TCC-III single-cylinder optical engine from University of Michigan is investigated and the analysis is conducted under motored condition. LES quality is mainly affected by grid size and type, sub-grid scale (SGS) model, numeric schemes. In this study, the same grid size and type are used in order to focus on the effect on LES quality of SGS models and blending factors of numeric scheme only. In the first section of the study, single grid estimators are used to compare two sub-filter models which are static Smagorinsky model and dynamic Smagorinsky model. Also, two cases which are simulated with different blending factors for numeric schemes and same SGS model are compared. In the second section, the in-cylinder gas-dynamics and flow structures are analyzed by comparing experimental results (pressure transducers and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) velocity fields) with a dataset of consecutive LES cycles. The flow analysis focuses at four different crank angle positions (<b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (<b>BDC),</b> middle of exhaust and intake valve opening timing and mid-compression stroke) on the same section plane as PIV visualizations.

This paper deals with a process whereby a preheated thermoplastic plain-woven carbon fiber fabric sheet is formed into a circular cup by a mechanical servo-press. The effects of press parameters, specifically the <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> and slide speed in the forming of CFRTP cup, on the press load, pressure, internal temperature, shape accuracy, and internal structure have been investigated. A plain-woven carbon-fiber-reinforced PA 6 thermoplastic sheet was used. The sheet consisted of four layers of woven 3 K carbon and had a thickness of 1 mm. The sheet was heated to 320 °C under a halogen heater so that it would be around the recommended temperature for forming 260 °C after transfer to the mold. The sheet was pressed into a circular cup shape by a cold mold while the periphery was cramped by a heated holder so as not to cool the sheet before it was pulled into the mold cave. Die clearance was designed considering the thickness increase due to the fiber concentration during the forming. By increasing the slide stroke to the <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center,</b> the applied press load was increased and the internal structure was improved, showing no voids. By increasing the slide speed, the final press load was reduced and shape accuracy was improved through a good pressure distribution on the mold. Measurement of the surface temperature of the sheet during the forming revealed that it remained in the melting region of the resin in the case of fast slide speed, but dropped below the melting temperature in the case of low slide speed. This difference apparently led to spring-in or spring-back after the forming. The experimental results indicate that appropriate balance among press speed, <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>center,</b> and sheet temperature is important in the high-cycle forming of CFRTP. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.
