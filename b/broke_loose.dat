Two years later, Anson accidentally sank a passenger ship when the latter <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from her anchors during a strong storm and collided with her. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in mid-1893 and returned home in 1900 when she {{was assigned}} to the Reserve Fleet. She recommissioned for the Home Fleet in early 1901. Anson was paid off three years later and then sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E

5|$|The {{drift of}} the Antarctic {{exploration}} vessel SY Aurora was an ordeal which lasted 312days, during the Ross Sea chapter of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. It {{began when the}} ship <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from its anchorage in McMurdo Sound in May 1915, during a gale. Caught in heavy pack ice and unable to manoeuvre, Aurora, with eighteen men aboard, was carried into the open waters of the Ross Sea and Southern Ocean, leaving ten men stranded ashore with meagre provisions.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt met Virginia for {{the first}} time since 1898. It also won {{for the first}} time, 13–0. Ammie Sikes scored first, after runs of 35 and 28 yards by Lew Hardage paved the way.

Her last commercial run came on March 20, 1947. The trip was described in McCurdy as follows:Mills, an English professor when he was not writing books on history, used his full talent with the language to capture the occasion:Georgie Burton was moored up at The Dalles, with the objective of turning her into a museum boat.

The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the Nebraska 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} {{caught off guard}} by the late arrival of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Henry Bridge, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge (which carries I-470), and the Wheeling Suspension Bridge {{were all}} closed in January 2005, {{stopping}} any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia {{for a few}} days because barges <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> during heavy flooding along the Ohio River. The Wheeling Tunnel was closed for reconstruction work in 2007, 2008, and 2010, causing motorists who wished to travel through on I-70 to detour. The two detour routes were city streets in downtown Wheeling and the I-470 loop.|$|E

25|$|The keel of the Svea-owned {{ship was}} laid on 2 June 1971, {{and she was}} {{launched}} six months later on 3 December 1971. On 13 February 1972 a storm <b>broke</b> the ship <b>loose</b> from her fitting-out berths, resulting in minor damage. Despite the difficulties the ship was delivered to Rederi AB Svea on 26 May 1972, and christened Svea Regina by Mrs Ingegerd Hägglöf, the wife of Mr Ingemar Hägglöf, the Swedish Ambassador to Finland. Following delivery the Svea Regina sailed from Nantes to Stockholm via the Kiel Canal. On 30 May 1972 she arrived at Nybroviken, Stockholm.|$|R
5|$|The third {{storm of}} the season was first {{observed}} in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September20. Strengthening while heading northeastward, the system made landfall near Boca Grande, Florida with winds of 70mph (110km/h) early on the following day. Heavy rainfall in Tampa caused the streets and sideways to become inundated, leaving portions of the city impassable, especially areas adjacent to the DeSoto Hotel. Two fire stations were severely damaged. On {{the east coast of}} Florida, the worst impact occurred in Cocoa, where some buildings were destroyed and others were deroofed. Further north in Fernandina Beach, ships in the harbor <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> and tossed about, leaving considerable damage.|$|E

5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
5000|$|Friendship 7 lost {{altitude}} in its reentry glide {{over the}} continental United States, {{and headed toward}} splashdown in the Atlantic. The Texas tracking station told Glenn to retain the retro pack until the accelerometer read 1.5 g (14.7 m/s2). Glenn reported as he crossed Cape Canaveral he had been controlling the spacecraft manually and would use the fly-by-wire mode as a backup. Mercury Control then gave him the 0.05 g (0.49 m/s2) mark, and he pressed the override button. About the same time, Glenn heard noises that sounded like [...] "small things brushing against the capsule." [...] "This is Friendship 7 - a real fireball outside," [...] he radioed Mercury Control. A strap from the retro package <b>broke</b> partially <b>loose</b> and hung over the spacecraft window as it was consumed in the reentry plasma stream. The spacecraft control system was working well but the manual fuel supply was down to 15 percent. The peak of reentry deceleration was still to come. Glenn switched to fly-by-wire and the automatic tank supply. This combination had more available fuel.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} {{hundreds}} of bootlegs based on the solo careers {{of the members of the}} band, one is particularly noteworthy as the only known recording of Lennon and McCartney together after The Beatles <b>broke</b> up. A <b>loose</b> jam involving the two, along with Stevie Wonder, Harry Nilsson, Jesse Ed Davis and others, was recorded at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles on 28 March 1974. The recording did not surface until 18 years later when a portion of it was released on bootleg as A Toot and a Snore in '74. The recording is known more for its historical significance than the quality of the performances.|$|R
5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually <b>broke</b> into a <b>loose</b> formation created by the vagaries of the wind.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{continued}} {{to open his}} lead on Kovalainen; by lapeight it stood at 6.3seconds. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Fisichella in separate manoeuvres over the next twolaps.

As {{a result of the}} contact, the Force India's front wing <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> and lodged under the car. Consequently, Fisichella lost control at turnnine, spinning into the gravel trap and retiring. Massa overtook Rosberg for fourth on the same lap, beginning a close fight where both drivers repeatedly exchanged positions over the next threelaps. Massa eventually consolidated fourth position on lap15. Hamilton passed Heidfeld, Glock, Kubica and Alonso in separate manoeuvres, to sit in seventh by lap19.|$|E
5|$|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste. She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908. The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria-Hungary purchased abroad to build her. A {{month and a half}} after her launch, she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion. During a severe storm that night, she <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from her moorings; with no crewmen aboard, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola. The following morning, the navy located her and started to refloat her. Completion was delayed by a welders' strike in 1908 and a riveters' strike in 1909. Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of the class to be completed, and she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910.|$|E

Eighteen aircraft joined battle with American fighters and lost half their number. A smaller group of nine Japanese dive bombers of this force evaded U.S. aircraft and attacked Wasp and Bunker Hill, but scored no hits. Eight were shot down. The larger group of Japanese aircraft had flown to Guam and were intercepted over Orote Field by 27 Hellcats while landing. Thirty of the 49 Japanese aircraft were shot down, and the rest were damaged beyond repair. Aboard the Lexington afterward, a pilot was heard to remark [...] "Hell, this is like an old-time turkey shoot!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Zabu {{appeared}} in the 1981 Spider-Man episode [...] "The Hunter and the Hunted". J. Jonah Jameson hired Kraven the Hunter to capture Zabu, {{so that he could}} be the mascot for the Daily Bugle, much to the objection of Robbie Robertson and Betty Brant. Ka-Zar traveled to Manhattan to rescue Zabu. When the chain on the airport crane holding Zabu's cage <b>broke,</b> Zabu got <b>loose</b> and Spider-Man tried to subdue Zabu only for an allergy to smilodons to kick in. Spider-Man did manage to trap Zabu in his webs. Kraven later uses Zabu for bait when it came to hunting Ka-Zar. When Ka-Zar ended up tangled up in Kraven's vines, he managed to swing to Zabu's cage and release him. He and Ka-Zar managed to trick Kraven into one of his cages. After Kraven was handed over to the police, Ka-Zar and Zabu returned to the Savage Land.|$|R
2500|$|... 1830s {{and early}} 1840s blackface {{performers}} performed solo or as duos, {{with the occasional}} trio; the traveling troupes that would later characterize blackface minstrelsy arose only with the minstrel show. In New York City in 1843, Dan Emmett and his Virginia Minstrels <b>broke</b> blackface minstrelsy <b>loose</b> from its novelty act and entr'acte status and performed the first full-blown minstrel show: an evening's entertainment composed entirely of blackface performance. (E. P. Christy did {{more or less the}} same, apparently independently, earlier the same year in Buffalo, New York.) Their loosely structured show with the musicians sitting in a semicircle, a tambourine player on one end and a bones player on the other, set the precedent for what would soon become the first act of a standard three-act minstrel show. By 1852, the skits that had been part of blackface performance for decades expanded to one-act farces, often used as the show's third act.|$|R
5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E
5|$|The eight Locusts {{were loaded}} into {{separate}} Hamilcar gliders between 17–20 March, {{and on the}} morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions. Weather conditions for the operation were excellent, with clear visibility, and all eight gliders arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone without incident. During their attempts to land, however, the small force was severely depleted; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated, apparently as a result of structural failure, with the Locust inside it falling to the ground. Three more gliders came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, rendering it useless.|$|E
5|$|The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of {{the brigade}} landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of {{obstructions}} by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch <b>broke</b> <b>loose</b> of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E
