Beside the well-established {{role of the}} brainstem–cerebellum in the adaptation of reactive saccades (RSs), the cerebral cortex has been suggested {{to be involved in}} the adaptation of voluntary saccades (VSs). Here, we provide direct evidence for a causal involvement of the parietal cortex in saccadic adaptation. First, the posterior intra-parietal sulcus (pIPS) was identified in each subject using func-tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, a saccadic adaptation paradigm was used to progressively reduce the ampli-tude of RSs and VSs, while single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) was applied over the right pIPS. The pertur-bations of pIPS resulted in impairment for the adaptation of VSs, selectively when spTMS was applied 60 ms after saccade onset. In contrast, the adaptation of RSs was facilitated by spTMS applied 90 ms after saccade initiation. The differential effect of spTMS rela-tive to saccade types suggests a direct interference with pIPS activity for the VS adaptation and a remote interference with brain-stem–cerebellum activity for the RS adaptation. These results support the hypothesis that the adaptation of VSs and RSs involves different neuronal substrates...|$|E

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} and obesity {{are associated with}} a reduction of mitochondrial content in various tissues of mammals. Moreover, a reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability impairs several cellular functions, including mitochondrial biogenesis and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, two important mechanisms of <b>body</b> <b>adaptation</b> in response to physical exercise. Although these mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated in skeletal muscle and heart, few studies have focused on the effects of exercise on mitochondria and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. In this study, we compared the in vivo effects of chronic exercise in subcutaneous adipose tissue of wild-type (WT) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) knockout (eNOS(-/-)) mice after a swim training period. We then investigated the in vitro effects of NO on mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 and human subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived adipocytes after a chronic treatment with an NO donor: diethylenetriamine-NO (DETA-NO). We observed that swim training increases mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial DNA content, and glucose uptake in subcutaneous adipose tissue of WT but not eNOS(-/-) mice. Furthermore, we observed that DETA-NO promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and elongation, glucose uptake, and GLUT 4 translocation in cultured murine and human adipocytes.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{the relationship between}} anterior disc displacement and global posture (plantar arches, lower limbs, shoulder and pelvic girdle, vertebral spine, head and mandibles). Common {{signs and symptoms of}} anterior disc displacement were also identified. INTRODUCTION: Global posture deviations cause <b>body</b> <b>adaptation</b> and realignment, which may interfere with the organization and function of the temporomandibular joint. METHODS: Global posture evaluation was performed in a group of 10 female patients (20 to 30 years of age) with temporomandibular joint disc displacement and in a control group of 16 healthy female volunteers matched for age, weight and height. Anterior disc displacement signs, symptoms and the presence of parafunctional habits were also identified through interview. RESULTS: Patients with disc displacement showed a higher incidence of pain in the temporomandibular joint area, but there were no differences in parafunctional habits between the groups. In the disc displacement group, postural deviations were found in the pelvis (posterior rotation), lumbar spine (hyperlordosis), thoracic spine (rectification), head (deviation to the right) and mandibles (deviation to the left with open mouth). There were no differences in the longitudinal plantar arches between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a close relationship between body posture and temporomandibular disorder, though {{it is not possible to}} determine whether postural deviations are the cause or the result of the disorder. Hence, postural evaluation could be an important component in the overall approach to providing accurate prevention and treatment in the management of patients with temporomandibular disorder...|$|E

In judo bouts, maintaining hand grip on an opponent's clothes and postural balance is essential for the effective technical and tactical actions. This study compares changes after maximal anaerobic exercise among judo athletes and untrained subjects regarding 1) maximum isometric handgrip strength (HGSmax) and accuracy at the perceived 50 % maximum handgrip force (1 / 2 HGSmax) and 2) the balance of 13 judo athletes at national (n = 8) and international (n = 5) competitive levels and 19 untrained university students. The groups did not differ in age, body height, and weight. Body mass index (BMI) and body composition (JAWON) were evaluated. The Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT, Monark 875 E) measured recommended anaerobic capacity indices. Hand grip strength (Takei dynamometer) and balance (biplate balance platform) were measured before warm-up (T 1), before the WAnT test (T 2), and after (T 3). Parametric or non-parametric tests were performed after verifying the variable distribution assumption. Judoists had higher BMI and fat-free mass index (FFMI) than the students. The athletes also showed higher relative total work and relative peak power and lower levels of lactic acid. The difference in judoists between HGSmax at T 1 and HGSmax at T 3 was statistically significant. Before warm-up (T 1), athletes showed higher strength (more divergent from the calculated ½HGSmax value) compared to students. Substantial fatigue after the WAnT test significantly deteriorated the body stability indices, which were significantly better in judo athletes at all time points. The findings suggest specific body adaptations in judoists, especially for body composition, anaerobic energy system efficiency, and postural balance. These characteristics could be trained for specifically by judo athletes to meet the time-motion and anaerobic demands of contemporary bouts...|$|E
40|$|It {{appears that}} the {{physiological}} and biochemical adaptation of skeletal muscle to training in equine species shows a lot of similarities with human and rodent physiological adaptation. On the other hand {{it is becoming increasingly}} clear that intra-cellular mechanisms of adaptation (substrate transport, enzyme activity, etc) differ considerably between species. The major drawbacks in equine training physiological research are the lack of an appropriate training model and the lack of control of sensitivity and specificity of parameters used in human and rodent research. Furthermore, scientists become {{aware of the fact that}} the coupling of biochemical properties of skeletal muscle and other physiological systems play a role in the whole <b>body</b> <b>adaptation</b> during training adaptation. The present thesis focuses on development of a scientific based controlled equine training model, based on equine training practice, and the adaptation in equine skeletal muscle physiological, biochemical, and neuromuscular pathways. During rest and exercise, glucose and triglycerides provide the most energy needed. Both substrates are stored in skeletal muscle, glucose as glycogen and triglycerides as lipid droplets. Transport of these substrates into skeletal muscle is primarily regulated by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT- 4) and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD 36). In this thesis we show that the immunohistochemical distribution of these proteins is similar to human expression patterns. Accumulation of lactic acid during exercise is a major determinant of fatigue. Lactic acid is removed from the cell by specific membrane transport proteins, monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). These MCT proteins promote transport of lactate anions and protons from production sites (anaerobic metabolism, mainly in fast glycolytic muscle fibres) to oxidation sites (heart, brain and oxidative muscle fibres). This thesis identifies the expression of MCT 1, 2 and 4 in Standardbred skeletal muscle. The training protocol used in this study resulted in changes in quantitative electromygraphic (EMG) values associated with training. Biochemical analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies resulted in less pronounced training adaptation than quantitative EMG. Quantitative EMG and biochemical analysis both showed no signs of mal-adaptation after intensified training compared to controls. There was however a stronger training associated adaptation observed upon intensified training. Finally, we applied these techniques to horses suffering from lower motor neuron disease (LMND), among others a model for denervation. This disease is characterized by increased whole body glucose metabolism and muscular atrophy and weight loss, due to degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Using these techniques we show that increased whole body glucose uptake is not accompanied by increased GLUT- 4 expression. Furthermore we conclude that metabolic changes are secondary to denervation and reinnervation processes in this disease. The main conclusion from our results is that the intensified training protocol used in this study does not increases stress levels above the maximal threshold for skeletal muscle (mal) adaptation. Sarcolemmal substrate transport proteins for fatty acids (FAT/CD 36), glucose (GLUT- 4) and monocarboxylates (MCT), as identified in this thesis, may have an important function in (mal) adaptation of skeletal muscle metabolism to training and intensified training. Due to technical problems, we were unfortunately not able to perform these analysis...|$|E

40|$|Many authors {{emphasize}} the importance of warm-up. Warm-up in team games aims at enhancing the <b>body</b> <b>adaptation</b> to the physical activity and to activate physiological functions from the rest state to the active state. Warm-up brings many different benefits, for example: physiological, psychological, and preventive, regardless of the classification of the above. From a psychological standpoint, the warm-up is performed to create the body "alertness", activity and readiness, and a willingness to act effectively. It was found that the players who perform the correct warm-up are better mentally prepared than those who do not perform it. After a well performed warm-up, the athlete is self-confident and has a positive attitude to the match. It is believed that the warm-up can also be the way to relieve tension and anxiety and to increase concentration and motivation before the match. Warm-up also improves the emotional states and reduces fear of failure. It has been verified that the warm-up, performed under appropriate conditions, improves focus, visual perception, action accuracy, self-confidence, speed and responsiveness, speed of processing and decision making. From the physiological point of view, the warm-up is an activity that adapts the basketball player’s body to an effort. It is an important factor that affects the effect of participation in the competition. Data from the literature suggest that the warm-up individualization is necessary in terms of duration and intensity. There are two types of warm-ups: passive and active. Passive warm-up is the one that is performed by using hot showers, baths, saunas, and steam baths or by using energetics massage. Active warm-up requires a lot of commitment and determination from the athlete during exercises that prepare the body and muscles for an effort. The training measures used during this part of warm-up are the general exercises that improve strength, stretch, coordination, and technical-tactical activities, and activities with the ball or without it. The cognitive purpose of the paper: was to find and develop the best possible pre-match warm-up structures based on current literature. These data were used to determine a "model" (pattern) of optimal warm-up. The practical aim was to formulate guidelines for basketball coaches to develop the warm-up structures, taking into account the duration and proportion of dynamic and static exercises that prepare the body for play. The research material was 12 male players from the basketball team playing in the top tournaments in Poland and in the Tauron Basket League. 11 players were included in the play reliability study, because one of them did not participate in the play and it was impossible to determine his play effectiveness. The team was ranked in the top five of the 2014 / 2015 league table. The standardized observation method was used in the study. The method consisted in observing people with respect to the purpose of observation, taking into account strictly defined behavioral (reactions) categories the researchers were interested in. To evaluate the players’ effectiveness during the match, the original result sheet of the players’ performance based on the Superlak project was used. As a result of the research, no correlation between the type of warm-up performed by the respondents and the player’s reliability during the match was observed. According to authors, the results allow formulating the following conclusions: • In the Extra-class team, many of the competitors skip the general phase and performed only the specialist phase. There is a division based on the type of exercises (dynamic, static, ball). • Based on the observation made, the warm-up performed by the Extra-class basketball players did not match the warm-up model resulting from the literature recommendations and it did not affect the player's reliability and performance during the match. • As a practical proposal, trainers should use rational, highly personalized warm-up models...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn many of {{his papers}} the {{contemporary}} and much debated author Hubert Dreyfus resorts to Merleau-Ponty's concept of “motor intentionality” in order to uphold the view of direct relation, not mediated by mental representations, between subject and world. He claims that as a person becomes an expert in a domain (driving, playing piano etc.), she does not respond in a rule-like way to objects, but in a flexible way to situations as wholes. No representations of objects or rules are active anymore; the whole situation in which that person is immersed requires her {{to act in a}} certain way. However, skillful coping, although not guided by rules, is not automatic action; it is intentional behavior, viz. motor intentionality–the <b>body's</b> <b>adaptation</b> to the environmental “solicitations”. This paper challenges this thesis by arguing that, in order to account for skillful coping, one need to explain how the body succeeds in dealing with complicated objects that require multiple object tracking, specific timing and spatiotemporal coordination of movements.
