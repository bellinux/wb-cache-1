60|$|Other {{women might}} have been alarmed by the atrocious wickedness of the {{conspiracy}} which the music-master had planned. Mrs. Gallilee was only offended. That he should think her capable--in her social position--of favouring such a plot as he had suggested, was an insult which she was determined neither to forgive nor forget. Fortunately, she had not committed herself in writing; he could produce no proof of the relations that had existed between them. The first and best use to make of her recovery would be to dismiss him--after paying his expenses, privately and prudently, in money instead of <b>by</b> <b>cheque.</b>|$|E
50|$|During 2005-2008, the UPA led {{government}} of India imposed tax on withdrawals {{of more than}} Rs 50,000.00 from current accounts for detection of unaccounted money {{in the absence of}} alternative methods.

60|$|A secretary, after all, {{can do a}} great deal. When {{it came to the}} scratch, I had {{but little}} {{difficulty}} in persuading Sir Charles, with Amelia's aid, backed up on either side by Isabel and Césarine, to accede to the Count's more reasonable proposal. The Southampton Row people had possession of certain facts as to the value of the wines in the Bordeaux market which clinched the matter. In a week or two all was settled; Charles and I met the Count by appointment in Southampton Row, and saw him sign, seal, and deliver the title-deeds of Schloss Lebenstein. My brother-in-law paid the purchase-money into the Count's own hands, <b>by</b> <b>cheque,</b> crossed on a first-class London firm where the Count kept an account to his high well-born order. Then he went away with the proud knowledge that he was owner of Schloss Lebenstein. And what to me was more important still, I received next morning by post a cheque for the five per cent, unfortunately drawn, by some misapprehension, to my order on the self-same bankers, and with the Count's signature. He explained in the accompanying note that the matter being now quite satisfactorily concluded, he saw no reason of delicacy why the amount he had promised should not be paid to me forthwith direct in money.|$|E
