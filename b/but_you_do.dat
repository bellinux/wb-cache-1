500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E
500|$|After her divorce, Victoria went to {{live with}} her mother at Coburg and at her house in the French Riviera. She and Ernst shared custody of Elisabeth, who spent six months of each year with each parent. Elisabeth blamed Victoria for the divorce and Victoria had a {{difficult}} time reconnecting with her daughter. Ernst wrote in his memoirs that Elisabeth hid under a sofa, crying, before one visit to her mother. Ernst assured the child that her mother loved her too. Elisabeth responded, [...] "Mama says she loves me, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> love me." [...] Ernst remained silent and didn't correct the child's impression. Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge. The doctor advised the Tsar's family to notify the child's mother of her illness, but the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram. Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the child's death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside. At Elisabeth's funeral, Victoria removed her Hessian Order, a medallion, and placed it on her daughter's coffin as a final gesture [...] "that she had made a final break with her old home." ...|$|E
500|$|Victor {{was noted}} for his {{controversial}} relationship {{with both of}} his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a [...] father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father {{and more like a}} hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it looks as if it might not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The diverse {{sources of}} funding {{meant that the}} {{production}} team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> want to see something like a kiss", she said.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Nick's mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), {{his father}} Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) adored Sharon and {{maintained}} a paternal {{relationship with her}} over the years. Case described Victor as being Sharon's hero and a [...] "father figure". However, their dynamic changes in January 2012 when Victor marries Sharon {{so that she can}} protect his assets while he is in jail; the non-romantic marriage is annulled days later. Several months later, they become romantically involved. Joshua Morrow told Soaps In Depth that he was puzzled as to why Nick had no [...] "legitimate anger" [...] about the relationship, while Braeden was also unhappy with the storyline, stating: [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Case described the relationship as incestuous: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things", calling it [...] "upsetting to the audience". The actress was also unfavorable of Sharon marrying Victor in August 2012, believing the writers could have handled the storyline other ways. The short-lived marriage between Victor and Sharon was considered an [...] "inside joke" [...] for the actors. Reflecting on the storyline, Case revealed: [...] "I didn’t understand how I was going to sell a love story between Sharon and Victor for obvious reasons. What motivated Sharon {{to fall in love with}} Victor when she’s in love with Adam and Nick?" ...|$|E

500|$|Following the battle, the {{commander}} of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: [...] "Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know how to make use of your victory." [...] Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy. Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, {{and the fact that he}} first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} favorable. Columnist Joan Crosby noted that [...] "This {{is the kind}} of show you don't think you'll laugh at, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> mostly because the cast is so good." [...] She noted that Cleavon Little, Joan Van Ark, and Reva Rose were, respectively, [...] "marvelous", [...] "pretty", and [...] "funny", and that Nancy Fox [...] "wins this year's cute-as-a-kitten award". Barbara Holsopple, TV and radio editor for the Pittsburgh Press, noted that [...] "ABC did a gutsy turnabout in taking the heavy drama out of a {{hospital}} and replacing it with comedy. The venture worked well, thanks to excellent performances from the Temperatures Rising cast". She [...] praised Albertson, noted that Whitmore [...] "was little seen", and that the series: [...] "{{is the kind of}} tidy little show that brings chuckles". Win Fanning, a syndicated columnist, stated that: [...] "the comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give Temperatures a bright, light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy", and that it was: [...] "loaded with one-liners and sight gags, which, if kept on the level of the opener, promise many hours of hilarity". Fanning praised Little as [...] "one of the comedy finds of any TV season", and Fox as [...] "a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long, successful career ahead". More praise for the series came after the broadcast of its fourth episode. An unidentified reviewer, writing for the Armored Sentinel (of Temple, Texas), stated [...] "If you're suffering from the case of the 'downs,' this series is a sure pick up!" [...] The reviewer went on to note that [...] "the brightest spot of the series is wacky Nancy Fox. Her role applies the wackiness of Goldie Hawn, but in situation comedy form. I'd watch the show just for her! The whole series is wacky and funny; it's downright good. I highly recommend it." ...|$|E
