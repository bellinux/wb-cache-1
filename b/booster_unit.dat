25|$|After {{less than}} a year as the City of Los Angeles, the LA-4 was {{replaced}} again, this time by a train equipped with the new EMC E3s LA-5 and LA-6 in March 1939. In June of that year, the lead power car of the train was rebuilt as a <b>booster</b> <b>unit,</b> renumbered to CD-06-C, and added to the former M-10006, now renumbered as CD-06. The trailing power car was added to the former M-10005, now CD-05, as CD-05-C. Both cars were scrapped with their respective power sets in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|The M-10003 was {{intended}} to be a spare power set, able to fill in on either the City of San Francisco or City of Denver if any of the other three locomotives needed maintenance. As of March 7, 1937, its <b>booster</b> <b>unit</b> was on loan to M-10002 on the Los Angeles run. [...] In June 1937, it was decided to permanently assign it to the City of Denver and it was renumbered to CD-07. A third power car was added in 1939, using a new carbody and the power equipment from M-10001.|$|E

50|$|The C855 was {{launched}} in 1964 {{in response to a}} request from the Union Pacific Railroad for a dual engine unit to replace up to ten first-generation locomotives.

50|$|A B unit, in {{railroad}} terminology, is {{a locomotive}} unit (generally a diesel locomotive) {{which does not}} have a driving cab or crew compartment, and must therefore be controlled from another, coupled locomotive with a driving cab (an A unit). The terms <b>booster</b> <b>unit</b> and cabless are also used. The concept is largely confined to North America. Elsewhere, locomotives without driving cabs are rare.|$|E
50|$|At the 1954 Farnborough Airshow, Fairey Australia {{displayed}} a massive missile resembling the RTV-1. The base {{was formed by}} a <b>booster</b> <b>unit</b> about 6 ft high and 20 inches in diameter, stabilised by four large and four small fins and housing seven five-inch motors. The main body was about 17 ft in length with a diameter of 10 in. The body was fitted with four wings and four small control vanes.|$|E
50|$|The first units {{produced}} for a customer {{were built in}} December 1940 and January 1941 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and numbered the 100 set. These were the first diesel-electric locomotives ever produced with dynamic braking, a system developed {{at the insistence of}} the railroad and with its assistance. Initially the four-unit, coupler-equipped set featured two <b>booster</b> <b>units</b> between two cab units in the manner of the demonstrator set. The Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, however, insisted that the two cabs required two crews, so the railway had EMD produce extra boosters, and renumbered its earliest sets into four unit sets with one cab <b>unit</b> and three <b>boosters.</b> Negotiation with the unions soon rectified the situation, but as the road's earliest units were geared for higher speeds than subsequent units, these sets continued to be composed of one FTA cab unit and three FTB boosters. This is why the road had ten more FTB <b>booster</b> <b>units</b> than FTA cab units.|$|R
50|$|The XRB {{class were}} built by Pacific National at their South Dynon {{workshops}} They are mechanically {{similar to the}} XR class, but are B units without driving cabs.

50|$|The Chukar drones {{that were}} {{available}} were usually launched from DC-130 director aircraft, and could also be launched from strike aircraft such as F-15s or F-16s.
