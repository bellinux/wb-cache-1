5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in terms of human physiology, which in turn might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to <b>be</b> <b>described</b> using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Cacti whose stems {{are even}} smaller may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as {{globular}} (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti.

5|$|The American economy, however, {{does not}} require a labor force {{consisting}} solely of professionals. Instead it requires a greatly diverse and specialized labor force.

5|$|The global {{population}} of the species has as yet not been formally confirmed, {{but it has been}} officially rated in the range of 'Least Concern', according to the BirdLife International in 2004. As such, the bird could <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as common in its local habitat.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but can only <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might <b>be</b> <b>described</b> more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as circumstantial when a patient includes {{a great deal of}} irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning.
