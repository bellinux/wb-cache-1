5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E

25|$|The running key {{variant of}} the Vigenère cipher was also {{considered}} unbreakable at one time. This version uses as the key a block of text {{as long as the}} plaintext. Since the key is as long as the message the Friedman and Kasiski tests no longer work (the key is not repeated). In 1920, Friedman was the first to discover this variant's weaknesses. The problem with the running key Vigenère cipher is that the cryptanalyst has statistical information about the key (assuming that the block of text is in a known language) and that information will <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext.|$|E
25|$|The first opera to be {{performed}} in the San Giacomo Theatre had been {{as far back as}} 1733 ("Gerone, tiranno di Siracusa"), and for almost two hundred years between 1771 until 1943 nearly every major operatic composition from the Italian tradition, as well as many others of Greek and French composers, were performed at the stage of the San Giacomo theatre. This impressive tradition, invoking an exceptional musical past, continues to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mythology supporting the opera theatre of Corfu, reputed to be fixture on famous opera singers' working travel itineraries. Operatic performers who found success at the theatre were distinguished with the accolade applaudito in Corfu ("applauded in Corfu") as a tribute to the discriminating musical sensibility of the island's audience.|$|E
25|$|The Faceless Men {{believe that}} all the slave {{population}} of Valyria prayed for deliverance to the same god of death, in different incarnations. In Qohor, the Many-Faced God is called the Black Goat of Qohor; in Yi Ti, the Lion of Night and in the Faith of the Seven, the Stranger. This belief of a single god with many incarnations or 'faces' came to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Guild's House of Black and White, which contains a public shrine with idols of many death gods, including the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven. The worshipers of the Many-Faced God believe that death is a merciful end to suffering. God may grant a 'gift' of death to those worthy. In the Guild's temple, those who seek an end to suffering may drink from a poisonous fountain.|$|E

25|$|In Manet’s painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, {{observed}} by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene appears to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal {{structure of the}} painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet’s barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at {{the centre of the}} work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.|$|E
25|$|Based {{upon the}} 2001 census, Wolverhampton has a Christian {{population}} of 67.4% and non-Christian religions of 13.6% of people, compared with 5.5% for England and Wales. Wolverhampton has {{the fourth largest}} Sikh community in England and Wales. Sikhs accounting for 7.6% of Wolverhampton's population in 2001. Wolverhampton's Sikh Population rose to 9.1% in the 2011 census. The number of Hindus is also higher than the England and Wales average (Wolverhampton 3.9%, England and Wales 1.1%), while the proportion of people following Judaism and Islam was below the average for England and Wales. The figure for Buddhism {{is in line with}} the England and Wales average. The 2009 British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers Great Britain but not Northern Ireland, indicated that over 50% of the population would self classify as not religious at all and this should <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current general Wolverhampton population.|$|E
25|$|TMRCA {{calculations}} {{are considered}} critical evidence {{when attempting to}} determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide {{it can be concluded}} that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence. The issue is best illustrated in the debate surrounding the demic diffusion versus cultural diffusion during the European Neolithic.|$|E

500|$|Kenyon's {{blend of}} evangelical {{religion}} and mind-power beliefs—what he termed [...] "overcoming faith"—resonated {{with a small}} but influential segment of the Pentecostal movement. Pentecostals had always been committed to faith healing, and the movement also possessed a strong belief {{in the power of}} speech (in particular speaking in tongues {{and the use of the}} names of God, especially the name of Jesus). Kenyon's ideas would <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teachings of Pentecostal evangelists F. F. Bosworth and John G. Lake (who co-led a congregation with New Thought author Albert C.

The report concluded that “white privilege and power continues to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eurocentric curricula, traditional pedagogical approaches, hiring, promotion and tenure practices, and opportunities for research” at Queen’s.

His increasing tendencies would eventually start to isolate and alienate him from {{some of his own}} writers.

[...] The IPU was founded with an international scope, with a third of the members of parliaments (in the 24 countries that had parliaments) serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its foundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means. Annual conferences were established to help governments refine the process of international arbitration.

500|$|Several critics {{felt that}} {{events in the}} episode—particularly the terrorist-caused blackouts in major cities around the world, and the public relegitimization of S.H.I.E.L.D.—were {{problematic}} due to the series' connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Meslow felt it was questionable for the series to feature a crisis such as the blackouts, given they [...] "would surely {{attract the attention of}} at least one Avenger". Valentine felt that the S.H.I.E.L.D. announcement would fall alongside other events on the series that [...] "will never <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] movies ... it does sometimes make you aggravated when the series can go for such broad strokes to the universe without any mention in the movies themselves". Fitzpatrick concurred with Valentine, saying the announcement will [...] "never, ever be acknowledged by any other Marvel property." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{three main}} playable {{characters}} of Final Fantasy X-2 are Yuna, Rikku and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as [...] "YRP" [...] ("YuRiPa" [...] {{in the original}} Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from Final Fantasy X, and, though their personalities are {{much the same as}} before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Final Fantasy Xs world as they and others began trying to live positively would <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in Final Fantasy X-2, to accommodate the game's intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Her personality is far more cynical and emotionally distant than that of her teammates, and she keeps her past a secret from them for much of the game.|$|E
