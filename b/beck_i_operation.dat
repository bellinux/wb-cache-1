Beck possessed the freedom of hand and readiness, or rather rapidity of execution, for which Van Dyck was so remarkable, in so much that when Charles I observed the expeditious manner of Beck's painting, he exclaimed, [...] "Faith! <b>Beck,</b> <b>I</b> believe you could paint riding post" [...] and asked him to teach his sons drawing.|$|R
