5|$|Little <b>Butte</b> Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. Early settlers named Little <b>Butte</b> Creek and nearby Big <b>Butte</b> Creek after their proximity to Mount McLoughlin, which was known as Snowy <b>Butte.</b> In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and lumber production. The city of Eagle Point was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Popular {{recreational}} {{activities in the}} Big <b>Butte</b> Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Many tourists also come to sight-see. The most heavily used trail in the area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the Sky Lakes Wilderness, and ultimately the larger Pacific Crest Trail. The city of <b>Butte</b> Falls has organized the <b>Butte</b> Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long drive through the Rogue River– Siskiyou National Forest. The loop starts in <b>Butte</b> Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin.|$|E
5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big <b>Butte</b> Creek. They travel as far as <b>Butte</b> Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the <b>Butte</b> Creek waterfall, streams above <b>Butte</b> Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big <b>Butte</b> Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The Little <b>Butte</b> Creek {{area was}} {{originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribe of Native Americans. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the Eagle Point region in 1852. Little <b>Butte</b> Creek was named by the early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy <b>Butte),</b> as was nearby Big <b>Butte</b> Creek. Due to conflicts with the Rogue River Indians, Major J. A. Lupton gathered 35men from Jacksonville on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans {{near the mouth of}} Little <b>Butte</b> Creek, killing about 30 of them. Lupton was also killed, and eleven of his men were injured. On December 24 of the same year, Captain Miles Alcorn discovered and attacked a Native American camp on the north fork, killing eight. On Christmas the following day, another band of Native Americans were attacked near Little <b>Butte</b> Creek's mouth; some fled, while the rest were either captured or killed.|$|E

5|$|Big <b>Butte</b> Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy <b>Butte,</b> an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of <b>Butte</b> Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Big <b>Butte</b> Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big <b>Butte</b> Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy <b>Butte),</b> as was nearby Little <b>Butte</b> Creek.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Little <b>Butte</b> Creek Watershed Council {{rated the}} health of the Little <b>Butte</b> Creek {{watershed}} on a scale of 1 (slightly degraded) to 5 (severely degraded). Overall, the watershed received 2.95, or moderately degraded. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Little <b>Butte</b> Creek at RM 1.4 (RK 2.3) between 1998 and 2007 was 72 (poor) in the summer and 82 (fair) in the fall, winter, and spring.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} in Rock Springs was stabilized {{as early as}} September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly Finnish immigrants {{who were members of}} the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine <b>Butte,</b> established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot <b>Butte,</b> in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot <b>Butte</b> closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{marked the}} start of the Mesozoic and streams started to incise the newly dry land. Streams flowing through broad low valleys in Triassic time {{deposited}} sediment eroded from nearby uplands, creating the once -thick Moenkopi Formation.

Moenkopi outcrops are found along the Colorado River in Marble Canyon, on Cedar Mountain (a mesa near the southeastern park border), and in Red <b>Butte</b> (located south of Grand Canyon Village). Remnants of the Shinarump Conglomerate, itself a member of the Chinle Formation, are above the Moenkopi Formation near the top of Red <b>Butte</b> but below a much younger lava flow.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, American homesteaders began to settle in {{scattered}} sites around Glass <b>Buttes.</b> Most of the homesteaders arrived between 1910 and 1913. The only community in the area was Stauffer. It was located in the Lost Creek Valley, just south of Glass <b>Buttes.</b> The Stauffer post office was opened in 1913, but the community was never incorporated. Many of the settlers in Stauffer used logs from juniper trees cut on Glass <b>Buttes</b> to build their home. They also decorated their homes with obsidian gathers from sites around the <b>buttes.</b> By 1918, homesteads around Glass <b>Buttes</b> were being abandoned {{due to the lack}} of water for livestock. However, a small post office was maintained at Stauffer until 1950.|$|R
