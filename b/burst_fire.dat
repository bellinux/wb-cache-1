We now report that <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> is also potentiated by an apamin-like effect of bicuculline methiodide (BMI) {{at the same}} concentration (30 microM) which blocks GABA(A) receptors in vitro. Using microelectrodes to record intracellularly from rat dopamine neurons in the midbrain slice, BMI reduced the apamin-sensitive afterhyperpolarization in all cells tested.

Although picrotoxin (100 microM) and bicuculline free base (30 microM) blocked the inhibition of firing produced by the GABA(A) agonist isoguvacine (100 microM), neither had apamin-like effects.

We show {{for the first time}} with in vitro recording that <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> in thalamic relay cells of the monkey is evoked by activation of voltage-dependent, low threshold Ca 21 spikes (LTSs), as has been described in other mammals. Due to variations in LTS amplitude, the number of action potentials evoked by an LTS could vary between 1 and 8. These data confirm the presence of two modes of firing in the monkey for thalamic relay cells, tonic and burst, the latter related to the activation of LTSs. With these details of the cellular processes underlying <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> we could account for many of the firing patterns we recorded from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in behaving monkeys. In particular, we found clear evidence of <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> during alert wakefulness, which had been thought to occur only during sleep or certain pathological states.

MS-DB neurons {{were divided into}} three groups according to their action potential characteristics and firing properties. Slow firing neurons displayed a broad action potential followed by a prominent after-hyperpolarization. <b>Burst</b> <b>firing</b> neurons, when depolarized from hyperpolarized holding potentials, exhibited a high-frequency burst of spikes {{on the crest of}} a slow depolarizing potential. Fast firing neurons did not <b>fire</b> <b>bursts</b> of spikes when depolarized from hyperpolarized holding potentials. Eighteen MS-DB neurons were identified as septohippocampal by antidromic activation. Of the septohippocampal neurons, four were slow firing neurons, five were <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> neurons and nine were fast firing neurons. The mean axon conduction velocities of these neurons fell into two significant groups, termed slow conducting and fast conducting. Slow firing septohippocampal neurons had significantly slower conduction velocities than either fast <b>firing</b> or <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> neurons (P < 0. 05), being 0. 7 ± 0. 5 ms− 1 for slow firing neurons and 2. 9 ± 2. 0 and 2. 0 ± 1. 4 ms− 1 for <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> and fast firing neurons, respectively.

A particularly relevant pattern for neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity is <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> the generation of clusters of action potentials with short interspike intervals. Besides ion-channel composition, dendritic morphology appears to be an important factor modulating firing pattern. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the impact of morphology on <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> remains insufficiently known. Dendritic morphology is not fixed but can undergo significant changes in many pathological conditions. Using computational models of neocortical pyramidal cells, we here show that not only the total length of the apical dendrite but also the topological structure of its branching pattern markedly influences inter- and intraburst spike intervals and even determines whether or not a cell exhibits <b>burst</b> <b>firing.</b> We found that there is only a range of dendritic sizes that supports <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> and that this range is modulated by dendritic topology.

Based upon repetitive firing properties and subthreshold membrane characteristics, layer 5 pyramidal neurons were separated into three classes: regular firing and weak and strong intrinsically <b>burst</b> <b>firing.</b> High frequency (330 ± 10 Hz) action potential <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> was abolished or greatly weakened by the removal of Ca 2 + (n = 5) from, or {{by the addition of}} the Ca 2 + channel antagonist Ni 2 + (250 – 500 μm; n = 8) to, the perfusion medium. The blockade of apical dendritic sodium channels by the local dendritic application of TTX (100 nm; n = 5) abolished or greatly weakened action potential <b>burst</b> <b>firing,</b> as did the local apical dendritic application of Ni 2 + (1 mm; n = 5). Apical dendritic depolarisation resulted in low frequency (157 ± 26 Hz; n = 6) action potential <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> in regular firing neurons, as classified by somatic current injection. The intensity of action potential burst discharges in intrinsically <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> neurons was facilitated by dendritic depolarisation (n = 11). Action potential amplitude decreased throughout a burst when recorded somatically, suggesting that later action potentials may fail to propagate axonally. Axonal recordings demonstrated that each action potential in a burst is axonally initiated and that no decrement in action potential amplitude is apparent in the axon > 30 μm from the soma. Paired recordings (n = 16) from synaptically coupled neurons indicated that each action potential in a burst could cause transmitter release. EPSPs or EPSCs evoked by a presynaptic burst of action potentials showed use-dependent synaptic depression. A postsynaptic, TTX-sensitive voltage-dependent amplification process ensured that later EPSPs in a burst were amplified when generated from membrane potentials positive to - 60 mV, providing a postsynaptic mechanism that counteracts use-dependent depression at synapses between layer 5 pyramidal neurons...|$|R

Dopamine neurons from food-restricted mice exhibited increased <b>burst</b> <b>firing</b> in vivo, an effect that was enhanced by an injection of the psychomotor stimulant cocaine (10 mg/kg, i. p.).
