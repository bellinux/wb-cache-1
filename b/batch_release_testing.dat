40|$|Current <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>testing</b> of {{established}} vaccines emphasizes quality {{control of the}} final product and is often characterized by extensive use of animals. This report summarises the discussions of a joint ECVAM/EPAA workshop on {{the applicability of the}} consistency approach for routine release of human and veterinary vaccines and its potential to reduce animal use. The consistency approach is based upon thorough characterisation of the vaccine during development and the principle that the quality of subsequent batches is the consequence of the strict application of a quality system and of a consistent production of batches. The concept of consistency of production is state-of-the-art for new generation vaccines, where batch release is mainly based on non-animal methods. There is now the opportunity to introduce the approach into established vaccine production, where {{it has the potential to}} replace in vivo tests with non-animal tests designed to demonstrate batch quality while maintaining the highest quality standards.

40|$|AbstractBiologics {{are usually}} {{produced}} from live organisms, and {{the manufacturing process}} often involves a degree of natural variability. Characterization of biologics such as vaccines is inherently difficult due to the complex molecular structure of the antigens they contain {{and the presence of}} excipients such as preservatives and adjuvants that can interfere with testing. Therefore, each batch, lot, or serial produced must be tested before market release to ensure that the product complies with regulatory standards. This <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>testing</b> emphasizes quality control of the final product and may be characterized by an extensive use of laboratory animals. The consistency approach is based upon the principle that the quality of a biologic {{is the result of the}} strict application of a quality system and consistent production. Subsequent batches are determined to be similar to clinically evaluated batches and therefore acceptable for release through the in-process testing that comprises this quality system. The European Centre for Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) organized international workshops in 2006 and 2010 to discuss the consistency approach and its potential to reduce the number of animals used in testing of biological products. This paper provides an overview of these workshops...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal in the {{induction}} of adaptive immune responses {{because they can}} activate naive T-cells. Moreover, they steer these adap-tive immune responses by integrating various stimuli, such as from different pathogen associated molecular patterns and the cytokine milieu. Immature DC are very well capable of ingesting protein antigens, whereas mature DC are effi-cient presenters of peptides to naive T cells. Human DC can be readily cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are isolated from human blood. There is a strong need to moni-tor in a high-throughput fashion the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines {{during the process of}} vaccine develop-ment. Furthermore, regulators require efficacy and safety testing for batch release. For some vaccines, these tests require animal testing, causing pain and discomfort, which cannot be contested because it would interfere with the test results. With the aims of promoting vac-cine development and reducing the num-ber of animals for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>testing,</b> we propose to use more broadly human DC for vaccine immunogenicity testing. In this commentary, this proposition is illustrated by several examples in which the maturation of human DC was suc-cessfully used to test for vaccine and adjuvant immunogenicity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractManufacturers of {{veterinary}} vaccines frequently incorporate animal-based <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety <b>tests</b> into their quality assurance monitoring protocols {{to meet their}} internal quality standards and to conform to government regulatory requirements. These tests are conducted by vaccinating target species animals or laboratory animals with a single dose or multiple doses of the test batch, and observing the vaccinated animals for signs of local or systemic adverse reactions. Manufacturers, standard-setting bodies, animal welfare advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies are actively investigating alternative methods to reduce their reliance on animal-based methods for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety <b>testing.</b> Approaches which have been implemented or proposed include harmonizing technical requirements, developing in vitro tests, refining the existing animal tests, improving adverse reaction monitoring (vaccinovigilance), and improving manufacturing methods and quality controls to reduce batch-to-batch variability. An approach, known as the consistency approach, is increasingly being acknowledged as a potentially viable alternative to animal-based <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>tests</b> for vaccines. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} currently utilized <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety <b>tests</b> for veterinary vaccines, the associated regulatory requirements, and some potentially acceptable alternative approaches for reducing, refining, and replacing the use of animals in these tests...|$|R
40|$|Polyclonal and {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{are often}} used in regulatory testing of biologicals (vaccines and related prod-ucts). One {{of the most common}} applications for antibody-based immunoassays is as a <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>tests,</b> whether they measure serological responses to vacci-nation or they quantify individual antigens by in vitro meth-ods, must provide an acceptable estimate of potency of an individual batch of vaccine. Thus, due consideration must be given to the type of antibody used or quantified in such assays. Differences in specificity and avidity may affect the utility of an assay as an indicator of potency; case examples are given to illustrate these concepts. Concerns associated with antigen quantification assays (e. g., reagent denatur-ation upon binding to solid substrates, and interference from nontarget antigens or additives in a complex vaccine) are also discussed. International efforts to harmonize test meth-ods in recent years have increased the importance of estab-lishing standardized antibodies. Sources of such antibodies and issues associated with the ongoing availability of anti-body supplies are described.

A WHO workshop was organised to facilitate implementation into African (national/regional) regulatory practices, of the regulatory evaluation principles outlined in the guidelines regarding quality aspects. The workshop was used also to share knowledge and experience on regulatory topics of chemistry, manufacturing and control {{with a focus on}} vaccines through presentations and an interactive discussion using a case study approach. The basic principles and concepts of vaccine quality including consistency of production, quality control and manufacturing process were presented and discussed in the meeting. By reviewing and practicing a case study, better understanding on the relationship between consistency of production and <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>tests</b> of an adjuvanted pre-erythrocytic recombinant malaria vaccine was reached.

40|$|Safety and potency {{assessment}} for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>testing</b> of established vaccines still relies partly on animal tests. An important avenue {{to move to}} batch release without animal testing is the consistency approach. This approach is based on thorough characterization of the vaccine, and the principle {{that the quality of}} subsequent batches is the consequence of the application of consistent production of batches monitored by a GMP quality system. Efforts to implement the consistency approach are supported by several drivers from industry, government, and research, but there are also several barriers that must be overcome. A workshop entitled "Consistency Approach, Drivers and Barriers" was organized, which aimed to discuss and identify drivers and barriers for the implementation of the 3 Rs in the consistency approach from three different perspectives/domains (industry, regulatory and science frameworks). The workshop contributed {{to a better understanding of}} these drivers and barriers and resulted in recommendations to improve the overall regulatory processes for the consistency approach. With this report, we summarise the outcome of this workshop and intend to offer a constructive contribution to the international discussion on regulatory acceptance of the consistency approach...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to slow {{crack growth}} is an {{important}} material property of polyethylene especially for pipe applications. Slow crack growth resistance of polyethylene pipes and materials is usually assessed by tedious and time consuming testing methods (e. g. NPT, FNCT, PENT, ESCR etc.) performed on notched samples in contact with specific fluids at elevated temperatures. In this paper we present a new test method to predict slow crack growth resistance in materials in a much simpler, more accurate and faster way. It will be shown that resistance to slow crack growth in polyethylene can be predicted from a simple tensile strain hardening measurement at 80 °C. It is shown that for bimodal polyethylene materials for pipe applications {{the slope of the}} stress-strain curve above its natural draw ratio (i. e. strain hardening) correlates well with the measured stress crack resistance via traditional methods. The rationale behind this correlation is provided by the Kramer-Brown model for craze propagation and craze-crack transition where the most important intrinsic material parameter that is governing propagation and failure of crazes is the density of the network of effective entanglements which can in a straightforward way be assessed by measuring the amount of strain hardening This technique offers a relatively easy way of predicting slow crack growth resistance in materials without using surfactants. The presented test method shows very low standard deviation and furthermore, measuring times are dramatically reduced in comparison to traditional methods from thousands of hours to only a few. This accelerated test method is suitable for small sample sizes for R&D purposes and also is suitable as a <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> <b>test</b> for both resin suppliers and pipe converters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{quality and}} safety of {{advanced}} therapy products must be maintained throughout their production and quality control cycle to ensure their final use in patients. We validated the cell count method according to the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and European Pharmacopoeia, considering the tests’ accuracy, precision, repeatability, linearity and range. Methods As the cell count is a potency test, we checked accuracy, precision, and linearity, according to ICH Q 2. Briefly our experimental approach was first to evaluate the accuracy of Fast Read 102 ® compared to the Bürker chamber. Once {{the accuracy of the}} alternative method was demonstrated, we checked the precision and linearity test only using Fast Read 102 ®. The data were statistically analyzed by average, standard deviation and coefficient of variation percentages inter and intra operator. Results All the tests performed met the established acceptance criteria of a coefficient of variation of less than ten percent. For the cell count, the precision reached by each operator had a coefficient of variation of less than ten percent (total cells) and under five percent (viable cells). The best range of dilution, to obtain a slope line value very similar to 1, was between 1 : 8 and 1 : 128. Conclusions Our data demonstrated that the Fast Read 102 ® count method is accurate, precise and ensures the linearity of the results obtained in a range of cell dilution. Under our standard method procedures, this assay may thus be considered a good quality control method for the cell count as a <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> quality control <b>test.</b> Moreover, the Fast Read 102 ® chamber is a plastic, disposable device that allows a number of samples to be counted in the same chamber. Last but not least, it overcomes the problem of chamber washing after use and so allows a cell count in a clean environment such as that in a Cell Factory. In a good manufacturing practice setting the disposable cell counting devices will allow a single use of the count chamber they can then be thrown away, thus avoiding the waste disposal of vital dye (e. g.

All the tested LDH-herbicide complexes displayed similar slow herbicide release properties in water, although the IE method seemed {{to result in}} complexes with a greater fraction of herbicide in a readily available form.

This was attributed to the replacement of the intercalated herbicide by carbonate and hydroxyl anions from the aqueous solution. Compared to the free herbicides, the application of the three LDH-herbicide complexes (RE) to soil columns resulted in reduction in the maximum herbicide concentration in leachates and led to the retardation of herbicide leaching through the soil. All LDH-herbicide complexes presented an herbicidal efficacy similar to that of the free (technical) herbicides. Our results indicated the potential applicability of LDHs as supports for the preparation of slow release formulations of acid herbicides such as 2, 4 -D, MCPA, or picloram. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
