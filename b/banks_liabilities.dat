Consequently, banks obtain higher profits from more captured borrowers than from borrowers with financing alternatives. We refer to this as a “flight to captivity” effect. Negative shocks, associated with monetary contractions or foreign entry, cause a reallocation of bank credit away from more transparent borrowers and toward more opaque, more captured borrowers.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} modern {{readers to}} the basic understanding of the banking system that was held by academics and practitioners {{in the early years}} of the 20 th century – that is, to traditional banking theory. This theory is completely inconsistent with the theoretic framework that views banks as financial intermediaries that receive deposits and invest those deposits in assets. Thus, this paper first sets forth in detail the basic elements of traditional banking theory and then relates those elements to the modern network effects literature. From this a bank-centered view of the money market is derived: all demand and short-term <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities,</b> including contingent liabilities, are potential money and nearmoney assets, and any non-bank liabilities that have monetary properties will derive them from their relationship with the banking system. This framework is then used to evaluate modern money markets, and this paper finds that indeed the so-called market-based money market in fact functions as a means of reallocating the <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> held (indirectly) by the public from deposits to wholesale and contingent <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities.</b> This paper proposes that bank liability-based measures of the money supply be developed, and that regulators recognize that contingent <b>bank</b> <b>liabilities</b> often function as a substitute for deposits and should be regulated similarly...|$|R

This paper assesses empirically the relevance of these factors relative to alternative explanations. Based on a sample of Latin American countries, we find that ongoing central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market, relative market power of borrowers, and financial penetration are at least as important in explaining DL.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the importance of}} various channels of financial contagion across countries. This paper first presents stylized facts of international banking activities during the crisis. It then describes a simple model of financial contagion based on bank balance sheet identities and behavioral assumptions of deleveraging. Cascade effects can be triggered by bank losses or contractions of interbank lending activities. As a result of shocks on assets or on liabilities of banks, a global deleveraging of international banking activities can occur. Simple simulations are presented to illustrate {{the use of the}} model and the relative importance of contagion channels, relying on bank losses of advanced countries’ banking systems during the {{financial crisis}} to calibrate the shock. The outcome of the simulations is compared with the deleveraging observed during the crisis suggesting that leverage is a major determinant of financial contagion.
