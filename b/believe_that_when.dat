5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E

Some may <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. If a man solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.|$|E
25|$|Many of the limpkin's names {{across its}} range are onomatopoeic and reflect the bird's call; for example carau in Argentina, carrao in Venezuela and guareáo in Cuba. The species {{also has a}} range of common names that refer to its call, for example lamenting bird, or to its {{supposed}} gait, crippled bird.

The three are each gifted fighters and fight each other over the {{smallest}} of matters. Both their parents <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the King dies, the sons will fight each other for control of the kingdom.

Nuers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{a man or a woman}} dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.".|$|E
25|$|Dysplastic nevus (nevus of Clark): {{usually a}} {{compound}} nevus with cellular and architectural dysplasia. Like typical moles, dysplastic nevi can be flat or raised. While they vary in size, dysplastic nevi are typically larger than normal moles {{and tend to}} have irregular borders and irregular coloration. Hence, they resemble melanoma, appear worrisome, and are often removed to clarify the diagnosis. Dysplastic nevi are markers of risk when they are numerous (atypical mole syndrome). According to the National Cancer Institute (NIH), doctors <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> {{part of a series}} or syndrome of multiple moles, dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to develop into the most virulent type of skin cancer called melanoma.|$|E
25|$|According to the Ahmadi Muslim view, {{the fourth}} {{article of faith}} in Islam is {{concerned}} with the belief in all divine prophets sent by God. Ahmadi Muslims <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the world is filled with unrighteousness and immorality, or when a specific part of the world displays these attributes, or when the followers of a certain law (religion) become corrupt or incorporate corrupted teachings into the faith, thus making the faith obsolete or in need of a Divine Sustainer, then a Prophet of God is sent to re-establish His Divine Will. Aside from the belief in all prophets in the Quran and the Old Testament, the Community also regards Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, Confucius as prophets.|$|E

25|$|However, some Hindus <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the emanations of the Supreme Being are pratyaksha, or {{obvious to}} the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna {{was such an}} {{embodiment}} and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.|$|E
25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church {{have come to understand}} Zion as primarily a community way of life that is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E

However, the actions of many modern Christian leaders, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, who visited the Wall and left prayer messages in its crevices, have symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site.|$|E

500|$|Form and Fuller {{recognized}} the iconic {{status of the}} music used {{in the first four}} Friday the 13th films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> you watch a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next to you with the London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E

2500|$|Orthodox Christians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{a person}} dies {{the soul is}} {{temporarily}} separated from the body. Though it may linger {{for a short period}} on Earth, it is ultimately escorted either to paradise (Abraham's bosom) or the darkness of Hades, following the Temporary Judgment. Orthodox do not accept the doctrine of Purgatory, which is held by Roman Catholicism. The soul’s experience of either of these states is only a [...] "foretaste"—being experienced only by the soul—until the Final Judgment, when the soul and body will be reunited.|$|E
2500|$|In most sun dance cultures, it is {{forbidden}} to film ceremony or prayer. Few images exist of authentic ceremonies. Many First Nations people <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> money or cameras enter, the spirits leave, so no photo conveys an authentic ceremony. But the Kainai Nation in Alberta permitted filming of their sun {{dance in the}} late 1950s. This was released as the documentary Circle of the Sun (1960), produced by the National Film Board of Canada [...] Manitoba archival photos show that the ceremonies have been consistently practiced {{since at least the}} early 1900s.|$|E
