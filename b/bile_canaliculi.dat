50|$|Bile canaliculus (plural:bile canaliculi; {{also called}} bile capillaries) {{is a thin}} tube that {{collects}} bile secreted by hepatocytes. The <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> merge and form bile ductules, which eventually become common hepatic duct.|$|E
50|$|Hepatocytes are {{polyhedral}} in shape, therefore {{having no}} set shape or design. They have surfaces facing the sinusoids, (called sinusoidal faces) and surfaces which contact other hepatocytes, (called lateral faces). <b>Bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> are formed by grooves {{on some of}} the lateral faces of these hepatocytes.|$|E
5000|$|Plentiful canalicular {{multiple}} drug-resistant protein causes bilirubin {{transfer to}} <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> An isoform of this protein is localized to the apical hepatocyte membrane, allowing transport of glucuronide and glutathione conjugates {{back into the}} blood. High levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) help in diagnosing pathologies involving biliary obstruction.|$|E
5000|$|The path is as follows: <b>Bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> → Canals of Hering → interlobular bile ducts → {{intrahepatic}} bile ducts → {{left and}} right hepatic ducts merge to form → common hepatic duct exits liver and joins → cystic duct (from gall bladder) forming → common bile duct → joins with pancreatic duct → forming ampulla of Vater → enters duodenum ...|$|E
50|$|The unconjugated {{bilirubin}} still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated {{in the usual}} way. This conjugated bilirubin is {{then returned to the}} blood, probably by rupture of the congested <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> and direct emptying of the bile into the lymph leaving the liver. Thus, most of the bilirubin in the plasma becomes the conjugated type rather than the unconjugated type, and this conjugated bilirubin which did not go to intestine to become urobilinogen gives the urine the dark color.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{has been}} damaged and {{is unable to}} {{adequately}} metabolize fat. Small vacuoles of fat accumulate and become dispersed within cytoplasm. Mild fatty change may {{have no effect on}} cell function; however more severe fatty change can impair cellular function. In the liver, the enlargement of hepatocytes due to fatty change may compress adjacent <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi,</b> leading to cholestasis. Depending on the cause and severity of the lipid accumulation, fatty change is generally reversible. Fatty Change is also known as fatty degeneration, fatty metamorphosis, or fatty steatosis.|$|E
50|$|After {{migration}} of hepatoblasts into the septum transversum mesenchyme, the hepatic architecture begins to be established, with liver sinusoids and <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> appearing. The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left umbilical vein becomes the ductus venosus {{and the right}} vitelline vein becomes the portal vein. The expanding liver bud is colonized by hematopoietic cells. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant glycogen accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a liver lobule dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. WNT/β-catenin has now been identified to be playing {{a key role in}} this phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme is {{distributed}} in {{cells of the}} gastrointestinal tracts, lymphoid tissues, blood cells, urinary organs and microglia. Its intracellular localization in different mammalian cells is different to that of its analog Cathepsin D. Cathepsin E associates with the membrane tissue in the intracellular canaliculi of gastric parietal cells, <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> of hepatic cells, cells of the rinal proximal tubule in the kidney, epithelial cells in the intestine, trachea and bronchi, osteoclasts and even in erythrocytes. Its localization in the endosome structures {{can be seen in}} many different cell types such as antigen-presenting B cell lymphoblasts, gastric cells and microglia. Its presence is also detected in the cisternae of the cell’s endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
50|$|Bile is {{secreted}} by {{the liver}} {{to aid in}} the digestion of fats. Bile formation begins in <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> that form between two adjacent surfaces of liver cells (hepatocytes) similar to the terminal branches of a tree. The canaliculi join each other to form larger and larger structures, sometimes referred to as the Canals of Hering, which themselves join to form small bile ductules that have an epithelial surface. The ductules join to form bile ducts that eventually form either the right main hepatic duct that drains the right lobe of the liver, or the left main hepatic duct draining the left lobe of the liver. The two ducts join to form the common hepatic duct, which in turn joins the cystic duct from the gall bladder, to give the common bile duct. This duct then enters the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater.|$|E
50|$|The biliary tract {{is derived}} from the {{branches}} of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to {{the first part of the}} small intestine, the duodenum. The bile produced in the liver is collected in <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi,</b> small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which exit the liver at the transverse fissure, and merge to form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.|$|E
40|$|Phalloidin, a toxin {{from the}} plant Amanita phalloides, irreversibly polymerizes actin {{filaments}} and causes cholestasis. Three-dimensional structural changes induced by phalloidin in the <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> and the intra-acinar localization of these changes were studied in the rat liver by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. After 3 days of treatment, canalicular changes appeared mainly in zones 2 and 3 of Rappaport's acinus, but after 7 days of treatment changes occurred in <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> of the whole acinus. The changes in the <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> included tortuosity, saccular dilatation, loss of microvilli, bleb formation and elongation of canalicular side branches. Some side branches extended near to Disse's space, leaving only a thin cytoplasmic rim between the canalicular lumen and Disse's space. Kupffer cells were occasionally situated near such extended <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> and protruded their processes into the hepatic cord. These results suggest that <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> in zone 3 {{are more susceptible to}} phalloidin toxicity than those in zone 1 and that biliary constituents may leak from such altered <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Many {{substances}} are hepatotoxic due {{to their}} ability to cause intrahepatic cholestasis. Therefore, there is a high demand for in vitro systems for the identification of cholestatic properties of new compounds. Primary hepatocytes cultivated in collagen sandwich cultures are known to establish <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> which enclose secreted biliary components. Cholestatic compounds are mainly known to inhibit bile excretion dynamics, but may also alter canalicular volume, or hepatocellular morphology. So far, techniques to assess time-resolved morphological changes of <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> in sandwich cultures are not available. In this study, we developed an automated system that quantifies dynamics of <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> recorded in conventional time-lapse image sequences. We validated the hepatocyte sandwich culture system as an appropriate model to study <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> in vitro by showing structural similarity measured as <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> length per hepatocyte to that observed in vivo. Moreover, bile canalicular excretion kinetics of CMFDA (5 -chloromethylfluorescein diacetate) in sandwich cultures resembled closely the kinetics observed in vivo. The developed quantification technique enabled the quantification of dynamic changes in individual <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> With this technique, we were able to clearly distinguish between sandwich cultures supplemented with dexamethasone and insulin from control cultures. In conclusion, the automated quantification system offers the possibility to systematically study the causal relationship between disturbed bile canalicular dynamics and cholestasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to reveal the {{morphological}} changes in the cellular surfaces of rat hepatic cells during restorative proliferation after a two-third partial hepatectomy. Male rats of Wistar strain weighing 150 to 200 g were subjected to two-third partial hepatectomy, and after periods of from 3 hours to 4 weeks after the operation, the livers were fixed by a perfusion method for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. During the early phase (3 - 6 hours) after the partial hepatectomy, the lateral surfaces of hepatocytes became rough due to a marked increase in microvilli and invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane. The <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> had enormously elongated microvilli. During the intermediated phase (24 - 36 hours) after the operation, the lateral surfaces became smooth, and the <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> showed branching, dilatation and diverticulation. Mitotic hepatocytes, which, were identified by their characteristic spherical shape, were separated from the neighbouring hepatocytes by wide intercellular spaces but they normally contained tight junctions around the <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> The <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> of the mitotic hepatocytes showed obvious continuity to those of the neighbouring hepatocytes. During the late phase (48 - 72 hours), the hepatic plates became wavy and multiple-cell thick. Most of these changes were normalized by one week after the operation, although the <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> still showed slight branching.

40|$|Following the {{injection}} of hepatobiliary contrast agents, MRI detects all molecules {{included in a}} region of interest but cannot estimate true concentrations in sinusoids, interstitium, hepatocytes or <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to measure true concentrations in hepatocytes and to show how transfer rates across sinusoidal and canalicular membranes generate these concentrations. We perfused livers isolated from normal rats with 200 [*]μM Gd-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA and measured clearances from sinusoids to liver and from hepatocytes to <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> or back to interstitium. We detected Gd-BOPTA with a gamma probe and determined true concentrations in each liver compartment knowing their liver volumes. No pharmacokinetic modelling was applied. Gd-BOPTA clearance from sinusoids to liver (2. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 4 [*]mL/min) was 50 times higher than that of Gd-DTPA (0. 05 [*]±[*] 0. 02 [*]mL/min) when portal flow rate was 30 [*]mL/min (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Gd-BOPTA clearance from sinusoids to liver was always superior to hepatocyte clearance, and hepatocyte Gd-BOPTA concentrations measured by the probe increased over time.

40|$|International audienceIntrahepatic {{cholestasis}} represents 20 %- 40 %of drug-induced {{injuries from}} which a large proportion remains unpredictable. We aimed to investigate mechanisms underlying drug-induced cholestasis and improve its early detection using human HepaRG cells {{and a set of}} 12 cholestatic drugs and six noncholestatic drugs. In this study, we analyzed <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> dynamics, Rho kinase (ROCK) /myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway implication, efflux inhibition of taurocholate [a predominant bile salt export pump (BSEP) substrate], and expression of the major canalicular and basolateral bile acid transporters. We demonstrated that 12 cholestatic drugs classified on the basis of reported clinical findings caused disturbances of both <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> dynamics, characterized by either dilatation or constriction, and alteration of the ROCK/MLCK signaling pathway, whereas noncholestatic compounds, by contrast, had no effect. Cotreatment with ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 [4 -(1 -aminoethyl) -N-(4 -pyridyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride] and MLCK activator calmodulin reduced <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> constriction and dilatation, respectively, confirming the role of these pathways in drug-induced intrahepatic cholestasis. By contrast, inhibition of taurocholate efflux and/or human BSEP overexpressed in membrane vesicles was not observed with all cholestatic drugs; moreover, examples of noncholestatic compounds were reportedly found to inhibit BSEP. Transcripts levels of major bile acid transporters were determined after 24 -hour treatment. BSEP, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, and organic anion transporting polypeptide B were downregulated with most cholestatic and some noncholestatic drugs, whereas deregulation of multidrug resistance-associated proteins was more variable, probably mainly reflecting secondary effects. Together, our results show that cholestatic drugs consistently cause an early alteration of <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> dynamics associated with modulation of ROCK/MLCK and these changes are more specific than efflux inhibition measurements alone as predictive nonclinical markers of drug-induced cholestasis.

40|$|Gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) is a commercialised {{hepatobiliary}} {{contrast agent}} used during liver {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) to detect liver diseases. It enters into human hepatocytes through organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP 1 B 1 /B 3) and crosses the canalicular transporter multiple resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP 2) to be excreted into <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi.</b> Gd-BOPTA can return to sinusoids via the sinusoidal transporters MRP 3 /MRP 4. Hepatocyte concentrations of Gd-BOPTA depend on three clearances: the sinusoidal clearance or volume of sinusoidal blood cleared of drugs per unit of time and two hepatocyte clearances (into <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> or back to sinusoids) or volume of hepatocytes cleared of drugs per unit {{of time in the}} respective liver compartments. The present study investigates whether changing liver blood flow modifies hepatocyte concentrations when plasma concentrations do not change. We perfused normal rat livers at various portal flow rates (24, 30, and 36  ml/min) with 200  µM Gd-BOPTA and measured sinusoidal clearances, hepatocyte clearances, and hepatocyte concentrations of Gd-BOPTA. We showed that varying portal flow rates changes the sinusoidal clearance of Gd-BOPTA despite its low extraction ratio. Portal flow rates do not modify Gd-BOPTA clearance from hepatocytes into <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> but can change hepatocyte clearance back to sinusoids. At a given perfused concentration, portal flow rates modify Gd-BOPTA hepatocyte concentrations, a result important to consider when interpreting liver imaging...|$|E

Pretreatment of female Wistar rats with phenobarbitone, SKF 525 A or carbon disulphide failed to alter the toxicity of reduced lantadene A but when female rats were pretreated with spironolactone there was a marked increase in the severity of toxicity. Male rats which are normally resistant to the toxicity of reduced lantadene A were still resistant after pretreatment with spironolactone. In other experiments rats were sacrificed at various times after dosing with reduced lantadene A and liver plasma membrane fractions enriched in <b>bile</b> <b>canaliculi</b> were prepared for estimation of the activities of 52 ̆ 7 -nucleotidase and Mg 2 +-ATPase.
