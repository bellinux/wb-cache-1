60|$|Marco {{was so much}} {{accustomed}} to the idea which sailors attach to the word toss, and to {{the manner in which}} they perform the evolution, that he forgot how many different ways there might be of tossing up an oar. The proper way is, when the command is given, for each oarsman to raise the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> his <b>oar</b> quick, but gently, into the air, letting the end of the handle rest upon the thwart. It is then in a position to be let down into the water conveniently when the next order, which is, Let fall, is given.|$|R
60|$|Just as the brig's {{boat had}} been swung out, ready for lowering, the yacht's gig hauled up by its line {{appeared}} tossing and splashing {{on the lee}} quarter. Carter stood up in the stern sheets balancing himself cleverly to the disordered motion of his cockleshell. He hailed the brig twice {{to know what was}} the matter, not being able from below and in the darkness to make out what that confused group of men on the poop were about. He got no answer, though he could see the shape of a man standing by himself aft, and apparently watching him. He was going to repeat his hail for the third time when he heard the rattling of tackles followed by a heavy splash, a burst of voices, scrambling hollow sounds--and a dark mass detaching itself from the brig's side swept past him on the crest of a passing wave. For less than a second he could see on the shimmer of the night sky the shape of a boat, the heads <b>of</b> men, the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>oars</b> pointing upward while being got out hurriedly. Then all this sank out of sight, reappeared once more far off and hardly discernible, before vanishing for good.|$|R

But {{the word}} 'petalos' is {{connected}} in Greek with another word, meaning, to fly,--so {{that you may}} think of a bird as spreading its petals to the wind; and with another, signifying Fate in its pursuing flight, the overtaking thing, or overflying Fate. Finally, there is another Greek word meaning 'wide,' [Greek: platus] (platys); whence at last our 'plate'--a thing made broad or extended--but especially made broad or 'flat' out of the solid, as in a lump of clay extended on the wheel, or a lump of metal extended by the hammer. So the first we call Platter; the second Plate, when of the precious metals.

2500|$|During the Middle Ages spathula {{was used}} to refer to the {{shoulder}} blade. Spathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad, two-edged sword without a point, broad, flat, wooden instrument for stirring any liquid, a spattle, spatula [...] or spathe of the palm tree [...] and its diminutive used in classical and late Latin for referring to a leg of pork [...] or a little palmbranch. The English word spatula is actually derived from Latin spatula, an orthographic variant of spathula. Oddly enough, classical Latin non-diminutive spatha can be translated as English spatula, while its Latin diminutive spatula is not translated as English spatula. Latin spatha is derived from ancient Greek σπάθη. Therefore, the form spathula is more akin to its origin than spatula. Ancient Greek σπάθη has a similar meaning as Latin spatha, as any broad blade, and can also refer to a spatula or to the broad <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> a sword., but also to the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> an <b>oar.</b> The aforementioned πλάται for shoulder blades was also used for <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> an <b>oar.</b> Concordantly σπάθη was also {{used to refer to}} the shoulder blade. Interestingly, the English word spade, as well as the Dutch equivalent spade [...] is cognate with σπάθη. Please notice, that the aforementioned term pala as applied by Roman physician Caelius Aurelianus, also means spade. Pala is probably related to the Latin verb pandere, to spread out, [...] and to extend. This verb is thought to be derived from an earlier form spandere, with the root spa-. Σπάθη is actually derived from the similar root spē(i), that means to extend. It seems that os latum scapularum, ὠμοπλάτη, πλάται, pala, spathula and σπάθη all refer to the same aspect <b>of</b> the shoulder <b>blade,</b> i.e. being a flat, broad blade, with the latter three words etymological related to each other.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the same}} slow and {{cautious}} manner, Forester taught {{the boys to}} let the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> their <b>oars</b> fall gently into the water, at the command, [...] "Let fall." [...] He taught one at a time, as before, each boy dropping the blades {{into the water and}} letting the middle <b>of</b> the <b>oar</b> come into the row-lock, while he held the handle in his hands ready to row. Then, without letting them row any, he ordered them to toss again; that is, to raise the <b>oars</b> out <b>of</b> the water and hold them in the air, {{with the end of the}} handle resting upon the thwart. He drilled them in this exercise for some time, until they could go through it with ease, regularity, and dispatch. He then gave the order, [...] "Crew at ease," [...] and let the boys rest themselves and enjoy conversation.|$|R
25|$|The basic {{philosophy}} of Courtney stroke {{is to keep}} the oars (sculls or sweep) in the water as long as possible and in the air as short as possible. To do this, Courtney taught his rowers to sharply lower the hands to the lap when the preceding stroke is finished. This forced the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oar</b> out <b>of</b> the water perpendicular to the surface. Then he required his rowers to quickly shoot their arms forward moving the blade back to start another stroke. He emphasized that the blade should be {{as close as possible to}} the water. He wanted the blade to enter the water at slight inclined to the surface of the water to allow it to enter cleanly. Once the blade entered the water, he taught his rowers to immediately start the stroke. During the stroke he wanted the blade to always be covered but not sunk too deep.|$|R
60|$|Now {{although}} {{this group of}} arts nearly always involves the putting {{of two or more}} separate pieces together, we must not define it by that accident. The <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> an <b>oar</b> is not less formed with reference to external force than if it were made of many pieces; and the frame of a boat, whether hollowed out of a tree-trunk, or constructed of planks nailed together, is essentially the same piece of art; to be judged by its buoyancy and capacity of progression. Still, from the most wonderful piece of all architecture, the human skeleton, to this simple one,[107] the ploughshare, on which it depends for its subsistence, the putting of two or more pieces together is curiously necessary to the perfectness of every fine instrument; and the peculiar mechanical work of Dædalus,--inlaying,--becomes all the more delightful to us in external aspect, because, as in the jawbone of a Saurian, or the wood of a bow, it is essential to the finest capacities of tension and resistance.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{the voice}} spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers of sharks, {{seemingly}} rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oars,</b> {{every time they}} dipped in the water; {{and in this way}} accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks-- a matter sometimes well known to affect them,--however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.|$|R
60|$|It {{would not}} be easy to imagine a more dreary scene than that in which Deacon Pratt's {{schooner}} moved out into the waters that separated the different islands of this remote and sterile group. Roswell could just discern the frowning mass of the rocks that crowned the centre of Sealer's Land; and that was soon lost in the increasing obscurity. The cold was getting to be severe, and the men soon complained that ice was forming on the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> their <b>oars.</b> Then it was that a thought occurred to our young mariner, which had hitherto escaped him. Of what use would it be for his vessel to be beyond the ice, if that of Daggett should be shut in the succeeding day? So sensible did he become to the importance of this idea, that he called in his boat, and pulled back into the cove, in order to make one more effort to persuade Daggett to follow him out.|$|R
2500|$|Cornell {{moved to}} the semifinals of the Grand {{challenge}} cup by defeating Leander. In its second race against Trinity Hall from Cambridge, things did not go well for Courtney’s crew. Cornell came off the line fast, pulling 24 strokes in a half minute. Cornell took the lead by a few feet. At the quarter mile, they had {{a third of a}} boat length lead and increased it to a half a length at the half-mile mark. Trinity surged {{and by the time the}} boats reached the mile mark, they had passed Cornell. Shortly after Trinity took the lead, a sudden collapse occurred in the Cornell boat. The <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oars</b> went flying, Hager (No. 3) and Fennell (No. 5) missed the water with their oars and almost fell out of the boat. Trinity continued the last [...] to victory by seven lengths. [...] Fennell had caught a crab and the handle <b>of</b> his <b>oar</b> struck his side, inflicting injury including bruising his groin. Despite the pain, he continued to row even though he showed signs of exhaustion. After the race, Fennell was placed in doctors' care. Trinity Hall would go on and win the Cup that year.|$|R
60|$|Then Rollo went to {{the forward}} end of the raft to see the raftsmen row. The <b>oars</b> were <b>of</b> monstrous size, as you might well suppose {{to be the case}} from the fact that each of them {{required}} six men to work it. These six men all stood in a row along the handle <b>of</b> the <b>oar,</b> which seemed to be as large as a small mast. They all pressed down upon the handle <b>of</b> the <b>oar</b> so as to raise the <b>blade</b> out <b>of</b> the water, and then walked along over the floor of the raft quite a considerable distance. At last they stopped, and lifting up their hands, they allowed the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oar</b> to go down into the water. Then they turned, and began to push the oar with their hands the other way. The outside men had to reach up very high, for as the oar was very long, and the blade was now necessarily in the water, the end of the handle was raised quite high in the air. The men, accordingly, that were nearest the end <b>of</b> the <b>oar,</b> were obliged to hold their hands up high, in order to reach it; and they all walked along very deliberately, like a platoon of soldiers, pushing the oar before them as they advanced. And as each of the other six oars had a similar platoon marching with it to and fro, and as all acted in concert, and kept time with each other in their motions, the whole operation had quite the appearance of a military manoeuvre. Rollo watched it for some time with great satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you," [...] said Harry, [...] "we {{all had to}} run for it; and when our line broke, {{it was he who}} could get to the boats who was most lucky. The French horse and foot pursued us down to the sea, and were mingled among us, cutting our men down, and bayoneting them on the ground. Poor Armytage was shot in advance of me, and fell; and I took him up and {{staggered}} through the surf to a boat. It was lucky that the sailors in our boat weren't afraid; for the shot were whistling about their ears, breaking the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> their <b>oars,</b> and riddling their flag with shot; but the officer in command was as cool {{as if he had been}} drinking a bowl of punch at Portsmouth, which we had one on landing, I can promise you. Poor Sir John was less lucky than me. He never lived to reach the ship, and the service has lost a fine soldier, and Miss Howe a true gentleman to her husband. There must be these casualties, you see; and his brother gets the promotion--the baronetcy." ...|$|R
50|$|In single-oar sculling, the oar pivots on the boat's stern, and the inboard end {{is pushed}} {{to one side}} with the blade turned so that it generates forward thrust; it is then twisted so that when pulled back on the return stroke, the blade also {{produces}} forward thrust. Backward thrust can also be generated by twisting the oar {{in the other direction}} and rowing. Steering, as in moving coxless sculling shells in crew, is accomplished by directing the thrust. The oar normally pivots in a simple notch cut into—or rowlock mounted on— the stern of the boat, and the sculler must angle the blade, by twisting the inboard end <b>of</b> the <b>oar,</b> to generate the thrust that not only pushes the boat forward but also holds the oar in its pivot. Specifically, the operation of the single sculling (oar) is unique as turning the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oar</b> in figure 8 motions operates them. It is not hoisted {{in and out of the}} water like any other traditional oars. The objective is to minimize the movement of the operator’s hands, and the side-to-side movement of the boat, so the boat moves through the water slowly and steadily. This minimal rotation keeps the water moving over the top <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> and results in forces that transfer to the multi directional row-lock, or pivoting mount, on the side of the hull thus pushing the boat forward. Steering the boat is just a matter <b>of</b> rotating the <b>oar</b> to produce more thrust on a push or pull <b>of</b> the <b>oar,</b> depending upon which way the operator wants to go.|$|R
60|$|What the Admiralty {{was to me}} that day; what {{nonsense}} I made of {{our case}} in my mind, as I listened to it; how I saw 'DORA' engraved upon the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the silver <b>oar</b> which they lay upon the table, as the emblem of that high jurisdiction; and how I felt when Mr. Spenlow went home without me (I had had an insane hope that he might take me back again), as if I were a mariner myself, and the ship to which I belonged had sailed away and left me on a desert island; I shall make no fruitless effort to describe. If that sleepy old court could rouse itself, and present in any visible form the daydreams I have had in it about Dora, it would reveal my truth.|$|R
60|$|January 19.--To-day, {{being in}} {{latitude}} 83 degrees 20', longitude 43 degrees 5' W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw {{land from the}} masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, {{found it to be}} {{one of a group of}} very large islands. The shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. In about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island. After searching about for some time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. We waited for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail. Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> an <b>oar,</b> when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! They continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance.|$|R
60|$|As the consul held my wages, {{and refused}} to give me any money, I was {{compelled}} {{to get on board}} some vessel as soon as I could. Batavia was not a place for an American constitution, and I was glad to be off. I shipped, before the mast, in the Clyde, of Salem, a good little ship, with good living and good treatment. We sailed immediately, but not soon enough to escape the Batavia fever. Two of the crew died, about a week out, and were buried in the Straits of Banca. The day we lost sight of Java Head, it came on to blow fresh, and we had to take in the jib, and double-reef the topsails. A man of the name of Day went down on the bowsprit shrouds to clear the jib-sheets, when the ship made a heavy pitch, and washed him away. The second mate and myself got into the boat, and were lowered as soon as the ship was rounded-to. There was a very heavy sea on, but we succeeded in finding the poor fellow, who was swimming with great apparent strength. His face was towards the boat, and, as we came near, I rose, and threw the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> my <b>oar</b> towards him, calling out to him to be of good cheer. At this instant, Day seemed to spring nearly his length out of water, and immediately sunk. What caused this extraordinary effort, and sudden failure, was never known. I have sometimes thought a shark must have struck him, though I saw neither blood nor fish. The man was hopelessly lost, and we returned to the ship, feeling as seamen always feel on such occasions.|$|R
2500|$|Ancient galleys {{were named}} {{according}} to the number <b>of</b> <b>oars,</b> the number <b>of</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>oars</b> or lines <b>of</b> rowers. The terms are based on contemporary language use combined with more recent compounds of Greek and Latin words. The earliest Greek single-banked galleys are called triaconters (from triakontoroi, [...] "thirty-oars") and penteconters (pentēkontoroi, [...] "fifty-oars"). For later galleys {{with more than one}} row <b>of</b> <b>oars,</b> the terminology is based on Latin numerals with the suffix -reme from rēmus, [...] "oar". A monoreme has one bank <b>of</b> <b>oars,</b> a bireme two and a trireme three. Since the maximum banks <b>of</b> <b>oars</b> was three, any expansion above that did not refer to additional banks <b>of</b> <b>oars,</b> but <b>of</b> additional rowers for every oar. Quinquereme (quintus + rēmus) was literally a [...] "five-oar", but actually meant that there were several rowers to certain banks <b>of</b> <b>oars</b> which made up five lines <b>of</b> <b>oar</b> handlers. For simplicity, they have by many modern scholars been referred to as [...] "fives", [...] "sixes", [...] "eights", [...] "elevens", etc. Anything above six or seven rows of rowers was not common, though even a very exceptional [...] "forty" [...] is attested in contemporary source. Any galley with more than three or four lines of rowers {{is often referred to as}} a [...] "polyreme".|$|R
6000|$|A gondola is {{in general}} rowed only by one man, {{standing}} at the stern; those of the upper classes having two or more boatmen, for greater speed and magnificence. In order to raise the oar sufficiently, it rests, not {{on the side of}} the boat, but on a piece of crooked timber like the branch of a tree, rising about a foot from the boat's side, and called a [...] "fórcola." [...] The fórcola is of different forms, according to the size and uses of the boat, and it is always somewhat complicated in its parts and curvature, allowing the <b>oar</b> various kinds <b>of</b> rests and catches on both its sides, but perfectly free play in all cases; as the management of the boat depends on the gondolier's being able in an instant to place his oar in any position. The fórcola is set on the right-hand side of the boat, some six feet from the stern: the gondolier stands on a little flat platform or deck behind it, and throws nearly the entire weight of his body upon the forward stroke. The effect of this stroke would be naturally to turn the boat's head round to the left, as well as to send it forward; but this tendency is corrected by keeping the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oar</b> under the water on the return stroke, and raising it gradually, as a full spoon is raised out of any liquid, so that the blade emerges from the water only an instant before it again plunges. A downward and lateral pressure upon the fórcola is thus obtained, which entirely counteracts the tendency given by the forward stroke; and the effort, after a little practice, becomes hardly conscious, though, as it adds some labor to the back stroke, rowing a gondola at speed is hard and breathless work, though it appears easy and graceful to the looker-on.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} day at noon, the spot on which the late combat had taken place became the theatre of a stirring and animated scene. Fort Garry, and the space {{between it and the}} river, swarmed with voyageurs, dressed in their cleanest, newest, and most brilliant costume. The large boats for the north, six in number, lay moored to the river's bank, laden with bales of furs, and ready to start on their long voyage. Young men, who had never been on the road before, stood with animated looks watching the operations of the guides as they passed critical examination upon their boats, overhauled the oars to see that they were in good condition, or with crooked knives (a species of instrument in the use of which voyageurs and natives are very expert) polished off the top of a mast, the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> an <b>oar,</b> or the handle of a tiller. Old men, who had passed their lives in similar occupations, looked on in silence--some standing with their heads bent on their bosoms, and an expression of sadness about their faces, as if the scene recalled some mournful event of their early life, or possibly reminded them of wild, joyous scenes of other days, when the blood coursed warmly in their young veins, and the strong muscles sprang lightly to obey their will; when the work {{they had to do was}} hard, and the sleep that followed it was sound--scenes and days that were now gone by for ever. Others reclined against the wooden fence, their arms crossed, their thin white hair waving gently in the breeze, and a kind smile playing on their sunburned faces, as they observed the swagger and coxcombry of the younger men, or watched the gambols of several dark-eyed little children--embryo buffalo-hunters and voyageurs--whose mothers had brought them to the fort to get a last kiss from papa, and witness the departure of the boats.|$|R
