500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing room, we could have done better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and you know <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> but I thought it was. I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back." ...|$|E

She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity.

Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moss's first Formula One {{victory was}} in the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree, a race {{he was also the}} first British driver to win. Leading a 1–2–3–4 finish for Mercedes, {{it was the first time}} he beat Fangio, his {{teammate}} and arch rival, who was also his friend and mentor. It has been suggested that Fangio sportingly allowed Moss to win in front of his home crowd. Moss himself asked Fangio repeatedly, and Fangio always replied: [...] "No. You were just <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> that day." [...] The same year, Moss also won the RAC Tourist Trophy, the Targa Florio (sharing the drive with Peter Collins), and the Mille Miglia.|$|E
2500|$|While gaining {{some success}} as a cover band, the group began working on {{original}} songs. In June 1968, at manager James William Guercio's request, The Big Thing moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with Columbia Records. The band {{changed its name to}} [...] "Chicago Transit Authority". It was while performing on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood that the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time. Subsequently, they were the opening act for Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. As related to group biographer, William James Ruhlmann, by Walt Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix once told Parazaider, Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

After the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in 1996 and changed their name to the Ravens, Unitas {{and some of the}} other old-time Colts attended the Ravens' first game ever against the Raiders on Opening Day at Memorial Stadium. Unitas was frequently seen on the Ravens' sidelines at home games (most prominently in 1998 when the now-Indianapolis Colts played the Ravens) and received a thunderous ovation every time he was pictured on each of the huge widescreens at M Bank Stadium. He was often seen on the 30-yard line on the Ravens side. When the NFL celebrated its first 50 years, Unitas was voted the league's best player. Retired Bears quarterback Sid Luckman said of Unitas, [...] "He was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> better than Sammy Baugh, better than anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lady Diana was {{the most}} famous of the group, which {{included}} Raymond Asquith (son of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister), Patrick Shaw-Stewart, Edward Horner, Sir Denis Anson and Duff Cooper. [...] Following the deaths at relatively young ages of Asquith, Horner, Shaw-Stewart, and Anson—the first three in the war; Anson by drowning—Lady Diana married Cooper, one of her circle of friends' last surviving male members, in June 1919. It was not a popular choice in the Manners household, since the bride's parents had hoped for a marriage to the Prince of Wales. As for Cooper, he once impulsively wrote a letter to Lady Diana, before their marriage, declaring, [...] "I hope everyone you like <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> will die very soon." [...] In 1929 she gave birth to her only child, John Julius (now known as John Julius Norwich), who became a writer and broadcaster.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, the Formula One circus {{began to}} {{alternate}} between Silverstone and the Aintree circuit, {{located on the}} Grand National horse racing course near Liverpool. Mercedes drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and home favourite Stirling Moss arrived at Aintree expecting to win. They took the lead at the start and the two drivers battled throughout, and Moss passed Fangio on the 26th lap; and he kept the lead for a while; but Fangio fought back {{and was about to}} pass Moss on the last corner on the last lap, and all were certain Fangio would pip Moss at the chequered flag. But he didn't, and Moss won his first Formula One race on home soil. Moss later asked Fangio [...] "did you let me through?" [...] and the Argentine replied [...] "No. You were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> that day." [...] Mercedes romped to the finish 1-2-3-4, with German Karl Kling and Italian Piero Taruffi finishing 3rd and 4th.|$|E

Kovačić revealed that precisely Prosinečki is the player he admired the most while growing up. His compatriot, Zvonimir Boban, who played for Milan for over a decade, in an interview with Sky Italia (in 2013) said, [...] "He has talents that could make him even <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> he is an incredibly serious professional for someone his age. Kovačić is a complete player. He is not a born regista but he is playing there now. He is a complete talent that can still grow— he has incredible potential." [...] Trapattoni described him as [...] "a mixture of Kaká and Clarence Seedorf", because of his style of play and technical characteristics. Long-time Inter captain Javier Zanetti stated that, with the exception of Ronaldo, who had arrived to Inter when he was 21, Kovačić was the most promising youngster he had seen in his 19 years at the club.|$|E

2500|$|Trần Thủ Độ {{was also}} an honest {{mandarin}} who never profited his high position {{for the benefit of}} his family. It was said that one time the Emperor wanted to appointed Trần Thủ Độ's elder brother Trần An Quốc for the position of grand chancellor. Trần Thủ Độ politely declined the Emperor's request by an answer: [...] "An Quốc is my brother, if he is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> then I had better retire from the position, but if Your Majesty think that I am better than him, so please not appoint him for grand chancellor. Because if we hold the same position then what royal court will become?". For his dedication, the Emperor personally redacted an epitaph for Trần Thủ Độ in his tomb. However, Trần Thủ Độ still remains as a controversial figure in History of Vietnam for his ruthless decisions against members of Lý royal family and his responsibility in the forced marriage between Trần Thái Tông and his brother Trần Liễu's wife, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Sometimes, his Machiavellian figure was compared with Dorgon, the powerful general who helped establish the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, or Cardinal Mazarin who was chief minister of France for 20 years.|$|E

[...] According to Anderson, his father [...] "was a deeply troubled man... I've dealt with my rage, my pain... I was a very angry boy... When he was around he was a very explosive person."

[...] Anderson grew up in suburban Coburg and attended Coburg Technical School before working as a fitter and turner in a factory. Initially {{he wanted to be a}} blues guitarist, [...] "I wanted to be like all the great blues guitar players, then I wanted to be like Bob Dylan, then of course... John Lennon." [...] Anderson found himself in a band with three possible guitarists and [...] "he other two were much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> so the only other thing we needed was a singer... had to sing 'Twist and Shout' without accompaniment.
