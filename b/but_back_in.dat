5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{recorded}} commission for the firm, around 1875–76, {{was a complete}} rebuild of Blenheim House (56 Old Steine) in the centre of Brighton. [...] This {{was one of several}} old buildings (along with Marlborough House and Steine House) {{on the west side of}} Brighton's first fashionable area, the low-lying grassland of Old Steine. [...] In 1876–77, they extended the Brighton Friends Meeting House, built for Quakers in 1805, and in 1894 they extended and comprehensively redesigned the town's famous Theatre Royal, partly in response to new fire regulations. [...] Much of the firm's early work, though, consisted of housebuilding and surveying in the rapidly developing residential town of Hove, a comfortable middle-class counterpoint to the neighbouring resort of Brighton, in which [...] "a certain gentility prevails" [...] in the spacious streets of finely detailed houses. [...] The landmark Gwydyr Mansions at the bottom of Holland Road, a Flemish Renaissance red-brick and ashlar block of mansion flats with integral facilities such as a restaurant and barber shop, date from 1890. [...] Their next work was in Lansdowne Road (1891), Furze Hill (1893), Holland Road (1895: a studio) and Portland Road (1895: several pairs of semi-detached houses and villas). [...] On Holland Road, a major north–south route, they were also responsible for shops, flats and a religious institute in 1898, a factory for Green & Company in 1911, and a set of garages in 1925. [...] From 1895, they were the main surveyors to the Vallance Estate, a development of high-class Domestic Revival/Queen Anne-style red-brick housing on land owned by the Vallance family. [...] In particular, they were engaged at Pembroke Crescent and Pembroke Avenue, part of the Pembroke & Princes conservation area, almost continuously between 1895 and 1906, and at Vallance Road and Vallance Gardens until 1907. [...] At the same time, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Brighton, they built a seaside convalescent home for French nationals who were patients at the French Hospital in London. [...] The distinctive turreted structure is now Grade II-listed. [...] Also contemporary were a veterinary surgery on Goldsmid Road and the small terraced streets between Old Shoreham Road, Sackville Road and the railway line—Frith, Poynter, Landseer, Prinsep and Leighton Roads. [...] Between 1892 and 1900 they also built up Sackville Road, another important north–south route, with shops, houses and the vicarage of St Barnabas' Church. [...] In 1894–97, they were responsible for a large complex of school buildings in the Aldrington area of Hove, and in 1900 they designed and built a new hall at the Ellen Street schools in Hove (demolished in 1974)—an elaborate Queen Anne-style building designed in 1877 by Thomas Simpson, under whom Clayton was studying at that time.|$|E

6000|$|And in {{the house}} there were books. The rubbish old Lady Drew read I never saw; stuff of the Maria Monk type, I have since gathered, had a fascination for her; <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the past {{there had been a}} Drew of {{intellectual}} enterprise, Sir Cuthbert, the son of Sir Matthew who built the house; and thrust away, neglected and despised, in an old room upstairs, were books and treasures of his that my mother let me rout among during a spell of wintry wet. Sitting under a dormer window on a shelf above great stores of tea and spices, I became familiar with much of Hogarth in a big portfolio, with Raphael, there was a great book of engravings from the stanzas of Raphael in the Vatican--and with most of the capitals of Europe as they had looked about 1780, by means of several pig iron-moulded books of views. There was also a broad eighteenth century atlas with huge wandering maps that instructed me mightily. It had splendid adornments about each map title; Holland showed a fisherman and his boat; Russia a Cossack; Japan, remarkable people attired in pagodas--I say it deliberately, [...] "pagodas." [...] There were Terrae Incognitae in every continent then, Poland, Sarmatia, lands since lost; and many a voyage I made with a blunted pin about that large, incorrect and dignified world. The books in that little old closet had been banished, I suppose, from the saloon during the Victorian revival of good taste and emasculated orthodoxy, but my mother had no suspicion of their character. So I read and understood the good sound rhetoric of Tom Paine's [...] "Rights of Man," [...] and his [...] "Common Sense," [...] excellent books, once praised by bishops and since sedulously lied about. Gulliver was there unexpurgated, strong meat for a boy perhaps but not too strong I hold--I have never regretted that I escaped niceness in these affairs. The satire of Traldragdubh made my blood boil as it was meant to do, but I hated Swift for the Houyhnhnms and never quite liked a horse afterwards. Then I remember also a translation of Voltaire's [...] "Candide," [...] and [...] "Rasselas;" [...] and, vast book though it was, I really believe I read, in a muzzy sort of way of course, from end to end, and even with some reference now and then to the Atlas, Gibbon--in twelve volumes.|$|E

A common grayness silvers everything-- All in a twilight, you and I alike --You, at the point of your first pride in me (That's gone you know)--but I, at every point; My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole. [...] 40 There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; That length of convent-wall across the way Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, And autumn grows, autumn in everything.

At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: I do what many dream of, all their lives, --Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, [...] 70 And fail in doing.

Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-gray Placid, and perfect with my art: the worse!

Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth The Urbinate who died five years ago. ('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)

Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: But all the play, the insight and the stretch-- Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think-- [...] 120 More than I merit, yes, by many times. But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow, And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare-- Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!

Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; The rest avail not. Why do I need you? What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? In this world, who can do a thing, will not; And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power-- And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, [...] 140 God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. 'T is safer for me, if the award be strict, That I am something underrated here, Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. The best is when they pass and look aside; But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! [...] 150 I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, In that humane great monarch's golden look-- One finger in his beard or twisted curl Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, I painting proudly with his breath on me, All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls [...] 160 Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts-- And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, This in the background, waiting on my work, To crown the issue with a last reward! A good time, was it not, my kingly days? And had you not grown restless [...] . but I know-- 'T is done and past; 't was right, my instinct said, Too live the life grew, golden and not gray, And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.

Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, (What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? Do you forget already words like those?)

[...] 10 [...] I often am much wearier than you think, [...] This evening more than usual, and it seems [...] As if--forgive now--should you let me sit [...] Here by the window with your hand in mine [...] And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole, [...] 15 [...] Both of one mind, as married people use, [...] Quietly, quietly the evening through, [...] I might get up tomorrow to my work [...] Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try. [...] Tomorrow, how you shall be glad for this! [...] 20 [...] Your soft hand is a woman of itself, [...] And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. [...] Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve [...] For {{each of the five}} pictures we require: [...] It saves a model. So! keep looking so-- [...] 25 [...] My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds! [...] --How could you ever prick those perfect ears, [...] Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet-- [...] My face, my moon, my everybody's moon, [...] Which everybody looks on and calls his, [...] 30 [...] And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn, [...] While she looks--no one's: very dear, no less. [...] You smile? why, there's my picture ready made, [...] There's what we painters call our harmony! [...] A common grayness silvers everything-- [...] 35 [...] All in a twilight, you and I alike [...] --You, at the point of your first pride in me [...] (That's gone you know)--but I, at every point; [...] My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down [...] To yonder sober, pleasant Fiesole. [...] 40 [...] There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; [...] That length of convent-wall across the way [...] Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; [...] The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, [...] And autumn grows, autumn in everything. [...] 45 [...] Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape [...] As if I saw alike my work and self [...] And all that I was born to be and do, [...] A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand. [...] How strange now looks the life He makes us lead; [...] 50 [...] So free we seem, so fettered fast we are! [...] I feel He laid the fetter: let it lie! [...] This chamber for example--turn your head-- [...] All that's behind us! You don't understand [...] Nor care to understand about my art, [...] 55 [...] But you can hear at least when people speak: [...] And that cartoon, the second from the door [...] --It is the thing, Love! so such thing should be-- [...] Behold Madonna!--I am bold to say. [...] I can do with my pencil what I know, [...] 60 [...] What I see, what at bottom of my heart [...] I wish for, if I ever wish so deep-- [...] Do easily, too--when I say, perfectly, [...] I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, [...] Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, [...] 65 [...] And just as much they used to say in France. [...] At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! [...] No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: [...] I do what many dream of, all their lives, [...] --Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, [...] 70 [...] And fail in doing. I could count twenty such [...] On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, [...] Who strive--you don't know how the others strive [...] To paint a little thing like that you smeared [...] Carelessly passing with your robes afloat-- [...] 75 [...] Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says, [...] (I know his name, no matter)--so much less! [...] Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. [...] There burns a truer light of God in them, [...] In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, [...] 80 [...] Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt [...] This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. [...] Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, [...] Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, [...] Enter and take their place there sure enough, [...] 85 [...] Though they come back and cannot tell the world. [...] My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. [...] The sudden blood of these men! at a word-- [...] Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. [...] I, painting from myself and to myself, [...] 90 [...] Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame [...] Or their praise either. Somebody remarks [...] Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, [...] His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, [...] Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? [...] 95 [...] Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? [...] Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, [...] Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-gray [...] Placid and perfect with my art: the worse! [...] I know both what I want and what might gain, [...] 100 [...] And yet how profitless to know, to sigh [...] "Had I been two, another and myself, [...] Our head would have o'erlooked the world!" [...] No doubt. [...] Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth [...] The Urbinate who died five years ago. [...] 105 [...] ('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) [...] Well, I can fancy how he did it all, [...] Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, [...] Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, [...] Above and through his art--for it gives way; [...] 110 [...] That arm is wrongly put--and there again-- [...] A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, [...] Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, [...] He means right--that, a child may understand. [...] Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: [...] 115 [...] But all the play, the insight and the stretch-- [...] Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? [...] Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, [...] We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! [...] Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think-- [...] 120 [...] More than I merit, yes, by many times. [...] But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow, [...] And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, [...] And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird [...] The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare-- [...] 125 [...] Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! [...] Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged [...] "God and the glory! never care for gain. [...] The present by the future, what is that? [...] Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! [...] 130 [...] Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!" [...] I might have done it for you. So it seems: [...] Perhaps not. All is as God overrules. [...] Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; [...] The rest avail not. Why do I need you? [...] 135 [...] What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? [...] In this world, who can do a thing, will not; [...] And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: [...] Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power-- [...] And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, [...] 140 [...] God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. [...] 'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, [...] That I am something underrated here, [...] Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. [...] I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, [...] 145 [...] For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. [...] The best is when they pass and look aside; [...] But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. [...] Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, [...] And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! [...] 150 [...] I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, [...] Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, [...] In that humane great monarch's golden look-- [...] One finger in his beard or twisted curl [...] Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, [...] 155 [...] One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, [...] The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, [...] I, painting proudly with his breath on me, [...] All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, [...] Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls [...] 160 [...] Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts-- [...] And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, [...] This in the background, waiting on my work, [...] To crown the issue with a last reward! [...] A good time, was it not, my kingly days? [...] 165 [...] And load you not grown restless ... but I know-- [...] 'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my instinct said; [...] Too live the life grew, golden and not gray, [...] And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt [...] Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. [...] 170 [...] How could it end in any other way? [...] You called me, and I came home to your heart. [...] The triumph was--to reach and stay there; since [...] I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? [...] Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, [...] 175 [...] You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! [...] "Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; [...] The Roman's is the better when you pray, [...] But still the other's Virgin was his wife"-- [...] Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge [...] 180 [...] Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows [...] My better fortune, I resolve to think. [...] For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, [...] Said one day Agnolo, his very self, [...] To Rafael ... I have known it all these years ... 185 [...] (When the young man was flaming out his thoughts [...] Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, [...] Too lifted up in heart because of it) [...] "Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub [...] Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, [...] 190 [...] Who, were he set to plan and execute [...] As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, [...] Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!" [...] To Rafael's!--And indeed the arm is wrong. [...] I hardly dare ... yet, only you to see, [...] 195 [...] Give the chalk here--quick, thus the line should go! [...] Aye, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! [...] Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, [...] (What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? [...] Do you forget already words like those?) [...] 200 [...] If really there was such a chance, so lost-- [...] Is, whether you're--not grateful--but more pleased. [...] Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! [...] This hour has been an hour! Another smile? [...] If you would sit thus by me every night [...] 205 [...] I should work better, do you comprehend? [...] I mean that I should earn more, give you more. [...] See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; [...] Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, [...] The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. [...] 210 [...] Come from the window, love--come in, at last, [...] Inside the melancholy little house [...] We built to be so gay with. God is just. [...] King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights [...] When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, [...] 215 [...] The walls become illumined, brick from brick [...] Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, [...] That gold of his I did cement them with! [...] Let us but love each other. Must you go? [...] That Cousin here again? He waits outside? [...] 220 [...] Must see you--you, and not with me? Those loans? [...] More gaming debts to pay? You smiled for that? [...] Well, let smiles buy me! Have you more to spend? [...] While hand and eye and something of a heart [...] Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? [...] 225 [...] I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit [...] The gray remainder of the evening out, [...] Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly [...] How I could paint, were I <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> France, [...] One picture, just one more--the Virgin's face, [...] 230 [...] Not yours this time! I want you at my side [...] To hear them--that is, Michel Agnolo-- [...] Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. [...] Will you? Tomorrow, satisfy your friend. [...] I take the subjects for his corridor, [...] 235 [...] Finish the portrait out of hand--there, there, [...] And throw him in another thing or two [...] If he demurs; the whole should prove enough [...] To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, [...] What's better and what's all I care about, [...] 240 [...] Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! [...] Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he, [...] The Cousin! what does he to please you more? ...|$|E
