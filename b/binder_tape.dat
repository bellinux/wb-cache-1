50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of Control Cable {{in the area of}} process automation: CY, YY and SY Cable. With its GSWB braid SY is suited to installations with medium to high mechanical stress. YY and CY Control Cable are very similar in construction, but without the mechanical protection provided by the steel wire. YY is a versatile cable that works well in environments with only light mechanical stress and CY Cable has a tinned copper wire braid and polyester <b>binder</b> <b>tape,</b> which provide protection against external electromagnetic influences.|$|E

50|$|Over years, {{magnetic}} tape {{made in the}} 1970s and 1980s can suffer from a type of deterioration called sticky-shed syndrome. Caused by hydrolysis of the <b>binder</b> of the <b>tape,</b> it can render the tape unusable.|$|R
50|$|Depending on a sucrologist's {{preference}} of collecting empty or full, {{there are a}} variety of methods to store sugar packets. Many collectors store them in bags or boxes. Other collectors prefer to store them in binders using plastic coupon sleeves or trading card sleeves. However, not all shapes of sugar packets are easy to be stored in <b>binders.</b> Using <b>tape</b> or glue to stick them inside a book is not recommended as it can damage the packet. Sucrologists typically prefer to sort out their collections by country or by theme.|$|R

Four days later, on June 26, 1993, she {{attended}} her mother's funeral service {{on the grounds of the}} Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda. Ten months later, she was by her father's bedside with her sister Patricia when he died. Julie attended the funeral on April 27, 1994. Her father's death left her and her sister with his diary entries, <b>binders</b> and <b>tapes</b> among other things while they were secluded from the public.|$|R
5000|$|Information can be {{recovered}} from the [...] "stick-shed" [...] tapes by heating them at a very low temperature in order drive {{the water out of}} the binders. The baking method is a one-time solution to the problem because the <b>binder</b> remains unstable. <b>Tapes</b> that do not show the breakdown syndrome do not need any special treatment.|$|R
40|$|A BAE Systems /UK EPSRC funded project Flaviir, is {{investigating}} the design and manufacture of low cost carbon fibre composite airframe structures. Novel binder coated unidirectional fibre tapes and tows were developed to enable the design of optimised primary structures. The RTM technique was applied to mould net shape sections of spar components. Various designs of wing attachment lugs were manufactured {{with a range of}} reinforcement materials, including non crimp fabric, novel <b>binder</b> coated <b>tapes</b> and conventional unidirectional prepreg. Alongside these, a novel technique termed optimised tow lay up (OTL) was used to reduce the weight. Binder coated carbon fibre tow is placed around the structure in the principal stress directions to increase both bearing strength and overall component stiffness. The novel materials, manufacturing technique and initial element test results are presented...|$|R
50|$|Current {{solutions}} to sticky-shed syndrome seek to safely remove the unwanted {{moisture from the}} <b>tape</b> <b>binder.</b> Two different strategies are commonly employed: applying heat to the tape (commonly called 'baking'), and changing the environment to lower the humidity. Baking is widely practiced, but can destroy tapes. While modification of humidity by safely controlling the environment may take significantly longer, its major benefit {{is that it does}} not irreparably damage the tape. Alternate practices have also been developed by engineers to fix affected tapes.|$|R
50|$|Baking is {{a common}} {{practice}} for temporarily repairing sticky-shed syndrome. There is no standard equipment or practice for baking, so each engineer is left {{to create their own}} methods and materials. Generally, tapes are baked at low temperatures for relatively long periods of time, such as 130 °F to 140 °F (54 to 60 °C) for 1 to 8 hours. Wider tape formats may take longer. It is commonly thought that baking a tape will temporarily remove the moisture that has accumulated in the <b>binder.</b> A treated <b>tape</b> will reportedly function like new for a few weeks to a few months before it will reabsorb moisture and be unplayable again.|$|R
40|$|Laminated ZrC-SiC ceramic was {{prepared}} through tape casting and hot pressing. The green tapes of ZrC and SiC were prepared at room temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of fabrication techniques that make possible the use of Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) Tapes for the construction of three-dimensional meso (intermediate) scale electro mechanical systems. We brought together technologies from the packaging, silicon and ceramics industries to develop a photolithographic technique for LTCC tapes. To that end, it was necessary to investigate and define an appropriate heat preprocess that we called partially sintering. Jet Vapor Etching is another patterning technique developed during this research effort. It has the advantage of being more directional than wet etching and therefore vias with high aspect ratio can be patterned. A jet of atomized solvent impinges {{on the surface of the}} LTCC tape dissolving the organic <b>binder</b> of the <b>tape</b> and mechanically removing the alumina and glass grains. When the vertical dimension is introduced, sagging problems appear; however, we solved these problems by using sacrificial materials and the appropriate atmosphere and firing profile. We also experimentally found the processing parameters for the photoformables LTCC tapes and showed that the diffusion model is a good candidate to model transport of light in the ceramic. The firing of photoformable LTCC is problematic because of non-uniform drying but it was resolved by constrain lamination. The discovery of the exfoliation phenomenon played an essential role in the development of a high temperature pressure sensor. ...|$|R
40|$|Multilayer {{ceramics}} technology, as LTCC, {{offers several}} advantages for the fabrication of miniaturized three-dimensional structures, e. g. for microsystem applications, where electrical, mechanical and fluidic functions {{can be combined}} in robust and compact packages. 3 D features, required by those applications are e. g. vias for electrical and thermal interconnection, cavities for chip integration and channels for fluidic functions. They can be realized, in principle, in the sintered, {{as well as in}} the green state, but structuring in the green state dominates due to the then far better machinability of the material. Ceramic green tape structuring is usually accomplished by mechanical or laser machining. Punchung is the standard process for realizing vias or cavities in LTCC. By nature, only through tape features can be realized, but 3 D features can be realized by stacking of several layers. Embossing can be used for the realization of quite complex 3 D structures with high resolution. It can be carried out either at elevated temperature, at which the <b>binder</b> of the <b>tape</b> is softened (hot embossing) or at room temperature (cold embossing). Laser structuring is a quite flexible method, which allows both through-cutting and engraving without any specific tool. However, a certain roughness of ablated areas cannot be avoided, and depth control and uniformity of laser engraved features remain challenging. In the present paper, the different techniques will be compared regarding their appropriatness for different structuring tasks. A combined use of punching, embossing and laser proce ssing is described, which has been made possible by a novel machine and tool concept...|$|R
40|$|A unitary layered ceramic {{structure}} is disclosed which comprises co-sintered layers. The co-sintered structure comprises a sintered central layer of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) {{which is about}} 8 mole percent yttria and having a density of at least about 95 % of theoretical, and sintered outer layers of strontium lanthanum manganite (LSM) having the approximate molecular composition La. sub. 0. 8 Sr. sub. 0. 2 MnO. sub. 3, having a density from about 50 to about 60 % of theoretical, and having interconnected porosity from about 40 to 50 % with an interconnected pore diameter from about one micron to about five microns. The sintered central layer is sandwiched by and bonded and sintered to the outer layers and is essentially free of significant amounts of manganese. A process for making the unitary composition-of-matter is also disclosed which involves tape casting a LSM tape and then on top thereof casting a YSZ tape. The process comprises presintering LSM powder at 1250. degree. F., crushing the presintered commercially available LSM powder, forming a slurry with the crushed LSM, a <b>binder</b> and solvent, <b>tape</b> casting the slurry and allowing the slurry to air dry. A mixture of commercially available submicron size particle YSZ powder is milled with a dispersant and solvent to disperse the YSZ particles thereby forming a dispersed YSZ slurry. The YSZ slurry is then tape cast on the dried LSM tape. If desired, a third layer of LSM can be cast {{on top of the}} dried YSZ layer. After drying the composite LSM/YSZ and LSM/YSZ/LSM tapes are fired at 1300. degree. C. No migration of manganese into the YSZ layer was observed with scanning electron microscope/edax in the sintered multilayer tape...|$|R
40|$|Definition : Tumescent liposuction is a {{technique}} {{for the removal of}} subcutaneous fat under a special form of local anesthesia called tumescent anesthesia. Physician&#x 2032;s qualifications : The physician performing liposuction should have completed postgraduate training in dermatology or a surgical specialty and should have had adequate training in dermatosurgery at a center that provides training in cutaneous surgery. In addition, the physician should obtain specific liposuction training or experience at the surgical table ("hands on") under the supervision of an appropriately trained and experienced liposuction surgeon. In addition to the surgical technique, training should include instruction in fluid and electrolyte balance, potential complications of liposuction, tumescent and other forms of anesthesia as well as emergency resuscitation and care. Facility : Liposuction can be performed safely in an outpatient day care surgical facility, or a hospital operating room. The day care theater should be equipped with facilities for monitoring and handling emergencies. A plan for handling emergencies should be in place with which all nursing staff should be familiar. A physician trained in emergency medical care and acute cardiac emergencies should be available in the premises. It is recommended but not mandatory, that an anesthetist be asked to stand by. Indications: Liposuction is recommended for all localized deposits of fat. Novices should restrict themselves to the abdomen, thighs, buttocks and male breasts. Arms, the medial side of the thigh and the female breast need more experience and are recommended for experienced surgeons. Liposuction may be performed for non-cosmetic indications such as hyperhidrosis of axillae after adequate experience has been acquired, but is not recommended for the treatment of obesity. Preoperative evaluation : Detailed history is to be taken with respect to any previous disease, drug intake and prior surgical procedures. Liposuction is contraindicated in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, severe coagulation disorders including thrombophilia, and during pregnancy. Physical evaluation should be detailed and should include assessment of general physical health to determine the fitness of the patient for surgery, as well as the examination of specific sites that need liposuction to check for potential problems. Preoperative Informed consent : The patient should sign a detailed consent form listing details about the procedure and possible complications. The consent form should specifically state the limitations of the procedure and should mention whether more procedures are needed for proper results. The patient should be provided with adequate opportunity to seek information through brochures, computer presentations, and personal discussions. Preoperative laboratory studies to be performed include Hb&#x 0025;, blood counts including platelet counts, bleeding and clotting time (or prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time) and blood chemistry profile; ECG is advisable. Liver function tests, and pregnancy test for women of childbearing age are performed as mandated by the individual patient&#x 2032;s requirements. Ultrasound examination is recommended in cases of gynecomastia. Preoperative medication : Preoperative antibiotics and non-sedative analgesics such as paracetamol are recommended. The choice of antibiotic and analgesic agents depends on the individual physician&#x 2032;s preference and the prevailing local conditions. Type of anesthetic employed : Lidocaine is the preferred local anesthetic; its recommended dose is 35 - 45 mg/kg and doses should not exceed 55 mg/kg wt. The recommended concentration of epinephrine in tumescent solutions is 0. 25 - 1. 5 mg/L. The total dosage of epinephrine should be minimized and should not exceed 50 &#x 00 B 5;g/kg. Surgical technique/procedure It is always advisable not to combine liposuction with other procedures to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage of lignocaine. However, such combinations may be attempted if the total required dose of lignocaine does not exceed the maximum dose indicated above. The recommended cannula size for liposuction is not to be larger than 3. 5 mm in diameter. The recommended volume of fat removed is in proportion to the fat content and/or size and/or weight of the patient being treated. It is recommended that the volume of fat removed not exceed 5000 mL in a single operative session. Large volume liposuctions or mega-liposuctions are not recommended. Intraoperative and postoperative monitoring : Baseline vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate, are recorded pre- and postoperatively. Pulse oximeter monitoring is essential in all cases. Postoperative care: Postoperative antibiotics should be selected by the physician and taken for five days. Postoperative antiinflammatory drugs such as Cox 2 Inhibiters may be given for 5 - 7 days; specialized compression garments, <b>binders,</b> and <b>tape</b> help to reduce bruising, hematomas, seromas, and pain. Generally, compression is recommended for two weeks although this is variable according {{to the needs of the}} individual patient...|$|R
