5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E

Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls.

50|$|In many countries, {{radio and}} {{television}} networks, after <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> either went off the air except for funeral music or broke schedules to carry uninterrupted <b>news</b> of <b>the</b> assassination, and if Kennedy had made a visit to that country, recalled that visit in detail.

5|$|The Latino {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} Latino community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E

25|$|Clair's {{contract}} with Korda's London Films was {{for two years}} and it envisaged three films. Because of his limited English, he collaborated with the American dramatist Robert E. Sherwood as script-writer for his first film, The Ghost Goes West (1935), a comic fantasy about transatlantic culture clash. Clair and Sherwood became close friends. In January 1936, Clair visited America for two weeks, checking out for future employment possibilities but still planning to remain with Korda. Korda however rejected Clair's next script and they parted company. Clair's remaining time in England led to only one more completed film, <b>Break</b> <b>the</b> <b>News</b> (1938), a musical comedy with Jack Buchanan and Maurice Chevalier.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 the tax {{receipts}} were in, and Sherif Pasha, {{the head of}} the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the Wāli the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80million francs (£2,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts. Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, İbrahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.|$|E

His death meant {{that for the first time}} since 1933, when Calvin Coolidge died during Herbert Hoover's final months in office, that there were no former Presidents still living; Johnson had been the only living ex-President since December 26, 1972, following the death of Harry S.

25|$|In 1183, {{the young}} King Henry tried again to force {{his father to}} hand over some of his patrimony. In debt and refused control of Normandy, he tried to ambush his father at Limoges. He was joined by troops sent by his brother Geoffrey and Philip II of France. Henry II's troops besieged the town, forcing his son to flee. After {{wandering}} aimlessly through Aquitaine, Henry the Younger caught dysentery. On Saturday, 11 June 1183, the Young King realized he was dying and was overcome with remorse for his sins. When his father's ring was sent to him, he begged that his father would show mercy to his mother, and that all his companions would plead with Henry to set her free. Henry II sent Thomas of Earley, Archdeacon of Wells, to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to Eleanor at Sarum. Eleanor reputedly had had a dream in which she foresaw her son Henry's death. In 1193 she would tell Pope Celestine III that she was tortured by his memory.|$|E
25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> {{of the death of}} another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E

After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (again). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World.
