Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out. Krycek is about {{to pull the trigger}} when a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless.

5|$|Mullum Malarum {{is based}} on a novel of the same name by Umachandran which was {{published}} in the Tamil magazine, Kalki. The story, about the love between a brother and sister, won the first prize in Kalkis Novel Short Story Competition celebrating the magazine's 1966 silver jubilee. Screenplay and dialogue writer J. Mahendran read only a part of Umachandran's novel, but was particularly impressed by the winch operator Kali and his affection for his sister, as well as the loss of his arm. He outlined Mullum Malarum to producer Venu Chettiar, who was impressed. Adapting Umachandran's novel for the screen, Mahendran made his directing debut and wrote the film's dialogue. His screenplay diverged from the novel's plot, and he decided to make a minimalist, visually-rich film without melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue or duets. A significant difference is that in the novel, Kali loses his arm to a tiger while in the film, he loses it due to it <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> by a lorry.|$|E
5|$|Detective Joe Salerno (Derek Russo), a {{very dear}} friend of Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), is found dead, after <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> by Sara Gonzales (Diane Guerrero).

A distraught Samantha and Megan visit Joe's wife Helen (Kathryn Meisle) and their {{daughter}} Becky (Fátima Ptacek). Helen says that Joe had been distant before he died, after he was under review for assaulting Chuck Foster (John Magaro). Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) discovers Joe was doing freelance work on a cold case involving Lizzy Adler (Rebecca Blumhagen), a student athlete who was murdered, with Chuck being the prime suspect. Megan, Bud, Samantha and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) talk to Lizzy's lacrosse coach, Hal Davis, who states that Joe had been visiting the team recently. Megan exhumes Lizzy's body, without her boss, Kate Murphy's (Jeri Ryan), permission. Megan gets her judge mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy) to sign the request, who tells Megan that Lizzy is buried in the same graveyard as Megan's father David, who committed suicide when Megan was twelve. Megan and Peter later visit David's grave.|$|E

25|$|The Koppenberg {{has been}} dropped some years {{because it was}} deemed too {{difficult}} and too dangerous. Particularly when wet weather had made the cobbles slippery, {{it was hard for}} riders to take the steep slopes all the way riding. One rider falling could bring many others down and, in turn, halt those behind, who often had to shoulder their bikes and run up the remainder of the hill. In 1984 only two riders– Phil Anderson and Jan Raas– got to the top on their bikes. In 1987 Danish rider Jesper Skibby slipped and fell on the slick cobbles, before <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> by an official's car who tried to pass him.

Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. Fire hydrants sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{causes of}} death {{included}} hypothermia, drowning in river crossings, getting run over by wagons, and accidental gun deaths. Later, more family groups started traveling, and many more bridges and ferries were being put in, so fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era. <b>Being</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> was {{a major cause of}} death, despite the wagons' only averaging 2–3 miles per hour. The wagons could not easily be stopped, and people, particularly children, were often trying to get on and off the wagons while they were moving—not always successfully. Another hazard was a dress getting caught in the wheels and pulling the person under. Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie, as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary, as the perceived Indian threat faded and hunting opportunities receded.|$|E

Seven thousand extras were hired to cheer in the stands. Economic conditions in Italy were poor at the time, and as shooting for the chariot scene wound down only 1,500 extras were needed on any given day. On June 6, more than 3,000 people seeking work were turned away. The crowd rioted, throwing stones and assaulting the set's gates until police arrived and dispersed them. Dynamite charges were used to show the chariot wheels and axles splintering {{from the effects of}} Messala's barbed-wheel attacks.

5000|$|Many of the {{tedious and}} disgusting tasks at the pub (taking out the trash, {{cleaning}} the bathrooms, exterminating pests) {{are referred to}} as [...] "Charlie work", even when Charlie is not performing them. He seems almost inhumanly tough and resistant to injury. Mac and Dennis, who believe him to be nearly indestructible, frequently manipulate him into tests of his fortitude, such as hitting him over the head with beer bottles and chairs or having him tow Dennis' Range Rover through the streets of Philadelphia. After ingesting an amount of cough syrup large enough to [...] "kill a gorilla", as Mac warns in [...] "The Gang Dances Their Asses Off", Charlie simply states [...] "Bro, I can handle my sedatives."

40|$|ABSTRACT As {{a result}} of vacant and {{unregulated}} land close to railway lines, poor people tend to build their informal structures in such areas, thus putting their health and well being at risk, for instance the danger of <b>being</b> <b>ran</b> <b>over</b> by trains. Such occupation also threatens to disrupt the railway services. This problem {{is not unique to}} South Africa and in this study I draw on cases from India and Kenya. These countries wre identified, because they have set precedence in informal settlement upgrading and their experience can guide the policy formulation process in South Africa. This study explores the development challenges that are faced By informal settlers on railway reserves, using a case study of Dukathole informal settlement in Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM). During the investigation {{it was found that the}} interviewees at Dukathole informal settlement are not able to participate in the process of dealing with their own development challenges and are not aware of any development planning taking place for Dukathole, although such planning is underway. This is in contrary to the way in which informal settlers are treated in the case studies fo India and Kenya, where they are regared as active role players in addressing their own development challenges...|$|R
