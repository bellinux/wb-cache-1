5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{after the}} 2015 {{election}} of Mayor Dale Fowler, Harrisburg opened {{a brand new}} theater {{on the north side}} of town, and unveiled park plaza, gateway for southeastern Illinois entertainment and culture downtown.

5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though {{he was concerned about}} the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E

5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> public awareness {{to the experience}} of war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|In 216 Caracalla {{pursued a}} series of {{aggressive}} campaigns in the east against the Parthians, intended to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> territory under direct Roman control. He offered the king of Parthia, Artabanus V of Parthia, a marriage proposal {{between himself and the}} king's daughter. Artabanus refused the offer, realizing that the proposal was merely an attempt to unite the kingdom of Parthia under the control of Rome. In response, Caracalla used the opportunity to start a campaign against the Parthians. That summer Caracalla began to attack the countryside east of the Tigris in the Parthian war of Caracalla. In the following winter, Caracalla retired to Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa in south-east Turkey, and began making preparations to renew the campaign by spring.|$|E
5|$|In November HMS Eagle chased and {{captured}} the small French frigate Corcyre in a failed attempt by a French convoy to transport supplies to Corfu. A day later, {{the action of}} 29 November 1811 foiled the most significant French attempt to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> forces to the Adriatic in 1811 when a British squadron under Captain Murray Maxwell in Alceste chased and engaged two frigates and an armed store ship. One frigate and the store ship were captured, the other reaching Ancona in a disabled state. This action had wide-ranging effects; Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the reports, and {{it has been suggested that}} it was this engagement that convinced him to change the direction of his plans for eastwards expansion from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E

SpongeBob then shows Mr. Krabs the highway's blueprint, which shows that the highway with concrete columns will run over the Krusty Krab and end directly at the Chum Bucket, revealing that Plankton {{is responsible for the}} highway's development. Mr. Krabs is outraged at this revelation and decides to support SpongeBob. They both go to the Chum Bucket and ask Plankton to not develop the highway, but he states {{that the rest of the}} town has already unanimously voted to build the highway.|$|E

5|$|The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to {{make the}} city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the {{conversion}} of one-way streets to two-way streets. The hope is to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> businesses to the area, create shorter travel routes, and to reduce speeding. This phase {{of the project was}} expected to be completed by 2016. The other part of the initiative is the West Side Main Streets Plan, which is a revitalization plan for the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise Association.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord {{proved a}} {{successful}} breed for the farmers that developed it, and quickly {{spread throughout the}} Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. It was given different names depending on the country, and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from the Netherlands, Brabants and the Ardennes. Breed associations began to organize in the late 19th century, {{and at this point}} blood from the Boulonnais was introduced to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> elegance to the breed. The Trait du Nord gradually began to differ from the Ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits, and the breed became popular in the north and east of France. In 1855, even before the breed had been differentiated from the Ardennes, veterinarians described the heavy horses bred near Hainaut as superior to Flemish breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan {{was part of an}} effort to <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> attention to the AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E

5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two ships}} closed Truxtun's ship held the weather gauge, the {{position}} upwind from his opponent which {{allowed him to}} close or break off. However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her leeward side. From there Constellation could <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> of her guns to bear. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would <b>bring</b> <b>more</b> money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E
