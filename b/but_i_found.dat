McDonald's shut down their Happy Meal promotion for the film. Burton responded, [...] "I like Batman Returns {{better than the}} first one. There was this big backlash {{that it was too}} dark, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> this movie much less dark." ...|$|E

He said that he [...] "later reexamined it and started noticing the 'codes' and letters hidden all around the video".|$|E
500|$|Some {{individuals}} {{profiled in}} In Patagonia were unhappy with Chatwin's portrayals of them. They included one man whom Chatwin insinuated was homosexual {{and a woman}} who thought her father was unjustly accused of killing Indians. However, Chatwin's biographer found one farmer who was featured in the book who thought Chatwin's depictions of himself and other members of his community were truthful. He stated, [...] "No one likes looking at their own passport photograph, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it accurate. It's not flattering, but it's the truth." ...|$|E

500|$|Another of her {{compositions}} was [...] "Aloha ʻOe", a song she {{had written}} previously and transcribed during her confinement. In her writings, she says, [...] "At first I had no instrument, and had to transcribe the notes by voice alone; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found,</b> notwithstanding disadvantages, great consolation in composing, and transcribed a number of songs. Three found their way from my prison {{to the city of}} Chicago, where they were printed, among them the 'Aloha Oe' or 'Farewell to Thee', which became a very popular song." [...] Originally written as a lover's good-bye, the song came to be regarded as a symbol of, and lament for, the loss of her country. Today, {{it is one of the}} most recognizable Hawaiian songs.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|Harvick {{was only}} quick enough for 19th position. In {{the third and}} final practice, Burton was quickest with a time of 31.850 seconds. Kahne {{followed}} in second, ahead of Martin Truex, Jr. and Hamlin. Jamie McMurray was fifth quickest, with a time of 31.916 seconds. Edwards, Gordon, Ragan, Biffle, and Aric Almirola rounded out the first ten positions. Johnson, who was eleventh in the second session, could only manage 22nd. Following the third practice session, Harvick stated, [...] "We didn't put up a fast lap but it never slows down. I'm really excited." [...] Afterward, Johnson commented [...] "We struggled a little bit maybe in the first practice. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> a good direction and started making some good gains there at the end. I feel really good about our car. It's very comfortable. I can run the top, run the bottom. I think we're in good shape." [...] "I think we've got the balance real close," [...] Johnson continued. [...] "My motor's running great. Maybe some overall grip but I think there I'm one of 43 guys that are saying that. This hot sun out here [...] the track awful slick." ...|$|E

500|$|Mardas {{often said}} that the Abbey Road studio was [...] "no good", much to {{producer}} George Martin's annoyance: [...] "The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios {{to see what we}} were doing and to learn from it, {{while at the same time}} saying ‘These people are so out of date.’ <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn’t, a minor schism developed". Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road—which was being updated at the time to an 8-track—so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr's drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some [...] "huge" [...] computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but [...] "they never left the barn", and were later sold as scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of the critics gave [...] "Lord Snow" [...] a positive review, many suggested that it suffered from having to introduce many new characters and locations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 80% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.75 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] "'Lord Snow' is an intriguing and heavy transitional episode with standout performances from Bean and Gillen, though it would be better served with more focus on character change and development." [...] Myles McNutt wrote at Cultural Learnings that it was [...] "perhaps the most narratively uninteresting episode of the first six," [...] although he highlighted that it was [...] "hardly a bad episode of television, filled as it is with satisfying sequences that capture many themes key to the series," [...] and added that many issues introduced in this episode had a payoff in future installments. Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the [...] "more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked [...] "because the stories are being told with such passion." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that [...] "Lord Snow" [...] was [...] "dense and filled with tons of exposition and backstory, {{which may or may not}} have interested those new to this story - <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself hanging on every precious word." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote a positive review of the episode for HitFix, saying [...] "Arya's fencing lesson is a wonderful scene, carried by the joy of Maisie Williams' performance and the playful, Inigo Montoya-ish quality of her new teacher Syrio, but it's also such a small, simple thing that you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to be the note that an episode of dramatic television goes out on" [...] and continued [...] "I liked the looser, more rambling quality of [...] "Lord Snow," [...] an episode largely about transitions, fish out of water, and old ghosts.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and going out on a limb even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship. He added that the episode was [...] "particularly great" [...] because it featured no cutaway gags and was a two-hander, noting that [...] "Clearly, the writers know exactly what the fans want." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leonardo da Vinci, (1452–1519) {{may have}} been the first in Europe to {{recognize}} certain special optical qualities of the eye. He derived his insights partly through introspection but mainly through a process that could be described as optical modelling. Based on dissection of the human eye he made experiments with water-filled crystal balls. He wrote [...] "The function of the human eye, ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it to be completely different." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) is {{believed}} to be the first to recognize the special optical qualities of the eye. He wrote [...] "The function of the human eye ... was described by a large number of authors in a certain way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it to be completely different." [...] His main experimental finding was that there is only a distinct and clear vision at the line of sight—the optical line that ends at the fovea. Although he did not use these words literally he actually is the father of the modern distinction between foveal and peripheral vision.|$|E
2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks.

2500|$|The Battle of Iuka {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a long professional enmity between Rosecrans and Grant. The Northern press gave accounts very favorable to Rosecrans at Grant's expense. Some rumors circulated that the reason Ord's column had not attacked in conjunction with Rosecrans was not that the battle had been inaudible, but that Grant had been drunk and incompetent. Grant's first report of the battle was highly complimentary to Rosecrans, but his second, written after Rosecrans had published his own report, took a markedly negative turn. His third statement was in his Personal Memoir, where he wrote [...] "I was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka—but I had so high an opinion of General Rosecrans <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> no fault at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, Marty Sliva of IGN was {{critical}} of Trico's behavior during puzzles combined with camera controls making sections of the game more frustrating, particularly during interiors due to the cramped nature of certain levels {{and the size of}} Trico detracting from the experience, calling it [...] "rare to even have to think about the camera in a third-person game in 2016, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself constantly being pulled out of the experience trying to wrestle with my point of view". Sliva however still felt that the game succeeded in the attachment with its characters and delivered memorable moments despite its issues. Game Revolutions James Kozanitis found that there were moments that Trico would continue with traversing the environment and performing tasks even without player input, making the act of controlling Trico at times [...] "ineffective and unnecessary".|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, Hay was {{described}} as being a very serious and private man, some thought he may have a dark side due to his demeanour. Peter Ustinov, who made his film debut in The Goose Steps Out as a straight man to Hay, said in a 1990 interview when asked about working with him [...] "Well, Will Hay wasn't very funny <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> that very few comics are." [...] as well as [...] "And Will Hay was always {{wrapped in a blanket}} at certain hours and had his tea, and we all stopped talking while he was having his tea, and then we went on shooting. I don't remember him saying anything memorable, nothing I could remember at all. He was very funny when you saw him on the screen, but in life all those people are very, very strange." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{well-known}} third-gender group in India {{is perhaps the}} hijra of northern India. The hijra is the only sect that practices castration, a custom introduced during Muslim rule around the tenth century A.D. Male castration is not recommended in the Vedas {{and is not a}} traditional Hindu practice. There are an estimated 50,000 hijra in northern India. After interviewing and studying the hijra for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book, Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, as follows: [...] "There is a widespread belief in India that hijras are born hermaphrodites [...] and are taken away by the hijra community at birth or in childhood, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> no evidence to support this belief among the hijras I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens." [...] Nanda also states: [...] "There is absolutely no question that at least some hijras – perhaps even the majority – are homosexual prostitutes. Sinha's (1967) study of hijras in Lucknow, in North India, acknowledges the hijra role as performers, but views the major motivation for recruitment to the hijra community as the satisfaction of the individual's homosexual urges..." [...] The hijras especially worship Bahuchara, the Hindu goddess presiding over transsexuality.|$|E
