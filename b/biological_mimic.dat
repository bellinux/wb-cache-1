Prussian blue, considered as a practical, economical, safe, and environmently friendly drug, has {{been approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in clinic to therapy the radioactive exposure. Importantly, the PBNPs were highly dispersible and stable in both water and <b>biological</b> <b>mimic</b> environments such as blood serum without the appearance of aggregation within 1  week [16], and have good photothermal stability that could reuse the PBNPs during practical applications [17]. For example, Liang et al. [13] firstly demonstrated that PBNPs with strong absorption in the NIR region can be used as an excellent contrast agent to enhance photoacoustic imaging. PBNPs with uniform size and good colloidal stability can be fabricated from low-cost chemical agents by an easy way.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to develop methods of {{assessing}} soft biological tissue quality using structure-property relationships. “Tissue quality” is here taken to mean {{the condition of the}} biological tissue structure which can be quantified in terms of features at a range of scales, including histological features. The purpose is to serve as a diagnostic aid in clinics and provide quantitative information that might replace the more traditional palpation. It is recognised that any structure-property relationship may be local to particular areas and may be differently expressed at a range of scales of probe size. In order to arrive at some generic outcomes, two model systems were chosen, one a <b>biological</b> <b>mimic</b> (gelatin-oil mixtures) which had the advantage that certain aspects of the structure could be varied. The biological system was chosen to be ovine connective tissue (collagen-lipid mixture) because it was expected to be similar in its components to the mimic, although with a more natural variation in structure. Static and dynamic indentation tests were carried out on all of the material and the static and dynamic elastic and viscoelastic properties were determined. Two experimental rigs were developed, a macro-scale one with a 0. 5 mm radius indenter and micro-scale one with a, pyramidal indenter of base side 4 µm, height 6 µm and opening angle. The macro-scale rig was purpose-built with indentation distance being controlled using software specifically configured for the work. The macro-scale rig was a modified atomic force microscope with a piezo-ceramic actuator being used to vibrate the specimen stage. Experiments were carried out under displacement control, with the mean indentation distance in the range from 1 - 4...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Cerenkov {{emission}} is induced when a {{charged particle}} moves {{faster than the}} speed of light in a given medium. Both x-ray photons and electrons produce optical Cerenkov photons in everyday radiation therapy of tissue; yet, this phenomenon has never been fully documented. This study quantifies the emissions and also demonstrates that the Cerenkov emission can excite a fluorophore, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), embedded in biological phantoms. Methods: In this study, Cerenkov emission induced by radiation from a clinical linear accelerator is investigated. <b>Biological</b> <b>mimicking</b> phantoms were irradiated with x-ray photons, with energies of 6 or 18 MV, or electrons at energies 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 MeV. The Cerenkov emission and the induced molecular fluorescence were detected by a camera or a spectrometer equipped with a fiber optic cable. Results: It is shown that both x-ray photons and electrons, at MeV energies, produce optical Cerenkov photons in tissue mimicking media. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Cerenkov emission can excite a fluorophore, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), embedded in biological phantoms.

40|$|Scaffolds {{suitable}} for tissue engineering applications like dermal reconstruction were prepared by Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) starting from a ternary solution PLLA/dioxane/water. The experimental protocol {{consisted of three}} consecutive steps, a first quench from the homogeneous solution to an appropriate demixing temperature (within the metastable region), a holding stage for a given residence time, and a final quench from the demixing temperature to a low temperature (within the unstable region). A large variety of morphologies, in terms of average pore size and interconnection, were obtained upon modifying the demixing time and temperature, owing to the interplay of nucleation and growth processes during the residence in the metatable state. An interesting combination of micro and macro-porosity was observed for long residence times in the metastable state (above 30 min at 35 °C). Preliminary degradation tests in a <b>biological</b> <b>mimicking</b> fluid (D-MEM with bovine serum) showed a significant weight loss during the initial stages (ca. 30 % in 30 days) related to the degradation of the amorphous part, followed by a negligible weight loss in the next days (few percent from 30 to 60 days) ...|$|R
