5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is {{startled by the}} lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium <b>because</b> <b>two</b> pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not sit well with Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose <b>because</b> <b>two</b> bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E

Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared <b>because</b> <b>two</b> {{versions of the same}} person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E
5|$|Szigetvár {{was divided}} into three {{sections}} divided by water: the old town, the new town and the castle—each of which {{was linked to the}} next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was <b>because</b> <b>two</b> other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched.|$|E

Police Service of Northern Ireland Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leighton estimated that 40,000 fans would travel from Northern Ireland to Dublin, despite each competing county only being allocated approximately 10,000 match tickets. Declan Martin, policy director for Dublin Chamber of Commerce, expected the revenue {{generated in the}} city {{as a result of the}} final to double <b>because</b> <b>two</b> sides from Ulster were involved.|$|E
5|$|A {{decade after}} Virginia Tech's {{selection}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl {{and five years}} after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game {{that served as the}} national championship game, Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game. The No. 9 Hokies finished the regular season 10–2 and won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship their first year in the conference, winning an automatic bid to the game. Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 Auburn Tigers, who had gone 12–0 during the regular season. Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, but <b>because</b> <b>two</b> other teams had also gone undefeated during the regular season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the National Championship game.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} claim in his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on {{studying}} the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this claim. Survival stories persist <b>because</b> <b>two</b> bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. Most historians believe that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Ekaterinburg.|$|E

5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 <b>because</b> <b>two</b> sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with The Sporting News in August 1951, Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox for outfielder Dick Wakefield as {{a major factor in}} his inability to secure a new contract. The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash, but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute, leading to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary. Chandler voided the trade, making Wakefield's contract the Yankees' responsibility and angering their owner, Del Webb. It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed. Historian John Paul Hill considers this unlikely, however, <b>because</b> <b>two</b> of Chandler's strongest allies, Connie Mack and Walter Briggs, Sr., were ardently opposed to integration while William DeWitt, the second owner in the American League to integrate, voted against him. Hill points to the Dick Wakefield dispute, as well as Chandler's investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner Fred Saigh involving their rumored connections to gambling interests, as more compelling reasons for Chandler's dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) <b>because</b> <b>two</b> methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E

5|$|On April 9, 2013, media {{reported}} that Apple Inc. had prohibited {{the sale of}} issue 12 of Saga through iOS, <b>because</b> <b>two</b> panels that depicted oral sex between men in a small, in-set image violated Apple's restrictions on sexual content. This resulted in criticism by artists and writers, who pointed to similarly explicit content in previous issues and in other works sold through iTunes. William Gibson and others suggested that the restriction could have occurred specifically because the drawings in question depicted gay sex.
