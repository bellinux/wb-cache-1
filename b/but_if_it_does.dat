People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} any {{pool of water}} that mingles with the water of a mikveh is as valid as the mikveh itself. The Mishnah taught that one may immerse in holes and crevices of a cavern just as they are, but one may not immerse {{in the pit of}} a cavern except if it has an opening as big as the tube of a water skin. Rabbi Judah taught that this is the case when it stands by itself (and forms an {{independent}} pool separated by a wall from the pool in the cavern), <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not stand by itself, one may immerse in it just as it is (for {{it is part of the}} pool in the cavern).|$|E
500|$|After Neighbours, Dale {{struggled}} to find work in Australia because he was typecast as Jim Robinson. His only regular sources of income were voice-overs, and publishing magazines about his former show which he [...] "made {{quite a lot of}} money out of". He lost most of his profits investing in a failed children's magazine. In 1999, he was cast in the American TV film First Daughter, which was filmed in Australia. After discovering he could perform a convincing American accent, Dale attended the film's premiere, finally moving with his family to the United States permanently in January 2000. Dale, his second wife Tracey, and their then two-year-old son Nick moved into an [...] "awful little flat" [...] in Los Angeles and found an agent. Dale recalled telling his wife in Melbourne that [...] "there's no way this is going to work. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> it proves you can do anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Compare this {{extract from}} one of the later rasa'il Netton {{provides}} on pg 102 of his Muslim Neoplatonists: [...] "Know, O Brother, that if these qualities are united simultaneously in one human being, during one of the cycles of astral conjunctions, then that person is the Delegate (al-Mab'uth) and the Master of the Age (Sahib al-Zaman) and the Imam for the people as long as he lives, If he fulfills his mission and accomplishes his allotted task, advises the community and records the revelation, codifies its interpretation and consolidates the holy law, clarifies its method and implements the traditional procedures and welds the community into one; if he does all that and then dies and passes away, those qualities will remain in the community as its heritage. If those qualities, or most of them, are united in one in his community, then he is the man suited to be his successor in his community after his death. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not happen that those qualities are united in one man, but are scattered among all its members, and they speak with one voice and their hearts are united in love for each other, and they cooperate in supporting the faith, preserving the law and implementing the sunna, and bearing the community along the path of religion, then their dynasty will endure in this world and the outcome will be happy for them in the next."

60|$|We {{have had}} to stretch the {{definition}} of the class of birds so as to include birds with teeth and birds with paw-like fore limbs and long tails.

50|$|A crucial {{assumption}} {{about the}} technology is that both firms have the same constant unit cost of production, so that marginal and average costs are the same and equal to the competitive price.

If price is equal to unit cost, then it is indifferent to how much it sells, since it earns no profit. Obviously, the firm will never want to set a price below unit cost, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> would not want to sell anything since it would lose money on each unit sold.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{full motion}} video-based games (also called {{interactive}} movies) had already become {{a subject of}} ridicule by the time Ripper began development, considerable effort {{was focused on the}} game's full motion video sequences.

50|$|Speed at some instant, or assumed {{constant}} {{during a}} very short period of time, is called instantaneous speed.
