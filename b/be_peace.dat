5|$|In early summer, Maslama {{ordered his}} fleet {{to join him}} and with his army crossed the Hellespont (Dardanelles) at Abydos into Thrace. The Arabs began their march on Cοnstantinople, {{thoroughly}} devastating the countryside, gathering supplies, and sacking the towns they encountered. In mid-July or mid-August, the Arab army reached Constantinople and isolated it completely on land by building a double siege wall of stone, one facing the city and one facing the Thracian countryside, with their camp positioned between them. According to Arab sources, at this point Leo offered to ransom the city by paying a gold coin for every inhabitant, but Maslama replied that there could not <b>be</b> <b>peace</b> with the vanquished, and that the Arab garrison of Constantinople had already been selected.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} Anglo-Maratha war, Shinde and Holkar had lost {{many of their}} territories to the British. They {{encouraged}} the Pindaris to raid the British territories. The Pindaris, who were mostly cavalry, {{came to be known}} as the Shindeshahi and the Holkarshahi after the patronage they received from the respective defeated Maratha leaders. The Pindari leaders were Setu, Karim Khan, Dost Mohammad, Tulsi, Imam Baksh, Sahib Khan, Kadir Baksh, Nathu, and Bapu. Of these, Setu, Karim Khan, and Dost Mohammad belonged to Shindeshahi and the rest to Holkarshahi. The total strength of the Pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33,000. The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India. The result of the Pindari raids was that Central India was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable to support themselves on the land. They had no option but to join the robber bands or starve. In 1815, 25,000 Pindaris entered the Madras Presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on the Coromandel coast. Another band swept the Nizam's kingdom while a third entered Malabar. Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817. Francis Rawdon-Hastings saw that there could not <b>be</b> <b>peace</b> or security in India until the predatory Pindaris were extinguished.|$|E

25|$|From the 1040s to 1130 {{the country}} was at peace. In 1130 the civil war era broke out {{on the basis of}} unclear {{succession}} laws, which allowed all the king's sons to rule jointly. For periods there could <b>be</b> <b>peace,</b> before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The Archdiocese of Nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings. The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the church's influence of the king. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of Håkon Håkonsson, who introduced clear law of succession.|$|E
500|$|Aldfrith's {{relations}} with the Church were, however, not always smooth. [...] He inherited from Ecgfrith a troubled relationship with Wilfrid, a major ecclesiastical figure of the time. [...] Wilfrid, the bishop of York, had been exiled by Ecgfrith {{for his role in}} persuading Ecgfrith's wife, Æthelthryth, to remain a saintly celibate. [...] In 686, at the urging of Archbishop Theodore, Aldfrith allowed Wilfrid to return. Aldfrith's {{relations with}} Wilfrid were stormy; the hostility between the two was partly caused by Aldfrith's allegiances with the Celtic Church, a consequence of his upbringing in exile. A more significant cause of strife was Wilfrid's opposition to Theodore's division, in 677, of his huge Northumbrian diocese. [...] When Wilfrid returned from exile the reconciliation with Aldfrith did not include Aldfrith's support for Wilfrid's attempts to recover his episcopal authority over the whole of the north. By 691 or 692 their differences were beyond repair. Wilfrid's hagiographer writes:For a while all would <b>be</b> <b>peace</b> between the wise King Aldfrith and our holy bishop, and a happier state of affairs could hardly be imagined. Then spite would boil up again and the situation would be reversed. And so they continued for years, in and out of friendship with each other, till finally their quarrels came to a head and the king banished Wilfrid from Northumbria.|$|E

The leader of the Anglar plans on {{destroying}} the Lylat system, which Fox McCloud and crew set out to save. The Star Fox team has broken up, but re-assembles to fight the threat. Peppy is made the General of the Cornerian Army, replacing Pepper. Fox flew around the Lylat system with ROB on patrol, and Krystal broke off her relationship with Fox after she left the team, because he was afraid she would receive injury and it would affect him. Slippy finds love with a frog named Amanda, and spends less time with the team. Falco left the team and went around on solo missions (as he has done before in Star Fox Adventures), spending less time with a team also. Peppy's daughter Lucy joins the team for some missions. There are nine endings depending on paths chosen by the player, though the player is required to finish the game before having the options.

The college's campus was still under construction while virtually the entire male student body left for military service. Two hundred and thirty-two students, faculty members, and trustees served in the Civil War. A quarter of them were wounded and one in eight was killed. Two were awarded the Medal of Honor, and Abner C. Harding, a college trustee who raised a regiment composed largely of MC students, was commissioned a brigadier general for his leadership in the defense of Fort Donelson in 1863.
