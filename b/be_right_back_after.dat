5000|$|Dozens {{of unique}} spells {{can be learned}} from scrolls that use the various {{elements}} of nature (wind, earth, fire, and water). Each character has to learn the spells individually with no spell sharing allowed. Spells are lost when the character that was holding them temporarily disappears from the party along with any armed weapon or armor that he was carrying. The equipment and spells <b>are</b> gained <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the character re-joins the group. Symbols determine the effects of the spell. For example, a spell with an up arrow is a spell that increases the target's stats and a spell with a flame symbol on it is considered to be an attack spell (regardless of which element that spell actually belongs to). At the start of the game, a dying woman assigns the player the challenge of [...] "conquering the world." [...] For every enemy encounter that the player overcomes in battle, the warriors gain gold pieces and experience points. The combat system and some of the music used in the game is borrowed from vintage Final Fantasy games such as Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IV.|$|R
