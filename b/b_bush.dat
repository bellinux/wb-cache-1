30|$|The {{observed}} {{changes in}} LULC in the Borana rangelands {{have resulted in}} a substantial change in livestock holding at the household level, while communities in general lost their livestock asset and become destitute. This might further be linked to the combined effects of shifts in grassland cover and recurrent drought (Angassa and Oba 2007). Another contributing factor for LULC changes are the process of bush encroachment linked to rangeland degradation and fragmentation (Dalle et al. 2006; Angassa and Oba 2008 <b>b).</b> <b>Bush</b> encroachment is widespread since the last four decades with its negative effects on cattle production and pastoral communities’ livelihood (Angassa and Oba 2008 b). In the Borana rangeland, grazing resources have been owned communally and administered by the traditional institution where community leaders used to formulate bylaws about their use with respect to the spatial and temporal patterns of grazing and types of animals to be allowed to graze in a specific landscape (Oba 1998). Changes in LULC have weakened the traditional institution in resource management. As a result, the present condition of resource administration and management in terms of rangeland resource utilization is not as strong as some four decades ago. Overall, the trends in LULC changes can adversely affect rangeland resources and livelihood of the local people.|$|E

J. Env. Qual. 32 : 801 - 815. Three low-volume mini-sprinklers were tested for their efficacy to strip trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) from water. Deionized water spiked with TCE and PCE was pumped through a mini-sprinkler supported {{on top of}} a 1. 8 -m-tall. Water was collected in collection vessels at 0. 61 and 1. 22 m above the ground on support columns that were spaced at 0. 61 -m intervals from the riser base, and samples were composited per height and distance from the riser. Overall, air-stripping reduced dissolved concentrations of TCE and PCE by 99. 1 to 100 and 96. 9 to 100 %, respectively. Mini-sprinklers offer the advantages of (i) easy setup in series that can be used on practically any terrain; (ii) operation {{over a long period of}} time that does not threaten aquifer depletion; (iii) use in small or confined aquifers in which the capacity is too low to support large irrigation or pumping systems; and (iv) use in forests in which the small, low-impact droplets of the mini-sprinklers do not damage bark and in which trees can help manage (via evapotransporation) excess waste water...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) 				 California State University, Los Angeles, 2011 Committee members: Mary <b>B</b> <b>Bush,</b> Marilyn Elkins, Benjamin Bateman, Ruben QuinteroFolk Tales, Gothic, Horror, SteampunkA {{series of}} three short stories reinterpreting the fairy tales of Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Pinocchio as viewed through the lenses of {{contemporary}} Los Angeles-celebrity-tabloid culture while set against a steam-punk backdrop. These stories utilize twisted concepts of morality and consumerism espousing deviant forms of behavior much {{in the same manner}} canon fairy tales promote their own form of ethics. "Fleishstadt Market" establishes the moral compass by which the stories in this project orient themselves. Focusing on the self-destruction of a boy caught up in the spectacle of cultural excess, "Fleishstadt Market" is a descent into the madness of consumerism. "West Lazurene Avenue" features a young girl shunned by her blood relatives and thrust into the bizarre household of her new step-family. Her indoctrination into a cult obsessed with resurrecting the dead forces her to choose between dying as a sacrifice with her blood relatives and joining the cult to harvest her family's bodies. "Glannonstadt" is a first-person narrative in the voice of a necromantic puppet-maker who studies the human soul in an attempt to gain eternal life. His research leads him to steal the souls of children whom he uses to animate his puppets and, ultimately, graft his soul to that of an innocent child in an attempt to be reborn...|$|E
