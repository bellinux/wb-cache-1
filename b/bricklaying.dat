5|$|Horsfield {{was born}} in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. His father, Terry, was a coal miner, as was his grandfather. While still a schoolboy he started playing {{football}} for a men's team, Athersley Recreation, in the Barnsley Sunday League, and had an unsuccessful trial with home-town club Barnsley F.C. On leaving school, Horsfield took a college course in <b>bricklaying.</b> He continued playing football part-time, with Athersley, with Worsbrough Bridge in the Northern Counties East League, and with Football League club Scarborough, where he turned professional in July 1992. Given his league debut in March 1993 by manager Ray McHale, he was released after playing 12 league matches and returned to <b>bricklaying</b> and part-time football. After a nine-game spell with Halifax Town in 1994, he rejoined manager McHale at Guiseley, where his 36 goals helped the club to reach third place in the Northern Premier League Premier Division in the 1994–95 season. He moved on to Witton Albion, where he sustained a potentially career-threatening knee injury; after making a full recovery he returned to Halifax for a fee reported as £4,000.|$|E

5|$|To the south, is the Croquet lawn, {{previously}} {{a tennis}} court – Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn {{are a number of}} structures grouped around the Victorian kitchen garden, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in <b>bricklaying</b> when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of houses on the estate. In 1928 he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused some controversy. Near the kitchen garden are the Golden Rose walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.|$|E
5|$|Carre's and St. George's Academy {{operate the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which shares a common {{timetable}} {{between the two}} sites and allows for students to choose {{from a wide range}} of options at A-Level. Students may choose to apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial activities will take place. The Sixth Form, including Carre's, is co-educational. The majority of students take four A-levels subjects in year 12, with most choosing to focus on three in year 13. The Joint Sixth Form allows students to choose from a range of 65 optional vocational or academic subjects including: art and photography (separate A-Level or BTEC options), applied Science, biology, <b>bricklaying,</b> business (A-Level or BTEC), childcare, carpentry, chemistry, computing or ICT (A-Level or BTEC), drama or performing arts (A-Level or BTEC), electronics, engineering, English (language and/or literature), film or media studies, French, German, geography, government and politics, health and social care, history, hospitality and catering, law, mathematics and further mathematics, music (A-Level or BTEC), philosophy and ethics, psychology, physical education or sport (A-Level or BTEC), physics, product Design, public Services, light vehicle maintenance, Spanish, sociology, travel and tourism, and work skills. In addition, students may participate in General Studies at A-Level, and a range of extra-curricular activities, including the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including <b>bricklaying,</b> but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, Schwarzenegger {{and fellow}} {{bodybuilder}} Franco Columbu started a <b>bricklaying</b> business.

Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their <b>bricklaying</b> venture to start a mail order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Hauerwas {{was raised}} in Pleasant Grove, Texas, in a working-class family. He {{attended}} both Pleasant Grove High School (1954–56) and W. W. Samuell High School (1956–58). As {{the son of a}} bricklayer, Hauerwas was early on apprenticed to the craft of <b>bricklaying</b> under his father. The experience was extremely formative for his later life, as he himself has often compared the skill and hard work that <b>bricklaying</b> requires with both his own approach to theological work and the challenges of living a fully Christian life.|$|E
25|$|Other work {{processes}} involved {{minimizing the}} number of steps in doing individual tasks, such as <b>bricklaying,</b> by performing time and motion studies to determine the one best method, the system becoming known as Taylorism after Fredrick Winslow Taylor who is the best known developer of this method, which {{is also known as}} scientific management after his work The Principles of Scientific Management.|$|E
25|$|Gilbreth {{discovered}} his vocation {{as a young}} building contractor when he sought ways to make <b>bricklaying</b> faster and easier. This grew into a collaboration with his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees {{in all sorts of}} industries to find ways to increase output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, Gilbreth, Inc., focusing on such endeavors.|$|E
25|$|As both {{companies}} grew, the brothers realized that encouraging {{a foundation of}} skilled craftsmen would benefit the entire industry. So, in the early 1970s, they developed in-house carpentry and <b>bricklaying</b> apprenticeship programs, now known as Nabholz University. They were the first contractor-sponsored apprenticeship programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in Arkansas, and have grown into an important center of industry education. Nabholz University has produced more than 100 journeyman carpenters to date.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the novel}} deals mainly with Shukhov's squad (the 104th, which has 24 members), their {{allegiance}} to the squad leader, and the work that the prisoners (zeks) do. For example, they are seen working at a brutal construction site where the cold freezes the mortar used for <b>bricklaying</b> if not applied quickly enough. Solzhenitsyn also details the methods used by the prisoners to survive; the whole camp lives by the rule of survival of the fittest.|$|E
25|$|Masonry cements {{are used}} for {{preparing}} <b>bricklaying</b> mortars and stuccos, and {{must not be used}} in concrete. They are usually complex proprietary formulations containing Portland clinker {{and a number of other}} ingredients that may include limestone, hydrated lime, air entrainers, retarders, waterproofers and coloring agents. They are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent masonry work. Subtle variations of Masonry cement in the US are Plastic Cements and Stucco Cements. These are designed to produce controlled bond with masonry blocks.|$|E
25|$|Dirac {{was educated}} first at Bishop Road Primary School {{and then at}} the all-boys Merchant Venturers' Technical College (later Cotham School), where his father was a French teacher. The school was an {{institution}} attached to the University of Bristol, which shared grounds and staff. It emphasised technical subjects like <b>bricklaying,</b> shoemaking and metal work, and modern languages. This was unusual at a time when secondary education in Britain was still dedicated largely to the classics, and something for which Dirac would later express his gratitude.|$|E
25|$|Born in the Dutch town of Tegelen in 1956, Noten {{explored}} careers such as <b>bricklaying</b> {{and nursing}} at {{a psychiatric hospital}} before applying to art school. He enrolled in the Maastricht Academy for Applied Arts in the Netherlands, and in 1990 he obtained a degree from Amsterdam's Gerrit Rietveld Academie. From 2005 to 2008 Noten worked as a senior international {{research fellow at the}} Birmingham School of Jewellery of Birmingham City University in the UK. Since 2007 he teaches master classes at the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The {{affair was}} widely reported, {{especially}} in London, New York and Philadelphia. The Stewards of Henley Royal Regatta {{came in for}} heavy criticism. One interpretation {{was that they had}} excluded Kelly because they did not want an American to win the Diamonds. The publicity made Kelly widely popular and would later help his <b>bricklaying</b> business. The ban on Vesper was rescinded soon afterward and in 1937 the references in the Henley rules excluding manual labourers, mechanics, artisans and menial duties were deleted. In 2003, the Princess Grace Challenge Cup was launched as an event for women's quadruple sculls both in recognition of John B. Kelly and in memory of his daughter, Grace.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his national service, Book returned his <b>bricklaying</b> job in Bath and started playing for Frome Town. During the 1955–56 season Frome suffered financial difficulties, and sent letters to all their players permitting {{them to leave}} if they wished. Book showed his letter to a colleague, who played for Bath City of the Southern League. He in turn informed the Bath chairman, and Book signed for the club in January 1956. He spent {{seven and a half}} years at Bath, becoming captain {{in the latter part of}} his Bath career, and winning the Southern League title in 1960. In the 1962 close season, Malcolm Allison became Bath manager, beginning a long association between the two.|$|E
500|$|His {{early life}} is little documented, {{and one of}} the {{earliest}} recorded references to him is in 1719, when he and his elder brother Robert were admitted to the city of Norwich as [...] bricklayers. A critic of Brettingham's at this time claimed that his work was so poor that it was not worth the nine shillings a week (£ in [...] ) he was paid as a craftsman bricklayer. Whatever the quality of his <b>bricklaying,</b> he soon advanced himself and became a building contractor.|$|E
500|$|Following word of Benchley's resignation, {{freelance}} offers began piling up. He worked constantly while {{claiming he}} was intensely lazy. (According to legend, he submitted a magazine piece titled [...] "I Like to Loaf" [...] {{two weeks after}} deadline. His explanatory note: “I was loafing.”) He was offered $200 per basic subject article for The Home Sector, and a weekly freelance salary from New York World {{to write a book}} review column three times per week for the same salary he received at Vanity Fair. The column, titled [...] "Books and Other Things," [...] ran for one year and roved beyond literature to mundane topics such as <b>Bricklaying</b> in Modern Practice. Unfortunately for Benchley, however, his writing a syndicated column for David Lawrence drew the ire of his World bosses, and [...] "Books and Other Things" [...] was dropped.|$|E
500|$|He {{signed with}} Coventry City on his 17th birthday, though was {{initially}} only a part-time player {{as his father}} insisted that he also complete an apprenticeship in <b>bricklaying.</b> Under the stewardship of Harry Storer, the [...] "Sky Blues" [...] finished seventh in the Second Division in 1950–51, and Taylor made his debut in the Football League {{on the final day}} of the season, breaking Alf Wood's run of 261 consecutive first team appearances. The Birmingham Sports Argus described how [...] "if Peter's role [...] has denied him the glamour of a glorious achievement in action, he has his share of personal glamour. He's a tall fair-haired good looker, and so comely, that he was described as the film star of Highfield Road. Is single too." [...] Taylor did not stay single for long however, and married Lily Thorpe in June 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Damon Bennett - Damon was {{introduced}} (by Shawn) {{in the fourth}} season of the series in the episode Window Well to Hell. With the departure of Shawn, Damon became the senior contractor starting in the sixth season. [...] He is also the only series regular other than Mike himself {{to be part of}} Pasadena 911. [...] His specialty is carpentry, though he started in <b>bricklaying</b> (having come {{from a long line of}} bricklayers) and roofing.|$|E
2500|$|Poe {{may have}} known <b>bricklaying</b> through {{personal}} experience. Many periods in Poe's life lack significant biographical details, including {{what he did}} after leaving the Southern Literary Messenger in 1837. Poe biographer John H. Ingram wrote to Sarah Helen Whitman that someone named [...] "Allen" [...] said that Poe worked [...] "in the brickyard 'late {{in the fall of}} 1834'". This source has been identified as Robert T. P. Allen, a fellow West Point student during Poe's time there.|$|E
2500|$|They were {{involved}} {{in the development of the}} design for the Simmons Hardware Company's Sioux City Warehouse. The architects had specified that hundreds of [...] hardened concrete piles were to be driven in to allow the soft ground to take the weight of two million bricks required to construct the building. The [...] "Time and Motion" [...] approach could be applied to the <b>bricklaying</b> and the transportation. The building was also required to support efficient input and output of deliveries via its own railroad switching facilities.|$|E
2500|$|John Brendan Kelly Sr. (October 4, 1889 [...] June 20, 1960), {{also known}} as Jack Kelly, {{was one of the}} most {{accomplished}} American competitors in the history of the sport of rowing. He was a triple Olympic Gold Medal winner, the first to be so in the sport of rowing. He won 126 straight races in the single scull. [...] The Philadelphia-based Kelly also was a multimillionaire in the <b>bricklaying</b> and construction industry. He was the father of Grace Kelly, actress and Princess of Monaco (thus maternal grandfather of Albert II, Prince of Monaco), and of John B. Kelly Jr., an accomplished rower in his own right.|$|E
2500|$|As the regatta committee's minutes also note, it was rejecting Kelly {{because he}} was deemed ineligible because of his <b>bricklaying</b> work. The regatta's rules on amateurism {{excluded}} anyone ... who is or ever has been ... by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan or labourer. Two days before he was due to sail to the UK, with his passage booked and his boat boxed, Kelly received a telegram which said: [...] "Entry rejected; letter follows." [...] He never received the letter. The Henley Stewards later declared that they had informed the governing board for U.S. rowing as soon as Kelly's entry was processed, {{and that it was}} not their fault if the information was not passed on.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, {{he began}} <b>bricklaying</b> in Philadelphia {{and he also}} learned to row on the Schuylkill River. By 1916, Kelly was a {{national}} champion and the best sculler in the United States when, {{as part of the}} World War I call up, Kelly joined United States Army as a private. He rose to the rank of lieutenant when he was discharged in 1918. While in the army, he entered the armed forces boxing tournament as a heavyweight and ran up a 12-0 record before being waylaid by a broken ankle. Future World Professional Boxing Champion Gene Tunney won the tournament. In later years, Kelly would kid Tunney: [...] "Aren't you lucky I broke my ankle?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Renton Widden, Gilbreth's old Sunday School teacher, {{hired him}} for his {{building}} company. He was to start as a laborer, learn the various building trades, and work his {{way up in the}} firm. In July 1885 at age 17 he started as a bricklayer's helper. As he learned <b>bricklaying</b> he noticed the many variations in the bricklayers' methods and efficiency. This began his interest in finding [...] "the one best way" [...] of executing any task. He quickly learned every part of building work and contracting and advanced rapidly. He took night school classes to learn mechanical drawing. After five years he was a superintendent, which allowed his mother to give up her boarding house.|$|E
2500|$|While {{inspecting}} {{the roof of}} his clinic in 1940, Hayes slipped and fell, and died shortly thereafter. [...] His heirs sold the clinic and house to Charles and Alice Davis in 1940, and the Davises in turn sold the clinic (but not the house) to Stone in 1943. [...] Stone immediately began expanding the building. [...] He hired a brick-mason named Joe Chittum and mobilized idle nurses and relatives to mix mortar and aide in <b>bricklaying.</b> [...] By 1946, the building rose five stories at its highest point. [...] As the building continued to grow, Stone modified its design to fit around an old Maple tree growing on the lot, giving the building's northeast corner its awkward appearance. [...] The building's central six-story tower, completed in 1949, briefly served as a Civil Defense lookout for the nearby atomic energy installations at Oak Ridge.|$|E
2500|$|Moran himself leaned {{strongly}} {{in the direction of}} his patient's being [...] "by nature very apprehensive"; close associates of Churchill have disputed the idea that apprehension was a defining feature of Churchill's temperament, although they readily concede that he was noticeably worried and anxious about some matters, especially in the buildup to important speeches in the House of Commons and elsewhere. Churchill himself all but openly acknowledged in his book Painting as a Pastime that he was prey to the [...] "worry and mental overstrain [...] by persons who, over prolonged periods, have to bear exceptional responsibilities and discharge duties upon a very large scale". The fact that he found a remedy in painting and <b>bricklaying</b> is a strong indicator that the condition as he defined it did not amount to 'clinical depression', certainly not as that term was understood during the lifetimes of himself and Lord Moran.|$|E
2500|$|Rushed into construction, a {{work group}} {{consisting}} of 23 carpenters, 12 bricklayers, and 30 general laborers built the amphitheater in just 28 days. A [...] "Colonel Curtis" [...] oversaw the work, {{under the supervision}} of General William Myers (the quartermaster in charge of the Washington, D.C., quartermaster's depot). A bowl was dug in the earth and the removed soil used to create a [...] high berm on which the pergola was erected. Excavation work was accomplished by contractor Harvey Bell. <b>Bricklaying</b> was done by the firm of Carroll & Shaw, and the carpentry work by contractor D.J. McCarty. Plastering, stuccoing, and painting of the pergola columns was done by contractor Joseph Beckert, while painting of the wooden trellis was accomplished by James Hudson. Sod was provided by Harvey Bell. At the time of its completion, no shrubs, trees, or vines had yet been planted at the amphitheater. A dais in the northern side of the amphitheater provided a platform for speakers and guests. The dais supported 12 round, smooth columns. To reinforce the dais and the trellis above it, the A. Schneider firm made and affixed metal braces. The dais columns were topped by Ionic capitals. The double base consisted of a two-stepped, round base with egg-and-dart decoration, below which was a simple square plinth. The capitals and bases were made of cast iron, and manufactured by James Hudson.|$|E
2500|$|On the site, {{construction}} {{started in}} October 1846, with demolition {{of the old}} slaughterhouse, water mills, bazaars and an entire block, and temporary bridges were built on either sides of the old canal, while old curbs and piles {{were removed from the}} seabed. [...] Ericson concluded there never was an isthmus connecting the two island, in opposition to later expertise who believe they were cut off around 1000 AD. [...] 2,000 piles were driven into the seabed, one about every two meters, and a bed of grit made up the leveled bed for the caisson. [...] Since the caisson was fit into place the <b>bricklaying</b> of the bottom, sills, and lower parts of the walls began. The caisson was lowered with ballast of gravel and rock waste before water was pored in and the box sank into place [...] the fit was perfect and the box so tight the planned hiring of a steam engine to pump it dry could be cancelled. As the masonry with mortar begun in May 1849, the ballast was gradually removed. [...] Limestone from Borgholm was used up to 12 feet over the bottom, while granite was cut locally for {{the upper part of the}} construction. [...] Between the inner walls of the caisson and the stone walls, homogeneous, well-worked clay was used as a protection against frost and decay, while compressed sand was used outside the caisson. The entire construction was completed in 1850 with the addition of the gates, made in wood below water and iron above, the drawbridges outside the gates, also made of iron, and a cast iron sign was finally added in the middle of the lock displaying: [...] "Built during the VII year of reign of Oscar I". [...] The costs ended at 335,000 riksdaler, 75 per cent below the estimated cost, while the entire project was completed a year before the scheduled five years.|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} to her afterwards that the chambermaid abroad is always an active and willing young man. The foreign girl fills in her time <b>bricklaying</b> and grooming down the horses. It is a young and charming lady who serves you when you enter the tobacconist's. She doesn't understand tobacco, is unsympathetic; with Mr. Frederic Harrison, regards smoking as a degrading and unclean habit; cannot see, herself, any difference between shag and Mayblossom, seeing that they are both the same price; thinks you fussy. The corset shop {{is run by a}} most presentable young man in a Vandyck beard. The wife runs the restaurant; the man does the cooking, and yet the woman has not reached freedom from bother.|$|E
60|$|As {{a source}} of information, Danny McCan was impossible. He did not like adventure. Wild life was a horror, and he had had nine years of it. Shanghaied in San Francisco, he had deserted the whaleship at Point Barrow with three companions. Two had died, and the third had {{abandoned}} him on the terrible traverse south. Two years he had lived with the Eskimos before raising the courage to attempt the south traverse, and then, within several days of a Hudson Bay Company post, he had been gathered in by a party of Snass's young men. He was a small, stupid man, afflicted with sore eyes, and all he dreamed or could talk about was getting back to his beloved San Francisco and his blissful trade of <b>bricklaying.</b>|$|E
60|$|Through {{that opening}} she had at several times {{abstracted}} the entire collection, which doubtless she {{had succeeded in}} converting into coin of the realm. When with an unconscious justice which deprives me of all satisfaction in the memory I decided to build her into the wall, by some malign fatality I selected {{that part of it}} in which were these movable stones, and doubtless before I had fairly finished my <b>bricklaying</b> she had removed them and, slipping through into the wine cellar, replaced them as they were originally laid. From the cellar she had easily escaped unobserved, to enjoy her infamous gains in distant parts. I have endeavored to procure a warrant, but the Lord High Baron of the Court of Indictment and Conviction reminds me that she is legally dead, and says my only course is to go before the Master in Cadavery and move for a writ of disinterment and constructive revival. So it looks as if I must suffer without redress this great wrong {{at the hands of a}} woman devoid alike of principle and shame.|$|E
