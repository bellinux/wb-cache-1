5|$|<b>Bottom</b> time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. <b>Bottom</b> time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how <b>bottom</b> time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define <b>bottom</b> time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the <b>bottom</b> time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E

5|$|From the 1986–87 season, {{the club}} {{finishing}} <b>bottom</b> of the Football League's basement division was {{relegated to the}} Conference National (now National League), {{the highest level of}} non-League football, depending on the ability of the Conference champions to meet FA requirements. Before this, clubs would lose their League status by failing to gain re-election after finishing in the <b>bottom</b> four of the <b>bottom</b> division. Since the 2002–03 season, the <b>bottom</b> two clubs of League Two face relegation to the Conference/National League.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with <b>bottom</b> fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} <b>bottom</b> longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The <b>bottom</b> trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E

5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing <b>bottom</b> and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another <b>bottom</b> place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the <b>bottom</b> half of the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from <b>bottom</b> spot that season.|$|E
