40|$|International audienceMassive pancreaticojejunal anastomotic bleeding, {{mainly from}} the {{gastroduodenal}} stump, {{is one of the}} most common complications of pancreatoduodenectomy. Selective angiography should be systematically the first step of investigative procedure in such situations. Pharmacoarteriography may be used if the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is not spontaneously identified, and allows safe and effective treatment with transcatheter arterial embolization compared to blind open surgical hemostasis. Coil embolization of the common or proper hepatic artery on either side of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> with "sandwich technique" is then the preferred technique to prevent retrograde filling. Surgery should be performed only as a last resort...|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{angiography}} procedure itself, most authors {{described a}} standard approach via the common femoral artery (CFA). Under local anaesthesia in the groin, the CFA is punctured {{with a needle}} and a 4 or 5 French sheath is then introduced using the Seldinger technique to secure access into the arterial tree. Our local practice is to start with an aortogram to delineate the anatomy first, then guided by CT positive findings a direct catheterisation of the suspected internal iliac artery would follow. Contrast is then injected to identify the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point,</b> identified as a focus of contrast extravasation/blush. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is used to guide the operator along the arterial map (49). Standard catheter use is by default recommended at our institution. However, if the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is not evident, further selective micro-catheterisation and angiogram of the pelvic arterial branches on the affected side is necessary to identify the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point.</b> Once this is evident, the bleeding artery is embolised accordingly {{using a variety of}} embolic material (e.g. micro-coils and/or glue), which is further discussed below.|$|R

40|$|Short term {{sclerotherapy}} (by injection(s) {{around the}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>point)</b> {{is used for}} immediate control of massive haemorrhage from oesophagogastric varices. The usefulness of longterm sclerotherapy once short term sclerotherapy has been successfully carried out was assessed. Two treatment groups were studied: 50 patients were treated by 'combined' (short term followed by longterm) sclerotherapy; 56 patients were treated by short term sclerotherapy only. Patients included in the second group were treated by short term sclerotherapy only if a variceal rebleeding was present. The overall cumulative proportion of patients rebleeding was not significantly different in either group. Combined sclerotherapy patients, however, experienced less episodes of variceal haemorrhage {{and the source of}} haemorrhage was different (p < 0. 002). Combined sclerotherapy was more efficient in preventing bleeding from oesophageal <b>bleeding</b> <b>points</b> but not those arising from a junctional source (p < 0. 05). A greater incidence of oesophageal rebleeding was found in those patients whose first source of bleeding was oesophageal (p < 0. 05). No significant difference was detected in survival expectancy between either group. In conclusion, after short term sclerotherapy is carried out successfully, those patients with bleeding from variceal <b>bleeding</b> <b>points</b> located on oesophageal mucosa should benefit most from a longterm sclerotherapy programme...|$|R

Prompt detection of the esophageal <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> by esophagoscopy followed by a balloon tamponade led to temporary hemostasis, during which time an emergency operation was prepared and started promptly. Two-staged surgery was performed with a successful outcome; direct vascular access to the right atrium and suturing of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> of ARSA through a T-shaped skin incision with median sternotomy were performed in the first surgery, and dividing the ARSA and repairing the esophagus were performed in the second surgery on the following day.

30|$|We {{selected}} a thoracoscopic operation. Thymectomy was initiated under general anesthesia {{with the patient}} in the lithotomy position using a single-lumen tracheal tube. Thoracoscopic thymectomy was performed as previously reported [1]. Dissection of the lateral edge of the thymus was performed using the LigaSure Maryland (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) running along the phrenic nerve. The {{left side of the}} thymus was dissected after the right side. However, when the left upper edge of the thymus was dissected, bleeding suddenly occurred. Pressure was immediately applied to the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> with an instrument. We confirmed that hemostasis had almost been obtained and thymectomy was continued. Following thymectomy, the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> became obvious. We recognized a small tear in the orifice of the left internal thoracic vein flowing into the innominate vein. The amount of blood loss was only 10  g, but we were unable to suck the blood flowing {{into the bottom of the}} thoracic cavity completely. The total operation time was 165  min (Additional file 1).|$|R
40|$|Aortoesophageal fistulas are a rare but {{commonly}} fatal {{complication of}} esophageal cancer. Reports of successfully managed cases are few, with high mortality and morbidity usually resulting from failure {{to control the}} initial massive haemodynamic insult. We report {{the case of a}} 47 -year-old Caucasian man with recently diagnosed advanced esophageal cancer who suffered an episode of massive haematemesis. Emergency gastroscopy revealed an arterial <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> in the proximal esophagus. A self-expanding metal esophageal stent was placed to achieve initial partial haemostasis. CT angiography confirmed an aortoesophageal fistula. An endoluminal stent device was thus inserted within the thoracic aorta stabilising the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point.</b> The patient subsequently made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on long-term antibiotics for palliative care. He survived for 2 months at home before dying of disseminated malignancy. The successful use of esophageal stenting as a means of achieving haemostasis, allowing time for endovascular intervention, is as yet a relatively unexplored area of management of this rare condition...|$|R

30|$|DSA is {{the gold}} {{standard}} for the investigation of haemobilia but is invasive and is usually reserved for when there is an intent to treat suspected haemobilia with vascular embolization. In the context of clinically significant haemobilia, 88 – 100 % of patients will have a <b>bleeding</b> <b>point,</b> pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous malformation identified on DSA (Zaydfudim et al., 2014; Fidelman et al., 2008; Bloechle et al., 1994).|$|R
30|$|Additional file 1 : The right lobe and {{the lower}} edge of the left lobe of the thymus were already dissected. During {{dissection}} of the upper edge of the thymus, sudden bleeding occurred.

We recognized a small tear in the orifice of the left internal thoracic vein flowing into the innominate vein.|$|R
30|$|We should {{immediately}} examine {{sources of}} bleeding through thoracotomy if <b>bleeding</b> <b>points</b> are unclear on CT. Thoracotomy {{prove to be}} both diagnostic and theoretically therapeutic [7]. When the patient has massive bleeding unexplained by the estimated <b>bleeding</b> <b>point,</b> thoracotomy must be done. A question arises as to the option of incision. Once cardiac rupture is strongly suspected, incision is basically rapid, especially in cardiac arrest. Left anterolateral thoracotomy is speedy but it gives very poor access to any cardiac structure except {{the apex of the}} left ventricle [9]. In addition, the extension of this incision across the sternum into a clamshell (bilateral anterior thoracotomies) leads to four more bleeding vessels (internal mammary arteries and veins) to contend with [9]. However, in our case, we ought to have chosen the left anterolateral thoracotomy in supine position for an exploration of the left thorax, because the advantage of the left anterolateral thoracotomy is that the incision might be extended to the right if we needed to explore the right thorax.|$|R
40|$|The term &# 34;ectopic varices&# 34; {{is used to}} {{describe}} dilated portosystemic collateral veins in unusual locations other than the gastroesophageal region.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the collar graft (standard dacron graft with a customized flexible collar attached to the proximal rim) decreased anastomotic bleeding and the overall clamp time. DesignProspective randomised single center study. MethodsBetween November 2003 and January 2006, 21 patients were treated with a collar graft and 19 with a standard dacron graft. Routine endoaneurysmorraphy was used. Only infra-renal aneurysms between 5. 5 cm and 6. 5 cm were included. Aneurysms were diagnosed by CT scans. The total number of <b>bleeding</b> <b>points,</b> the total clamp time, and the number of teflon felt pledgets, was determined. ResultsThe total number of bleeding points; the number of aortic re-clamps and total clamp time (minutes) per patient were all significantly lower in the collar graft group (1. 2 versus 2, p< 0. 04; 0. 5 versus 2. 0, p< 0. 001; 13. 6 versus 20. 1, p< 0. 003 respectively). The number of teflon felt pledgets and new sutures used was significantly lower in the collar graft group (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 003 respectively).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Although {{duodenal}} diverticula are common, periampullary duodenal diverticula are rare. Periampullary duodenal diverticula {{are usually}} asymptomatic {{and may be}} difficult to diagnose and treat. However, they may present with massive bleeding, requiring prompt diagnosis. Case presentation We report the case of a 71 -year-old Asian woman with bleeding from a periampullary duodenal diverticulum. She presented with severe anemia and tarry stools. Two examinations using a forward-viewing endoscope did not identify the source of the bleeding. However, examination using a side-viewing endoscope found an exposed bleeding vessel overlying the bile duct within a periampullary diverticulum of the descending part of the duodenum. The bleeding was successfully controlled by using hemostatic forceps. Conclusions Bleeding periampullary duodenal diverticula are rare, and a <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> in the mucosa overlying the bile duct within a large periampullary duodenal diverticulum is very rare. Identification of a <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> within a duodenal diverticulum often requires repeated examination and may require the use of a side-viewing endoscope. Use of hemostatic forceps to control bleeding from a periampullary duodenal diverticulum is very rare but, for bleeding lesions overlying the bile duct within a periampullary duodenal diverticulum, {{is the best way to}} prevent obstructive jaundice. </p...|$|R

30|$|In {{cases with}} a high {{suspicion}} of haemobilia or confirmed haemobilia on endoscopy, three or four phase CT can be performed. Though no studies have yet attempted to calculate the sensitivity of multiphase CT for identifying haemobilia, intermittent bleeding and slow flow bleeding are thought to cause {{a high rate of}} false negative results.

40|$|An 81 -year-old {{man with}} {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis presented with hematemesis, melena, and hypotension. Examination revealed as-cites and chronic liver disease stigmata. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple large columns of esophageal varices. No other bleeding sources were seen. Using a Cook 4, 6, 10 Shooter ® (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) multi-band ligator, the varix was ligated {{at the site}} of a platelet plug, which suggested recent hemorrhage (Figure 1). After blood extruded {{at the site of}} this defect, the ligated varix demonstrated the white ball sign (Figure 2). First described by Matsutani and colleagues, the white ball sign is observed after effective variceal ligation at the bleeding site. 1 – 3 It is hypothesized that the outflow of blood from the rupture point on the varix is the likely cause of this phenomenon. 1 – 3 Ligation at non-bleeding sites results in a purple ball appearance, representing congestion of blood in the variceal vessels captured by the band. 3 Other authors have noted that the white ball sign also occurs with ligation of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> on esophogogastric varices. 3 In the setting of variceal bleeding where the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is obscure, the white ball sign is particularly useful in confirming effective ligation. ...|$|R
40|$|Complications of diverticula of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, {{exclusive}} of Meckel's diverticula are extremely rare but can produce major diagnostic and therapeutic problems. Major reported complications include hemorrhage, perforation, biliary and pancreatic obstruction, and inflammation with intestinal obstruction. The mortality of complicated duodenal diverticula is reported from 33 to 48 %. Our experience {{with some of}} these complications is reported. This experience and a review of other reported cases have led to the following recommendations for surgical treatment. 1) Massively bleeding duodenal diverticulum. Precise localization of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> by endoscopy and/or arteriography is highly desirable. Excision or partial excision of the diverticulum with suture ligation of the <b>bleeding</b> <b>point</b> is necessary. 2) Perforated duodenal diverticulum. Excision or partial excision, secure closure and drainage are necessary. If peri-Vaterian, a probe should be passed through the ampulla of Vater via the common duct. Unless an entirely satisfactory closure is achieved, complete diversion of the enteric stream from the duodenum by vagotomy, antrectomy with closure of duodenal stump, and Billroth II anastomosis is recommended. 3) Choledochal obstruction due to duodenal diverticulum. Choledocho-duodenostomy. 4) Perforation, bleeding, or obstruction due to jejunal or ileal diverticulum. In rare cases, local excision of the diverticulum is feasible. Usually, resection of the involved segment with primary anastomosis is indicated...|$|R
