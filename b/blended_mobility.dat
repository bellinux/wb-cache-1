40|$|Charge {{transport}} in disordered organic blends is studied theoretically by numerically {{solving the}} Pauli master equation. The influence of morphology, disorder, electric field, and charge carrier concentration on <b>blend</b> <b>mobility</b> is assessed. Important differences between neat materials and blends are found. The dependence of mobility on charge carrier concentration is {{more pronounced in}} blends and it {{is influenced by the}} electric field strength. At low charge carrier densities, <b>blend</b> <b>mobility</b> is found to decrease with increasing field. Additionally, the impact of the volume ratio of the constituent materials and their domain size on the mobility is presented. Especially for strongly disordered materials charge transport is favored by relatively large domains. To compare these theoretical findings with existing experimental mobility data, the current density in a space-charge-limited device is computed. The author finds that, for the parameters and morphologies studied, the apparent mobility in such a device decreases with increasing bias voltage. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mobility}} is {{an important}} parameter for organic solar cell materials as it influences the charge extraction and recombination dynamics. In this study, the time of flight technique is used to investigate the charge mobility of the important organic photovoltaic materials PC 71 BM, PTB 7 and their <b>blend.</b> The electron <b>mobility</b> of PC 71 BM is {{in the region of}} 1 × 10 − 3 cm 2 /Vs for the neat fullerene film, and has a positive electric field dependence. At room temperature the hole mobility of PTB 7 is 1 × 10 − 3 cm 2 /Vs for the neat film and 2 × 10 − 4 cm 2 /Vs for their <b>blend.</b> The hole <b>mobility</b> of the <b>blend</b> reduces by a factor of a thousand when the sample is cooled from room temperature to 77 K. This finding is compared with the device performance of efficient PTB 7 :PC 71 BM solar cells for varying temperature. At 77 K the solar cell efficiency halved, due to losses in fill factor and short circuit current. Bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination increase at low mobility (low temperature) conditions, whereas at high mobility conditions the open circuit voltage reduces. The power conversion efficiency as a function of temperature has a maximum between 260 K and 295 K, revealing an optimized mobility at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Donor-acceptor organic {{solar cells}} often show high quantum yields for charge collection, but {{relatively}} low open-circuit voltages (VOC) limit power conversion efficiencies to around 12 %. We report here {{the behavior of}} a system, PIPCP:PC 61 BM, that exhibits very low electronic disorder (Urbach energy less than 27 meV), very high carrier <b>mobilities</b> in the <b>blend</b> (field-effect <b>mobility</b> for holes > 10 - 2 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1), and a very low driving energy for initial charge separation (50 meV). These characteristics should give excellent performance, and indeed, the VOC is high relative to the donor energy gap. However, we find the overall performance is limited by recombination, with formation of lower-lying triplet excitons on the donor accounting for 90 % of the recombination. We find this is a bimolecular process that happens on time scales as short as 100 ps. Thus, although the absence of disorder and the associated high carrier mobility speeds up charge diffusion and extraction at the electrodes, which we measure as early as 1 ns, this also speeds up the recombination channel, giving overall a modest quantum yield of around 60 %. We discuss strategies to remove the triplet exciton recombination channel...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of materials {{with the ability}} of intrinsic self-repairing after damage in a fashion resembling that of living tissues has important scientific and technological implications, particularly in relation to cost-effective approaches toward damage management of materials. Natural rubbers with epoxy functional groups in the macromolecular chain (ENR) and ethylene-methacrylic acid ionomers having acid groups partially neutralized with metal ions possess self-repairing behavior following high energy impacts. This research investigates the self-repairing behavior of both ENR and ionomers during ballistic puncture test {{on the basis of}} their thermal and mechanical properties. Heterogeneous blending of ionomers and ENR have also been used here as a strategy to tune the thermal and mechanical properties of the materials Interestingly, blends of sodium ion containing ionomer exhibit complete self-repairing behavior, whereas blends of zinc ion containing ionomer show limited mending. The chemical structure studied by ETIR and thermal analysis shows that both ion content of ionomer and functionality of ENR have significant influence on the self-repairing behavior of <b>blends.</b> The <b>mobility</b> of rubbery phases along with its interaction to ionomer phase in the blends significantly changes the mending capability of materials.

The technique (MIS-CELIV) allows selective measurement of both electron and hole mobilities of organic solar cells with active layers thicknesses representative of operational devices. The method {{is used to}} study the model high efficiency bulk heterojunction combination poly[N- 9 -heptadecanyl- 2, 7 -carbazole-alt- 5, 5 -(4, 7 -di- 2 -thienyl- 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole) ] (PCDTBT) and [6, 6]-phenyl C 70 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70 BM) at various blend ratios. The absence of bipolar transport in PCDTBT-and-PC 70 BM-only diodes is shown and strongly imbalanced carrier mobility {{is found in the}} most efficient optimized <b>blend</b> ratios.

40|$|This chapter {{looks at}} the growing {{proliferation}} of digital information, from place-bound desktops to pocket-sized portable digital technology, which has come to facilitate the mobility of modern society. In particular, it explores how budget travellers use a connected, pedestrian, personal and portable mobile sound technology - the iPod, a mobile auditory experience kept close to one's body - in everyday travel life. First, it {{looks at the}} mobility of budget travellers and the mobility of objects. Secondly, it conceptually discusses the 'everyday' and, thirdly, it examines how the iPod allows its user to weave {{in and out of}} public space and virtual space (or cyberspace). Fourthly, it looks at some of the consequences of travellers weaving in an out of these worlds. This is because, with the iPod, the public/private/virtual worlds intertwine, overlap, interact if not collide head on, causing new relationships, presences, absences, contexts and identities to change, emerge or be constrained (even if only temporarily). By examining how the iPod and <b>mobilities</b> <b>blend</b> together in the travelscape, one can examine the effects on a budget traveller's everyday activities, how they practise mobility, behaviour and management of everyday life and visualize the impact ubiquitous computing may have in the future...|$|R

The field effect mobilities of charge carriers in polymer and fullerene films and in various blend compositions were investigated {{for the effects of}} tempering.

The field effect mobilities of holes in films of the conjugated polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) were found to be in the 10 − 3 cm 2 /Vs range and the field effect mobilities of electrons in films of the methanofullerene [6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were found to be in the order of 10 − 2 cm 2 /Vs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, proton {{conducting}} copolymers, polymer blends and composites containing phosphonic acid {{groups have}} been prepared. Proton conduction mechanisms in these materials are discussed respectively in both, the anhydrous and humidified state. Atom transfer radical copolymerization (ATRCP) of diisopropyl-p-vinylbenzyl phosphonate (DIPVBP) and 4 -vinyl pyridine (4 VP) is studied {{for the first time}} in this work. The kinetic parameters are obtained by using the 1 H-NMR online technique. Proton conduction in poly(vinylbenzyl phosphonic acid) (PVBPA) homopolymer and its statistical copolymers with 4 -vinyl pyridine (poly(VBPA-stat- 4 VP) s) are comprehensively studied in both, the “dry” and “wet” state. Effects of temperature, water content and polymer composition on proton conductivities are studied and proton transport mechanisms under various conditions are discussed. The proton conductivity of the polymers is in the range of 10 - 6 - 10 - 8 S/cm in nominally dry state at 150 oC. However, proton conductivity of the polymers increases rapidly with water content in the polymers which can reach 10 - 2 S/cm at the water uptake of 25 % in the polymers. The highest proton conductivity obtained from the polymers can even reach 0. 3 S/cm which was measured at 85 oC with 80 % relative humidity in the measuring atmosphere. Poly(4 -vinyl pyridine) was grafted from the surface of SiO 2 nanoparticles using ATRP in this work for the first time. Following this approach, silica nanoparticles with a shell of polymeric layer are used as basic particles in a polymeric acidic matrix. The proton conductivities of the composites are studied under both, humidified and dry conditions. In dry state, the conductivity of the composites is in the range of 10 - 10 ~ 10 - 4 S/cm at 150 oC. While in humid state, the composites show much higher proton conductivity. The highest proton conductivity obtained with the composites is 0. 5 S/cm measured at 85 oC with 80 % relative humidity in the measuring atmosphere. The miscibility of poly (vinyl phosphonic acid) and PEO is studied {{for the first time in}} this work and a phase diagram is plotted based on a DSC study and optical microscopy. With this knowledge, homogeneous PVPA/PEO mixtures are prepared as proton-conducting polymer <b>blends.</b> The <b>mobility</b> of phosphonic acid groups and PEO in the blends is determined by 1 H-MAS-NMR in temperature dependent measurements. The effect of composition and the role of PEO on proton conduction are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} novel liquid {{crystals}} and amorphous organic conjugated semiconductors were synthesised by the chemistry {{branch of the}} Organophotonics group at Hull University. These compounds are studied electrochemically and optically to investigate the suitability of these materials as good donor/acceptor with suitable pairs energy levels for use in organic photovoltaic devices. Liquid crystal compounds with a fluorene-thiophene structure were identified as potential electron donors in combination with perylene based compounds as electron acceptors. Time-of-flight was used to study the charge transport of organic semiconductors in this thesis. The nature of the functional groups of the molecules {{was found to have}} a significant influence on the charge carrier mobility. The incorporation of a reactive end group with spacer affected the charge carrier mobility of electron donors negatively, suggesting that the mobility depends on the intermolecular separation. Based on the need to correlate the charge transport of the donor/acceptor blends with photovoltaic devices, the electron and hole mobility were studied for blends. For all <b>blends</b> the hole <b>mobility</b> is lower than that of the pure electron donor. The electron <b>mobility</b> of the <b>blends</b> is much higher than that of the pure electron acceptor. The thermal activation of charge transport in the liquid crystals is investigated by applying the Gill model. The result shows that charge transport in the liquid crystals is thermally activated and the activation energy is field dependent. The Gaussian disorder model and correlated disorder model were used to analyze the mobility data of four liquid crystals compounds with the same conjugated core and different end groups. We show that the thin film nanoscale morphology and the phase separation of the donors/acceptors blends depend on the chemical structures of donors and acceptors, the casting solvents and the annealing temperature of the film. The functional groups of the perylene bisimide are found to influence the roughness. The surface roughness of the blended thin film is minimum and its phase separation finest when the electron donors component has short terminal aliphatic groups rather than long polymerisable chains. Chlorobenzene shows the best performance as coasting solvent. The annealing temperature is significant in controlling the nanoscale morphology and the phase separation of an intermixed network of the blends. We successfully demonstrate photovoltaic performance using blends of our novel donors and acceptors. The annealing temperature is very important to optimise the solar cell performance by optimisation of the phase separation. The perylene based liquid crystals have disappointing performance as electron acceptors. The donor with the shortest terminal end group gives the best result. The device performance fully correlates with the blend nanoscale morphology of the blends; the blend with the smallest domains gives best power conversion efficiency; the best device has a value of 1. 1 %.
