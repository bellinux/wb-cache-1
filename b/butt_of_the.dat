5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E

25|$|The {{armament}} of the Phalangites {{is described}} in the Military Decree of Amphipolis. It lists the fines imposed upon the soldiers who fail to maintain their armament or produce it upon demand. Offensive weapons were a pike (sarissa), and a short sword (machaira). The sarissa was over 6m (18ft) in length, with a counterweight and spiked end at the rear called a sauroter; {{it seems to have}} had an iron sleeve in the middle which may mean that it was in two pieces for the march with the sleeve joining the two sections before use. Like the xyston, the sarissa was greatly tapered towards the point. This, along with the sauroter, helped to make the point of balance as far towards the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapon as possible. It should be stressed that the archaeological discoveries show that the phalangites also used the two-edged sword (xiphos) as well as the traditional Greek hoplite spear (doru/δόρυ), which was much shorter than the sarissa. The sources also indicate that the phalangites were on occasion armed with javelins. The sarissa would have been useless in siege warfare and other combat situations requiring a less cumbersome weapon.|$|E

500|$|In {{the harsh}} {{economic}} {{times of the}} early Depression, films and performers often featured an alienated, cynical, and socially dangerous comic style.

In Employee's Entrance, a woman enters the office of a scoundrel boss who remarks, [...] "Oh, it's you — I didn't recognize you with all your clothes on." [...] Racial stereotypes were usually employed when ethnic characters appeared. Blacks in particular were usually the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wisecrack, never the author.

500|$|Harmon has {{emphasized}} the importance of the cast to making the premise of the comedy work. [...] "Casting was 95 percent of putting the show together," [...] he said in an interview. He had worked with several of the cast members earlier; Joel McHale, John Oliver and Chevy Chase all had cameo roles in episode 9 of Water and Power, the short film series produced by Harmon for Channel 101. Actor Chevy Chase had long been a favorite of Harmon. Though principally not very partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded to take the job by the quality of the show's writing. Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: [...] "What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop." [...] Harmon had to warn Chase against playing a [...] "wise-ass" [...] the way he often does in his roles, since the character of Pierce is a rather pathetic figure who is normally the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joke himself.|$|E

[...] In his review for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray found that Lennon's composition [...] "verges uncomfortably on self parody" [...] with Starr left as [...] "the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joke".

500|$|Darlington formed {{part of the}} new Northern Section of the Third Division in 1921–22. Healey was {{no longer}} a first choice in the forward line, but {{appeared}} not infrequently, particularly when the ground was heavy. He made his first appearance on 24 December and played in nine of the next twelve fixtures. Replacing the injured Arthur Wolstenholme for the FA Cup match against Manchester City, he opened the scoring with a header, but City won 3–1. He kept his place for the next match, and even after Wolstenholme's return to fitness continued in the team, with a winning goal against Rochdale, four of Darlington's six to beat Hartlepools United in the Durham Senior Cup, and profiting from a defensive error to score the only goal of the league visit to Tranmere Rovers. Healey was retained for the 1922–23 season, and he scored against Accrington Stanley in September, but he played mainly in the reserves. In a match against Hartlepools' reserves in November, he was the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd's mockery because he had, as the Northern Daily Mail put it, [...] "now lost some of his former vigour".

500|$|Stela 6 {{is located}} {{on the south side of}} the Main Plaza in Group C, just north of the South Pyramid. It was {{discovered}} in 1988 and had been broken into many pieces, although the base of the stela was still in situ. Two other large fragments were lying on the surface and more than 100 smaller fragments were collected. The stela appears to have shattered when it fell, some time after Motul de San José had been abandoned. The north and south faces of the stela bore sculpted designs, the remaining <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stela has the left foot of a human figure worked in profile on the south side. The sculpture on the north side has been pieced together in part and appears to have shown the figure of a ruler of the city dressed in rich clothing and regalia. The figure was positioned performing a dance, with one foot half lifted off the ground. In his right hand the ruler held a God K sceptre. The prelimanry reconstruction of the sculpture indicates that the figure of the king measured between [...] high. Stela 6 is very similar to Stela 1 from Dos Pilas with both depicting the ruler in an identical position.

500|$|There {{is little}} record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC; Cicero (c. 50 BC), who was much {{interested}} in Greek philosophy, had little to say about Cynicism, except that [...] "it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor." [...] However, by the 1st century AD, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of Imperial Rome, like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier, {{may have led to}} a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again. Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtue. Lucian complained that [...] "every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog," [...] and Aelius Aristides observed that [...] "they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence." [...] The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was Demetrius, whom Seneca praised as [...] "a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects." [...] Cynicism in Rome was both the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satirist and the ideal of the thinker. In the 2nd century AD, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus, nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, Demonax, in a dialogue.|$|E

500|$|The Kaguru of Tanzania and the Kujamaat of Southern Senegal view hyenas as {{inedible}} and greedy hermaphrodites. A mythical African tribe {{called the}} Bouda is reputed to house members able to transform into hyenas. A similar myth occurs in Mansôa, Guinea-Bissau. These [...] "werehyenas" [...] are executed when discovered, {{but do not}} revert to their human form when killed. In Khoikhoi mythology, the spotted hyena is often the <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jackal's tricks. Gogo folklore links the spotted hyena to the origin of death; in one tale, the hyena prevents humanity from achieving immortality, thus ensuring it can continue to eat corpses. A similar tale is present among the Meru. In their narrative, the supreme god Murungu sent a mole to inform humanity {{that they would be}} reborn after death. Fearing this would deprive it of corpses to eat, the hyena prevents the mole from ever delivering the message. Madi and Nuer mythology links the spotted hyena to the separation between heaven and earth; at one time, humanity kept in contact with the Creator in the sky via a cowhide rope, which was subsequently severed by a hungry hyena. The spotted hyena is a sacred totem animal for some Pedi tribes, with the skin often being used as robes by chieftains and their bones as divining instruments. According to the doctrine of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, hyenas are unclean animals which represent sexual deviancy and lawlessness. The Egyptian Saint abba (Father) Matewos of Asfoni was associated with hyenas; one fable tells of how he rescued a cub trapped in a pit, and had his feet licked in gratitude by its mother. In Ethiopian folklore, an albino hyena called the [...] "King of Hyenas" [...] is ascribed great power. Some ethnic groups in Ethiopia associate themselves with hyenas; the Gurage traditionally believe that their ancestors migrated from Arabia to Ethiopia using hyenas as mounts. In Dorze tradition, the highest Demuṣa-priests have the ability to control hyenas, and will send them to punish defaulting debtors.|$|E
