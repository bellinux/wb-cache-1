The <b>business</b> <b>surveys</b> reviewed in this section {{provide an overview of}} key recent evidence of the Scottish economy. <b>Business</b> <b>Surveys</b> are primarily conducted to provide data needed for calculating key economic indicators that monitor the economy over time and for constructing official statistics. The rapid rate of change in economic data creates a demand for quick estimators/indicators of these changes ideally ‘as they are happening’. Survey data have the advantages of essentially being instantaneously accessible, never being revised and furthermore having little or no measurement errors. The latest set of Scottish <b>Business</b> <b>Surveys</b> are not particularly strong and show that many of the key benchmark indicators continued to slow in the most recent quarters, perhaps highlighting the impacts of the continuing low oil price and the low value of the pound on the Scottish economy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>surveys</b> are {{a useful}} tool and provide {{accurate}} and timely data that are extremely helpful in pinpointing subtle movements in the economy. <b>Business</b> <b>surveys</b> collect information {{on a wide range}} of topics such as business confidence, orders, turnover, exports, investment, employment etc. and when analysed provide a view of the overall economy. They are also useful for short term forecasting and pinpointing turning points. Many <b>business</b> <b>surveys</b> use net balances, determined by subtracting the percentage reporting declines from the percentages reporting increases. A number of recent surveys continue to show that more and more businesses report that net trends, although remaining positive, have eased somewhat (with a growing number of respondents reporting ‘no change’) and despite many of the trends reported not being quite as high as recent quarters, most remain positive and more importantly for many of the respondents to recent <b>Business</b> <b>Surveys,</b> expectations remain strong and at pre-recession levels...|$|R

40|$|Response {{rates to}} <b>business</b> <b>surveys</b> are often quite low. Because {{of the special}} {{circumstances}} and characteristics of <b>business</b> <b>surveys,</b> average responses rates to <b>business</b> <b>surveys</b> may range from lows of 10 % to no higher than about 50 %. We were interested in understanding whether these low response rates were {{in part due to}} the survey mode, and whether business respondents had preferences for different survey modes. In a recent mail <b>survey</b> of <b>businesses</b> in Washington State, we included a question, asking business respondents what their most preferred survey mode was. The response options included the following: mailed survey, telephone survey, web survey, face-to-face survey, and no preference. The sample of 2, 626 businesses was stratified by geographic region, business size, and industry. The mail survey was implemented using total design methods (TDM) and three follow-ups to encourage a high response rate. The survey included an internet response option, and also a telephone followup of nonrespondents. The telephone followup attempted to get information from <b>businesses</b> on their <b>survey</b> mode preferences. A total of 1265 businesses responded to the survey, with 1152 responding by mail, and 113 responding on the web. Another 1041 of the nonresponding businesses were contacted by telephone. This paper presents an analysis of the survey mode preferences by business strata. We also compare the results of survey mode preferences for respondents and nonrespondents. The mode preferences of business responding by mail and those responding by web are different, and our paper presents these differences. We discuss the implications of these survey mode preferences for improving response rates to <b>business</b> <b>surveys</b> in the future...|$|R

First, we assess the merits of a novel questioning method to gather information about tax evasion by means of <b>business</b> <b>surveys.</b> This approach allows estimating the prevalence of tax evasion, but it does not allow identifying whether the individual firm engages in tax evasion or not, therefore providing incentives for survey participants to answer truthfully. Second and contrary to most other <b>business</b> <b>surveys,</b> we differentiate between two common modes of tax evasion, namely underreporting of sales and informal supplements to official wages (‘envelope wages’). Using evidence from Serbia, we show that the estimated share of firms which underreport sales and wages, respectively, by at least 10...|$|R
