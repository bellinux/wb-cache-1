25|$|On 24 July 1913, {{a meeting}} of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was held in a meadow in <b>Bullace</b> Lane where the Australian suffragist, Miss Muriel Matters, had been invited to address a {{gathering}} on the subject of votes for women. The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895. Florence kicked off the meeting by mounting the wagon which was being used as a stage. Her introduction {{made it clear that they}} were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.|$|E

6000|$|... "You mean Miss M. recites?" [...] inquired Miss <b>Bullace,</b> {{leaning forward}} over her lap. [...] "But how entrancing! It is we, then, who are birds of a feather. And how I should adore {{to hear a}} fellow-enthusiast. Now, won't you, Lady Pollacke, join your entreaties to mine? Just a stanza or two!" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{lightning}} grimace {{swept over}} Miss <b>Bullace's</b> square features.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{nearly all}} damsons, <b>bullaces</b> may be either [...] "white" [...] (i.e. yellow or green) or [...] "black" [...] (i.e. blue or purple) in colour, and ripen {{up to six}} weeks later in the year. Though smaller than most damsons, <b>bullaces</b> are {{much larger than the}} closely related sloe. Their flavour is usually rather acidic until fully ripe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then pity 'tis, 'tis true," [...] cried she, {{as if in}} Miss <b>Bullace's</b> words. [...] "But please, Miss M., it must be {{the briefest}} of adieus. There are so many of my friends who would enjoy your company--and those {{delightful}} recitations. Walter, will you see that everything's quite--er--convenient?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The first {{visitor to}} appear was none but Miss <b>Bullace,</b> whose recitation of [...] "The Lady's 'Yes'" [...] had so peculiarly inspirited Fanny. She sat square and dark with her broad lap {{in front of}} her, and {{scrutinized}} me as if no emergency ever daunted her. And Lady Pollacke recounted the complexity of ties that had brought us together. Miss <b>Bullace,</b> alas, knew neither Mr Ambrose Pellew, nor my godmother, nor even my godmother's sister, Augusta Fenne. Indeed I {{seemed to have no}} claim at all on her recognition until she inquired whether it was not Augusta Fenne's cousin, Dr Julius Fenne, who had died suddenly while on a visit to the Bermudas. Apparently it was. We all at once fell into better spirits, which were still more refreshed when Lady Pollacke remarked that Augusta had also [...] "gone off like that," [...] and that Fennes were a doomed family.|$|E
60|$|Instinct prevailed. Just as I {{could not}} bring myself to {{complete}} Tom o' Bedlam with Miss <b>Bullace</b> looking {{out of her eyes}} at me, so I {{could not bring}} myself to offer money to Lady Pollacke's nice prim parlourmaid. Instead I hastily scrabbled up in tissue paper a large flat brooch--a bloodstone set in pinchbeck--a thing of no intrinsic value, alas, but precious to me because it had been the gift of an old servant of my mother's. I hastened out and lifting it over my head, pushed it into her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly, {{perfectly}} true," [...] assented Miss <b>Bullace.</b> [...] "Now mine is {{a verbal}} memory. My {{mind is a}} positive magnet for words. Method, of course, is everything. I weld. Let us say that a line of a poem terminates with the word bower, and the next line commences with she, I commit these to memory as one word--Bowershee--and so master the sequence. My old friend, Lady Bovill Porter--we were schoolfellows--recommended this method. It was Edmund Kean's, I fancy, or some other well-known actor's. How else indeed, could a great actor realize what he was doing? Word-perfect, you see, he is free." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this {{a sudden}} gush of shame welled up in {{me at the}} thought that through all my {{troubles}} I had never once remembered the kindnesses of my step-grandfather; that he, too, might be dead. I was so rapt away by the thought that I caught only the last three words of Miss <b>Bullace's</b> murmured aside to Lady Pollacke, viz., [...] "not blush unseen." ...|$|R
6000|$|Throughout {{these first}} three stanzas all went well. So rapt was my {{audience}} that I {{seemed to be}} breaking {{the silence of the}} seas beyond their furthest Hebrides. But at the first line of the fourth--at [...] "With a heart"--my glance unfortunately wandered off from the unheeding face of the image and swam through the air, to be caught, as it were, like fly by spider, by Miss <b>Bullace's</b> dark, fixed gaze, that lay on me from under her flat hat.|$|R
6000|$|I {{smiled to}} myself at remembrance of Dr Phelps and his blushes. After all, if {{humanity}} should [...] "dwindle into a delicate littleness," [...] {{it would make}} a good deal more difference than he had supposed. What a destruction would ensue, among all the lesser creatures of the earth, the squirrels, moles, voles, hedgehogs, and the birds, not to mention the bees and hornets. They would be the enemies then--the traps and poisons and the nets! No more billowy cornfields a good yard high, no more fine nine-foot hedges flinging their blossoms into the air. And all the long-legged, [...] "doubled," [...] bloated garden flowers, gone clean out of favour. It would be a little world, would it be a happier? The dwarfed Mrs Bowaters, Dr Phelpses, Miss <b>Bullaces,</b> Lady Pollackes.|$|R
6000|$|In a rich falsetto she {{repeated}} Mr Crimble's [...] "few words" [...] of sympathetic apology for her absence: [...] "'I must ask your indulgence, ladies and gentlemen, for a lamentable hiatus in our programme.'" [...] She gave us Miss Willett's and Mr Bangor's spirited rendering of [...] "Oh, that we two"; {{and of the}} recitation which rather easily, it appeared, Mrs <b>Bullace</b> had been prevailed upon to give as an encore after her [...] "Abt Vogler": [...] "The Lady's 'Yes,'" [...] by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. And what a glance of light and fire she cast me {{when she came to}} stanza six of the poem:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was in}} vain. Even if he {{had asked}} me only to whisper {{the rest of the}} poem into his long, pink ear, for his sake alone, I could not have done so. Moreover, Mr Crimble was still nodding his head at his mother in {{confirmation}} of his applause; and Miss <b>Bullace</b> was assuring me that mine was a poem entirely unknown to her, that, [...] "with a few little excisions," [...] it should be instantly enshrined in her repertory--"though perhaps a little bizarre!" [...] and that if I made trial of Lady Bovill Porter's Bowershee method, my memory would never again play me false.|$|E
60|$|The summons was to me. My {{moment had}} come, but I was {{prepared}} for it. In my last ordeal I had broken down because I had chosen a poem that {{was a kind of}} secret thing in my mind. So, after receiving Lady Pollacke's letter, I had hunted about for a recitation as short, but less personal: one, I mean, whose sentiments I didn't mind. And since Mrs <b>Bullace</b> had chosen two of Mrs Browning's pieces for her triumph on New Year's Eve, I argued that she knew the parish taste, and that I could do no better. Of course, too, composure over what I was going to do was far more important than the composition.|$|E
60|$|Accustomed {{as we are}} to our {{excellent}} {{vegetables and}} luscious fruits, we can hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the wild carrot and parsnip, or the little shoots of the wild asparagus, or crabs, sloes, etc., should ever have been valued; yet, from what we know of the habits of Australian and South African savages, we need feel no doubt on this head. The inhabitants of Switzerland during the Stone-period largely collected wild crabs, sloes, <b>bullaces,</b> hips of roses, elderberries, beechmast, and other wild berries and fruit. (9/8. Prof. O. Heer 'Die Pflanzen der Pfahlbauten' 1866 aus dem Neujahr. Naturforsch. Geselschaft' 1866; and Dr. H. Christ in Rutimeyer's 'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 226.) Jemmy Button, a Fuegian on board the 'Beagle,' remarked {{to me that the}} poor and acid black-currants of Tierra del Fuego were too sweet for his taste.|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{origin of}} Prunus domestica subsp. insititia is still {{extremely}} debatable: {{it is often}} thought to have arisen in wild crosses, possibly in Asia Minor, between the sloe, Prunus spinosa, and the cherry plum, Prunus cerasifera. Despite this, tests on cherry plums and damsons have indicated {{that it is possible}} that the damson developed directly from forms of sloe, perhaps via the round-fruited varieties known as <b>bullaces,</b> and that the cherry plum did not play a role in its parentage. Insititia plums of various sorts, such as the German Kriechenpflaume or French quetsche, occur across Europe and the word [...] "damson" [...] is sometimes used to refer to them in English, but many of the English varieties from which the name [...] "damson" [...] was originally taken have both a different typical flavour and pear-shaped (pyriform) appearance compared with continental forms. Robert Hogg commented that [...] "the Damson seems to be a fruit peculiar to England. We do not meet with it abroad, nor is any mention of it made in any of the pomological works or nurseryman's catalogues on the Continent". As time progressed, a distinction developed between the varieties known as [...] "damascenes" [...] and the (usually smaller) types called [...] "damsons", to the degree that by 1891 they were the subject of a lawsuit when a Nottinghamshire grocer complained about being supplied one when he had ordered the other.|$|R
6000|$|My old {{habit of}} {{hunting in the}} crannies of what I read had ample {{opportunity}} here. Two things stood out in my mind: a kind of astonishment at Mr Crimble's [...] "stumbling bark" [...] which he was asking me to help to steer, and inexpressible relief that Fanny's letter was buried beyond hope of recovery before he could call that afternoon. The more I pitied and understood his state of mind, the more helpless and anxious I felt. Then, in my foolish fashion, I began again picturing in fancy the ceremony that would bring Mr Crimble and my landlady into so close a relationship. Why did he fear the wagging of tongues so much? I didn't. Would Miss <b>Bullace</b> be a bridesmaid? Would I? I searched in my drawer and read over the [...] "Form of Solemnization of Matrimony." [...] I came to [...] "the dreadful day of judgment," [...] and to [...] "serve" [...] and [...] "obey," [...] and shivered. I was not sure that I cared for the way human beings had managed these things. But at least, bridesmaids said nothing, and if I---- ...|$|E
60|$|Bud-variation, {{which was}} fully {{discussed}} {{in a former}} chapter, shows us that variability may be quite independent of seminal reproduction, and likewise of reversion to long-lost ancestral characters. No one will maintain that the sudden appearance of a moss-rose on a Provence-rose {{is a return to}} a former state, for mossiness of the calyx has been observed in no natural species; the same argument is applicable to variegated and laciniated leaves; nor can the appearance of nectarines on peach-trees be accounted for on the principle of reversion. But bud-variations more immediately concern us, as they occur far more frequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a length of time, than on other and less highly cultivated plants; and very few well- marked instances have been observed with plants growing under strictly natural conditions. I have given one instance of an ash-tree growing in a gentleman's pleasure-grounds; and occasionally there may be seen, on beech and other trees, twigs leafing at a different period from the other branches. But our forest trees in England can hardly be considered as living under strictly natural conditions; the seedlings are raised and protected in nursery-grounds, and must often be transplanted into places where wild trees of the kind would not naturally grow. It would be esteemed a prodigy if a dog-rose growing in a hedge produced by bud-variation a moss-rose, or a wild <b>bullace</b> or wild cherry- tree yielded a branch bearing fruit of a different shape and colour from the ordinary fruit. The prodigy would be enhanced if these varying branches were found capable of propagation, not only by grafts, but sometimes by seed; yet analogous cases have occurred with many of our highly cultivated trees and herbs.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{names have}} appeared, but {{are likely to}} {{represent}} either the above broad types or variations of them; Abercrombie and Mawe, writing in 1779, described three types of <b>bullace,</b> the [...] "white", [...] "black" [...] and [...] "red". Loudon also mentions a black, white and red <b>bullace,</b> as well a double flowered variety flore pleno. Hogg described an [...] "Essex Bullace", which appears in all respects identical to the Shepherd's <b>Bullace,</b> and a [...] "Royal Bullace", said to bear very large, yellow-green fruit. A [...] "New Large Bullace", probably synonymous with the Royal <b>Bullace,</b> was occasionally mentioned, described as {{very similar to the}} Shepherd's <b>Bullace</b> but with larger leaves, many of which were glandless, a much more vigorous habit, and lighter cropping.|$|E
5000|$|The Black <b>Bullace</b> is {{the common}} [...] "wild" [...] <b>bullace</b> of woods in England, {{recognisable}} by its small, round black or dark purple fruit. It is sometimes classified as insititia var. nigra. [...] It can be quite astringent until very ripe, or subject to a slight frost; a larger variety known as the [...] "New Black Bullace" [...] was later developed from it.|$|E
5000|$|The Langley <b>Bullace,</b> or [...] "Veitch's Black Bullace", {{is by far}} {{the newest}} variety, being first raised in 1902 by the Veitch {{nurseries}} at Langley, Berkshire. It was a cross between an Orleans plum and the Farleigh damson, and is therefore not considered a true <b>bullace</b> in some sources. This is the largest variety, and when ripe - which occurs in November - is much the sweetest.|$|E

5000|$|Like other {{varieties}} of Prunus domestica, the <b>bullace</b> {{may have had}} its origin in hybrids between the sloe (Prunus spinosa) and cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera), though {{there is also evidence}} that domestica was solely descended from the latter. Another theory suggests that the <b>bullace</b> developed (or was selected) over time from the sloe, without the involvement of Prunus cerasifera. Prunus insititia is still, however, occasionally regarded as a separate (entirely native) species. It is possible that the <b>bullace</b> is genuinely native to the United Kingdom: the horticulturalist Harold Taylor, in his book The Plums of England, described it as [...] "the only truly English plum", observing that all other hybrid varieties of plum and damson had at least some non-native origins.|$|E
50|$|Four main {{varieties}} of <b>bullace</b> are recognised in England: the White, Black, Shepherd's and Langley. The <b>bullace</b> {{may be found}} as a small tree, growing to around 8 metres in height, or as a bush, distinguishable from the sloe by its broader leaves and small number or complete absence of spines. There is, however, a wide variation between trees in different districts due to hybridization and local selection. Bullaces generally ripen in October-November, rather later than other types of plum, and fruit heavily. They may sometimes be found growing wild in woods or hedgerows, particularly near old farmhouses; others {{may be found in}} old gardens or orchards, or can still be purchased from some nurseries.|$|E
5000|$|To confuse matters, the White <b>Bullace</b> was in {{the past}} sold in London markets under the name of [...] "white damson". Bullaces can usually be {{distinguished}} from damsons by their spherical shape, relatively smooth stones, and poorer flavour, and generally ripen up to a month later in the year than damsons.|$|E
50|$|Plant remains {{indicate}} {{the cultivation of}} cereals, lentils, beans, peas {{and a kind of}} plum called <b>Bullace.</b> Remains of the following animal species were recovered during excavations: Persian fallow deer, goat, sheep, mouflon and pig. More remains indicate Red deer, Roe deer, a kind of horse and a kind of dog but no cattle as yet.|$|E
50|$|Bullaces {{are often}} stated to only be {{suitable}} for cooking. As well as being used for stewing and making various fruit preserves, they were also traditionally used to make fruit wine, and a <b>bullace</b> pie was stated {{to be one of}} the usual centrepieces of a 19th-century harvest home supper in the south of England. However, some bullaces are palatable raw when sufficiently ripe.|$|E
50|$|Although once cultivated, and {{familiar}} to gardeners of the Tudor period, the <b>bullace</b> gradually {{fell out of}} favour as newer, larger or sweeter types of damson or plum displaced it, and it hung on at the fringes of cultivation. Its hardiness meant that, like the damson, it was occasionally planted as a windbreak or hedging tree, and until the 20th century was regarded as valuable for providing fruit very late in the year.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bullace</b> is {{a variety}} of plum. It bears edible fruit {{similar to those of}} the damson, and like the damson is {{considered}} to be a strain of the insititia subspecies of Prunus domestica. Although the term has regionally been applied to several different kinds of [...] "wild plum" [...] found in the United Kingdom, it is usually taken to refer to varieties with a spherical shape, as opposed to the oval damsons.|$|E
5000|$|The White <b>Bullace,</b> {{sometimes}} {{classified as}} insititia var. syriaca, has small, yellowish fruit, with greenish flesh. A very old variety, {{it was once}} known in Cambridgeshire and Essex by the name [...] "cricksies" [...] or [...] "crickses", formed on an earlier plural [...] "creeks", and probably originating in Anglo-Norman creke. It was grown in large quantities in Norfolk in the 19th century, for use in preserving or cooking; Hogg described the flesh as [...] "firm, juicy, sweet and subacid". It is also occasionally {{referred to as the}} [...] "Golden Bullace".|$|E
50|$|On 24 July 1913, {{a meeting}} of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was held in a meadow in <b>Bullace</b> Lane where the Australian suffragist, Miss Muriel Matters, had been invited to address a {{gathering}} on the subject of votes for women. The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895.

Her introduction {{made it clear that they}} were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the damson is its distinctive rich flavour; unlike other plums it is both high in sugars and highly astringent. The fruit of the damson can also be identified by its shape, which is usually ovoid and slightly pointed at one end, or pyriform; its smooth-textured yellow-green flesh; and its skin, which ranges from dark blue to indigo to near-black depending on the variety (other types of Prunus domestica can have purple, yellow or red skin). Most damsons are of the [...] "clingstone" [...] type, where the flesh adheres to the stone. The damson is broadly similar to the semi-wild <b>bullace,</b> also classified as ssp. insititia, which is a smaller but invariably round plum with purple or yellowish-green skin. Damsons generally have a deeply furrowed stone, unlike bullaces, and unlike prunes cannot be successfully dried. Most individual damson varieties can be conclusively identified by examining the fruit's stone, which varies in shape, size and texture.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} book, Cynthia and Philip Rylands, a wealthy British couple, are {{entertaining}} guests at Casa Terragena, an Italian villa with a famous garden on the Italian Riviera. Among the party are a prominent author, [...] "the great Mr. Sempak," [...] an American aesthete, Mr. Plantagenet-Buchan, the beautiful, vivacious Lady Catherine, Col. and Mrs. <b>Bullace,</b> Lady Grieswold, {{and a number}} of others. At dinner, Sempak, a brilliant talker with ideas similar to Wells's, expounds the idea that a [...] "Great Age" [...] is certain to come, and that contemporaries are obliged in the present to live, as it were, [...] "meanwhile": [...] "Since nothing was in order, nothing was completely right. We lived provisionally. There was no just measure of economic worth; we had to live unjustly .... We were justified in taking life as we found it; in return if we had ease and freedom we ought to do all that we could to increase knowledge and bring the great days of a common world-order nearer, a universal justice, the real civilisation, the consummating life, the days that would justify the Martyrdom of Man." ...|$|E
50|$|The dunnocks {{moved to}} a <b>bullace</b> bush by Forge Farm where they nested and laid four more eggs. Meanwhile a cuckoo {{who was raised in}} the valley had {{migrated}} from Africa and substituted the dunnocks' fourth egg for her own feeling the need to lay. The cuckoo egg hatched three and a half days {{after the first of the}} dunnocks' eggs and that evening whilst the parents searched for food the newborn evicted the dunnock weakling who broke her neck when she landed on the ground and was eaten by a fox. The following day the cuckoo had evicted the other female dunnock nestling who survived the fall out of the bush but was taken by a jay. On the cuckoo's seventh day the dunnock father was hit by a car whilst searching for food in the early morning light and was eaten by a crow when he died. The remaining dunnock nestling spent much of his time and energy dodging attacks from the cuckoo and the feeding became less frequent with the mother being the sole provider. When the dunnock nestling was two days away from full growth the cuckoo tried to evict him but he survived by perching on the branches of the bush. He did the same the following day and on the next day he practiced flying.After learning to hunt for himself the young male dunnock flew away wanting to be independent.|$|E
5000|$|From those humble {{beginnings}} in the 18th {{century was}} to come the industrial base on which the growth and prosperity of Dartford were founded. In 1840 the mustard factory of Saunders & Harrison was described as being [...] "perhaps {{the largest in the}} kingdom". Dartford Paper Mills were built in 1862, when excise duty on paper was abolished. Between 1844 and 1939 the fabric printing works of Augustus Applegath were in being in <b>Bullace</b> Lane: again a firm using the waters of the river. RAF Joyce Green, at Long Reach, near Dartford {{was one of the first}} Royal Flying Corp airfields, It was established in 1911 by Vickers Limited (the aircraft and weapons manufacturer, who used it as an airfield and testing ground. It was superseded by Biggin Hill, and closed in 1919. The demand created by World War I meant that output at the local Vickers factory multiplied, with a positive effect on the local economy. Burroughs-Wellcome chemical works (later incorporated into GlaxoSmithKline) made Dartford a centre for the pharmaceutical industry. During the war, many Belgian refugees arrived in the town. Since the town was unable to accommodate them all, many people were housed with volunteers. There has been a large power station at Littlebrook on the Thames, to the north of the town, since 1939. The current station, which features one of the tallest chimneys in the UK, dates from about 1978.|$|E
