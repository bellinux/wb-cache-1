5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> transistors meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors. Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years.|$|E
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E

5|$|Slow-swimming but active, the blackmouth {{catshark}} is a generalist that preys {{on a wide}} variety of crustaceans, cephalopods, and fishes. Its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at tracking moving, bioluminescent prey. This species is oviparous, with females producing <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> up to 13 egg cases throughout the year. Because of its abundance, the {{blackmouth catshark}} forms a substantial part of the bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range. It has low economic value and is usually discarded, though the largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as there is no indication that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure.|$|E
