5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, iterated mathematical constructs having fractal dimension. Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa, corals, hydrozoa like the air fern, Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (internode length), and number of branches per <b>branch</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} axons' myelinated {{segments}} {{is important to}} the success of saltatory conduction. They should be as long as possible to maximize the speed of conduction, but not so long that the arriving signal is too weak to provoke an action potential at the next node of Ranvier. In nature, myelinated segments are generally long enough for the passively propagated signal to travel for at least two nodes while retaining enough amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node. Thus, the safety factor of saltatory conduction is high, allowing transmission to bypass nodes in case of injury. However, action potentials may end prematurely in certain places where the safety factor is low, even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the <b>branch</b> <b>point</b> of an axon, where it divides into two axons.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} {{of all the}} species and genera of the Rhinoceros family {{below the level of}} Rhinoceratidae has changed more rapidly {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century due to first the continued discovery of fossils representing new species and genera from China and Mongolia and second the number of points of morphology to be compared in computerised phylogenetic analysis.
