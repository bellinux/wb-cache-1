A similar experiment was conducted in year 2 with these two cultivars, plus 'Rubygem'. In year 3, plants in large, 125 -cm 3 cells were compared with small and large <b>bare-rooted</b> plants of 'Festival' and 'Rubygem'. Treatments {{in each of these}} experiments were planted on the same date. In the final experiment, plants in large cells and <b>bare-rooted</b> plants of 'Festival' were planted in late March, early April, mid-April, or early May. The plants grown in small cells produced 60 % to 85 % of the yields of the <b>bare-rooted</b> plants, whereas the yield of plants in large cells was equal to that of the <b>bare-rooted</b> plants. Containerized plants are twice as expensive as <b>bare-rooted</b> plants (A$ 0. 60 vs. A$ 0. 32) (A$=Australian dollar), and gave only similar or lower returns than the <b>bare-rooted</b> plants (A$ 0. 54 to A$ 3. 73 vs. A$ 1. 40 to A$ 4. 09). It can be concluded that containerized strawberry plants are not economically viable in subtropical Queensland under the current price structure and growing system. There was a strong relationship between yield and average plant dry weight (leaves, crowns, and roots) in 'Festival' in the last three experiments, where harvesting continued to late September or early October.

The surface range is about 5700 hectares, distributed in four natural groups of vegetation, two Apennine areas (Alpi, Spina -Zàccana, Pollino) and two coastal areas (Palanuda-Pellegrino, Montéa). In the mountain areas the species becomes exclusive and shows resistance to climate harshness at high elevation, ability to colonise ecologically difficult sites, aptitude and specific reliability to artificial spreading. The experimental plan, carried out without any repetition because technically unfeasible in the area, estimated three input variables: plastic bag-grown S 2 F 2 and <b>bare-rooted</b> seedlings S 2 T 2, inter-distance on the terrace (0. 5 m, 1 m, 1. 5 m), elevation a. s. l.

First, <b>bare-rooted</b> plants were obtained from Stanthorpe in southern Queensland from early March to mid-April/late April. Second, <b>bare-rooted</b> plants were sourced from Stanthorpe (a warm-growing area) or from Toolangi in Victoria (a cool-growing area). In Year 1 of the experiments, the nursery material from the different treatments was grown at Nambour in southeastern Queensland and fruit yield determined. The total weight of nonstructural carbohydrates/plant increased as digging was delayed and was higher in the plants from Stanthorpe than the plants from Toolangi. Plants dug on 17 Mar. in Year 1 had higher weights of non-structural carbohydrates [292 mg/plant dry weight (DW) ] than plants dug on 3 Mar.

40|$|SOIL EROSION At ICRAF's {{research}} station in Kenya's semi arid zone, low hedgerows of Cassia siamea, a leguminous shrub from Asia, {{planted on the}} contours {{have led to the}} natural formation of micro-terraces on land sloping at 14 %. The hedges take up less space than conventional conservation structures, leaving more land available for crop production. Subsequent heavy rain proved that fields with crops alone lost a very heavy tonnage of soil per hectare compared to the small losses from fields with hedgerows. Crop yields of maize and cowpea were also significantly higher where they were grown between hedgerows than in fields with crops alone. In Rwanda ICRAF researchers have also shown that contour aligned hedgerows of trees and grasses can lead to natural terrace formation and prevention of erosion. Screening trials have identified Sesbania sesban, a nitrogen-fixing tree, as a particularly promising species. Indigenous to the region, Sesbania grows quickly producing fuelwood, bean stakes, small poles and animal fodder in less than a year. Researchers have found ways of growing and then transplanting Sesbania as young <b>bare-rooted</b> seedlings. Results indicate that the <b>bare-rooted</b> seedlings of Sesbania sesban grow and survive nearly as well as seed lings produced in nurseries in polythene bags for transplanting. SOIL FERTILITY ICRAF is conducting improved fallow trials in collaboration with national programmes in Zambia and Cameroon. The system is based on planting fast-growing leguminous trees in rotation with food crops. During the fallow period, the trees capture atmospheric nitrogen and return this and other nutrients to the soil, primarily through leaf fall. At the end of the fallow period, the farmer harvests wood from the trees and returns all leafy material to the soil as nitrogen-rich mulch. In Southern Africa, after tree fallows of only one year, maize grain yields were as much as double the yields from control plots and 60 % higher than yields from plots with chemical fertilizers. The benefits are due not only to the capture and recycling of nutrients, but also to the improved physical properties of soil resulting from tree root penetration.

The growth of the leaves, crowns, roots, flowers and fruit over time followed a linear or sigmoid pattern. Maximum values of leaf, crown and root dry weight {{towards the end of}} the growing season about 190 days after planting were 30, 15 and 7 g/plant, respectively.

A qualitative analysis of the col-lected data showed that, in general, manual planting scored significantly higher than mechanised planting for plant position and planting quality. However, the quality of plant-ing resulting from mechanised operations was well within acceptable operational requirements. On the reforestation site, plant growth after one growing season was investi-gated. No overall significant differences in height growth and root collar diameter increment were found in the first growing season between mechanised and manual plant-ing operations. Plants grown in ‘fen containers ’ had the highest relative increase in height growth and root collar diameter, irrespective of planting method. The results showed that the Bräcke planting machine was capable of planting a range of containerised plants to an acceptable standard on both reforestation and afforestation sites. Fur-ther research to optimise the combination of machine, plant size and container type should result in improvements in both the quality and productivity of the planting opera-tions...|$|E
40|$|Turfgrasses {{range from}} {{extremely}} salt sensitive to highly salt tolerant. However, {{the selection of}} a salt tolerant turf is not a 'silver bullet' solution to successful turf growth on salt-affected parklands. Interactions between factors such as cultivar, construction practices, establishment, and maintenance can be complex and should not be considered in isolation of one another. Taking this holistic approach, a study investigating cultivar evaluation for salt-affected sites also included a comparison of topsoil materials as turf underlay, as well as pre-treatment of the sod. The turf species and cultivars used in the study were: Cynodon dactylon, cultivar 'Oz Tuff (I) '; Paspalum vaginatum, cultivars 'Sea Isle 1 (I) ' and 'Velvetene (I) '; Zoysia matrella cultivar 'A- 1 (I) '; and Zoysia japonica, cultivar 'Empire (I) '. The two underlay materials were compost (100 %) or a sandy clay topsoil each applied above a coastal sand profile to a depth of 10 cm. Rooting depth or root dry weight did not significantly differ among turf cultivars. Compost profile treatment had significantly greater root mass than the topsoil among all turf cultivars. This higher root production was reflected by improved quality of all turf at the final evaluation. Turfgrass grown on compost had a higher normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), regardless of whether full sod or <b>bare-rooted</b> turfgrass was used. The use of a quality underlay was paramount to the successful growth of the turf cultivars investigated. While each cultivar had superior performance in sub-optimal conditions, the key to success was the selection of the right species and cultivar for each situation combined with proper establishment and maintenance of each turf grass...|$|E
40|$|The aim of study: (1) {{to compare}} the {{survival}} rate, growth performance and nutrition of large and common-sized planting stock of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) on a frost-exposed site and (2)  to assess whether fertilizing had any effect on the plantations. Area of study: The Jizera Mts., an area heavily disturbed by air pollution situated on the Czech-Polish border close to Germany Materials and methods: Two types of planting stock were tested in a mountain frost hollow on an acidic mountain humic podsol: (a) the <b>bare-rooted</b> saplings 131 – 140 cm tall and (b) common-sized containerized transplants 26 – 35 cm. One half of the saplings and common-sized transplants were left untreated {{and the other half}} were fertilized with a low dose (30 g per tree) of a slow release fertilizer based on methylene urea and potassium magnesium phosphate. Growth performance and nutrition of plantations were investigated. Main results: Due to serious deformations and stem breakages inflicted by snow and frost, the prospects of common-sized transplants seem much worse than those of saplings. The height growth of saplings was significantly more rapid than that of common-sized transplants. As for growth, neither the saplings nor common-sized transplants did significantly respond to fertilizing. The effects of fertilizing on nutrition of rowans were unconvincing. The extreme temperature events during growth seasons and snow deformations in winters might be the decisive factors influencing growth performance of rowans under referred conditions. Research highlights: On the frost-exposed sites, the height of taller saplings might partly compensate for a missing shelter of forest stand since the terminal leaders are above ground-frost zone.

40|$|The {{inability}} {{of a plant}} to grow roots rapidly upon transplanting {{is one of the}} main factors contributing to poor establishment. In <b>bare-rooted</b> trees, treatments such as root pruning or application of the plant hormone auxin [e. g., indole butyric acid (IBA) ] can promote root growth and aid long-term establishment. There is little information on ornamental containerised plants, however, other than the anecdotal notion that 'teasing' the roots out of the rootsoil mass before transplanting can be beneficial. In the present study we tested the ability of various root-pruning treatments and application of IBA to encourage new root and shoot growth in two shrub species, commonly produced in containers - Buddleja davidii 'Summer Beauty' and Cistus 'Snow Fire'. In a number of experiments, young plants were exposed to root manipulation (teasing, light pruning, or two types of heavy pruning) and/or treatment with IBA (at 500 or 1, 000 mg l- 1) before being transplanted into larger containers containing a medium of 1 : 1 : 1 (v/v/v) fine bark, sand and loam. Leaf stomatal conductance (gl) was measured 20 min, and 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after root manipulation. Net leaf CO 2 assimilation (A) was measured frequently during the first week after transplanting, then at regular intervals up to 8 weeks after transplanting. Plants were harvested 8 weeks after transplanting, and root and shoot weights were measured. In both species, light root pruning alone, or in combination with 500 mg l- 1 IBA, was most effective in stimulating root growth. In contrast, teasing, which is commonly used, showed no positive effect on root growth in Buddleja, and decreased new root growth in Cistus. The requirement for exogenous auxin to encourage new root growth varied between experiments and appeared to be influenced by the age and developmental stage of the plants. There were no consistent responses between root treatments and net CO 2 assimilation rates, and changes in root weight were not closely correlated with changes in assimilation. The mechanisms whereby new root growth is sustained are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to study tree establishment, both how it may be {{improved}} in urban areas {{and how it is}} measured and defined. The establishment phase of trees is a period of reduced tree vitality, and a successful establishment is crucial for long-term survival and prosperity of newly planted trees. However, failed plantings and poor establishment is a common problem in the often harsh growing conditions present in urban areas. Improving tree establishment is thus important for securing the presence of trees in urban environments. Another important part is to understand how the process of establishment is expressed in trees, so that the needs of the trees can be met. Tree nursery industry has recently developed production systems that aim to produce trees that are better prepared for transplanting. This study set out to investigate the effect nursery production systems might have on tree establishment success, and to examine different ways of assessing establishment, since the term is not consistently defined. Sweet cheery and red oak trees, cultivated as either <b>bare-rooted</b> (BR), balled & burlapped (B&B), root-pruned (RP), air-potted (AP) or fabric container (FC) grown were planted at one urban and one rural site in Southern Sweden. The trees were studied during the final nursery year and the four first post-transplant years. The production systems influenced total root length for both species, providing root systems with large differences in appearance. Shoot growth was restored to pre-transplant values for RP, FC and B&B sweet cherry trees at the rural site, three years after transplanting. Water status was significantly higher for AP trees than BR trees of both species, but only during the first year after transplanting, at the rural site. In general, effects of production system were more pronounced at the rural site with the higher water availability, indicating that none of the studied production systems was superior to use in urban plantings. Visual assessments of the establishment success of the trees were affected by leaf size, colour and shape. Leaf size was related to water status. Water status and shoot growth measurements were not correlated during the first years after transplanting. The term establishment can be used in different ways, and the differences might affect the outcome of an establishment assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{plantations}} of Shorea javanica K. &V. (Dipterocarpaceae) in {{the district}} of Krui (Lampung province, Sumatra; see Fig. 1 for situation map and main climatic data) are remarkable examples of successful land development after deforestation and shifting cultivation which was mentioned in the Indonesian forestry literature as far back as 1937 (Rappard 1937). This tree is a white Meranti which is locally found in the natural forest and tapped for its beautiful, crystalline resin, or "damar". The local name of the tree is "Damar Mata Kucing", which means "cat's eye resin". One of the traditional cultivation systems in the area is shifting cultivation ("ladang") : rain-fed rice is grown during one or two years and then coffee, other crops, and damar trees are planted to convert the ladang into a permanent agricultural field. The damar trees close their canopies above the other crops after some years and can be tapped for resin after about 15 years and during a rotation of approximately 50 years. They constitute dense stands of 40 — 50 m high trees called "kebun damar" (damar gardens) which look like a natural rain forest. Seeds for planting stock were formerly obtained from the surrounding natural forest but nowadays they come from the pre-existing plantations which cover an area of approximately 1000 ha (Scholz 1983). Fruiting seasons are occasional and irregular, often several years spaces, so that the farmers manage large nurseries of seedlings which can be maintained for several years and transplanted to the plantations when needed. Transplantation of <b>bare-rooted</b> seedlings is easy. Other useful trees (e. g. clove trees), are simultaneously planted in the ladang at the time of planting the damar trees, so that, although the latter largely dominate, the resulting stand is a multi-layered, mixed one, comprising of different useful plants (fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, etc.). The whole cultivation system, from the shifting cultivation stage to the establishment of a permanent tree plantation, constitutes an efficient agroforestry system which is extensively described by Michon 1984, 1985; Michon et al 1984; and Torquebiau 1984. The resin of Shorea javanica is traditionally used for torches, caulking boats, batik coloring, etc., and is now exported to industrial countries where there is market for uses such as food additives, cosmetics, paints, varnishes...|$|E
