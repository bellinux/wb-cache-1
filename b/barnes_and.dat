5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses opened and closed in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, using it as a warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building was tied up in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect, and first <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris put on 136 for {{the opening}} stand before the latter fell for 65. <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket. Barnes' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes. After Bradman {{departed}} at 403/3, wickets began to fall more regularly, but Hassett held up his end and made 110, while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50. Surrey's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4/104. On the second afternoon, Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings. Johnson took 5/53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out, but received little support, the next highest scores being 15 and 10. Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day. They made continual inroads on the final day, and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win. Johnston took 4/40 and Johnson 3/40.|$|E

5|$|<b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris shared century opening {{partnerships}} at Lord's and The Oval, {{where their}} 117run stand dwarfed the 52all out {{made by the}} entire England team. In addition to his century at Lord's, Barnes made three other scores over 60 in the series.|$|E

5000|$|In 1957, Hall raced the front-engined Chaparral (retroactively {{called the}} [...] "Chaparral 1") through 1962, bought from Troutman <b>and</b> <b>Barnes</b> (like the Scarab, the Chaparral 1 cars {{were built in}} California by Troutman <b>and</b> <b>Barnes).</b> Hall <b>and</b> Hap Sharp {{extensively}} modified their Chaparral, and eventually decided {{to build their own}} car. They obtained permission from Trouman <b>and</b> <b>Barnes</b> to use the Chaparral name, which is why all of Hall's cars are called Chaparral 2s.|$|R
5|$|The 1948 Australia {{team that}} toured England {{has become known}} as The Invincibles, because they did not lose a single game. Following their {{performances}} during the Australian season, <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris were favoured as Australia's first-choice opening pair, while Brown batted out of position in the middle order in the first two Tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up, which included Bradman, Arthur Morris, vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, Neil Harvey and Sid <b>Barnes,</b> <b>and</b> the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston.|$|E
5|$|William Barnes, the West Country dialect poet, was Rector of Winterborne Came, a hamlet near Dorchester, for 24 {{years until}} his death in 1886, and ran a school in the town.

5|$|Aberhart's {{government}} was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled <b>Barnes,</b> <b>and</b> the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 {{and was replaced}} as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a more conservative and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the match}} against Durham, Australia headed south to The Oval for the Fifth Test, which started on 14 August. <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Tallon {{returned}} from injury, while Ernie Toshack was omitted with knee troubles, and the leg spin of Doug Ring replaced Johnson's off spin. Overnight, hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements in rainy weather to queue for tickets. Bradman had already {{announced that he}} would retire {{at the end of the}} season, and the public were anxious to witness his last Test appearance.|$|E
5|$|An {{experienced}} right-handed opening batsman, Brown was on {{his third}} campaign in England, having first toured in 1934 before the World War II. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948, <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris had risen above him in the pecking order and become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown {{was selected as the}} reserve opener, a decision that generated controversy among pundits who believed he was past his best.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him out of position in the middle order while <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris opened. Brown came in 6/335 and scored 25 at a typically placid pace, accumulating his runs at a lower strike rate than the other recognised batsmen. He was out with the score at 6/402 as Australia went on to declare at 8/462 and win by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted {{the players on}} the second day. <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian cricket team since World War II and was on his second trip to England after making his Test debut there in 1938 before the war. During the 1946–47 Australian season, which saw England tour for five Tests, the home nation's senior opening batsman Bill Brown was injured. <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> debutant Arthur Morris had {{averaged}} 73.83 and 71.85 respectively, playing in all five matches.|$|E

The grant also included 47 acres 2 roods in Dromcowen, alias Drumgoney.|$|R
5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E
5|$|Brown partnered the {{recovered}} <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> patiently scored 140, {{before being}} the fifth man {{out with the}} score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test. Looking to regain his Test position by sheer weight of runs, Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting {{out of position}} in the middle order while Sid <b>Barnes</b> <b>and</b> Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|E
