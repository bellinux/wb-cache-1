5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{the pier}} {{was sold to}} a Blackpool family firm, Sedgwick's, the owners of {{amusement}} arcades and the big wheel on Blackpool's Central Pier.

He said {{that he wants to}} restore the Victorian heritage of the pier and re-instate the pier's tram. An admission charge of fifty pence to access the board-walk section of the pier was abolished by the Sedgwicks.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought a}} house for the first time.

In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E

In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager {{to get their hands}} on Drive, they started negotiating to <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} {{the machine was}} a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to <b>buy</b> <b>it.</b> Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.|$|E

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would <b>buy</b> <b>it,</b> so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{or not the}} {{sculpture}} was to be exhibited at the Salon de la Nationale, it was scheduled for the café proprietor Lévy at 57 rue Saint-Lazare, with whom Gauguin had concluded an agreement to represent him before his last departure for Tahiti. It failed to sell, and Charles Morice was unable to raise public money to acquire it for the nation. Gauguin had thought his only likely interested patron would be Gustave Fayet, who did eventually <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> for 1,500 francs, but in 1905, after Gauguin's death.|$|E
5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale, and he advised Charles to <b>buy</b> <b>it.</b> Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
