5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, <b>blunting</b> its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|Skulls {{of early}} tyrannosauroids were long, low and lightly constructed, {{similar to other}} coelurosaurs, while later forms had taller and more massive skulls. Despite the {{differences}} in form, certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids. The premaxillary bone is very tall, <b>blunting</b> {{the front of the}} snout, a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids. The nasal bones are characteristically fused together, arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their upper surface. The premaxillary teeth {{at the front of the}} upper jaw are shaped differently from the rest of the teeth, smaller in size and with a D-shaped cross section. In the lower jaw, a prominent ridge on the surangular bone extends sideways from just below the jaw joint, except in the basal Guanlong.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by <b>blunting</b> any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E

His widow, Ellen Lloyd Key <b>Blunt,</b> was {{the subject}} of a March 7, 1856 letter by Jessie Benton Frémont to Elizabeth Blair Lee, lamenting <b>Blunt's</b> {{financial}} situation. Frémont attempted to intervene on <b>Blunt's</b> behalf by writing to George W. <b>Blunt,</b> brother of Joseph <b>Blunt</b> (no known relationship to Simon <b>Blunt),</b> imploring him to buy a patent for a device developed by Simon <b>Blunt</b> to lower lifeboats into the water. But, towards the end of 1859, Frémont was exasperated with <b>Blunt.</b> Ellen <b>Blunt</b> relocated to Paris in 1861 to give dramatic readings; she died in 1884.

25|$|Tolerance to the {{therapeutic}} effects of stimulants can occur, and rebound of symptoms may {{occur when the}} dose wears off.

25|$|All seemed {{lost for}} England until a defiant Jack Russell, ably {{supported}} by spinner John Emburey set about first <b>blunting,</b> {{and then when}} the opportunity arose, attacking the Australian bowlers.

By stumps they had crawled along to 123 for 6, Russell not out on 47 and Emburey on 22. A vital partnership of 64 restoring some credibility to an England team threatening to collapse completely.|$|E
25|$|Prior stress {{exposure}} heightens fear learning during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Stress-related {{increases in}} ghrelin circulation {{were shown to}} be necessary and sufficient for stress to increase fear learning. Ghrelin {{was found to be}} upregulated by stress {{even in the absence of}} adrenal hormones. Blocking the ghrelin receptor during stress abolished stress-related enhancement of fear memory without <b>blunting</b> other markers of stress. These results suggest that ghrelin is a novel branch of the stress response. Human studies are needed to translate the use of anti-ghrelin treatments to prevent stress-induced psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|With {{long-term}} use and during withdrawal of benzodiazepines, treatment-emergent depression and emotional <b>blunting</b> may emerge and sometimes also suicidal ideation. There {{is evidence that}} the higher the dose used {{the more likely it is}} benzodiazepine use will induce these feelings. Reducing the dose or discontinuing benzodiazepines may be indicated in such cases. Withdrawal symptoms can persist for quite some time after discontinuing benzodiazepines. Some common protracted withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal effects. The protracted withdrawal state may still occur despite slow titration of dosage. It is believed that the protracted withdrawal effects are due to persisting neuroadaptations.|$|E

25|$|Because Rhodesian exports were {{generally}} competitive and {{had previously been}} entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence.

After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in <b>blunting</b> their impact for at least a decade. Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts, also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.|$|E

25|$|However, by 5 February, the PAVN had {{infiltrated}} {{the ruined}} town; {{they set up}} an 82mm mortar in a hut, firing shells out through the thatch roof.

The following day, more mines were dropped by F-4 Phantom IIs in a horseshoe bend around the Royalists, limiting the battlefield to a single avenue of attack or retreat. More aerial mining followed on 7 and 8 February. As the PAVN removed defensive obstacles, they were replaced from the air, <b>blunting</b> their assaults. U.S. forward air controllers became expert at spotting the muzzle flashes of communist mortars, and having them demolished by air strikes making the Vietnamese gunners very circumspect.|$|E
25|$|Tamarind lumber {{is used to}} make furniture, carvings, turned objects, {{chopping}} blocks, {{and other}} small specialty wood items.

The pale yellow sapwood is sharply demarcated from the heartwood. Heartwood {{is said to be}} durable to very durable in decay resistance, and is also resistant to insects. Its sapwood is not durable and is prone to attack by insects and fungi as well as spalting. Due to its density and interlocked grain, tamarind is considered difficult to work. Heartwood has a pronounced <b>blunting</b> effect on cutting edges. Tamarind turns, glues, and finishes well. The heartwood is able to take a high natural polish.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force of Zimbabwe made {{particularly}} {{effective use of}} its air power, <b>blunting</b> rebel and Rwandan offensives on Mbuji-Mayi with repeated strikes by BAE Hawks and Hawker Hunters.

Despite the effectiveness of its highly mobile, big-gunned Eland-90 and Cascavel armoured cars, Zimbabwean ground forces also lost a significant number either captured or destroyed by the rebel coalition.
