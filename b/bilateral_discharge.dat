40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates from discharge in CSOM. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included a total of 187 patients of CSOM with unilateral or <b>bilateral</b> <b>discharge</b> attending department of ENT in SHKM Govt. Medical College and Hospital Nalhar, Mewat, Haryana March 2015 to August 2015. Samples were inoculated on blood and Mac Conkey agar for 24 - 48 hrs and identification of organism was done by using standard biochemical reactions and antibiotic susceptibility testing done by using modified Kirby Bauer method as per CLSI guidelines. RESULT Among 187 patients included in the study, most of the patients were between age group 11 - 20 years. CSOM was found to be more common in female patients (52...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} (CSOM) is a prevailing and notorious infection {{in developing countries}} causing serious local damage and threatening complications. Early and effective treatment based on the knowledge of causing micro organisms and their sensitivity results in good clinical recovery and prevents from damage and complications. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common pathogen causing CSOM in Pakistan. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in CSOM and sensitivity against commonly prescribed antibiotics. Methods: A total of 263 patients with unilateral or bilateral chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) were enrolled in the study at Department of ENT, Karachi Medical and Dental College & Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan from December 2004 to May 2006. Sterile cotton swabs were used to collect pus from discharging ears and plated on Blood agar and MacConkey agar for 24 to 48 hours. Antibiotics susceptibility was tested by Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) method using Mueller-Hinton agar. Results: Overall microbiology of 267 samples from 263 patients was studied including 4 of <b>bilateral</b> <b>discharge.</b> Polymicrobial growth was present in 8 samples. A total of 275 bacterial isolates were studied. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (30. 9 %) were the most common bacterial agents found in CSOM. MIC was done for Pseudomonas aeruginos...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Several {{pre-operative}} work-up protocols {{have been}} used while selecting epileptic patients for surgery among different centers. The relative value of the different available pre-operative tests is still under discussion. OBJECTIVE: We report on the surgical outcome obtained in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy associated to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and who were evaluated pre-operatively by interictal EEG and MRI alone. METHOD: Forty one patients with refractory unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy were evaluated using interictal EEG and MRI. MRI disclosed unilateral MTS in all patients. All patients had at least 4 interictal EEG recordings. All patients were submitted to cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy at the side determined by MRI. RESULTS: Interictal EEG showed unilateral epileptiform discharges compatible with MRI findings in 37 patients; in four out of the 41 patients, <b>bilateral</b> <b>discharges</b> were found. Mean follow-up time was 4. 3 ± 1. 1 years. Thirty-nine patients (95. 1 %) were classified as Engels Class I (70. 6 % Engel I-A). Two patients (4. 9 %) were rated as Engel's Class II. All patients in whom <b>bilateral</b> <b>discharges</b> were found were in Engels Class I. Pathological examination showed MTS in all patients. CONCLUSION: It is possible to adequately select good surgical candidates for temporal lobe resection using MRI and interictal EEG alone. In patients with MRI-defined MTS we should expect a postoperative remission rate higher then 90 %. The finding of MTS on MRI {{is the most important}} good prognostic factor after temporal lobe resection...|$|R

40|$|A 13 {{year old}} Thoroughbred mare {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for evaluation of chronic <b>bilateral</b> mucopurulent nasal <b>discharge.</b> She was purchased by the current owner from a sale in 8 months before presentation {{and at that time}} had a unilateral serous nasal discharge. The discharge was responsive to antibiotics but would return after medication was discontinued. The discharge progressed to a mucopurulent discharge that became unresponsive to treatment and also became bilateral. The primary veterinarian performed airway endoscopy and sinus radiography that revealed narrowed airways with a mass like lesion in the sinuses. She was referred to Cornell for repeat endoscopy and a CT scan with possible surgical correction of the chronic sinus disease. Upon presentation she was bright, alert and responsive with vital parameters within normal limits. Physical exam revealed <b>bilateral</b> mucopurulent <b>discharge,</b> facial swelling over the left maxillary sinus and stertor. Airflow was decreased through her nasal passages and the left side appeared to be most severely affected. Airway endoscopy revealed swelling of the sinus that was partially obstructing the nasal passage. Large amounts of mucoid discharge were predominant on the left side. A CT revealed a fluid/soft tissue opacity within all the paranasal sinuses on the left and well as the rostral maxillary, ventral conchal and small amounts in the conchofrontal on the right. This case report will discuss the etiology, treatment and prognosis of mucopurulent <b>bilateral</b> nasal <b>discharge</b> with a <b>bilateral</b> frontal sinusotomy in a 13 year old mare...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied a}} patient {{with a history of}} absence attacks in {{childhood}} in whom an absence status with <b>bilateral</b> spike-and-wave <b>discharges</b> developed after a top-of-the-basilar syndrome. Surprisingly, even though the ischemic lesion involved the left thalamus alone, spike-and-wave discharges were recorded from the two hemispheres.

40|$|Invasive {{aspergillosis}} {{of temporal}} bone, an extremely rare yet potentially life-threatening disease entity, occurs mostly in immuno-compromised individuals. We report {{a case of}} a 65 -year-old diabetic male who presented with <b>bilateral</b> ear <b>discharge,</b> <b>bilateral</b> subepithelial ear masses, and progressive left facial palsy of recent onset. The biopsy specimen taken from either side after surgical debridement revealed only nonspecific inflammatory granulation tissue, but the culture of the tissue was positive for Aspergillus flavus. Invasive aspergillosis was confirmed by demonstration of the fungi in the tissues with Gomori-Methanamine Silver staining. The patient was hence put on long-term Itraconazole therapy and is presently doing well. The possibility of invasive fungal otitis always needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis in immuno-compromised patients presenting with atypical otomastoiditis so as to diagnose this rare condition at an early stage to reduce the delay in the treatment and prevent its possible complications such as skull base osteomyelitis and progressive cranial nerve palsies...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Carbamazepine {{can lead}} to {{aggravation}} of epileptic seizures in generalized epilepsies (primary or secondary) with clinical manifestations of absence (typical or atypical) and/or myoclonic seizures. However, some focal epilepsies can be also aggravated {{by the introduction of}} carbamazepine. Case report. We presented a 10 -year-old boy born after a complicated and prolonged delivery completed by vacuum extraction, of early psychomotor development within normal limits. At the age of 8 years he had the first epileptic seizure of simple occipital type with generalization and urination. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed focal cortical reductions in the left parietal and occipital regions. Interictal EEG recorded slowed basic activities above the posterior regions of the left hemisphere, with intermittent occurrence of occipital sharp waves and bioccipital sharp and slow-wave complexes. Initially, treatment with valproate was administered; however, the addition of carbamazepine into therapy induced aggravation of seizures and EEG findings, changed behavior and poor performance at school. By withdrawal of carbamazepine the condition improved both clinically and in EEG findings. Conclusion. Childhood occipital epilepsy lesions show deterioration due to carbamazepine, which if administered induces aggravation of seizures, behavior changes, cognition with occurrence of long-term <b>bilateral</b> <b>discharges,</b> and posterior sharp and slow wave high amplitude complexes recorded by EEG...|$|R
50|$|Ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) {{typically}} manifests in {{the first}} five days post birth and is associated with marked <b>bilateral</b> purulent <b>discharge</b> and local inflammation. In contrast, conjunctivitis secondary to infection with chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) produces conjunctivitis after day three post birth, but may occur up to two weeks after delivery. The discharge is usually more watery in nature (mucopurulent) and less inflamed. Babies infected with chlamydia may develop pneumonitis (chest infection) at a later stage (range 2 weeks - 19 weeks after delivery). Infants with chlamydia pneumonitis should be treated with oral erythromycin for 10-14 days.|$|R

40|$|Embryogenesis of a {{congenital}} nasolacrimal duct (NLD) cyst {{is attributed}} {{to the failure of}} the Hasner membrane of the NLD system to cannulate. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital NLD cysts supports the argument for a developmental error, with a postnatal prevalence of 6 %. The role of a genetic basis for this malformation has never been ascribed. We present a set of monozygotic twins with bilateral congenital NLD cysts as an argument for a genetic basis of this entity. A case report and literature review were performed. We present two cases of bilateral congenital NLD cysts occurring in a set of monozygotic twins. Patients were delivered at 37 weeks via cesarean section. The pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor at 33 weeks requiring administration of terbutaline and betamethasone. At presentation, twin A had <b>bilateral</b> eye <b>discharge,</b> erythema, and swelling medial to the medial canthi as well as nasal obstruction. Computed tomography (CT) showed classic bilateral cystic masses in the inferior meatus. The diagnosis of bilateral infected congenital dacryocystoceles was made. Twin B initially presented with only <b>bilateral</b> eye <b>discharge</b> and CT showed a dilated NLD system. Twin B subsequently developed early signs of bilateral dacryocystoceles the following day. Both patients underwent lacrimal probing and endoscopic marsupialization of the dacryocystoceles. Biopsies were consistent with dacryocystocele. Dacryocystocele is a common presentation of unresolved neonatal NLD obstruction.

40|$|A {{three year}} old Thoroughbred filly was {{examined}} because of <b>bilateral</b> nasal <b>discharge</b> and external {{swelling of the}} left laryngeal area. Endoscopy revealed an enlarged left arytenoid cartilage, left laryngeal hemiplegia and drainage of purulent material into the lumen of the larynx. Radiographs showed a large fluid and gas filled cavity overlying the caudal larynx and cranial trachea. Surgical drainage and debridement of the abscess led to complete healing by secondary intention. Laryngeal ventriculectomy was performed {{as a treatment for}} left laryngeal hemiplegia, but a grave prognosis for respiratory soundness was given due to the extensive laryngeal fibrosis.

40|$|Chester, a 10 month old Oldenberg colt, {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for evaluation and repair of a cleft soft palate. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a very wide cleft that spanned over 2 / 3 of the caudal soft palate as well as feed material throughout his airways. Thoracic ultrasound revealed mild aspiration pneumonia. The palate was visualized via a combined mandibular symphysiotomy and laryngotomy approach and repaired using two mucosal flaps to cover the defect since {{the width of the}} cleft precluded a standard repair. Postoperatively, the caudal aspect of the repair broke down resulting in persistent mild <b>bilateral</b> nasal <b>discharge.</b> The lag screws used to secure the mandible also loosened leaving a gap between the first mandibular incisors.

40|$|SUMMARY: Distinguishing {{propagated}} epileptic {{activity from}} primary epileptic foci is of critical impor-tance in presurgical evaluation {{of patients with}} medically intractable focal epilepsy. We studied an 11 -year-old patient with complex partial epilepsy by using simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). In EEG, <b>bilateral</b> interictal <b>discharges</b> appeared synchro-nous, whereas MEG source analysis suggested propagation of spikes from the right to the left frontal lobe. In the presurgical work-up, magnetoencephalography(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) {{can be used to}} noninvasively localize and characterize epileptic activity. Propagation of epileptic activity, however, can lead to mislo-calization of the primary epileptic locus. Here we show that by using advanced MEG source analysis, it is possible to identify the origin of spike propagation that appears synchronous on standard clinical EEG.

40|$|Objective: Sixteen {{different}} {{features are}} evaluated in their potential {{ability to detect}} seizures from scalp EEG recordings containing temporal lobe (TL) seizures. Features include spectral measures, non-linear methods (e. g. zero-crossings), phase synchronization and the recently introduced Brain Symmetry Index (BSI). Besides an individual comparison, several combinations of features are evaluated as well in their potential ability to detect TL seizures. - Methods: Sixteen long-term scalp EEG recordings, containing TL seizures from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), were analyzed. For each EEG, all 16 features were determined for successive 10 s epochs of the recording. All epochs were labeled by experts for {{the presence or absence}} of seizure activity. In addition, triplet combinations of various features were evaluated using pattern recognition tools. Final performance was evaluated by the sensitivity and specificity (False Alarm Rate (FAR)), using ROC curves. - Results: In those TL seizures characterized by unilateral epileptiform discharges, the BSI was the best single feature. Except for one low-voltage EEG with many artifacts, the sensitivity found ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 90 at a FAR of 1 /h. Using three features increased the sensitivity to 0. 77 – 0. 97. In patients with bilateral electroencephalographic changes, the single best feature most often found was a measure for the number of minima and maxima (mmax) in the recording, yielding sensitivities of 0. 30 – 0. 96 at FAR 1 /h. Using three features increased the sensitivity to 0. 38 – 0. 99, at the same FAR. In various recordings, it was even possible to obtain sensitivities of 0. 70 – 0. 95 at a FAR= 0. - Conclusions: The Brain Symmetry Index is the most relevant individual feature to detect electroencephalographic seizure activity in TLE with unilateral epileptiform discharges. In patients with <b>bilateral</b> <b>discharges,</b> mmax performs best. Using a triplet of features significantly improves the performance of the detector. - Significance: Improved seizure detection can improve patient care in both the epilepsy monitoring unit and the intensive care unit...|$|R
40|$|A not {{pregnant}} 4 -year-old Jersey cow {{was presented}} with the sudden appearance of respiratory noise, nasal discharge and moderate respiratory difficulty. Upon physical examination a snoring-like noise, extended head and neck position, exaggerated abdominal effort, <b>bilateral</b> nasal <b>discharge</b> and left prescapular lymph node enlargement were noted. Sub-occlusion of the initial portion of the respiratory tract was suspected. Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed a pedunculate mass on the dorsal aspect of the rhinopharynx, which was removed with endoscopically assisted electrosurgery. Histologic examination revealed a chronic pyogranulomatous inflammation with eosinophilic club-like bodies surrounding small colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. Results of histochemical staining were consistent with Actinobacillus-like bacteria and a diagnosis of respiratory actinobacillosis was reached. Surgery and antibiotic therapy were resolutive, as demonstated by an endoscopic check at the second month after surgery, even without the association of the traditional iodine cure, which {{is regarded as the}} treatment of choice for actinobacillosis. ...|$|R
40|$|A 13 -year-old {{quarter horse}} gelding {{presented}} {{with a history of}} hematuria of approximately 1 -year duration, anemia, weight loss over the previous six months, and <b>bilateral</b> nasal <b>discharge</b> of 2 -week duration. It was determined that hematuria was most likely caused by the coccidian parasite Klossiella equi. Additional case workup suggested a diagnosis of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction. Confirmatory testing was declined by the owners and the horse was discharged on medical therapy. Despite initial improvement after discharge, the horse developed unresolving sinusitis approximately 1 year later and was euthanized. Necropsy confirmed the presence of an adenoma of the pars intermedia of the pituitary gland, supporting the initial diagnosis. Additional findings included multiple developmental stages of K. equi present in the kidneys. This finding demonstrates infections with K. equi can be chronic in nature and supports the association of increased severity of klossiellosis and impaired immune function...|$|R

Fifty clinical isolates from the United Kingdom isolated from 1986 to 2003 and seven cat isolates were characterized by ribotyping to determine whether the ribotypes of the cat isolates were genotypically related to those found for human clinical isolates. For comparison, the genotypes of 11 overseas isolates and 13 isolates from H. R. Carne's collection isolated between 1933 and 1979 were also determined. Strains isolated from domestic cats were found to exhibit the predominant ribotypes observed among human clinical isolates, suggesting that C. ulcerans isolated from cats could be a potential reservoir for human infection...|$|R

A follow-up X ray revealed a mixed pattern of osteolysis and increased radiodensity confined to the nasal cavity. Histologic sections of the biopsy specimens revealed the presence of granules containing numerous septate hyphae that were hyaline to pale brown and smooth, one-celled, subspherical-to-elongate conidia that were hyaline to brownish green, and bacteria. Cultures yielded numerous colonies belonging to Scedosporium apiospermum. Susceptibility tests were performed on the isolated strain. The isolate was sensitive to ketoconazole, intermediate to clotrimazole, and resistant to amphotericin B, 5 -fluorocytosine, fluconazole, and itraconazole. The dog was treated with oral ketoconazole.
