30|$|Si {{nanoparticles}} possess significant properties such as wide-bandgap energies due to {{the quantum}} confinement effect [1, 2], large surface area [3], and high reactivity [4]. Moreover, Si is a safe material, possible {{to apply to the}} bio-medical field [5]. Extensive studies have been performed to produce Si nanoparticles using various methods including laser ablation [6, 7], plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [8], hot wire CVD [9], sputtering [10], Si implantation [11], intense pulsed ion beam evaporation [12], and co-evaporation of SiO plus SiO 2 with subsequent heat treatment [13]. These methods require vacuum chambers and are time- and cost-consuming. Si nanoparticles can also be produced by chemical methods such as Zintl reaction and LiAlH reduction of SiCl 4 [14]. For a cheap fabrication method of Si nanoparticles, Lam et al. [15] employed the ball milling method, but {{only a small fraction of}} Si powders becomes nanometer size.

30|$|Figure  2 {{shows the}} PL spectra for Si {{nanoparticles}} fabricated from Si swarf {{by use of}} the <b>beads</b> <b>milling</b> method in hexane. The PL spectra had a peaked structure with peaks at 2.56, 2.73, 2.91, and 3.09  eV. The PL spectra hardly depended on the incident light excitation energy of 3.18 – 3.76  eV (Fig.  2 a). If PL arose from the band-to-band transition of Si nanoparticles, the PL energy would strongly depend on the excitation energy because {{with an increase in}} the excitation energy, wider bandgap Si nanoparticles can be excited, leading to PL emission with higher energy. This is not the case, and the observed PL most probably arises from adsorbed species on Si nanoparticles. The PL spectra of Si nanoparticles were very similar to that of DMA (bottom spectrum in Fig.  2 a) with peaks at 2.55, 2.75, 2.92, and 3.09  eV. The peaked structure with almost the identical energy separation of ~ 0.18  eV is due to the vibronic structure of DMA molecules [26]. We conclude that the observed PL with the vibronic structure resulted from DMA impurity in hexane adsorbed on Si nanoparticles.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Si nanopowder {{with water to}} generate hydrogen is investigated using FT-IR and XPS measurements. Si nanopowder is fabricated using the simple <b>beads</b> <b>milling</b> method. For HF-etched Si nanopowder, strong peaks due to Si-H and Si-H 2 stretching vibrational modes and a weak shoulder peak due to Si-H 3 are observed. Although no peaks due to oxide is observed in the Si 2 p XPS spectrum, weak vibrational peaks due to HSiO 2 and HSiO 3 species are observable. The hydrogen generation rate greatly increases with pH, indicating that the reacting species is hydroxide ions (OH− ions). After the reaction, the intensities of the peaks due to SiH and SiH 2 species decrease while those for HSiO, HSiO 2, and HSiO 3 species increase. This result demonstrates that OH− ions attack Si back-bonds, with surface Si-H bonds remaining. After {{initial reaction}} of HF-etched Si nanopowder with heavy water, vibrational peaks for SiD, SiDH, and SiDH 2 appear, and then, a peak due to DSiO 3 species is observed, but no peaks due to DSiO 2 and DSiO species are observable.

Suspensions of 10 % (w/w) vitamine E TPGS 400, 3500, 4000 and 6000 were prepared as described above and analyzed using DLS after 7 days of milling. All experiments were conducted in threefold. Results. For the suspensions stabilized with povidone K 25, no significant particle size reduction could be observed, possibly due to agglomeration of the particles. Poloxamer 188 stabilized suspensions showed particle size reduction and resulted in nanosuspensions with a particle size of 400 - 1000 nm after 7 days of milling. Vitamine E TPGS 1000 stabilized suspensions resulted in particle sizes of 250 - 350 nm after 7 days of milling, except for the 5 % (w/w) suspension that showed agglomeration upon milling.

The density and the strength of Si 3 N 4 ceramics were degraded, however, because the CNTs prevented Si 3 N 4 from densifying. The CNTs disappeared after firing at high temperatures owing to the reaction between CNTs and Si 3 N 4 or SiO 2, or both Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2. In order to improve the density and suppress the reaction, sintering aids for lower-temperature densification of Si 3 N 4 are needed.

The recovery of recombinant protein, cholesterol oxidase (COD) was studied in a continuous <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> process.

Significant process variables, cell slurry feed rate (A), bead load (B), cell load (C) and run time (D), were investigated and optimized for maximizing COD recovery. RSM predicted an optimum of feed rate of 310. 73 mL/h, bead loading of 79. 9 % (v/v), cell loading OD 600 nm of 74, and run time of 29. 9 min with a recovery of ~ 3. 2 g/L.

40|$|An {{increased}} worldwide protein {{demand for}} food and feed and the necessity to release the water soluble proteins {{in the first stage}} of the cascade biorefinery require the development of mild protein extraction technologies. Cell disintegration is the first hurdle and is considered {{as one of the most}} energy consuming steps. Therefore, this thesis focused on the development of a mild, scalable and energy efficient disintegration technology for green microalgae and macroalgae (seaweed) aimed on extraction of water soluble components (like proteins and carbohydrates). For microalgae disintegration, two main technologies were investigated. First of all the conventional technology <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> and second a novel approach using Pulsed Electric Field (PEF). In Chapter 2 a benchmark was set by means of <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> for the release of water soluble protein from the green microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Overall, protein yields between 32 and 42 % were achieved, while the energy consumption was reduced with 85 % by selective protein extraction to values as low as 0. 81 kWh kgDW- 1. Remarkably, the benchmark was much better than expected. In Chapter 3 the <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> was further optimized by decreasing the applied bead size, furthermore the applicability of <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> on two additional microalgae species (Neochloris oleoabundans, Tetraselmis suecica) was shown. In addition, to be able to better understand the disintegration mechanism, the so-called stress model was applied. This model describes the comminution process in a <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> as function of the amount of bead contacts and the force of each impact. The release kinetics could be improved and thereby the specific energy consumption could be reduced to 0. 45 ‒ 0. 47 kWh kgDW- 1 by using 0. 3 mm beads for all algae. Chapter 4 describes a screening on the applicability of PEF, over a broad range of operating conditions, for the extraction of water soluble proteins from the microalgae C. vulgaris and N. oleoabundans. No substantial protein yields were observed under the investigated conditions. This led to the conclusion that PEF is not suitable to release water soluble proteins, not even at specific energy consumptions much higher than those for the benchmark, <b>bead</b> <b>milling.</b> In Chapter 5 it was attempted to improve the performance of PEF by investigating the synergistic effect with the processing temperature. The PEF experiments were performed using a pilot scale continuous flow electroporation unit in which the processing temperature was controlled between 25 – 65 °C. The results showed that under the tested conditions, the combined PEF-Temperature treatment did not cause substantial disintegration of the algal cells to effectively release water soluble proteins. In addition to the microalgae, macroalgae were subject of investigation in the search for new protein sources in Chapter 6. Four batch technologies were used to disintegrate the green macroalgae Ulva lactuca, being; osmotic shock, enzyme incubation, PEF and High Shear Homogenization (HSH). In descending order the highest protein yields per treatment; HSH (~ 40 %) > enzyme degradation (~ 25 %) > osmotic shock (~ 20 %) > PEF (~ 15 %). In the final chapter the main results and remaining bottlenecks are discussed and a future outlook on microalgae disintegration is presented. To date, <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> is the only technology able to disintegrate fresh microalgae at specific energy consumptions below 10 % of the total energy available from the algae and release substantial amounts of water soluble protein.

40|$|Contamination of {{soil with}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{is a serious}} {{environmental}} issue because some PAHs are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic. Bioremediation is a promising option to completely remove PAHs from the environment or convert them to less harmful compounds. One of the main challenges in bioremediation of PAHs in a conventional roller bioreactor is the limitation on mass transfer due to the strong hydrophobicity and low water solubility of these compounds. To address this challenge, a novel <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactor (BMB) was developed by Riess et al. (2005) which demonstrated a significant improvement in the rates of mass transfer and biodegradation of PAHs. In this study, to further improve mass transfer rates, baffles have been installed in both the conventional and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. Mass transfer rates of 1000 mg L- 1 suspended naphthalene, 2 -methylnaphthalene and 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalene, three model compounds of PAHs, have been investigated in four bioreactors: conventional (control), baffled, BMB and baffled <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. The baffled bioreactor provided mass transfer coefficients (KLa) that were up to 7 times {{higher than those of}} the control bioreactor. Bioremediation of suspended naphthalene or 2 -methylnaphthalene as a single substrate and their mixtures was studied using the bacterium Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484. Both baffled and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors provided maximum bioremediation rates that were 2 times higher than the control bioreactor. The maximum bioremediation rates of 2 -methylnaphthalene were further increased in the presence of naphthalene by a factor of 1. 5 to 2 compared to the single substrate. Another rate-limiting step for bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soil is the strong sorption between the contaminant and soil. To find out the effect of sorption on the bioavailability of naphthalene, the appropriate sorption isotherms for three types of soils (sand, silt and clay) have been determined. It was observed that the sorption capacity of soils for naphthalene was proportional to the organic carbon content of the soils. The mass transfer of soil-bound naphthalene from the artificially prepared contaminated soils with short contamination history to the aqueous phase was studied in both the control and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. It was observed that the mass transfer was unexpectedly fast due to the increased interfacial surface area of naphthalene particles and the weak sorption between naphthalene and soils. It was concluded that artificially, naphthalene contaminated soils would likely not be any more difficult to bioremediate than pure naphthalene particles...|$|R

A short term physical stability study on nanocrystals stored at three different temperatures (4, 20 °C, and 40 °C) was performed to evaluate the tendency to change in particle size, aggregation and zeta-potential.

Several techniques of cell wall disintegration were studied, including ultrasound disintegration, homogenization in <b>bead</b> <b>mill,</b> application of chemicals of various types, and osmotic shock. The release of proteins from fungal cells and {{the activity of}} a cytosolic enzyme, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, in the crude extracts were assayed to determine and compare the efficacy of each method. The presented studies allowed adjusting the particular method to a particular strain. The mechanical methods of disintegration {{appeared to be the}} most effective for the disintegration of yeast, R. gracilis, and filamentous fungi, A. fumigatus and P. citrinum. Ultrasonication and <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> led to obtaining fungal cell-free extracts containing high concentrations of soluble proteins and active glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase systems...|$|R

This work included using glass beads (about US$4/kg) and screened river sand (about US$0.10/kg) before {{it was found that}} the rounded beads produced by granulating reverberatory furnace slag from the Mount Isa copper smelter constituted an ideal grinding medium.|$|R
40|$|Efficient, nonselective {{methods to}} obtain DNA from the {{environment}} are needed for rapid and thorough analysis of introduced microorganisms in environmental samples and for analysis of microbial community diversity in soil. A small-scale procedure to rapidly extract and purify DNA from soils was developed for in-the-field use. Amounts of DNA released from bacterial vegetative cells, bacterial endospores, and fungal conidia were compared by using hot-detergent treatment, freeze-thaw cycles, and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization. Combining a hot-detergent treatment with <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization gave the highest DNA yields from all three microbial cell types and provided DNA from the broadest range of microbial groups in a natural soil community. Only the <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization step was effective for DNA extraction from Bacillus globigii (B. subtilis subsp. niger) endospores or Fusarium moniliforme conidia. The hot-detergent–bead mill procedure was simplified and miniaturized. By using this procedure and small-scale, field-adapted purification and quantification procedures, DNA was prepared from four different soils seeded with Pseudomonas putida cells or B. globigii spores. In a New Mexico soil, seeded bacterial targets were detected with the same sensitivity as when assaying pure bacterial DNA (2 to 20 target gene copies in a PCR mixture). The detection limit of P. putida cells and B. globigii spores in different soils was affected {{by the amount of}} background DNA in the soil samples, the physical condition of the DNA, and the amount of DNA template used in the PCR...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{methods for}} yeast cell {{disruption}} were evaluated {{to establish their}} suitability for cell wall preparation {{in the process of}} β-glucan isolation. The effect of different disruption methods on contents of total saccharides, β-glucans and proteins in the produced cell walls preparations was analyzed. The degree of cell wall purification from intracellular components was established {{on the basis of the}} ratio of solubilised material. The investigated methods included: cell exposure to hot water (autoclaving), thermally-induced autolysis, homogenization in a <b>bead</b> <b>mill,</b> sonication and their combinations. Experimental systems were prepared in water (pH 5. 0 and pH 7. 0) and Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8. 0). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cell wall preparations with the highest degree of cytosol component release and purification of β-glucans were produced by 30 min of cell homogenization with zirconium-glass beads (0. 5 mm in diameter). This was confirmed by the highest ratio of solubilised material (approx. 64 %– 67 %). The thus-produced preparations contained ca. 60 % of total saccharides, 13 %– 14 % of β(1, 3) /(1, 6) -glucans, and approx. 35 % of crude proteins. Similar results were obtained after autolysis coupled with <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> as well as with sonication, but the time required for these processes was more than 24 h. Homogenization in a <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> could be valuable for general isolation procedures because allows one to eliminate the different autolytic activity of various yeast strains...|$|R
40|$|Several cell {{disruption}} methods were tested on Nannochloropsis gaditana, {{to evaluate their}} efficiency in terms of cell disintegration, energy input and release of soluble proteins. High-pressure homogenization (HPH) and <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> were the most efficient with > 95 % cell disintegration, ± 50 % (w/w) release of total proteins and low energy input (< 0. 5 kWh. kg− 1 biomass). Enzymatic treatment required low energy input (< 0. 34 kWh. kg− 1 biomass), but it only released ± 35 % protein (w/w). Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) was neither energy-efficient (10. 44 kWh. kg− 1 biomass) nor successful for protein release (only 10 % proteins w/w) and cell disintegration. The release of proteins after applying HPH and <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> always required less intensive operating conditions for {{cell disruption}}. The energy cost per unit of released protein ranged from 0. 15 – 0. 25 €. kgProtein − 1 in case of HPH, and up to 2 – 20 €. kgProtein − 1 in case of PEF...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{process was}} {{developed}} for extraction of intracellular proteins by combination of cell disruption and aqueous two-phase extraction in a single processing step. A horizontally stirred <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> was used to perform the cell disruption and the protein extraction simultaneously without using an additional extractor. Polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulfate {{were added to the}} cell suspension before disruption. The <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> worked both as a cell disrupter and as an extractor. The resulting homogenate after disruption was directly centrifuged for phase separation. The target protein was partitioned into the top phase while the cell debris was retained in the bottom phase. Separation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from yeast and human tumour necrosis factor alpha (cr-TNF) from recombinant Escherichia coli were tested as two model proteins in the new process. The ADH activity was increased in the presence of aqueous two-phase components. The TNF activity was also found to increase in the presence of PEG. This novel process has a good potential for separation of other intracellular biological products. (C) 1999 Society of Chemical Industry.
