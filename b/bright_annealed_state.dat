40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and annealed copper thin foils were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness. Yield strength was higher in the thinner foil than in the thicker foil at as-rolled state. Difference of yield strength between the thinner foil and the thicker foil becomes small at <b>annealed</b> <b>state.</b> Tensile strength was higher in the thinner foil than in the thicker foil at as-rolled state, but it was reversed at <b>annealed</b> <b>state.</b> Strain to fracture or elongation increased with increasing thickness in the <b>annealed</b> <b>state.</b> A knife edge type of fracture was characterized in both the as-rolled <b>state</b> and the <b>annealed</b> <b>state.</b> A higher tensile strength and strain to fracture of the annealed thicker foil was attributed to the higher number of grains per thickness.

Bimetal of high-tin {{aluminum}} alloy and steel was fabricated by cold-rolling process; microstructure, bonding strength and bonding mechanism for bonding interface of the bimetal were investigated under cold-rolling and recrystallization <b>annealing</b> <b>state,</b> respectively. Experimental {{results indicate that}} tin phase of bimetal in cold-rolling state shows a belt type distribution, however, it, in recrystallization <b>annealing</b> <b>state,</b> is uniformly distributed just like some “isolated islands”.

A modified integrated transfer operator is introduced, which describes the (relativised) quenched states studied e. g. by Kifer [1992], and conditions (including SRB) ensuring coincidence of quenched and <b>annealed</b> <b>states</b> are given.

Continuous stiffness nanoindentation measurements of near-surface hardness were {{performed in the}} grains of specific <b>annealing</b> <b>states</b> and of specific crystallographic orientation, determined by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); indentation pile-up was investigated using surface profilometry. Bulk hardness of unexposed tungsten does not strongly depend on grain orientation, but depends on the <b>annealing</b> <b>state</b> of the grain, with values between ∼ 4. 3 &nbsp;GPa for recrystallized grains and ∼ 5. 5 for non-recrystallized ones.

In this analysis, the absolute strain calculated from the <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> was used where the <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> relates to zero strain and the ECAP samples have an imposed strain before subsequent deformation in tensile or compression testing. The results show that in the range of low strains, as in the deformation of annealed samples, the rate of hardening is always positive and the magnitude of the hardening rate decreases monotonously with the total strain. In the range of high strains, as in the samples subjected to ECAP, the yield stress saturates because a homogeneous microstructure is ultimately established through ECAP processing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} devoted to the effect of a multiaxial stress state and of pre-straining on the creep {{properties}} of an austenitic stainless steel. Creep tests on both smooth and notched specimens have been carried out on type 316 L(N) steel at 600 °C. In comparison to the <b>annealed</b> <b>state,</b> pre-straining caused a substantial increase in creep lifetime but also a dramatic drop in intergranular damage resistance. The effect of a pre-strain on creep ductility was so strong that compact tension specimens in pre-strained state tested under relaxation conditions cracked, whereas specimens in <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> were not prone to cracking. A model taking into account both pre-strain and multiaxial effects was developed and identified on the basis of local intergranular micro-cracks measurements on notched specimens. It satisfactorily predicts the results of relaxation crack propagation tests. This model may also provide a useful estimation of the relaxation cracking risk of 316 L(N) as a function of pre-strain level and stress triaxiality ratio...|$|R
