5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for <b>bone</b> <b>strength,</b> but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E

He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by <b>bone</b> <b>strength</b> was only partly reliable.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess <b>bone</b> breaking <b>strength,</b> keel <b>bone</b> status and egg quality parameters of Lohmann Silver (LS) and Lohmann Tradition (LT) layers housed in small group systems (SG) and furnished cages (FC) in comparison to an aviary system. At the end of the 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 11 th laying month, approximately 40 hens were randomly chosen from each housing system and slaughtered (478 hens in total). Humerus and tibia strengths were analysed using a three-point-bending machine. Keel bone status was evaluated on a scale from 1 (severe) to 4 (no deformity). Shell breaking strength was measured every four weeks, totalling 4, 887 eggs. Statistical analyses were performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Humerus and tibia strengths of LS layers housed in SG were significantly higher compared to LS hens kept in FC. <b>Bone</b> breaking <b>strengths</b> of humerus and tibia in LS and LT layers were highest in the aviary system and the differences to the other housing systems were significant. No significant differences in tibia and humerus <b>bone</b> breaking <b>strengths</b> were found between SG and FC for LT hens. Keel bone status was not significantly influenced by housing system or laying strain. For both hybrids, shell breaking strength was significantly lower in SG compared to FC and aviary system. The results showed that SG systems can significantly enhance <b>bone</b> breaking <b>strength</b> for LS layers in comparison to hens kept in FC. The lower shell breaking strength of eggs in SG might slightly impair economic aspects...|$|R

40|$|Diabetic {{patients}} have increased fracture risk. The pathogenesis underlying {{the status of}} bone alterations in diabetes mellitus is not completely understood but is multifactorial. The major deficits appear {{to be related to}} a deficit in mineralized surface area, a decrement in the rate of mineral apposition, deceased osteoid surface, depressed osteoblast activity, and decreased numbers of osteoclasts due to abnormal insulin signaling pathway. Other prominent features of diabetes mellitus are an increased urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, and oxidative stress leading to sweet <b>bones</b> (altered <b>bone’s</b> <b>strength,</b> metabolism, and structure).

2500|$|It was {{discovered}} {{as early as}} the 1920s that bicarbonate caused increase in <b>bone</b> <b>strength</b> in patients who were losing calcium in their urine. In 1968 it was suggested that diets producing too much acid might put bones at risk. Experiments by Anthony Sebastian of the University of California, San Francisco starting {{in the late twentieth century}} found that the body was breaking down bones and muscles to release carbonates, phosphates and ammonia, which neutralize acid. Adding bicarbonate to the diet (he used potassium bicarbonate) reduced loss of calcium in post-menopausal women, amounting to the equivalent of [...] "an arm-and-a-leg's worth" [...] of bone if this continued for two decades.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease is}} theorized {{to include the}} artery of the ligmentum teres femoris being {{constricted}} or even blocked too early, not allowing for time when the medial circumflex femoral artery takes over. [...] The medial circumflex femoral artery is the principal source of blood supply to the femoral head. [...] LCP disease is a vascular restrictive condition of idiopathic nature. [...] Symptoms like femoral head disfigurement, flattening, and collapse occur typically between ages four and ten, mostly male children of Caucasian descent. [...] Children affected by LCP disease often display uneven gait and limited range of motion, and they experience mild to severe pain in the groin area. [...] For example, a child may be six years old chronologically but may have grown only four years old in terms of bone maturity. The child may then engage in activities appropriate for a six-year- old child, but lacking the <b>bone</b> <b>strength</b> of an older child, these activities may lead to flattening or fracture of the hip joint. Genetics {{do not appear to}} be a determining factor, but a deficiency of blood factors with anticoagulant property used to disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint. A deficiency of protein C and protein S, which also act as blood anticoagulants, may also exist; if that were the case, their deficiency could cause clot formation in ligamentum teres femoris artery and hinder blood supply to the femoral head. However, no evidence of this has been found; over the years, many theories have been published, but none has stood up to professional research.|$|E

40|$|Akin {{to other}} mineralized tissues, human {{cortical}} bone can resist deformation and fracture {{due to the}} nature of its hierarchical structure, which spans the molecular to macroscopic length scales. Deformation at the smallest scales, mainly through the composite action of the mineral and collagen, contributes to <b>bone’s</b> <b>strength</b> or intrinsic fracture resistance, while crack-tip shielding mechanisms active on the microstructural scale contribute to the extrinsic fracture resistance once cracking begins. The efficiency with which these structural features can resist fracture at both small and large length scales becomes severely degraded with such factors as aging, irradiation, and disease. Indeed, aging and irradiation can cause changes to the cross-link profile at fibrillar length scales as well as changes at the three orders of magnitude larger scale of the osteonal structures, both of which combine to inhibit the bone’s overall resistance to initiation and growth of cracks...|$|R
