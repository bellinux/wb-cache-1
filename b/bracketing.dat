5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's <b>bracketing</b> sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979 {{and made}} its closest {{approach}} on March 5, 1979, {{at a distance}} of 349,000km from Jupiter's center. This close approach allowed for greater image resolution, though the flyby's short duration meant that most observations of Jupiter's moons, rings, magnetic field, and radiation environment were made in the 48-hour period <b>bracketing</b> the approach, even though Voyager1 continued photographing the planet until April. It was soon followed by Voyager2, which made its closest approach on July 9, 1979, 576,000km away from the planet's cloud tops. The probe discovered Jupiter's ring, observed intricate vortices in its atmosphere, observed active volcanoes on Io, a process analogous to plate tectonics on Ganymede, and numerous craters on Callisto.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} there, {{like that of the}} extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating has been carried out on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit <b>bracketing</b> those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic <b>bracketing</b> (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E

One major drawback of these <b>brackets</b> is fracture during archwire torsion or tipping. Another drawback is that each type comes in one shade only: transparent or translucent. Objectives: To fabricate orthodontic <b>brackets</b> from different esthetic materials and evaluate their mechanical properties; to introduce extremely low profile miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> and evaluate their torsional fracture strength; also, to fabricate <b>brackets</b> in shades comparable to natural tooth shades, and compare them to commercial ceramic <b>brackets</b> under different lights. Materials and Methods: CAD/CAM technology was used to mill <b>brackets</b> from: ParadigmTM MZ 100 and LavaTM Ultimate resin composite; Mark II feldspathic porcelain; and In-Ceram® YZ zirconia. The <b>brackets</b> were subjected to two separate tests (torque and tipping). The average moments necessary to fracture the <b>brackets</b> were determined and compared to those of commercial alumina <b>brackets,</b> Mystique® MB and Resolve®. Also, miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> were fabricated and subjected to torsion till failure. Static fatigue test was performed on standard YZ, MZ 100, and Mystique <b>brackets.</b> <b>Brackets</b> were fabricated using CAD/CAM in shade A 3 materials: MZ 100; Lava Ultimate; and Mark II. Zirconia and alumina <b>brackets</b> were also fabricated and colored. Adobe Photoshop software {{was used to determine}} ΔE values between the <b>brackets</b> and A 3 acrylic teeth from digital images taken under three different lights (daylight, fluorescent, and incandescent). The shaded <b>brackets</b> were compared to commercial alumina brackets: Inspire ICETM; Radiance PlusTM; Avex® CX; and Mystique® MB. Results: Standard zirconia <b>brackets</b> had the highest torsional and tipping strength among the tested esthetic <b>brackets.</b> Miniature zirconia <b>brackets</b> showed comparable or even statistically significantly higher resistance to archwire torsion than commercial alumina <b>brackets.</b> Standard zirconia <b>brackets</b> showed the highest survival rate of 83 %.
