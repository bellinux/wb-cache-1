While in Ocala, he tried to become better at basketball by doing 200 push-ups every night. He also visited his hometown during school vacations. In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a growth spurt and stood nearly at 6ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court.

500|$|Bowie {{declared}} himself gay {{in an interview}} with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, [...] "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality". In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, [...] "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me". According to his first wife, Angie, Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.|$|E

As Love later reflected, [...] "The <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> {{to me in a}} way, was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E

He makes {{a phone call to}} Irene to tell her he is leaving and that meeting her and Benicio was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to him. The Driver goes to meet Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. He gives Bernie the money, but Bernie attempts to kill him, stabbing him in the stomach. Driver pulls out his own knife and fatally stabs Bernie. [...] Driver then abandons the money and leaves. Irene knocks at the Driver's apartment, but gets no response. The Driver drives off into the night.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a period}} of adjustment, Selänne gained an {{appreciation}} for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to him. He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post-season berth for the first time. Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed {{it up with a}} third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals. He was named to the First All-Star Team for a second time, while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise's first playoff appearance in 1997. Despite being criticized as being a [...] "one-line team," [...] Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round before being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States. The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if you play the game for a while, you just might find that it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the {{pregnancy}} of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully {{giving birth to}} an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the series" [...] as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X-Files {{at the end of}} the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing". Anderson was not featured at all in the episode [...] "3", as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time.|$|E
500|$|After several {{stand-alone}} episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials {{early in}} the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through production of the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the series", noting that the mythology [...] "really ended up running through {{the life of the}} series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant". Although there were initially thoughts about Anderson's character Scully giving birth to an alien child, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X-Files {{at the end of the}} season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, reappearing comatose several episodes later. In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and X (Steven Williams), and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
2500|$|In Martineau's Autobiography, she {{reflects}} on her {{success as a}} writer and her father's business failure, which she describes as [...] "one of the <b>best</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to us". [...] She described how she could then [...] "truly live instead of vegetate". Her reflection emphasizes her experience with financial responsibility in her life while she writes [...] " [...] fusion of literary and economic narratives".|$|R

By that time, memories of the legal troubles that had surrounded the game were gone. Independence Bowl president Cecil Lloyd said of the controversy in 1993, [...] "It was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> could have happened to the Independence Bowl. ...

500|$|Humor and irony are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} book. Mark Lawson of The Guardian considered the narrator's tone to be [...] "sardonic empath", and other critics have characterized {{the beginning of the}} novel as comical. When Cal is baptized as an infant by Father Mike, a Greek Orthodox clergyman, the priest receives a surprise: [...] "From between my cherubic legs a stream of crystalline liquid shot into the air ... Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... struck Father Mike {{right in the middle of}} the face." [...] Derek Weiler of the Toronto Star noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the [...] "horrific qualities of public men's rooms". The author employed another writing deviceabrupt incongruityin describing Desdemona's physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her [...] "braids were not delicate like a little girl's but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver's tail". According to Penelope Music of Book Magazine, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from [...] "run-of-the-mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy". An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal's grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that [...] "hameful as it is to say, the riots were the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to us." [...] The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout.|$|E
500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E

By 1962, Rohmer (known as {{more conservative than}} many of his fellow contributors) was often at odds with his staff for not promoting New Wave filmmakers. After several financial failures, the directors wanted better publicity, with Cahiers an [...] "instrument of combat" [...] of the New Wave. Rohmer profiled New Wave filmmakers in the December 1962 issue before his June 1963 resignation, when Rivette became his successor.
