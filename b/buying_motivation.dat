Everyone has a role to play regarding this issue: farmers, producers, distributors and most of all consumers. Indeed, as they hold the decisional power whether to buy or not a product, consumers are often considered to bethe key actors to focus on. Since {{there are only a few}} studies about students’ perspectives in terms of their <b>buying</b> <b>motivation,</b> this study focuses on this very topic. In order to help consumers making their choices, eco-labels have been created. They impose some strict norms and standards onthe producers and distributors. They also provide some transparency and valuable information regarding the way food is produced. But,asthis is quitea new initiative,few step-back can be takenyet. Besides, eco-labels’effectiveness is still unclear yet. This leadsus to our research question:How are Swedish students motivated to buy eco-labelled food products?After reading the existing literature regarding this topic, we have identified four main themes that can help us to conductour study: values, norms, budget constraintsand purchase intentions. As our objective is to highlight Swedish students’ motivations, we decidedto conduct a qualitative study. We have chosetwo different methods to gather our primary data: interviews and focus groups. Finally, our conclusion shows that norms and budget constraintsare the most important factors regarding Swedish students motivation when it comes to buy eco-labelled food products.

Almost every town in Indonesia there is modern markets, such as mall, supermarket, department store, shopping center, franchise, mini market, groceries, drugstores, and restaurants. People with different characteristics began to visit modern market to buy goods and services. This kind of market has various goods, either domestics and imports, has various qualities, different supplies in the stock of warehouses, own price tags, and differ service level (air conditioning, comfort and clean atmospheres, goods display separated to the subcategories, product information through reading machine, shopping baskets, cashiers, and shopkeepers). That’s mean it’s many thing can attractive consumer interest for buying in modern market. This study intended to find out the level of buying interests differences in modern market toward students in terms of personality types. This study is non­experiment research.

The research focuses on the Auckland market, specifically on the factors affecting the <b>buying</b> <b>motivation</b> of New Zealanders for themed weddings. Globalisation today has brought about the extension of trends in most developed countries: one of these is the themed wedding. Trends in themed weddings are being exported globally. There is an endless market opportunity for themed weddings in New Zealand just as there is in other developed countries like the U. S. and the U. K. The New Zealand market is making use of ideas for wedding themes from overseas markets. There is a need to keep abreast of the trends for themed packages and related services in order to be successful in New Zealand wedding market. Qualitative methodology has been used as the primary data collection. Thirteen semistructured interviews with wedding planners were tape-recorded and transcribed, and analysed by thematic content analysis. This research found that, based on the statements made by the interviewees during the interview, themed weddings are not currently in -demand: most couples still adhere to a ‘traditional’ setting. However, this does necessarily mean that themed weddings will not be well-liked in the market, as there are already some wedding planners who are marketing themed weddings through their websites. This study also found that popularisation seems far from happening because most wedding planners are not focusing on themed weddings but on their primary service - the standard wedding event. During the interview process most of the wedding planners thought that this concept of themed weddings would be a useful tool to develop their existing business. This research concludes that the wedding planners are gifted to create a market in Auckland or perhaps nationwide for themed wedding packages...|$|E

To this end, 157 Brazilian passengers at Santos Dumont airport (Rio de Janeiro) were invited to participate in a survey. The survey instrument was developed based on the variables and constructs suggested by Geuens, Vantomme e Brengman (2004). The results revealed four dimensions of buying motivation: two of them linked to the characteristics of an airport – “Atmospheric” and “Airport Related” - and two others linked to traditional buying behavior – “Social” and “Functional”.

Thematic analysis of open-ended accounts (n= 113) in Study 1 provides a rich, qualitative map of buying attitude dimensions {{that are important to}} young women and men. Study 2 is a quantitative survey (n= 240) of functional, emotional–social, and identity-related <b>buying</b> <b>motivations</b> in the 2 environments. The on-line environment has an effect on buying attitudes, but more strongly so for women than for men. Whereas men's functional concerns are amplified—rather than changed—in the shift from conventional to on-line buying, women's motivational priorities show a reversal, and less involvement in shopping. In contrast to men, women's on-line buying is associated with barriers (social–experiential factors) and facilitators (efficiency, identity-related concerns) grounded in their attitudes toward conventional buying. This has implications for the ease with which women and men can and want to adapt to the accelerating shift toward computer-mediated shopping...|$|R
40|$|This chapter explores {{what drives}} people toward impulse buying as {{consumers}} attempt {{to deal with}} discrepancies between the way they see themselves (actual self) {{and the way they}} would like to be (ideal self). Several hypotheses can be derived from the social psychological model of impulse buying: some consumer goods make more likely impulse buys than others; self-image concerns are a particularly important decision consideration in impulsive and excessive buying; and systematic differences exist between excessive and ordinary consumers in impulse buying, self-concept, and consumption values, and buying behavior can be predicted from a person's self-discrepancies if he or she has materialistic values. These hypotheses were tested in 3 linked studies that drew on different methodological approaches. A mail survey was used to collect questionnaire measures of planned and impulsive <b>buying</b> behavior, <b>buying</b> <b>motivations,</b> shopping attitudes, and self-concept. In the second study, the authors developed a computer-run study on discount rates for different consumer goods. Finally, the authors carried out qualitative research on the process of, and reasons for, impulse buying using in-depth interviews and shopping diaries...|$|R
40|$|Interlinked {{social and}} {{economic}} changes in Britain, particularly {{over the last two}} decades, have changed the climate in which individuals make consumer choices. Higher disposable incomes, coupled with an easier availability of consumer credit, mean wider choices for a greater number of individuals. An important theme of the ‘Economic Beliefs and Behaviour’ programme is to highlight in diverse domains that the process of choice is more complex than the operation of purely ‘rational’ (in a traditional economic sense) considerations on clear pre-existing preferences. The research reported in this chapter relates to this theme by addressing the claim that widening consumer choices mean that buying behaviour has assumed a greater personal significance in individuals’ lives. Through an examination of buying behaviour and <b>buying</b> <b>motivations</b> we attempt to show that choices about consumer durables are influenced by particular non-functional aspects of goods. Specifically, consumer goods also have symbolic meanings on which people can and do draw in constructing and expressing a sense of self and identity. Buying goods in order to bolster one’s self-image is probably a motivation that plays some role for all buying behaviour, but may be particularly important when people engage in unplanned ‘spur of the moment’ purchases...|$|R

It is important to study non-economic <b>buying</b> <b>motivations</b> as these {{are present in the}} buying of industrial goods and services as well as in consumer purchases. The process of decision making may be long in duration, as is in the decision- making to buy a computer, or short as in the decision- making to buy a packet of sweets, but similar stages may be observed: a general or a specific need is felt; a period of pre-buying activity follows, i. e. an investigation of sources of supply which might satisfy the need; a decision is taken (what to purchase, or even to make no purchase) {{based on the results of}} the pre-buying activity and the strength of the need. The basic need may be either general, e. g. need of a change of environment. The more specific need may arise spontaneously or it may be stimulated by creative marketing.

40|$|Consumer <b>buying</b> <b>motivations</b> can be {{distinguished}} into three categories: functional, experiential, or symbolic motivations (Keller, 1993). Although prior neuroimaging {{studies have examined the}} neural substrates which enable these motivations, direct comparisons between these three types of consumer motivations have yet to be made. In the current study, we used 7 Tesla (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the neural correlates of each motivation by instructing participants to view common consumer goods while emphasizing either functional, experiential, or symbolic values of these products. The results demonstrated mostly consistent activations between symbolic and experiential motivations. Although, these motivations differed in that symbolic motivation was associated with medial frontal gyrus (MFG) activation, whereas experiential motivation was associated with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activation. Functional motivation was associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation, as compared to other motivations. These findings provide a neural basis for how symbolic and experiential motivations may be similar, yet different in subtle ways. Furthermore, the dissociation of functional motivation within the DLPFC supports the notion that this motivation relies on executive function processes relatively more than hedonic motivation. These findings provide {{a better understanding of the}} underlying neural functioning which may contribute to poor self-control choices...|$|R

This dissertation endeavours to create an insightful analysis that helps to understand young Chinese consumers’ purchase motivations toward luxury products. The findings suggest that Chinese traditional culture indeed have impact on consumers’ luxury <b>buying</b> <b>motivations.</b> Specifically, under the collectivist culture, Chinese people tend to care much about others; therefore they are willing to enhance their perceived self-image through buying luxury goods. In terms of the conspicuousness, the findings indicate that Chinese consumers tend to purchase luxury goods are more likely to save “face”, rather than indicate their social status.

40|$|Purpose – This {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the main characteristics, <b>buying</b> habits, <b>motivations,</b> influences, and overall satisfaction of Portuguese online consumers of wine, as well as to assess whether this market segment can be considered a niche. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted in a Portuguese online wine shop during the last three months of 2009. The questionnaire included questions about the consumers’ socio-demographic characteristics, <b>motivations,</b> <b>buying</b> habits and factors influencing online buying behaviour. The questionnaires were delivered by e-mail to regular and new customers when a transaction was processed online. Of the 82 questionnaires received, 74 were sufficiently complete to be used in the study. Findings – The online wine market can be considered a niche in Portugal. As the authors’ empirical work shows, this segment is mainly composed of young, male, well-educated, high-income consumers who buy wine online from home often less than once a month. They are motivated by convenience, a wider selection of wines, availability, and price. As decision factors, they value the origin/brand of the wine, the price, the recommendation of the online shop, and their own experience. A comparative analysis with international online wine consumers found differences based on profile and consumer buying behaviour (patterns and influences). Research limitations/implications – The non-probabilistic sample contained only data from a Portuguese online wine store. Thus, future studies should examine other online wine stores to determine the level of generalisation of the findings to the entire community of online wine consumers. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research conducted in Portugal to identify the main characteristics, <b>buying</b> habits, <b>motivations,</b> influences, and overall satisfaction of the Portuguese online consumers of wine.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the social psychological functions clothes fulfil {{for young women}} and men, and the role that these perceived functions play for their (dis) satisfaction with their clothing generally. Sixty female and sixty male British students indicated why an item of clothing they particularly valued was important to them, including perceived functional and mood-related benefits, but also clothes as means for expressing personal and social identity. They also completed a measure of general (dis) satisfaction with one's clothing (Francis, 1990), and described their current financial circumstances. Results of diverse multivariate statistical tests support all three sets of hypotheses: (1) By comparison, men take a more self-oriented approach to clothes, stressing their use as expressive symbols of personality and their functional benefits, whilst women also have other-oriented concerns, choosing to use clothes as symbols of their social and personal interrelatedness with others; (2) although the perceived need for new clothing depends partly on financial constraints, women {{are more concerned with}} clothing in the context of peer relations, independently of financial constraints; and (3) the patterns of links between social psychological functions of valued items of clothing and general clothing (dis) satisfaction are gender-specific. Implications of gender differences throughout the clothes consumption cycle — <b>buying</b> <b>motivations,</b> purchase, and use — are discussed with respect to differential aspects of clothing advertising likely to influence women's and men's purchases on the one hand, and with respect to consumer policy tasks in assisting consumers on the other, particularly in the context of addictive buying of women...|$|R

40|$|Online group buying, as a {{new form}} of e-commerce, {{is one of the most}} {{innovative}} e-commerce business models. This model offers great opportunities for e-marketers, but also brings new challenges. In the last four years, more than 5000 online group buying vendors in China have gone out of business. Existing literature suggests that online group buying is distinctive from online shopping, and consumers are motivated to use online group buying to enjoy different benefits. As little research has been conducted on understanding consumers in this context, group buying websites have few guidelines to follow to improve competitiveness. This thesis addresses this challenge by exploring the hierarchical motivations underlying consumers’ online group buying behaviour and the development of consumer typologies from a new perspective. Specifically, utilising a Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach and Means-End Chain (MEC) theory perspective, this study aims not only to explore the content of online group buyers’ motivations, but also uncover the inter-relationships among these motivations. Moreover, it aims to introduce a new method to segment consumer, based on benefit-level motivations, which can provide more accurate consumer typologies. To reach these objectives the laddering interview technique was used to collect data from 58 online group buyers in China. A context-specific hierarchical motive model was developed, based on the 35 motivations identified, which not only indicated consumer value/goal fulfilment paths, but also illustrated the relative importance of different paths. Moreover, three typologies of group buyers with distinct value/goal fulfilment paths were identified, fundamentally different from existing shopper typologies in the e-commerce context. As a timely topic using a novel approach to explore consumer online group <b>buying</b> <b>motivations,</b> this study adds to the online group buying literature, introduces a new segmentation approach that overcomes the limitations of the traditional rating-scale based segmentation, and demonstrates theories and techniques derived from other disciplines that can be effectively applied to information systems and e-commerce research.

The idea that buying online provides both asking and hidden cost savings is an assumption that has been promoted by IT advocates of the commercial opportunity. In this research Price (attribute) is to be investigated as a contributor to customer motivations for online purchasing. The investigation is {{to begin with a}} literature search for other factors that are claimed to influence online purchasing and studies others have published in the focus area. Previously research has been carried out by others to understand the changes brought by internet and ecommerce to our lives and business opportunities. It has been found that behavioural characteristics like shopping convenience, information seeking, immediate possession, social interaction, and variety affects the consumer behaviour towards shopping on the internet (Rohm, 2004). There are other factors such as privacy and security affecting consumer attitude towards shopping online (Shergill, 2005). In this research the factors identified from the literature are listed in priority order and the top two used to explain the relationship to price. This approach is taken to limit the cost (financial and time) of the survey and yet to still contribute valuable knowledge regarding price and other factors affecting online purchasing behaviour. The ability to collect price information and make comparisons between the different product and offerings from various providers is argued to be defining for competitive advantage in ecommerce (Jiang, 2002). The research is started by asserting an initial model that suggests price is a moderating factor for other factors when customers purchase online. This model is a “straw man” to be tested. The resource limitations of this short study are managed by selecting only two of the possible constructs affecting online <b>buying</b> <b>motivations.</b> The research is operationalised by submitting banks of potential questions to experts, a pilot study, and reliability testing and then surveying a stratified random sample of online purchasers. Structural equation modelling method is chosen for data analysis and the appropriate approach for confirming (or otherwise) a mediation role for price in online customer purchasing. A metric and a path model were constructed from the empirical data and compared with the initial model. It was found that Price was the dominant motivating factor for those in the sample for transacting online. The initial model was not the best fit for the empirical data and other relationships were explored. Best fit was found by removing the hypothesised relationship from trust to price and establishing the relationship between trust and security. The best fit model hence showed that Price and intention to buy was a very strong relationship...|$|R

Due to the multivariate nature of consumer behavior, both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to provide a more holistic view of the consumption behavior. A focus group technique showed that the diversity of the participants’ experiences with olive oil resulted in differences in existing perceptions regarding what constitutes an EVOO and the meaning of ‘extra virgin’ and determined how the combination of considered factors influenced purchase and usage motivations. A two-stage sorting task was conducted to identify American consumers’ opinions of 25 EVOOs based on visual assessments of the bottles. The majority of the consumers perceived the EVOO bottles similarly; however the two-state sorting task allowed consumers to provide additional criteria of their perception of the products. Means-end chain analysis on the interview data revealed common grounds for consumption and <b>buying</b> <b>motivations</b> with three different consumer segments. As part of the quantitative research methods, survey research was employed to identify consumer preferences and attitudes regarding EVOO. Univariate and multivariate approaches were employed to understand how hedonic scores are related to descriptive analysis measurements. Three segments were identified using cluster analysis; the three segments agreed in the rejection of bitterness and pungency. In general, the positive drivers of liking are nutty, tea, green fruit, and green tomato. Some consumers are less sensitive to the presence of defects in EVOO and tend to like defective oils. Before describing analytical solutions, this chapter first provides definitions of authenticity and {{describes the}} official methods supported by the European Communities, International Olive Council, and Codex Alimentarius. The description of the current instrumental techniques has been split into two groups: (1) those based on contributions from almost all possible analytes (e. g., spectroscopy) and (2) those that rely on the measurement of more definite information obtained from fractionation of olive oil components (e. g., chromatography). In the first group, the chapter describes new applications of Fourier transform-Raman, Fourier transform-mid-infrared, fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), in addition to the traditional application of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for determining trans fatty acids (FAs). The description of chromatographic techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography and HRGC), which are probably the most effective analytical approaches when the separation of olive oil components is required for authentication, includes a discussion about the methods for the individual quantification of FA methyl esters, triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, FA alkyl esters, sterols, hydrocarbons, triterpene dialcohols and alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, waxes, and phenolic compounds. The chapter also analyzes new frontiers of research in the field of olive oil authenticity by means of the implementation of rapid methodologies or the identification and quantification of hitherto undetectable compounds with the help of sophisticated in-tandem techniques that have been developed recently. The next section, however, describes current problems with the official methods despite the arsenal of analytical techniques available at the moment. Because analytical results are not exempt from errors, validated analytical methods are essential for the quality performance of analytical laboratories. Thus, the chapter has a special section devoted to method validation (Cochran and Grubbs tests, precision, repeatability, and reproducibility limits), the definition of validation characteristics (selectivity, sensitivity, robustness, linearity, LOD, LOQ), the use in practice of accuracy values by means of procedures for comparisons between laboratories, the measurement of uncertainty, and general requirements for the competence of laboratories to carry out analytical tests, calibrations, and sampling. The entire section is based on ISO standards. The last section of the chapter, which is focused on future trends and perspectives, analyzes the global meaning of authenticity, genuine olive oils with a chemical composition that does not conform to international standards, and that the new trade standards prevent a casual relation between chemical compounds and authenticity can be interpreted as causal.

40|$|The {{aggregate}} volume oj purchasing hy family firms {{may account}} for half of the industrial purchasing in the United States. However, whether the buying processes of family firms are significantly {{different from those of}} nonfamily firms is unknown. Selected frameworks of organizational buyer behavior are imposed on family business literature in order to address this issue. There is ample evidence that the buyer behavior of family firms should be differenti-ated in five areas: patterns of influence in the buying center, organizational climate, organizational <b>buying</b> processes, buyer <b>motivations,</b> and formula-tion of marketing strategies. All family firms buy goods and services. Since the estimated proportion of fam-ily firms in the United States economy exceeds 90 percent (Lansberg, 1983; Stern, 1986; Beckhard & Dyer, 1983), family firms may be presumed to pur-chase a considerable proportion of all the goods and services produced in the United States. These are not necessarily small procurements. Family firms in this coun-try range from mom-and-pop shops to billion-dollar family-owned corpora-tions included in the Fortune 500 (Bork, 1986; Davis & Stern, 1988). If the proportion of procurement of family firms is equivalent to their proportion of the national gross domestic product or their proportion of all people employed, family firms probably account for at least half of all the purchasing made by businesses in the United States. The current state of the field does not yet per-mit more precise estimates. Purchasing made by businesses is organizational buyer behavior. Those interested in marketing goods and services to other businesses expend consid-erable resources understanding the organizational buying processes of their current and prospective customers. The question for industrial marketers is whether or not family firms engage in organizational buying processes that are significantly different from those of nonfamily firms. If they do, then the curren...|$|R

Standby power is a general term commonly used to describe the low power modes in which many electrical and electronic products are, when not performing their main function. For more than a decade, it has been recognized that the energy consumption in low power modes for electrical and electronic products is an important issue because it represent permanent loads (sometimes up to 24 hours per day) of a huge number of products. With the 1 W standby initiative of the International Energy Agency (IEA), several low power mode measurement campaigns have been led on a regular basis in a number of countries outside and inside Europe Union (EU). Based on these results and on the Energy-using Products Study Lot 6, the EU has prepared new regulation to limit the standby and off-mode power consumption of non-networked household electronic and electrical equipment, which is being applied since January 2010. The IEE project SELINA carried out a large scale monitoring campaign in shops in order to characterise the low power modes of new appliances being sold in the EU market. In order to ensure consistency of the collected data, a common measurement methodology was developed and the same high resolution measurement equipment was used by all partners. This document analyzes the results of more than 6000 different equipments measured in the 12 EU countries involved in the project. Standby and off-mode values by product categories were analysed and compared with data from other regions of the World. The measurements were also benchmarked against the new 2010 / 2013 EU standby and off mode regulation thresholds and the impact of the EU regulation is discussed. It was found that 18. 5 % of the equipments, whose off-mode power was measured, do not respect the EU regulation threshold of 1 W. When the measurements are compared to the 2013 threshold of 0. 5 W, this percentage raises up to 41. 5 %. Regarding standby mode input power, 31 % of the measured products did not comply with EU regulation limit for the 2010 threshold. When the standby measured values are compared to the 2013 limit, the number of products over the EU regulation target increases to 66. 4 %. When comparing the 2009 and 2010 measurements, only a slight decrease of the share of appliances exceeding the EU regulation limits was observed. In parallel with the measurement campaign, an awareness study of the retailers was carried out. This survey helps to understand the customers' <b>buying</b> <b>motivations</b> and the influence of retailers' advice in their choices. The results of the survey show that, despite of retailer's consciousness about the energy consumption and energy labels of the products, other types of sales arguments like the appliance price or functionalities are more frequently used to sell a product. This could be due to lack of visible information in shops related to the equipment energy consumption. Furthermore, the results show that retailers try to adapt their advice to the customers' needs (price and product functionalities). The retailers admitted that publishing more information regarding the energy consumption of products and some kind of cost saving calculator/reference would make the clients to opt for more efficient equipments. Based on the survey results and on the analysis of different existing policies targeting electrical and electronic products in Europe, examples of policies to improve the low power modes situation of the EU market are reviewed. The survey on measures enhancing the market transformation towards more energy-efficient electrical appliances showed a wide range of actions and policy tools in the SELINA partner countries. In national workshops, which mainly took place in the late summer/early autumn 2010, these measures were presented and discussed with all relevant national stakeholders. In most countries, information campaigns (esp. brochures, leaflets, websites, and national labels) are the dominating measure type. In some countries, however, financial subsidies for very energy-efficient appliances, often paid by an energy utility and not by the government, play an important role, too (e. g. in the Czech Republic or Switzerland). In general, the impact of a financial programme is easier to quantify than the single impact of an information campaign, which often serves as an accompanying measure for regulations (labels, minimum efficiency standards) or fiscal and financial measures. International cooperation with key institutions outside the EU, involved in similar efforts, such as the IEA Implementing Agreement 4 E (Efficient Electrical End-use Equipment) with an Annex on Standby, the Energy Star/EPA in USA, the Australia Standby Initiative and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, were used to promote synergies in the definition of common approaches to characterize the market and to define realistic and cost-effective performance targets which can be achieved in a short time frame. Special care is required when promoting low standby consumption products (without consideration of other attributes) to ensure that there are no perverse effects such as the inadvertent promotion of products with low active mode efficiency and high energy consumption. It is desirable to follow a vertical approach to standby, where low power modes are combined with active modes to give total energy consumption. This approach is particularly preferable for products where the total energy consumption is significant. The definition of usage patterns under such a vertical approach is necessarily product specific and this could vary by region or country. The new technologies offer many opportunities for energy savings potential but there are also some threats which need to be recognized and understood. There is a strong need to ensure that energy saving paradigms and strategies become a core consideration in future product designs. It is recognized that equipments connected to networks are of growing importance. It is recommended that increased efforts to compile data and measurements, of networked products, {{from a variety of sources}} in order to obtain better information on networked product characteristics, needs to be made. An online database was created so that everyone can access the input power values, in the different equipment low power modes, of the more than 6000 equipments measured. A Standby Calculator Tool was also developed and can be accessed through the project website. It can be used to calculate the consumed energy, the annual cost and the equivalent CO 2 emissions. In order to compare the results in an easy way, a diagram that shows the energy consumption of the different models is presented. Furthermore, the values for the most efficient device are also showed, in order to have an additional comparison. One of the main objectives of this project was to identify effective market transformation policies initiatives targeted at all the key stakeholders involved in the manufacture, distribution, sales, purchasing and operation of appliances with standby and off-mode losses. As a result of the future policy actions that may appear after the end of the project, considering loads in networked mode, it is expected to achieve very large cost-effective savings of electricity (80 TWh projected by 2020) and carbon emissions (30 MTons of CO 2 by 2020) ...|$|R
40|$|Master of Applied ScienceAbstract Until {{the last}} 20 years {{research}} into the people who buy sexual services has represented less than one per cent of all sex industry research (Perkins, 1999). In recent years, publications from diverse disciplines, including health sciences, medicine, psychology, theology and sociology have added knowledge about people who buy sex, {{in part because of}} the criminalisation in some countries of buying sex. Much of this available literature has established that ‘normal’ men buy sex, and provides information about the prevalence of <b>buying</b> sex, <b>motivations</b> to <b>buy</b> sex, and the risks of buying sex. Some recent qualitative research reveals that buying sex can be a deeply emotional experience with accompanying positive benefits to health and well-being (Earle & Sharp, 2007; Sanders, 2008 a). However, much of the research that has been conducted about people who buy sex has not directly accessed the clients themselves or has not used methods that offer a holistic understanding of their experiences. This empirical study, conducted in Australia during 2010, exposes gaps in current knowledge about men who buy sex, their feelings about buying sex in the context of their other relationships, their feelings about sex workers and money and, the effects of stigma. It is an exploratory qualitative study that represents clients of sex workers in their own words and identifies experiences and issues that are of importance to them. Through interpretive phenomenological analysis, the research project aims to answer the question of how being a client of the sex industry affects how men feel about themselves and their sexuality. An on-line approach to recruitment and data collection ensured safety and encouraged honesty by keeping participants anonymous and was successful in recruiting 137 possible research participants. These self-selecting, volunteer participants were invited to answer a short questionnaire and write a narrative about their experiences, which was guided by asking about key areas of research interest such as: motivations, perceived risks and benefits, and stigma and discrimination. Fifty-three narratives were examined for their suitability and for their depth in addressing the research questions; 27 of these were selected for further analysis based on the comprehensiveness of the narrative and their eligibility for the study. Men who had purchased sex about monthly for at least one year or more were eligible to participate in the study. Data achieved theoretical saturation at which point no new concepts emerged through further analysis. The final sample consisted of 27 men with an average age of 44 who had been buying sex for an average of 18 years. Participants differed in their sexual orientations and the genders of sex workers from whom they bought sex; some men also bought sex from genders other than their identified sexual orientation would suggest. All participants discussed aspects of their relationship status as a justification for buying sex; those who were partnered described why their primary relationships did not satisfy their sexual needs, and those who were single defended their right to buy sex as conferred by their single status. <b>Motivations</b> to <b>buy</b> sex were multifactorial for each participant, which occasionally conflicted within a single account, and mainly related to seeking sexual variety, seeking emotional intimacy, and convenience. Participants considered that the financial part of the commercial sex transaction was more important than the sex, and that emotional benefits of buying sex outweighed both physical benefits and the burdens of guilt, fear of STIs, discrimination and stigma. They demonstrate that their decisions to buy sex are complex and that men are silenced by internal and external stigma, and by not feeling empowered to disclose their status as a client of the sex industry. Participants wrote about their feelings about sex workers, describing feelings of integrity, gratitude and respect towards them. They spoke politically about the sex industry as a whole and also about other clients of sex workers. They rejected stereotypes for themselves while projecting deviant client beliefs onto imaginary others. In addition to identified areas for further research, the findings about sex industry clients’ diversity in buying sex, their fear of STIs, and assertions of condom use, will enable health care providers to offer appropriate sexual health care and education. The stress that participants placed on finances, primary relationships and rejection of stereotypes will assist counsellors and practitioners to better understand men who buy sex and, more generally, sexuality and the human condition. The findings will contribute to dissolution of deviant stereotypes and will allow policy and law makers to consider consumer representatives in debates about the sex industry...|$|R
