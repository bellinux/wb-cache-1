40|$|Amlodipine, marketed {{primarily}} as a <b>besylate</b> salt, is a calcium channel blocker used for treating essential hypertension. Amlodipine maleate is another salt that is considered, in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, similar to amlodipine <b>besylate.</b> This open, randomized, two-period crossover trial has investigated in 24 healthy volunteers over a 144 h period the bioequivalence of amlodipine maleate tablets 10 mg versus amlodipine <b>besylate</b> tablets (Norvasc 10 mg). Plasma amlodipine concentrations were assessed by ultra performance liquid chromatography interfaced with a double quadrupole mass spectrometer. The area under the curve total (AUC(t)) and the area under the curve to infinity (AUC(inf)) values, peak plasma concentration (C(max)), and time to attain peak (t(max)) were not statistically different between the two drugs. AUC(t) and AUC(inf) values were higher (p < 0. 05) in females than in males. The tolerability profile was comparable for the two salts of amlodipine. These findings indicate that amlodipine maleate and <b>besylate</b> are bioequivalent and were well tolerated, {{which suggests that the}} plasma kinetics of amlodipine depend on the properties of the molecule itself.

Most {{of the studies}} investigating the effects of atherosclerosis focused on early atherosclerotic lesions, whereas lesions in human disease, {{at the time when}} medical treatment is started, are already well established. Therefore, we set up a model of advanced atherosclerosis and investigated the effects of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine <b>besylate,</b> and the combination of both on atherosclerotic lesion size and lesion composition. Materials and methods: Olmesartan medoxomil (1 mg/kg/day), amlodipine <b>besylate</b> (1. 5 mg/kg/day), and the combination of both was added to chow and was fed to apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice at 25 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed after 25 weeks of drug administration and perfused with formalin. Innominate arteries were dissected out and paraffin embedded. Serial sections were generated, and lesion sizes and their composition – such as minimal thickness of the fibrous cap, size of the necrotic core, and presence of calcification – were analyzed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to detect DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in aortic tissue. Results: Treatment with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine <b>besylate</b> led to a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE-/- mice (olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine besylate: 122, 277 ± 6, 795 µm 2, number [n]= 14; versus control: 177, 502 ± 10, 814 µm 2, n= 9; P< 0. 001). Treatment with amlodipine <b>besylate</b> (n= 5) alone did not reach significance. However, a trend toward a decrease in lesion size in the amlodipine besylate-treated animals could be observed. In the histological analysis of atherosclerotic lesion composition, significantly thicker fibrous caps were found in treatment with amlodipine <b>besylate</b> (amlodipine: 5. 12 ± 0. 26 µm, n= 6; versus control: 3. 98 ± 0. 18 µm, n= 10; P< 0. 01). Furthermore, all sections revealed morphological signs of calcification, but no difference could be detected. Treatment with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine <b>besylate</b> showed no effect on lesion composition. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts demonstrated reduced activity of the transcription factor NF-κB when treated with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine <b>besylate,</b> or their combination, as compared to controls. Conclusion: Combined treatment with olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine <b>besylate</b> attenuated atherosclerotic lesion progression, possibly due to anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Our data support the hypothesis that even in advanced atherosclerosis anti-inflammatory treatment, using angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and calcium channel antagonists of the dihydropyridine type can attenuate atherosclerotic lesion progression.

40|$|Jae Hong Seo, Jung Bae Park, Woong-Kee Choi, Sunhwa Park, Yun Jin Sung, Euichaul Oh, Soo Kyung Bae College of Pharmacy and Integrated Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon, South Korea Objective: Cilostazol is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System class II drug {{with low}} {{solubility}} and high permeability, so its oral absorption is variable and incomplete. The {{aim of this}} study was to prepare two sulfonate salts of cilostazol to increase the dissolution and hence the oral bioavailability of cilostazol. Methods: Cilostazol mesylate and cilostazol <b>besylate</b> were synthesized from cilostazol by acid addition reaction with methane sulfonic acid and benzene sulfonic acid, respectively. The salt preparations were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The water contents, hygroscopicity, stress stability, and photostability of the two cilostazol salts were also determined. The dissolution profiles in various pH conditions and pharmacokinetic studies in rats were compared with those of cilostazol-free base. Results: The two cilostazol salts exhibited good physicochemical properties, such as nonhygroscopicity, stress stability, and photostability, which make it suitable for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations. Both cilostazol mesylate and cilostazol <b>besylate</b> showed significantly improved dissolution rate and extent of drug release in the pH range 1. 2 – 6. 8 compared to the cilostazol-free base. In addition, after oral administration to rats, cilostazol mesylate and cilostazol <b>besylate</b> showed increases in Cmax and AUCt of approximately 3. 65 - and 2. 87 -fold and 3. 88 - and 2. 94 -fold, respectively, compared to cilostazol-free base. Conclusion: This study showed that two novel salts of cilostazol, such as cilostazol mesylate and cilostazol <b>besylate,</b> could be used to enhance its oral absorption. The findings warrant further preclinical and clinical studies on cilostazol mesylate and cilostazol <b>besylate</b> at doses lower than the usually recommended dosage, so that it can be established as an alternative to the marketed cilostazol tablet.

40|$|The most {{frequent}} cause of mortality and morbidity in industrialized countries is {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD), which in Europe alone is responsible for around two million deaths per year. In 2001 it accounted for about 260, 000 hospital discharges in Italy. The costs of CAD treatment in Italy-which were borne by the Italian state, the third-party payer-amounted to euro 800 million. We propose to assess the pharmacoeconomic implications of using amlodipine <b>besylate</b> treatment in Italy for patients with coronary artery disease. The study {{is based on a}} post-hoc cost-effectiveness analysis that compared standard care supplemented by amlodipine <b>besylate</b> with ordinary standard care over a 36 -month time horizon. The clinical outcome data were based on the prospective randomized evaluation of vascular effect of norvasc trial (PREVENT). Direct medical costs referred to the purchase costs of amlodipine <b>besylate</b> and the cost of National Health Service (NHS) hospitalization. The costs were discounted back {{at an annual rate of}} 5 %. Patients administered amlodipine <b>besylate</b> exhibited a significant risk reduction with respect to any major vascular event or procedure when compared to the placebo group. The reduction mainly referred to unstable angina events and revascularization procedures. We estimated that the total cost of adding amlodipine <b>besylate</b> to standard care amounted to 139, 050 per 1000 patients treated for 36 months. This represents a cost of 1780 per patient remaining free of any vascular event. Results were sensitive to both clinical and economic variables. The incremental costs of the alternative therapy ranged from 296 to 5066 per patient free of any event in, respectively, the best and worst scenario. Amlodipine <b>besylate</b> therapy can be a cost-effective strategy for CAD treatment in Italy. Our economic evaluation demonstrated, first, that by reducing vascular events and the need for revascularization procedures savings were achieved in hospital expenditure, and, second, that such savings could significantly offset drug costs.
