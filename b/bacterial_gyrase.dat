The topo I of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the type I topoisomerase. The eukaryotic topo II, <b>bacterial</b> <b>gyrase,</b> and bacterial topo IV belong to the type II.|$|E

Inhibitory effect of the extracts on DNA gyrase was tested using gel-based DNA supercoiling assay.

Novobiocin differentially affected such transcripts; some transcripts became more abundant while many others were reduced in the presence of this drug. Nalidixic acid on the other hand caused many transcripts to become more abundant albeit to varying degrees.

However, {{it is unclear whether}} the long-term synaptic modulation by neurotrophins depends on protein synthesis in pre- or post-synaptic cells. Results Here we have developed an inducible protein translation blocker, in which the kinase domain of protein kinase R (PKR) is fused with <b>bacterial</b> <b>gyrase</b> B domain (GyrB-PKR), which could be dimerized upon treatment with a cell permeable drug, coumermycin.

Bisdioxopiperazines are anticancer agents that associate with ATP-bound eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) and convert the enzyme into an inactive, salt-stable clamp around DNA. To better understand both topo II and bisdioxopiperazine function, we determined the structures of the adenosine 5 ′-[β,γ-imino]-triphosphate-bound yeast topo II ATPase region (ScT 2 -ATPase) alone and complexed with the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF- 187.

First of all, a joint kernel is designed for complete data which include both visible and hidden variables.

Diones exhibited higher MIC values than fluoroquinolones; however, MICs for fluoroquinolone-resistant gyrA mutants, normalized to the MIC for wild-type cells, were lower. Addition of a 3 -amino group to the 2, 4 -dione core increased relative activity against mutants, while alteration of the 8 -methoxy group to a methyl or of the 2, 4 -dione core to a 1, 3 -dione core lowered activity against mutants. A GyrA G 89 C bacterial variant was strikingly susceptible {{to most of the}} diones tested; in contrast, low susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was observed. Many of the bacteriostatic differences between diones and fluoroquinolones were explained by interactions at the N terminus of GyrA helix IV revealed by recently published X-ray structures of drug-topoisomerase-DNA complexes. When lethal activity was normalized to the MIC in order to minimize the effects of drug uptake, efflux, and ternary complex formation, a 3 -amino- 2, 4 -dione exhibited killing activity comparable to that of a cognate fluoroquinolone.

NovJ/NovK use NADP as an electron acceptor to oxidize the â-OH of the tyrosyl moiety to yield the tethered â-ketotyrosyl-S-NovH.

On single DNA molecules twisted with magnetic tweezers to create plectonemes, the rates or pauses during relaxation of positive supercoils in DAP-substituted versus normal DNA were distinct for both enzymes. Gyrase struggled to bend or perhaps open a gap in DAP-substituted DNA, and segments of wider DAP DNA may have fit poorly into the N-gate of the human topoisomerase IIα. Pauses during processive activity on both types of DNA exhibited ATP dependence consistent with two pathways leading to the strand-passage-competent state with a bent gate segment and a transfer segment trapped by an ATP-loaded and latched N-gate.
