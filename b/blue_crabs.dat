As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E

During seven planktonic (zoeal) stages blue crab larvae float near the surface and feed on microorganisms they encounter. After the eighth zoeal stage, larvae molt into megalopae. This larval form has small claws called chelipeds for grasping prey items. Megalopae selectively migrate upward {{in the water column}} as tides travel landward toward estuaries.

25|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>crabs</b> grow by {{shedding}} their exoskeleton, or molting, {{to expose}} a new, larger exoskeleton. After it hardens, the new shell fills with body tissue. Shell hardening occurs most quickly in low salinity water where high osmotic pressure allows the shell to become rigid soon after molting. Molting reflects only incremental growth, making age estimation difficult. For <b>blue</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{the number of}} molts in a lifetime is fixed at approximately 25. Females typically exhibit 18 molts after the larval stages, while postlarval males molt about 20 times. Male <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> tend to grow broader and have more accentuated lateral spines than females. Growth and molting are profoundly influenced by temperature and food availability. Higher temperatures and greater food resources decrease {{the period of time}} between molts as well as the change in size during molts (molt increment). Salinity and disease also have subtle impacts on molting and growth rate. Molting occurs more rapidly in low salinity environments. The high osmotic pressure gradient causes water to quickly diffuse into a soft, recently molted blue crab's shell, allowing it to harden more quickly. The effects of diseases and parasites on growth and molting are less well understood, but in many cases have been observed to reduce growth between molts. For example, mature female <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> infected with the parasitic rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus appear extremely stunted in growth when compared to uninfected mature females. Blue crab may reach maturity within one year of hatching in the Gulf of Mexico, while Chesapeake Bay crabs may take up to 18 months to mature. As a result of different growth rates, commercial and recreational crabbing occur year-round in the Gulf of Mexico, while crabbing seasons are closed for colder parts of the year in northern states.|$|E

In the Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States the <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> supports a commercial fishery with an estimated worth of $ 165 million/year [1] and a substantial recre-ational fishery of undetermined magnitude that extends as far north as Massachusetts.

However, the <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> population in the Chesapeake Bay has been at histori...|$|R
25|$|Other {{species of}} Callinectes may be easily {{confused}} with C. sapidus because of overlapping ranges and similar morphology. One species is the lesser <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> (C. similis). It is found further offshore than the common <b>blue</b> <b>crab,</b> {{and has a}} smoother granulated carapace. Males of the lesser <b>blue</b> <b>crab</b> also have mottled white coloration on the swimming legs, and females have areas of violet coloration on the internal surfaces of the claws. C. sapidus can be distinguished from another related species found within its range, C. ornatus, by number of frontal teeth on the carapace. C.sapidus has four, while C. ornatus has six.|$|R
25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{recreational}} blue crab fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial crabbing was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing gear types to trap crabs at night. Blue crab spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered {{the growth of the}} fishery for several decades. The first commercial processing plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although commercial processing of hard <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> was not widespread until World War II.|$|E
25|$|Spawning {{events in}} the Gulf of Mexico are less {{pronounced}} than in estuaries along the East Coast, like the Chesapeake. In northern waters of the Gulf of Mexico, spawning occurs in the spring, summer, and fall, and females generally spawn twice. During spawning, females migrate to high salinity waters to develop a sponge, and return inland after hatching their larvae. They develop their second sponge inland, and again migrate to the higher-salinity waters to hatch the second sponge. After this, they typically do not reenter the estuary. <b>Blue</b> <b>crabs</b> along the southernmost coast of Texas may spawn year-round.|$|E
25|$|The early {{blue crab}} fishery along the Atlantic coast was casual and {{productive}} because <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> were extremely abundant. In the lower Chesapeake Bay, crabs were even considered a nuisance species because they frequently clogged the nets of seine fishermen. Early on, the blue crab fishery of the Atlantic states was well documented. Atlantic states {{were the first}} to regulate the fishery, particularly the Chesapeake states. For example, after observing a slight decline in harvest, the fishing commissions of Virginia and Maryland put size limits into place by 1912 and 1917 respectively. Catch-per-unit-effort at the time was determined by packing houses, or crab processing plants.|$|E

25|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} fishery by value is American lobster and Atlantic sea scallop. The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, {{there are nearly}} 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this species of fish had recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, <b>blue</b> <b>crabs,</b> and clam fisheries. These fisheries are pretty much fully exploited.|$|E
25|$|Mating and {{spawning}} {{are distinct}} events in blue crab reproduction. Males may mate {{several times and}} undergo no major changes in morphology during the process. Female <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> mate only once in their lifetimes during their pubertal, or terminal, molt. During this transition, the abdomen changes from a triangular to a semicircular shape. Mating in blue crab is a complex process that requires precise timing of mating {{at the time of}} the female's terminal molt. It generally occurs during the warmest months of the year. Prepubertal females migrate to the upper reaches of estuaries where males typically reside as adults. To ensure that a male can mate, he will actively seek a receptive female and guard her for up to 7 days until she molts, at which time insemination occurs. Crabs compete with other individuals before, during, and after insemination, so mate guarding is very important for reproductive success. After mating, a male must continue to guard the female until her shell has hardened. Inseminated females retain spermatophores for up to one year, which they use for multiple spawnings in high salinity water. During spawning, a female extrudes fertilized eggs onto her swimmerets and carries them in a large egg mass, or sponge, while they develop. Females migrate to the mouth of the estuary to release the larvae, the timing of which is believed to be influenced by light, tide, and lunar cycles. <b>Blue</b> <b>crabs</b> have high fecundity: females may produce up to 2 million eggs per brood.|$|E
25|$|Altieri {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments (Altieri et al. 2012) designed to elucidate the mechanisms driving marsh die-off more specifically. Sesarma crabs are normally preyed upon by <b>blue</b> <b>crabs</b> (Callinectes sapidus), and fish including striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis). Although the cascading effects of overfishing have been demonstrated across various ecosystems (Myers and Worm 2003), research on predator depletion has focused almost exclusively {{on the impact of}} large-scale commercial overfishing (Worm et al. 2009). However, Altieri and colleagues (2012) demonstrated that the predators of Sesarma were, and continue to be, overexploited by recreational anglers. Their results show that die-off and vegetated marshes differed dramatically in recreational fishing pressure, as anglers were observed only at die-off sites.|$|E
