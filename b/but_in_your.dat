25|$|The British came up {{and found}} her to be Princesa, {{carrying}} 64 guns and a crew of 650 {{under the command of}} Don Parlo Augustino de Gera. They began to chase her at 10am, upon which she lowered the French colours she had been flying and hoisted Spanish ones. Mayne addressed his men saying 'When you received the pay of your country, you engaged yourselves to stand all dangers in her cause. Now is the trial; fight like men for you have no hope <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> courage.' After a two and half hour chase the British were able to come alongside and exchange broadsides, which eventually left the Spanish ship disabled. The British then raked her until she struck her colours. The Spanish ship had casualties of 33 killed and around 100 wounded, while eight men were killed aboard both Kent and Orford, and another one aboard Lenox. Total British wounded amounted to 40, and included Captain Durell of Kent, who had one of his hands shot away. The commander of Orford during the engagement had been Lord Augustus FitzRoy.|$|E

500|$|At {{the advice}} of his former editor Raymond de Becker, Hergé {{travelled}} to Zürich to consult the Swiss psychoanalyst Franz Riklin, a student of Carl Jung, to decipher his disturbing dreams. Riklin latched on to the [...] "quest for purity" [...] that featured so prominently in Hergé's dreams, and ultimately in Tintin in Tibet. He told the author that he must destroy [...] "the demon of purity" [...] in his mind as soon as possible: [...] "I do not want to discourage you, but you will never reach the goal of your work.

The album has been compared to the music which was used to soundtrack Sons of Anarchy. Manson called himself [...] "a man of few words" [...] , opting to allow melody to be its primary focus, instead of using characters or extended metaphors to compose lyrics. Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the [...] "guttural, visceral element of music. I [...] holes in these stories so it becomes your story, it becomes more cinematic.
