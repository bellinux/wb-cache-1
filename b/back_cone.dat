40|$|The article {{deals with}} the results of the {{research}} on the influence of aerodynamic coefficient values on the trajectory elements and the stability parameters of classic axisymmetric projectiles. It presents the characteristic functions of aerodynamic coefficients with regard to aerodynamic parameters and the projectile body shape. The trajectory elements of the model of classic axisymmetric projectiles and the analyses of their changes were presented with respect to the aerodynamic coefficient values. Introduction Classic axisymmetric projectiles fly through atmosphere using muzzle velocity as initial energy resource, so the aerodynamic force and moment have the most significant influence on the motion of projectiles. The aerodynamic force and moment components represented as aerodynamic coefficients depend on motion velocity i. e. flow velocity, the flow features produced by projectile shape and position in the flow, and angular velocity (rate) of the body. The functional dependence of aerodynamic coefficients on certain influential parameters, such as angle of attack and angular velocity components is expressed by the derivative of aerodynamic coefficients. The determination of aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives enables complete definition of the aerodynamic force and moment acting on the classic projectile. The projectile motion problem is considered in relation to defining the projectile stability parameters and the conditions under which the stability occurs. The comparative analyses of aerodynamic coefficient values obtained by numerical methods, semi empirical calculations and experimental research give preliminary evaluation {{of the quality of the}} determined values. The flight simulation of the motion of a classic axisymetric projectile, which has the shape defined by the aerodynamic coefficient values, enables the comparative analyses of the trajectory elements and stability characteristics. The model of the classic projectile flight The velocity of the projectile flight in relation to the Earth represents the relative velocity, and the time derivatives of the velocity projections to coordinate frame axis represent the relative acceleration components. The mass of classic axisymetric projectile is constant during the flight, because there is no mass change caused by the rocket engine. The values of components of aerodynamic force and moment depend on the angle of attack being the basic parameter. The projections of the total aerodynamic force, because of the nature of its effect on the projectile, are given in an aeroballistics coordinate frame with the coordinate origin positioned in the center of gravity. The determination of aerodynamic coefficients with respect to projectile construction, i. e. the projectile geometry, is based on the theoretical approach of fluid mechanic equation and it leads to numerical solving of the partial differential equation system with the given boundary conditions and experimental results of tunnel research, i. e. measured flight parameters. In this part of the article, the aim is to describe the functions of dependence of aerodynamic coefficients on given parameters. Flight simulation of the classic projectile The determination of aerodynamic coefficients, i. e. the determination of the motion trajectory elements and stability parameters according to the model of six degrees of freedom, is done on the classic 40 mm axisymmetric projectile model, the shape of which is based on the geometric characteristics of the front ogive part and the <b>back</b> <b>cone</b> with the flat bottom. The equations of the model of six degrees of freedom are given in the aeroballistics coordinate frame. The initial data in the simulation are given for the values of aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives obtained by the calculations and experiments. The analysis of the change of trajectory elements and stability characteristics is done with respect to two given kinds of aerodynamic characteristics. The analysis of the trajectory element change and stability characteristics is also done in relation to the possible discrepancy of the values of aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives. The possible discrepancies are given in accordance with the analysis of the values of aerodynamic coefficients obtained by the calculation and experiment. The influence of aerodynamic coefficients on the classic projectile motion analysis The individual analysis of the influence of aerodynamic coefficients on the motion trajectory key elements and stability characteristics is done. The influence of axial aerodynamic coefficients, normal and side force derivatives, as well as the influence of the pitching, yawing and rolling moment derivatives, is considered. The most important influences of each of the components of aerodynamic coefficients are given and the values of the trajectory elements discrepancies are determined - of range, velocity, angular velocity, derivation, angle of attack and angle of yawing, i. e. stability characteristics - of dynamic and gyroscope stability factors and stability equation coefficients. Conclusion The need for a proper description of aerodynamic coefficients, in physical and mathematical sense, is a precondition of their adequate and reliable calculation. The highest values of aerodynamic coefficients, according to the calculation result analysis, are those of axial force coefficients, normal force and pitching moment, which means that they have the greatest influence on the overall aerodynamic resistance during the projectile motion. The influences of other aerodynamic coefficients are quantitatively lesser, but not insignificant, because they influence directly on the motion stability parameters. The character of the position change of the point of attack is almost the same according to experimental and calculation results. The trajectory elements of the model projectile for aerodynamic coefficients determined by calculation and experiment show considerable compliance in the flight simulation in a computer program with six degrees of freedom in a wide range of initial angles. The difference in values of calculation and experimental values of aerodynamic coefficients demonstrated the difference in the values of the obtained trajectory elements, and particularly in stability parameters. Dynamic derivatives of aerodynamic coefficients (stability derivatives) have great influence on stability motion parameters. Experimental measurement of derivatives of aerodynamic coefficients is very complex and expensive because it entails the use of gauges for each of the derivatives. The importance of improvement of existing calculations and the development of new numerical solutions is evident in the reduction of the experimental research expenses...|$|E

40|$|Cones in the {{vertebrate}} retina {{project to}} horizontal and bipolar cells and the horizontal cells feedback negatively to cones. This organization {{forms the basis}} for the center/surround organization of the bipolar cells, a fundamental step in the visual signal processing. Although the surround responses of bipolar cells have been recorded on many occasions, surprisingly, the underlying surround-induced responses in cones are not easily detected. In this paper, the nature of the surround-induced responses in cones is studied. Horizontal cells feed <b>back</b> to <b>cones</b> by shifting the activation function of the calcium current in cones to more negative potentials. This shift increases the calcium influx, which increases the neurotransmitter release of the cone. In this paper, we will show that under certain conditions, in addition to this increase of neurotransmitter release, a calcium-dependent chloride current will be activated, which polarizes the cone membrane potential. The question is, whether the modulation of the calcium current or the polarization of the cone membrane potential is the major determinant for feedback-mediated responses in second-order neurons. Depolarizing light responses of biphasic horizontal cells are generated by feedback from monophasic horizontal cells to cones. It was found that niflumic acid blocks the feedback-induced depolarizing responses in cones, while the shift of the calcium current activation function and the depolarizing biphasic horizontal cell responses remain intact. This shows that horizontal cells can feed <b>back</b> to <b>cones,</b> without inducing major changes in the cone membrane potential. This makes the feedback synapse from horizontal cells to cones a unique synapse. Polarization of the presynaptic (horizontal) cell leads to calcium influx in the postsynaptic cell (cone), but due to the combined activity of the calcium current and the calcium-dependent chloride current, the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell will be hardly modulated, whereas the output of the postsynaptic cell will be strongly modulated. Since no polarization of the postsynaptic cell is needed for these feedback-mediated responses, this mechanism of synaptic transmission can modulate the neurotransmitter release in single synaptic terminals without affecting the membrane potential of the entire cel...|$|R

40|$|Cone photoreceptors and {{horizontal}} cells (HCs) have a reciprocal synapse that underlies lateral inhibition and establishes the antagonistic center-surround {{organization of the}} visual system. Cones transmit to HCs through an excitatory synapse and HCs feed <b>back</b> to <b>cones</b> through an inhibitory synapse. Here we report that HCs also transmit to cone terminals a positive feedback signal that elevates intracellular Ca 2 + and accelerates neurotransmitter release. Positive and negative feedback are both initiated by AMPA receptors on HCs, but positive feedback appears to be mediated by a change in HC Ca 2 +, whereas negative feedback is mediated by a change in HC membrane potential. Local uncaging of AMPA receptor agonists suggests that positive feedback is spatially constrained to active HC-cone synapses, whereas the negative feedback signal spreads through HCs to affect release from surrounding cones. By locally offsetting the effects of negative feedback, positive feedback may amplify photoreceptor synaptic release without sacrificing HC-mediated contrast enhancement...|$|R

40|$|In the {{vertebrate}} retina, cones {{project to}} the horizontal cells (HCs) and bipolar cells (BCs). The communication between cones and HCs uses both chemical and ephaptic mechanisms. Cones release glutamate in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, while HCs feed <b>back</b> to <b>cones</b> via an ephaptic mechanism. Hyperpolarization of HCs {{leads to an}} increased current through connexin hemichannels located on the tips of HC dendrites invaginating the cone synaptic terminals.

50|$|It is {{believed}} {{that as well as}} this pathway of chromophore recycling described above, that cone photoreceptors have an alternate pathway of chromophore recycling which uses Muller's cells within the retina to hasten chromophore recycling. In this pathway, cones reduce all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol via all-trans Retinol Dehydrogenase, then transport all-trans retinol to Muller's cells. There, it is transformed into 11-cis retinol by all-trans retinol isomerase, and can either be stored as retinyl esters within Muller's cells, or transported <b>back</b> to the <b>cone</b> photoreceptors, where it is transformed from 11-cis retinol to 11-cis retinal by 11-cis Retinal Dehydrogenase.

The time constant of the feedback signal in cones and of the effect this feedback signal had on the responses of second-order neurons was determined using whole-cell patch clamp and intracellular recording techniques. It {{was found that the}} feedback signal in cones had a time constant of around 80 ms, whereas the time constant of the effect this feedback signal had on the second-order neurons ranged from 36 to 116 ms. This range of time constants can be accounted for by the non-linearity of the Ca 2 + current in the cones. In depolarized cones, the feedback-mediated response in second-order neurons had a similar time constant to that of the direct light response of the cone, whereas in hyperpolarized cones, the time constant of the feedback-mediated response in second-order neurons was considerably larger. Further, it was shown that there was no delay in the feedback pathway. This is in contrast to what has been deduced from the response properties of second-order neurons. In one type of horizontal cell, the responses to red light were delayed relative to the responses to green light.

The weakened tooth ends of octoid gearing are generally produced by machining, inevitably resulting in a certain lengthwise dimensional discrepancy and slight profile difference. This in turn very often leads to systematic breakage of teeth. Serious, systematic damage occurs irrespective of the transmission tightness of the outer or inner tooth ends.

It was thought {{for a long time that}} this feedback pathway was GABAergic, because cones have GABA-receptors and horizontal cells release GABA via a GABA-transporter working in the reversed direction. However, recently we showed in goldfish that horizontal cells feed <b>back</b> to <b>cones</b> via an alternative mechanism. In goldfish, negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones shifts the calcium current of the cone to more negative potentials. This feedback pathway is independent of GABA, since feedback cannot be blocked by either saturating concentrations of PTX, the GABA-transporter blocker SKF 89976 A, or application of GABA. The mechanism of negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones involves hemichannels located at the tips of the invaginating horizontal cells, just opposite to the calcium channels of the cones. Current flowing through these hemichannels changes the extracellular potential deep in the synaptic cleft and in that way modulates the calcium current of the cones. Such a modulation of the extracellular potential is called ephaptic. If negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones is indeed ephaptic, other channels present in the synapse should also be able to act as a current source, i. e., should also be able to change the output of the cone. We showed that glutamate-gated channels present at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites can also mediate feedback responses. Surprisingly, although the glutamate-gated conductance of the horizontal cells is eight times the hemichannel conductance, glutamate-gated channels are not the major current source in negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones. In this chapter we present evidence that this is due to the more focal localization of the hemichannels, compared to a diffuse and extrasynaptic localization of the glutamate-gated channel...|$|R
