40|$|The current “Television without frontiers” (TVWF) Directive {{constitutes}} the basic {{regulation of the}} European Community’s broadcasting policy. Adopted in 1989, the Directive provides for the free movement of television broadcasting services in the Union as it requires Member States to guarantee the freedom of reception and transmission on their territory of television programmes which originate from other Member States. Consequently, the Directive harmonized certain national programming and advertising rules. With the aim of protecting the European TV market, it also introduced <b>broadcasting</b> <b>quota</b> for European and independent works. In {{the light of the}} rapid developments in the television sector, a revision of the Directive took place in 1997. Since 2002, the Commission is engaged in a new revision process in order to modernise the rules on televised services. It has also examined the possibility to extend the scope of these rules to cover all services which have an audiovisual content, including new media services delivered by Internet, email, mobile communication, etc. On 13 December 2005, the Commission eventually adopted the legislative proposal for the revision of the Directive. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the Commission’s strategy in reviewing the regulatory framework. First, we will shortly discuss and evaluate the underlying principles of the present Directive. We will subsequently take a look at the elements which require a revision of the Directive. Third, we will examine the Commission’s proposal and we will conclude with some critical comments...|$|E
40|$|<b>Broadcasting</b> <b>quotas</b> of {{domestic}} contents are commonplace in developed countries. The core argument {{for them is}} to promote diversity by making more room for domestic content and hence foster a more diverse production. However, this intuitive reasoning ignores the trade-off between repetition (broadcasting more of the same) and new program diffusion. If each consumer cares only about a small fraction on the total contents of the program, a broadcaster confronted to a quota will find optimal {{to compensate for the}} reduction of foreign programming by increasing the number of diffusions of substitutable domestic programs. Total broadcasting time being limited, this will force the broadcaster to slash marginal (less popular) types of programming, whereby reducing program diversity. This mechanism applies both in a monopoly and an imperfectly competitive setting. It thus undermines one of the main rationales for quotas {{of domestic}} content. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Broadcasting</b> <b>quotas</b> of {{domestic}} contents are commonplace in developed countries, be it for radio or television programming. The core argument {{for them is}} to promote diversity by making more room for domestic content. By doing so, they increase the sales {{of domestic}} content and hence foster a more diverse production. However, this intuitive reasoning ignores the trade-off between repetition (broadcasting more of the same) and new program diffusion that the broadcaster faces. If each consumer cares only about a small fraction on the total contents of the program, and that some con-tents are more popular than others, a broadcaster confronted to a quota will find optimal {{to compensate for the}} reduction of foreign programming by increasing the number of broad-casts of substitutable domestic programs for the most popular contents. Total broadcasting time being limited, this will force the broadcaster to slash marginal (less popular) types of programming, both domestic and foreign. The net effect of a quota can thus be a net reduction in programming diversity, {{in the form of a}} concentration of programming on the most popular contents and a disappearance of less popular genres. In a competitive setting, our setup concurs with the idea that competition between broadcasters also reduces diversity of programming compared with a similar situation un-der monopoly. Using a Stackelberg competition framework, we show that the incumbent broadcaster concentrates on the most popular genres. Since they affect both competitors symmetrically, quotas have the same effect under competition than with a monopoly, thus adding up the two diversity-reducing effects. These results thus call for a re-assessment of the quota policy in the broadcasting indus-try...|$|R
40|$|In global media governance, {{there is}} a growing {{emphasis}} on free trade which could rock the foundations of media regulation in Western democracies. While the US government pushes for a further liberalization of audio-visual services under the umbrella of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the EU, European countries and Canada are more reserved. They see the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) as a threat to their national media culture. Indeed the liberalization of the audio-visual services sector could restrict the possibilities of statutory media regulation dramatically: the funding of public service <b>broadcasting,</b> <b>quotas</b> for local content and support programmes for the audio-visual industry are claimed to be at stake. In their effort to resist the looming liberalization of film and broadcasting, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) experiences an unexpected revival as an actor in global media governance. By bringing in a non-economic perspective on the media, the UNESCO is thought to justify regulation that considers the media as not just another commodity. With the adoption of the new UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity (CCD) there is {{for the first time a}} legally binding international instrument which justifies regulation for the protection and the promotion of cultural diversity. However, the question remains whether the expectations associated with the CCD – namely to create a counterweight to the GATS – are realistic. This presentation aims not only at exploring the potential future implications of a further liberalization for media regulation but also at discussing whether the CCD can possibly stop this development. First it will be argued that the emphasis on purely economic aspects of the media in the current phase of global media governance puts strong pressure on societal regulation of the media. While the implications of the GATS are rather limited at the moment, future trade negotiations are likely to affect media regulation on both the European and the national level. Second, the presentation will investigate the UNESCO's role in global media governance, with a special focus on the new Convention on Cultural Diversity. It will be pointed out that the CCD fills a void within international law by highlighting the sovereign right of nation-states to take measures to protect and foster cultural diversity, including media diversity. Third, before coming to a conclusion, the relationship between the GATS and the CCD will be dealt with. While several clashes between the two treaties are conceivable, at the moment there is no solution in the actual event of a conflict. It will be argued that there is little scope to invoke the UNESCO Convention as a defence against GATS obligations. The chances that WTO bodies take the CCD into account when deciding on conflicts are probably slim at best. Thus, the convention is unlikely to stop the liberalization of audio-visual services...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} three decades {{were marked by}} attempts of the Abkhaz Communist elite to make the autonomous structures more Abkhaz, but their efforts constantly met resistance from the Georgians. Abkhaz nationalists attempted on several occasions, most notably in 1978, to convince Moscow to transfer the autonomous republic from Georgian SSR to the Russian SFSR. That year, the Abkhaz organised a series of indoor and outdoor rallies (including an all-ethnic meeting of Abkhaz in Lykhny) {{in response to the}} mass demonstrations of Georgians who had succeeded in winning for their language a constitutional status of the official language of the Georgian SSR. Although the Abkhaz request of the secession from Georgia was rejected Moscow and Tbilisi responded with serious economic and cultural concessions, appropriating an extra 500 millions rubles (or more) over seven years for the development of infrastructure and cultural projects such as the foundation of the Abkhazian State University (with Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian sectors), a State Folk Ensemble in Sukhumi, and Abkhaz-language television <b>broadcasting.</b> Substantial <b>quotas</b> were also given to ethnic Abkhaz in educational and official positions. For example, by 1990 most of government ministers and regional Communist party department heads were ethnic Abkhaz. Even though these concessions eased tensions only partially they made Abkhazia prosperous even by the standards of Georgia {{which was one of the}} wealthiest Soviet republic of that time. The favourable geographic and climatic conditions were successfully exploited to make Abkhazia a destination for hundreds of thousands of tourists, gaining for the region a reputation of [...] "Soviet Riviera." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{language}} {{issue in}} the Transcaucasian republics revealed {{the sensitivity of the}} national problem in the region. The upsurge of the national movement in Georgia proper led to tensions between minorities as well, in particular with the Abkhaz, who interpreted the concession by the Soviet authorities as a retreat in the face of Georgian nationalism and saw {{this as an opportunity to}} secede from Georgia. In May 1978, several thousands of Abkhaz nationalists assembled in the village of Lykhny to support 130 Abkhaz Communists, who had signed the letter to Moscow, demanding that the Abkhaz ASSR be allowed to be transferred from Georgia to the Russian SFSR. The Kremlin dispatched I.V. Kapitonov, secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, to Sukhumi and installed a new party leader, , in Abkhazia. Kapitonov declared that secession was impermissible, but the government acknowledged the seriousness of the Abkhaz problem by decreeing a costly plan [...] "for the development of the economy and culture of the Abkhaz ASSR". An extra 500 million rubles were appropriated over seven years for economic investments such as a road-building program for infrastructure-poor Abkhazia, and cultural benefits such as the creation of an Abkhaz State University (with Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian sectors), a State Folk Dance Ensemble in Sukhumi, and Abkhaz-language television <b>broadcasting.</b> Besides, ethnic <b>quotas</b> were established for certain bureaucratic posts, giving the Abkhaz a degree of political power that was disproportionate to their minority status in the autonomous republic.|$|R
