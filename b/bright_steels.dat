60|$|No feint or thrust at first, only on guard, {{quietly on}} guard, and Bucephalus {{seemed to be}} {{infinitely}} multiplied at times so quickly did the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flash out in the grey light and then subside again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Powder {{and your}} auld hands are {{but as the}} snail to the swallow against the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> {{in the hands of}} Alan," [...] said the other. [...] "Before your jottering finger could find the trigger, the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane." ...|$|R
6000|$|As I sat musing by {{the frozen}} dyke, [...] There {{was a man}} marching with a <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> pike, [...] Marching in the dayshine like a ghost came he, [...] And behind me was the moaning and the murmur [...] Of the sea.|$|R
6000|$|De la Fosse cried aloud at the sight. [...] "I have no sword. You {{would not}} murder me?" [...] said he, leaning back with haggard-face and burning eyes against his chair. The <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> {{shone in the}} lamp-light. Edith shrank back, {{her hand over her}} face.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 Antonio Marcegaglia {{acquired}} the Belgian Cotubel group, a distributor {{of stainless steel}} products and tubes in France and Benelux, and founded the trading company Central <b>Bright</b> <b>Steel</b> for the distribution of welded tubes in the UK; it also began production of these same products near Birmingham in 1997.|$|R
60|$|A shudder {{ran over}} Joe's frame. Fascinated, {{he watched the}} guard. The Indian uttered a low gasp; his eyes started and glared wildly; he rose very slowly to his full height and stood waiting, listening. The dark hand which held the {{tomahawk}} trembled so that little glints of moonlight glanced from the <b>bright</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R

60|$|There was but {{one thing}} to mention. A little after we had started, the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the water-side to the north. It was {{much of the same}} red as soldiers' coats; every now and then, too, there came little sparks and lightnings, as though the sun had struck upon <b>bright</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Exors of James Mills were {{manufacturers}} of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing {{from a small}} building employing two men to the large Bredbury Steelworks on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> at one point becoming the largest producer of <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> outside the United States. Other products were added from time to time, including cotters for locomotives and rolling stock, engineer's keys, taper pins, grooved fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway permanent way fastenings, rail lubricators and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to the United Kingdom, and in the 1960s developed free machining steels containing tellurium and an alloy replacement steel. The company was later acquired by GKN and closed down in 1985. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} hand. Makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe for the {{squaring}} of logs. The <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flashed through the frosty air, {{poised for a}} perceptible instant above Makamuk’s head, then descended upon Subienkow’s bare neck. Clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting deeply into the log beneath. The amazed savages saw the head bounce a yard away from the blood-spouting trunk.|$|R
60|$|Back again came Mrs. Day {{with a box}} of <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> horn-handled knives, {{silver-plated}} forks, carver, and all complete. These were wiped of the {{preservative oil}} which coated them, and then a knife and fork were laid down to each individual with a bang, the carving knife and fork thrust into the meat dish, and the old ones they had hitherto used tossed away.|$|R
60|$|A long-beaked, <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> ninety-footer floated at ease for one instant within hail of us, her slings coiled {{ready for}} rescues, {{and a single}} hand in her open tower. He was smoking. Surrendered to the insurrection of the airs through which we tore our way, he lay in {{absolute}} peace. I saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his boat dropped, it seemed, like a stone in a well.|$|R
60|$|Weston fancied {{that this}} was probable, for the man was dexterous, and there was applause when he set the bright blade whirling, and passed the haft from hand to hand. Most of the loungers could do a good deal with the ax themselves, and the lean, muscular {{demonstrator}} made rather a striking figure as he stood poised in statuesque symmetry under the lamplight with the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flashing about him.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bright</b> mild <b>steel</b> of {{thickness}} 0.0625 in (1.6 mm) - mean failing stress = 4,980 lbf/in2 (33.7 MPa, 3.50 kgf/mm2) ...|$|R
60|$|And Baby? He had grown, it is true, {{a trifle}} larger; {{but he was}} thin, and bore the marks of evident ill usage. His {{beautiful}} coat was matted and unkempt; and his claws, those <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> hooks, had been ruthlessly pared to the quick. His eyes were furtive and restless; and the old expression of stupid good humor had changed to one of intelligent distrust. His intercourse with mankind had evidently quickened his intellect, without broadening his moral nature.|$|R
60|$|The {{two young}} knights, so goodly in their <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> knelt for their mother's blessing, and then sprang like chamois down the ivy- twined steep, {{followed}} by their men, and were lost to sight among {{the bushes and}} rocks. Yet even while her frame quivered with fear, her heart swelled at the thought what a gulf there was between these days and those when she had hidden her face in despair, while Ermentrude watched the Debateable Ford.|$|R
60|$|Then, as the {{man walked}} up to it very quietly and unconcernedly, it seemed to hump itself {{together}} for a furious bound and rush with lowered head, {{and there was no}} sound in the great building until the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> flashed. Man's breast and gleaming horns seemed to meet, but apparently in the same second the gorgeously clad figure had stepped aside, and in the next the bull plunged forward and came down upon its knees.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. [...] Whet the <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> [...] Sons of the White Dragon! [...] Kindle the torch, [...] Daughter of Hengist! [...] The steel glimmers not for {{the carving}} of the banquet, [...] It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed; [...] The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber, [...] It steams and glitters blue with sulphur. [...] Whet the steel, the raven croaks! [...] Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling! [...] Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon! [...] Kindle the torch, {{daughter}} of Hengist! ...|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} renovations was the {{installation}} of a commissioned sculpture by Douglas Kornfeld called the [...] "Tree of Life", a 17' tall laser-cut <b>bright</b> red <b>steel</b> tree.|$|R
6000|$|Nay, nay, you {{are wrong}} there. It is just [...] "about the matter" [...] that he does know, and knows a great deal, and very accurately; what {{he does not know}} is the matter itself. He will tell you {{wonderful}} things about oxygen gas--how the air is full of it, the water full of it, every living thing full of it; how it changes hard <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> into soft, foul rust; how a candle cannot burn without it, or you live without it. But what it is he knows not.|$|R
50|$|Premiere Specification {{includes}} ambient interior mood lighting, <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel</b> external trim, flying 'B' radiator mascot, {{rear view}} camera, seat ventilation and massage function and a veneered iPod drawer.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile Harry {{had pulled}} the table into {{the centre of}} the room, and {{arranged}} the necessary instruments at one end. The <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> had a most charming and scientific appearance, which added greatly to the general effect. I saw myself already in imagination drawing up an elaborate report for the Royal Society, and delivering a Croonian Oration, with diagrams and sections complete, in illustration of the [...] "Vascular System of a Ghost." [...] But alas, it was not to be. A preliminary difficulty, slight in itself, yet enormous in its preventive effects, unhappily defeated our well-made plans.|$|R
60|$|A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, {{a pair of}} new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, {{redolent of}} opoponax, {{jessamine}} and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly {{on the top of}} a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).|$|R
60|$|The squire {{was waiting}} for me at the stern window, all his faintness gone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped {{overboard}} in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see the <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> shining far below us in the sun, on the clean sandy bottom.|$|R
50|$|The revolver, {{somewhat}} {{unusual for}} the type of weapon, features a manual safety lever. It also features Pachmayr decelerator grips. The Thunder 5 comes in either matte or <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel</b> finish and has fixed sights.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, Osmond's steed {{was led to}} the door, {{and such}} men-at-arms as could be spared from the {{garrison}} of Senlis were drawn up in readiness to accompany him. The boys stood on the steps, wishing they {{were old enough to}} be warriors, and wondering what had become of him, until at length the sound of an opening door startled them, and there, in the low archway of the smithy, the red furnace glowing behind him, stood Osmond, clad in <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> the links of his hauberk reflecting the light, and on his helmet a pair of golden wings, while the same device adorned his long pointed kite-shaped shield.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George {{looked and}} saw a very splendid edifice, having a fine {{architectural}} front that extended for a considerable distance along the street, though a little way back from it. There was a great gateway in the centre; and near the two ends of the building there were two porches on the street, with a splendidly-dressed horseman, completely armed, and mounted on an elegant black charger, in each of them. The horse {{of each of these}} sentries was caparisoned with the most magnificent military trappings; and, as the horseman sat silent and motionless in the saddle, with his sword by his side, his pistols at the holster, and his <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> helmet, surmounted with a white plume, on his head, Rollo thought that he was the finest-looking soldier he had ever seen.|$|R
40|$|Fabrication {{techniques}} for mass manufacture of disposable polymer microfluidic chips {{are important for}} electrospray application used in mass spectrometry. Hot embossing offers advantages over traditional MEMS fabrication techniques and {{is the focus of}} this research. The aim of the paper is to evaluate hot embossed open channel polymer chips using two different hot embossing tools. One tool was fabricated in nickel using the electroforming process, and the other in high carbon <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> by laser machining technique using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser that is normally used for conventional applications. Process parameters are determined and measurement of dimensions and surface roughness of tools and chips are presented. Depending on the fabrication method, each tool exhibits its own characteristic profile feature and surface roughness. Polystyrene and polycarbonate substrates embossed with the electroformed tool exhibited lowest surface roughness of 48 nm compared to 450 nm for the laser machined tool. The embossed microfluidic chips were tested for fluid flow and electrospray and showed good performance...|$|R
6000|$|One {{day that}} summer, I {{came away from}} a luncheon in company of an old College chum. Always {{exciting}} to meet those one hasn't seen for years; and as we walked across the Park together I kept looking at him askance. He had altered a good deal. Lean he always was, but now very lean, and so upright that his parson's coat was overhung by {{the back of his}} long and narrow head, with its dark grizzled hair, which thought had not yet loosened on his forehead. His clean-shorn face, so thin and oblong, was remarkable only for the eyes: dark-browed and lashed, and coloured like <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> they had a fixity in them, a sort of absence, on one couldn't tell what business. They made me think of torture. And his mouth always gently smiling, as if its pinched curly sweetness had been commanded, was the mouth of a man crucified--yes, crucified! ...|$|R
60|$|The street seemed {{filled with}} white figures, {{but they had}} opened out, and in the gaps {{he could see the}} {{dazzling}} stones over which the hot air danced. There was a gleam of <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> in the sun, and he noticed that the walls were scarred. Raw spots marked where the chipped whitewash had fallen off and the adobe showed through. But {{there was no time to}} observe these things; the foremost men were dangerously near. Finding he could now hold his rifle, Cliffe snapped in a cartridge and closed the breach. Then he spent a few tense minutes. The enemy reached the foot of the barrier and climbed up. Rifles flashed from roofs and windows, streaks of flame rippled along the top of the barricade, and one or two of the defenders, perhaps stung by smarting wounds or maddened by excitement, leaped down with clubbed weapons and disappeared. Cliffe kept his place between the table legs and pulled round his cartridge-belt.|$|R
6000|$|Frank Houston on that Sunday {{afternoon}} {{became an}} altered man. The reader {{is not to}} suppose by this that he is declared to have suddenly thrown off all his weaknesses, and to have succeeded in clothing himself in an armour of <b>bright</b> <b>steel,</b> proof {{for the rest of}} his life against all temptations. Such suits of armour are not to be had at a moment's notice; nor, as I fear, can a man ever acquire one quite perfect at all points who has not begun to make it for himself before Houston's age. But he did on that day dine off the two mutton chops, and comforted himself with no more than the half-pint of sherry. It was a great beginning. Throughout the whole evening he could not be got for a moment to join any of the club juntas which were discussing the great difficulty of the contumacious gentleman. [...] "I think he must really be going to be married at last!" [...] one club pundit said when a question was asked as to Houston's singular behaviour on the occasion.|$|R
60|$|The English knight {{accordingly}} {{introduced a}} person, apparently of no higher rank than a Nubian slave, whose appearance was nevertheless highly interesting. He was of superb stature and nobly formed, and his commanding features, although almost jet-black, showed nothing of negro descent. He wore over his coal-black locks a milk-white turban, and {{over his shoulders}} a short mantle of the same colour, open in front and at the sleeves, under which appeared a doublet of dressed leopard's skin reaching within a handbreadth of the knee. The rest of his muscular limbs, both legs and arms, were bare, excepting that he had sandals on his feet, and wore a collar and bracelets of silver. A straight broadsword, with a handle of box-wood and a sheath covered with snakeskin, was suspended from his waist. In his right hand he held a short javelin, with a broad, <b>bright</b> <b>steel</b> head, of a span in length, and in his left he led by a leash of twisted silk and gold a large and noble staghound.|$|R
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used for all major parts of the pistol {{including}} the frame, slide and barrel. The pistol was offered in four models: the Survivor, Survivor Guardsman, Hunter and the Hunter Guardsman models. The Survivor models come in a <b>bright</b> stainless <b>steel,</b> high-luster finish while the Hunter models are available in a matte finish. The Guardsman models have squared-off trigger guards instead of the rounded trigger guards found on the non-Guardsman models.|$|R
