5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E

5|$|Irene {{also caused}} severe {{agricultural}} damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $338million Floodwaters killed 30cattle at one farm, though the owners protected {{the rest of}} their 1700cattle <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> feeding areas above the flood plain. According to an initial estimate, the flooding destroyed between 5% and 15% of fruit groves along its path. The flooding delayed the winter planting of corn and bell peppers and damaged tomato plants, forcing Miami-Dade County growers to replant damaged crops. The hurricane also damaged sugar cane, vegetables, and citrus crops, with citrus canker spreading after the storm passed through the area. Due to the crop damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward, Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties as disaster areas. This qualified eligible farmers for low-interest emergency loans.|$|E
5|$|Known predators of the bluespotted ribbontail ray include {{hammerhead sharks}} (Sphyrna) and {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops); {{it is also}} potentially preyed upon by other large fishes and marine mammals. When threatened, this ray tends to flee at high speed in a zigzag pattern, to throw off pursuers. Numerous parasites have been identified from this species: the tapeworms Aberrapex manjajiae, Anthobothrium taeniuri, Cephalobothrium taeniurai, Echinobothrium elegans and E. helmymohamedi, Kotorelliella jonesi, Polypocephalus saoudi, and Rhinebothrium ghardaguensis and R. taeniuri, the monogeneans Decacotyle lymmae, Empruthotrema quindecima, Entobdella australis, and Pseudohexabothrium taeniurae, the flatworms Pedunculacetabulum ghardaguensis and Anaporrhutum albidum, the nematode Mawsonascaris australis, the copepod Sheina orri, and the protozoan Trypanosoma taeniurae. This ray has been observed soliciting cleanings from the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> margins of its disc and pelvic fins.|$|E

5|$|MediEvil 2, stylised as MediEvil II in North America, is an action-adventure hack and slash {{video game}} {{developed}} by SCE Cambridge Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It is the second instalment in the MediEvil series and a sequel to MediEvil. It was first released on 19 April 2000 in Europe and 30 April 2000 in North America. Taking place 500 years after {{the events of the}} first game, it follows series' protagonist Sir Daniel Fortesque's revival in Victorian era London as he attempts to stop sorcerer Lord Palethorn and Jack the Ripper's plans to terrorise the city <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth is achieved <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> lane speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s {{and increasing the}} number of AV data lanes from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 lanes to carry data). The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). The lane data structure has been changed to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E
5|$|The year 1918 saw the {{introduction}} of the Education Act 1918, commonly also known as the Fisher Act as it was devised by Herbert Fisher. The act enforced compulsory education from 5–14 years, but also included provision for compulsory part-time education for all 14 to 18-year-olds. There were also plans for expansion in tertiary education, <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> participation age to 18 though cuts in public spending after World War I made this impractical. This is the first act which starting planning provisions for young people to remain in education until the age of 18. The 1918 act was not implemented until a further act of 1921 was passed.|$|E

5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. <b>By</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Justinian also {{tore down}} the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The {{original}} building was a cruciform basilica {{with a central}} domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but with a central dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over {{the arms of the}} cross had pendentives but no windows. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's Basilica of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's Basilica are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church.|$|E
5|$|MediEvil 2 is {{the second}} {{instalment}} in the series {{and serves as a}} direct sequel to the first game. It was released on 19 April 2000 in Europe and 30 April 2000 in North America.

5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E
5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow <b>by</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
