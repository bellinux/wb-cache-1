5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything {{they do not want to}} do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E

25|$|A {{compound}} fracture {{is one that}} communicates with the external environment. In the case of mandibular fractures, communication may occur through {{the skin of the}} face or with the oral cavity. Mandibular fractures that involve the tooth-bearing portion of the jaw are by definition {{compound fracture}}s, because there is at least a communication via the periodontal ligament with the oral cavity and with more displaced fractures there may <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> tearing of the gingival and alveolar mucosa.|$|E
25|$|Wang was {{confirmed}} as Mayor of Beijing in early 2004. As mayor, Wang {{also served as}} the executive chair of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG).

25|$|Meanwhile, Hammerschmidt {{continues}} to investigate Zoe's death, and is given information {{by an unknown}} leaker within the White House. Major document dumps are made available to Hammerschmidt, which, among other charges, prompts an impeachment hearing against Frank. In response, the Underwoods set up extensive surveillance on all White House personnel. Eventually, the leaker makes a voice-modulated call to Hammerschmidt, implicating Doug in Zoe's murder. The Underwoods convince Doug to take the fall for killing Zoe, and the leaker is revealed to <b>be</b> <b>Frank</b> himself.|$|E

The terminally ill Joe pretends to <b>be</b> <b>Frank,</b> walks outside, and is killed by sniper from the Vice President's personal hit squad. The confusion, as well as Victoria's cover fire, buys the team enough time to leave the mansion, but Sarah is captured. They escape {{with the help of}} Ivan, who is Victoria's old flame. Frank calls Cooper from his family's phone and warns him against harming Sarah.|$|E
25|$|Winter {{wrote that}} Edmonds did not canvass {{the opinion of}} veterans, which was untrue—some volumes were sent to 1,000 or more {{officers}} for their comments, {{as well as being}} checked against unit diaries down to battalion level—in some cases entire chapters were rewritten (or in the case of Passchendaele, the volume was rewritten several times in the 1940s, during disputes about the roles of Haig and Hubert Gough, who was still alive). Winter quoted, out of context, Edmonds' advice to his researchers to write a draft narrative first, then invite interviewees to comment over lunch: Andrew Green, in his study of the Official History, wrote that this was done deliberately, for memories to be jogged by the draft narrative and that senior officers were more likely to <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> if approached informally. Winter doubted that Haig had passed out of Sandhurst top of his year or been awarded the Anson Sword but this was refuted by S. A. Anglim, who consulted the Sandhurst records.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} {{character}} Adrian Monk have been positive. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times called Monk [...] "TV's most original sleuth ever". In {{a review of}} the show's pilot, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle stated: [...] "With his history and his sympathetic but funny 'problems', he [...] becomes one of television's most likable characters and floats a show that is, to <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> riddled with improbability and simplicity". Monk is ranked number 99 on Bravo's list of The 100 Greatest Television Characters of All Time. He was named one of TV's Smartest Detectives by AOL.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney recalled, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> I {{was really}} surprised, {{because we thought}} we were {{creating}} the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E

500|$|An on- and {{off-road}} {{version of}} the Super Cub, what today would be classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, {{and even more so}} the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. [...] "When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. People always suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, to <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> I was never impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle make did—they listened." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Cecil and Tony Warriner {{had worked}} {{together}} at Artic Computing, an English video game development company. In 1990, {{they decided that}} they would {{set up their own}} video game development company, together with David Sykes and Noirin Carmody. The four started up Revolution Software, initially based in Hull, with a 10 thousand pounds loan from Cecil's mother. Cecil wanted the game to differ from popular Sierra games at the time, saying: [...] "While I enjoyed Sierra games, I felt that there had to be more than yet again saving King Graham of Daventry from a – let’s <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> – fairly unlikely series of events. It was all a little bit twee. So we {{came up with the idea}} of writing an adventure game that did not take itself too seriously, but did have a serious story – something in-between Lucasarts and Sierra." [...] The game was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Sesame Street {{debuted in}} the USA, the CTW was asked {{independently}} by producers from several countries to produce {{versions of the}} series in their countries. Cooney remarked, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> I was really surprised, because {{we thought we were}} creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, [...] "After [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series. [...] By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term [...] "co-productions".|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created".

500|$|Originally from The Bronx, New York, Frank was the {{intended}} pilot of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, which crashed {{on an island}} in the South Pacific. He is first encountered in The Bahamas, ringing the NTSB to state that the body of the pilot of Flight 815 shown on the sea bed, on the Television news, is not who it is claimed to <b>be.</b> <b>Frank</b> is later recruited as a pilot on behalf of Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who is chartering a freighter destined for the island upon which Flight 815 crashed. Frank reveals himself to be a conspiracy theorist who believes there are still survivors of Flight 815. He goes on to pilot a helicopter from the freighter to the island, which malfunctions on approach. His team—consisting of Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung)—parachute to safety, and Frank is able to land the helicopter without incurring significant damage. Lapidus identifies Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) as a [...] "local" [...] and in response to the return of Charlotte, who was being held hostage by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), flies Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) to the freighter.|$|E
500|$|Philadelphia Inquirer {{television}} critic Jonathan Storm strongly {{criticized the}} show, {{calling it a}} flat, [...] "miscast mess" [...] with serious structural problems. Storm also said the Leslie character lacked energy and Poehler was playing the part against her comedic strengths. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said, [...] "Poehler's show unfortunately isn't worthy of her. It's dry and hesitant when one longs {{for it to be}} raucous and madcap." [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News said the show was not funny enough to deserve Poehler's comedic talents, and compared the dialogue to a Saturday Night Live sketch that he said could not sustain a whole sitcom. New York Post television critic Linda Stasi said the pilot lacked laughs and was so similar to The Office that [...] "it's starting to look like a one-trick pony outfit that's gonna keep dressing that horse up in new saddles, hoping that no one will guess it's been around the track so many times, it's worn a ditch in the dirt." [...] The pilot episode premiered in Australia on Channel Seven on December 1, 2009, when episodes from the critically acclaimed second season were already playing in the United States. Sacha Moritorisz of The Sydney Morning Herald said of the episode, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> tonight's premiere is weak. But the potential is obvious and word from the US is that it gets much better." ...|$|E
