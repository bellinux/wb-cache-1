25|$|The {{branch of}} {{technology}} that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can {{take the place of}} humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of <b>bio-inspired</b> robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.|$|E
25|$|These {{technologies}} {{are used to}} develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots {{can be used in}} any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of <b>bio-inspired</b> robotics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bio-inspired</b> robotic {{locomotion}} is {{a fairly}} new subcategory of <b>bio-inspired</b> design. It is about learning concepts from nature and applying them {{to the design of}} real-world engineered systems. More specifically, this field is about making robots that are inspired by biological systems. Biomimicry and <b>bio-inspired</b> design are sometimes confused. Biomimicry is copying the nature while <b>bio-inspired</b> design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature. Biomimicry has {{led to the development of}} a different branch of robotics called soft robotics. The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat. However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality. <b>Bio-inspired</b> robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field. The designer should then try to simplify and enhance that mechanism for the specific task of interest. <b>Bio-inspired</b> roboticists are usually interested in biosensors (e.g. eye), bioactuators (e.g. muscle), or biomaterials (e.g. spider silk). Most of the robots have some type of locomotion system. Thus, in this article different modes of animal locomotion and few examples of the corresponding <b>bio-inspired</b> robots are introduced.|$|E

5000|$|The way {{in which}} <b>bio-inspired</b> {{computing}} differs from the traditional artificial intelligence (AI) is in how it takes a more evolutionary approach to learning, {{as opposed to what}} could be described as 'creationist' methods used in traditional AI. In traditional AI, intelligence is often programmed from above: the programmer is the creator, and makes something and imbues it with its intelligence. <b>Bio-inspired</b> computing, on the other hand, takes a more bottom-up, decentralised approach; <b>bio-inspired</b> techniques often involve the method of specifying a set of simple rules, a set of simple organisms which adhere to those rules, and a method of iteratively applying those rules.
