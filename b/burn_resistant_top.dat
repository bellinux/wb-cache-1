40|$|Semi-solid {{processing}} (SSP) is {{a popular}} near-net-shape forming technology for metals, while its application is still limited in titanium alloy mainly due to its low formability. Recent works showed that SSP could effectively enhance the formability and mechanical properties of titanium alloys. The processing parameters such as temperature and forging rate/ratio, are directly correlated with the microstructure, which endow the alloy with different chemical and physical properties. Specifically, as a key structural material for the advanced aero-engine, the <b>burn</b> <b>resistant</b> performance is a crucial requirement for the <b>burn</b> <b>resistant</b> titanium alloy. Thus, this work aims to assess the burning behavior of Ti 14, a kind of <b>burn</b> <b>resistant</b> alloy, as forged at different semi-solid forging temperatures. The burning characteristics of the alloy are analyzed {{by a series of}} burning tests with different burning durations, velocities, and microstructures of burned sample. The results showed that the burning process is highly dependent on the forging temperature, {{due to the fact that}} higher temperatures would result in more Ti 2 Cu precipitate within grain and along grain boundaries. Such a microstructure hinders the transport of oxygen in the stable burning stage through the formation of a kind of oxygen isolation Cu-enriched layer under the burn product zone. This work suggests that the burning resistance of the alloy can be effectively tuned by controlling the temperature during the semi-solid forging process...|$|R

There is little research or public health effort directed toward Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, because it is assumed to cause less severe enteric fever than does S. enterica serovar Typhi. There are few data {{on which to base}} this assumption, little is known of the serovar’s antibacterial susceptibilities, and there is no readily available tolerable vaccination. Methods. A prospective study was conducted of 609 consecutive cases of enteric fever (confirmed by blood culture) to compare the clinical phenotypes and antibacterial susceptibilities in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A infections. Variables independently associated with either infection were identified to develop a diagnostic rule to distinguish the infections. All isolates were tested for susceptibility to antibacterials. Results. Six hundred nine patients (409 with S. Typhi infection and 200 with S.

In this study, fully crystalline air plasma sprayed Si/mullite/BSAS-celsian EBCs were engineered under controlled conditions on SiC substrates. The influence of water vapor corrosion on the structural and mechanical properties of a Si/Mullite/BSAS EBC architecture was assessed by furnace thermal cycle testing (i. e.; 50 and 100 cycles, 2 h/cycles at 13000 C in water vapor atmosphere). The elastic modulus values of the as-sprayed BSAS top coat (7516 GPa as determined via indentation) did not exhibit major changes after thermal exposure (7818 GPa). In addition, the BSAS layer exhibited crack healing at high temperatures, the density of cracks decreasing from 15 cracks/cm in the as-sprayed state to 2 cracks/cm after thermal cycling. These characteristics of the BSAS top coat were related to its glass-ceramic nature, the phase/chemical stabilities of the BSAS-celsian at high temperatures and the engineered deposition conditions at which it was deposited. The overall performance at high-temperature of this functionally graded EBC architecture is discussed and correlated to its microstructural characteristics. 9 2012.

However, direct application of integrated thin film sensors on mechanical components {{will be an important}} issue for the future. That is the reason why we developed laser based patterning methods for the fabrication of electrical circuits on mechanical parts. For sensor preparation the complex surfaces at first will be coated by PVD- and CVD-techniques with an insulating layer (typical thickness 4 µm and a sensor and circuit layer, with a thickness in the range of some nanometers to a few microns, preferably 200 nm to 300 nm.

The characterisation of the laser structured micro sensors was done by light- and scanning electon microscopy and profilometry.

40|$|T he {{concept of}} {{perpetual}} pavements, orlong-lasting asphalt pavements, is notnew. Actually, full-depth and deep-strength asphalt pavement structures {{have been constructed}} since the 1960 s. Full-depth pavements are constructed directly on subgrade soils, and deep-strength sections are placed on relatively thin granular base courses. One of the chief advantages of these pavements is that the overall section of the pavement is thinner than those employing thick granular base courses. As a result, the potential for traditional fatigue cracking may be reduced, and pavement distress may be confined to the upper layer of the structure. Both are advantages to perpetual pavements. Thus, when surficial distress reaches a critical level, an economical solution is to remove the very top layer and replace it to the same level. Recent efforts in materials selection, mixture design, performance testing, and pavement design offer a methodology to obtaining long-lasting performance from asphalt pavement structures (greater than 50 years) while periodically replacing the pavement surface. The thrust is to combine a rut resistant, impermeable, and wear <b>resistant</b> <b>top</b> structural layer with a rut resistant and durable intermediate layer and a fatigue resistant and durable base layer as shown in Figure 1. Though {{the use of a}} perpetual pavement is focused at high-volume traffic, the justification may be made for medium- and low-volume roads as well. The criteria used in Maryland and California for high-volume traffic is discussed below. Maryland incorporates a thick asphalt structure surfaced with a stone matrix asphalt (SMA) on roads where the posted speed limit is 55 mph or greater, and the traffic is at 2000 equivalent single axle load (ESAL) /day or greater. California uses such designs when the truck traffic exceeds 15, 000 vehicles/day or the average daily traffic is greater than 150, 000 vehicles/day. Thus, it is conceivable, that with the right design approach, the use of perpetual pave-ments could become common on medium- and low-volume roads as well. Currently, most pavement design procedures do not consider each pavement layer to explain its characteristics relating t...|$|R

Preferably, the layer is formed by thermal spraying of a coating powder having a cemented carbide-like microstructure and consisting of two cubic hard material phases, forming a clad core particle structure with the hard material phase consisting mainly of Ti and C in the core and of Ti, a second metal and C in the cladding, embedded in a binder phase of Ni, Co and/or Fe.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} hot {{isostatic}} pressing (HIPping) variables such as HIPping temperature, HIPping cycle and powder particle size, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of HIPped samples of two Ti alloys have been assessed.

The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder was made by the plasma rotating electrode process (PREP). BuRTi powders, which were made both by gas atomisation and by PREP were HIPped to investigate the influence of the initial structure of the powder on the microstructure and associated mechanical properties of the HIPped alloy. The PREP Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder was shown to be fully martensitic in the as-atomised condition. The gas-atomised and PREP powders of BuRTi showed very different as-atomised structures, but in both cases the structure was, as expected single phase beta, with the carbon retained insolution. The individual particles of gas-atomised BuRTi powder were always polycrystalline, although there was a significant scatter in grain sizes within different particles. In contrast the individual particles in the PREP powder were either coarse grained polycrystals or single crystals. These differences led to significant differences in the microstructures and properties of HIPped samples. It was found that HIPping of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples resulted in the formation of equiaxed regions and lath-like microstructure. The small equiaxed regions are formed by recrystallisation which occurs at original particle boundaries where most of the deformation occurs during HIPping; the lath-like microstructure is formed by simply tempering the (less deformed) original alpha prime martensite within the central part of original particles. Among the three HIPping temperatures used, samples machined from powder HIPped at 930 °C exhibited a better balance of properties than those HIPped at 880 °C or 1020 °C. The fatigue properties of samples HIPped at 930 °C, made using different HIPping procedures were compared. It was found that samples which contain the as-HIPped surface, which were made using a new HIPping procedure, have better fatigue properties than samples with as-HIPped, machined or electro-polished surfaces which were produced by conventional HIPping. The properties of optimally HIPped Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples are as good as or better than ingot-route samples. In the case of BuRTi the original single crystals or coarse grained polycrystals in the PREP powder are retained after HIPping and limited grain growth occurs in the gas-atomised samples. The tensile strength is comparable for the gas-atomised and PREP samples, but samples tested to failure showed a significant scatter in ductility (a larger scatter in the PREP powder samples) and all fracture surfaces contained large circular fracture initiation sites, with larger sites associated with lower ductility. Initiation occurs in the centre of these circular regions in large grains or in adjacent grains which have similar orientations and the failed region expands symmetrically in powder samples where no texture is expected. The fatigue properties of the PREP samples are much lower whereas the fatigue properties of the gas atomised samples are better than those of samples from ingot route. This behaviour is associated with obvious facetted failure sites in the PREP powder samples where it is suggested that the coarser microstructure has allowed persistent slip to occur leading to localised deformation and to premature failure. These observations are discussed in terms of the potential of net shape HIPping for the production of engineering components and in this context the fact that a new HIPping schedule has been developed during this study, where the fatigue properties of samples containing an as-HIPped surface are excellent, is very significant.

Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) produced by clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased considerably in recent years. This may cause phenotypic resistance to virtually all clinically available β lactams. The drug resistance due to MBL has a potential for rapid spread to other micro organisms. Method: A prospective study was conducted {{over a period of}} 8 months. All the Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from infected burn wounds of patients admitted in <b>burn</b> ward. Imipenem <b>resistant</b> isolates were further tested by Hodge test, disk potentiation test, double disk synergy test (DDST) and MBL E test. Results: Out of total 140 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 42 (30 %) were imipenem resistant, among which, 20 (14. 28 %) were non MBL producers and 22 (15. 71 %) were MBL producers. MBL producers were more resistant to commonly used antibiotics than non MBL producers. All isolates were sensitive to colistin (10 µg) and polymyxin B (300 µg). Conclusion: Incidence of MBL producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is relatively high in our set up. Simple methods for MBL production should be done routinely.

We have developed and validated a two-site enzyme chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantifying Top 1 levels in tumor biopsies. Analytical validation of the assay established the inter-day coefficient of variation at 9. 3 %± 3. 4 % and a 96. 5 %± 7. 3 % assay accuracy. Preclinical fit-for-purpose modeling of topotecan time- and dose-effects was performed using topotecan-responsive and -nonresponsive xenografts in athymic nude mice. Higher baseline levels of Top 1 were observed in topotecan-responsive than -nonresponsive tumors. Top 1 levels reached a maximal decrease 4 to 7 hours following treatment of engrafted mice with topotecan and the indenoisoquinoline NSC 724998. Our analysis of Top 1 levels in control and treated tumors supports the previously proposed mechanism of action for Top 1 inhibitor efficacy, wherein higher baseline Top 1 levels lead to formation of more covalent-complex-dependent double-strand break damage and, ultimately, cell death. In contrast, xenografts with lower baseline Top 1 levels accumulate fewer double-stand breaks, and may be more <b>resistant</b> to <b>Top</b> 1 inhibitors. Our results support further investigation into the use of Top 1 levels in tumors as a potential predictive biomarker. The Top 1 immunoassay described in this paper has been incorporated into a Phase I clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute to assess pharmacodynamic response in tumor biopsies and determine whether baseline Top 1 levels are predictive of response to indenoisoquinoline Top 1 inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Burn injury causes {{mechanical}} disruption to the skin, {{which allows}} environmental microbes {{to invade the}} deeper tissues. A prospective study of infections in burn patients {{has shown that the}} incidence of hospital acquired bacterial infection in burn wounds was high. In the Burns Unit, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, 94 patients were hospitalized from January to July 2004. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the hospital acquired infections in burn wounds. Using a cross sectional study, 49 patients were included. The specimens for bacterial investigation were obtained from clean eschar which has healthy tissue taken at day 1, day 5 and day 10. At the same time, bacterial investigations were conducted from the air and the water, as well as from the hand and nasal swabs of hospital personnel. The results show that Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most prominent bacterium found in the wounds, but it is also found in the air. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the number two causative bacteria which caused a change of the bacterial infectivity on day 5 and 10. These bacteria were always found when we conducted bacterial investigations from the water resource of the <b>burns</b> unit. Methicillin <b>Resistant</b> Staphylococcus aureus is also found in the nasal swab of hospital personnel. Using the antibiogram pattern, there were similarities between bacteria found in the wounds and in bacteria found in the air and water. In conclusion, hospital acquired burn wound infection in Burns Unit, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital is as high as 62 %. The surveillance data are very important for developing good clinical practice guidelines in burn injury treatment and managemen...|$|R
40|$|Background: Human {{embryonic}} kidney- 293 (HEK- 293) {{cells are}} commonly used as a transient expression host but their application in stable therapeutic protein production is limited. This is presumably due {{to the absence of}} a suitable amplifiable expression system and hence limited protein output compared with other mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells. This paper describes a rapid clonal selection method for isolating HEK 293 cell lines with high specific productivity, for a non-amplifiable expression system, to achieve high-level, scalable expression of recombinant antibodies. Results: Flow cytometry utilizing cold capture of secreted protein on the cell surface was applied to isolate high expressing clones from a stable antibiotic <b>resistant</b> pool. The <b>top</b> three isolated clones showed a five- to seven-fold improvement in volumetric outputs compared with the initial resistant pool (~ 20 mg L) under batch conditions. In fed-batch conditions using commercially available hydrolysate supplements, the final titre was further increased to 500 - 600 mg L in shaker flasks. One clone was scaled up to 25 L bag production using a similar hydrolysate feeding regime. The antibody titre reached 655 mg L, and 12 g of antibody was recovered after purification, demonstrating scalability of the process. The process of clonal selection through to fed-batch production of gram quantities was completed within 4 months. Conclusion: HEK- 293 cells {{can be used as a}} stable host for the production of biopharmaceuticals, producing gram quantities of recombinant proteins for preclinical development...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} a simple, {{solution}} based processing route {{for the formation}} of large surface area electrodes resulting in improved organic photovoltaic devices when compared with conventional planar electrodes. The nanostructured electrode arrays are formed using hydrothermally grown ZnO nanorods, subsequently infiltrated with blends of poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) (P 3 HT) and indene-C 60 bisadduct (IC 60 BA) as photoactive materials. This well studied organic photoactive blend allows the composition/processing/performance relationships to be elucidated. Using simple solution based processing the resultant nanostructured devices exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2. 5 % compared with the best planar analogues having a PCE of around 1 %. We provide detailed structural, optical and electrical characterization of the nanorod arrays, active layers and completed devices giving an insight into the influence of composition and processing on performance. Devices were fabricated in the desirable inverse geometry, allowing oxidation <b>resistant</b> high work-function <b>top</b> electrodes to be used and importantly to support the hydrothermal growth of nanorods on the bottom electrode — all processing was carried out under ambient conditions and without the insertion of a hole transport layer below the anode. The nanorods were successfully filled with the active layer materials by carrying out a brief melt processing of a spin-cast top layer followed by a subsequent thermal anneal which was identified as an essential step for the fabrication of operational devices. The growth method used for nanorod fabrication and the active layer processing are both inherently scalable, thus we present a complete and facile route {{for the formation of}} nanostructured electron acceptor layers that are suitable for high performance organic active layers...|$|R
40|$|Thin film sensor systems {{based on}} {{hydrogenated}} carbon {{have the advantage}} to combine two very important characteristics. They show a piezoresistive behaviour and also a tribological stability caused by a high hardness and wear resistance. Therefore they can be applied {{on the surface of}} machine parts or used for building up universal insertable sensor systems like sensory washers. A real challenge is the deposition of a whole sensory layer system on technical components like a spindle, which have a length of 480 mm and an outer diameter of about 90 mm. The functions of the layer system directly applied in the contact zone between spindle shaft and tool holder are the measurement of the clamping force of the tool holder, the imbalance of the used tool and the process forces during machining. For this application a self-contained thin film sensor system is investigated. Directly in the spindle shaft an insulating alumina layer is deposited in a thickness of about 4 µm followed by electrode structures out of 200 nm thin chromium coating. On top of this the piezoresistive hydrogenated carbon layer in a thickness of about 1 µm is deposited, covered by a wear <b>resistant</b> and insulating <b>top</b> coating. Therefore a silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer in a thickness of about 2 µm is used. The piezoresistive sensor layer and also the top layer are part of the diamond like carbon layer family [1, 2, 3, 4]. Another very important application is the sensory washer. The thin film sensor system, consisting out of the piezoresistive sensor layer deposited directly on the washer surface, the electrode structures out of chromium for the local detection of the load distribution in the washer system and the insulating layer as top layer out of the silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer, has a thickness in the range of 9 µm. In the latest investigations this layer system is connected with a RFID-chip for contactless data transmission...|$|R
