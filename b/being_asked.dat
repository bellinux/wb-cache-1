The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E
5|$|Scull appealed his {{conviction}} to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, {{the high court}} held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th Amendment rights to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull could not tell what he was <b>being</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In Völuspá, at the {{creation}} of the first human <b>beings,</b> <b>Ask</b> and Embla, Hœnir and Lóðurr help Odin. According to the Prose Edda, Hœnir is said to have given reason to man. 'In Gylfaginning, Vili and Vé are mentioned instead. As Snorri Sturluson knew Völuspá, it is possible that Hœnir was another name for Vili. Also according to Völuspá, Hœnir {{was one of the few}} gods that would survive Ragnarök.|$|R
5000|$|It {{must move}} at {{the desire of}} the promisor. An act constituting {{consideration}} must have been done at the desire or request of the promiser. If it is done at the instance of a third party or without {{the desire of the}} promisor, it will not be good consideration. For example, [...] "A" [...] saves [...] "B"'s goods from fire without <b>being</b> <b>ask</b> him to do so. [...] "A" [...] cannot demand payment for his service.|$|R

5|$|As the {{precursor}} tropical disturbance crossed southern Florida, it dropped light rainfall of over 1 inch (25 mm) in the Miami area. Later, as a developing tropical depression, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern Louisiana; one station near Galliano reported over 3 inches (76 mm) of precipitation. Hurricane Anita produced a storm tide of 2 feet (0.6 m) above normal in Grand Isle, {{which resulted in}} hundreds of families <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to leave their homes.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Aristo wrote a film {{adaptation}} of Andrea Hirata's 2005 novel Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Troops) after <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> by the film's producer, Mira Lesmana. The film, directed by Riri Riza, {{was a critical}} and commercial success. He soon wrote another screenplay, for Garuda di Dadaku (Garuda on my Chest; 2009) upon request of producer Shanty Harmayn. The film, directed by Ifa Isfansyah, reportedly sold 1.2 million tickets, a large number for the Indonesian film industry.|$|E

5000|$|Descartes {{concluded}} famously that Cogito Ergo Sum, [...] "I think, therefore I am", but {{realized that}} according to his wax argument you could never similarly demonstrate {{the existence of the}} 'other'. However, the Cartesian Self, he concluded, is thus almost entirely self-evident: the existence of some <b>being</b> <b>asking</b> about itself necessarily implied that such a being existed. Because of this, while humans can know everything of the self and its mysteries, we cannot actually know anything of anything that is not the self.|$|R

5|$|In October 1811, Aigle {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean where she and her crew raided the island of Elba before <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to provide naval support during the {{invasion}} and occupation of Genoa. Refitted in January 1820, her square stern was replaced with a circular one, giving her a wider angle of fire and improved protection at the rear. Converted to a corvette in 1831, she returned to the Mediterranean under Lord Paget. From 1852, she became a coal hulk, then a receiving ship before being used as a target for torpedoes and broken up in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{a lifelong}} {{member of the}} Liberal Party, which until the 1920s {{had been one of}} the two main {{political}} parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out. Over the next few weeks, Vince {{made it clear that he}} favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E

5|$|The serial sees Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> {{to examine}} strange {{meteorite}} showers. His investigations lead to his uncovering a conspiracy involving alien infiltration {{at the highest}} levels of the British Government. As even some of Quatermass's closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence, he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype, which recently caused a nuclear disaster at an Australian testing range, to prevent the aliens from taking over mankind.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{premise is}} that Meyer is a former United States Senator who runs a failed Presidential {{campaign}} before <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to be the winning candidate's Vice President. As Vice President, her world is kept in balance by her assistants: Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) is the Vice President's chief of staff, while Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) is Meyer's grovelling personal aide. Selina also hires Dan Egan (Reid Scott), who threatens Amy's place in the staff, and Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), a press spokesman. Meyer has no significant other, and requires that her daughter Catherine, from a past marriage, make appointments to see her.|$|E
5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities after the Peace of Amiens, Murray returned to sea {{in command of the}} 74-gun , but word soon reached him that Nelson had requested him to be his captain of the fleet in the Mediterranean. Murray was initially reluctant to accept the offer, and on <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> why, replied that the nature of the service was such, as very frequently terminated in disagreement between the admiral and the captain; and he should be extremely unwilling to hazard any possible thing that should diminish the regard and respect which he should ever entertain for his lordship.|$|E

5|$|Years later, Bennett would {{recall his}} dismay at <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to do {{contemporary}} material, {{comparing it to}} when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress. By 1972, he had departed Columbia for the Verve division of MGM Records (Philips in the UK) and had relocated for a stint in London, where he hosted a television show from the Talk of the Town nightclub in conjunction with Thames Television, Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town. With his new label, he tried a variety of approaches, including some more Beatles material, but found no renewed commercial success, and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the prior}} {{introduction}} of the Princess Royal class had provided the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) with more powerful locomotives to be used on the main line between London Euston and Glasgow Central, {{the board of directors}} were persuaded in 1936 that more such locomotives would be needed, particularly as they were <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to approve the introduction of a new non-stop service between those cities, designated the Coronation Scot. Initially, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, planned to build five more Princess Royals, but the Chief Technical Assistant and Chief Draughtsman at the LMS Derby Works, Tom Coleman, argued that it would be preferable to design a new class of locomotive that was more powerful, more reliable and easier to maintain. Stanier was convinced and the drawing office commenced designing the new class. When Stanier was called on to perform an assignment in India, Coleman became responsible for most of the detailed design in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E

5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions <b>being</b> <b>asked.</b> In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E
