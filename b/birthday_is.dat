5|$|Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim, {{was born}} {{about the year}} 570 and his <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} to be in the month of Rabi' al-awwal. He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, part of the Quraysh tribe, and was one of Mecca's prominent families, although it appears less prosperous during Muhammad's early lifetime. Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca that year by the Abraha, Yemen's king, who supplemented his army with elephants.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, {{paranoia}} {{takes over}} {{the members of the}} office as downsizing rumors swirl. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) forms a Survivor-esque alliance with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) against the other employees—later adding Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) also. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arranges a morale-boosting birthday party for Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery)—although her <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> more than a month away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card, and in the end, his joke falls flat, ruining the party.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that}} they appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and Monica (Courteney Cox) {{organize}} a surprise party for Rachel one month {{ahead of her}} birthday, but Monica's insistence to take responsibility over everything leaves Phoebe with cup and ice duties. However Phoebe vows {{to get back at}} Monica. At the party, the apartment is overflowing with decorations and made of cups, and everyone is enjoying the snow cones Phoebe has made with the ice, meaning all of Monica's food is ignored. Rachel arrives home and is very surprised to find the party, given that Chandler's (Matthew Perry) <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> before hers.|$|E

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was {{inclined}} towards spirituality. He {{was influenced by}} his Guru, Ramakrishna Deva, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds {{of public and private}} lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> celebrated there as National Youth Day.|$|E
5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E

5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E
5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic {{priest of}} a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd <b>Birthday</b> <b>is</b> a third-person {{role-playing}} shooter. The player controls series protagonist Aya Brea through rendered-to-scale {{environments in}} from a third person perspective. The game plays out {{as a series of}} missions, between which Aya rests at the Counter Twisted Investigation headquarters, which acts as the game's main hub. In the hub, Aya can receive briefings for missions, view additional documents, buy and customize new weapons. She also has the option to transport back there should she die during a mission. The game can be saved both at the hub and in safe zones within missions. At the end of each mission, Aya is given a grade based on performance, enemies killed, and the number of times she died. Depending on her score, she will earn differing amounts of Bounty Points, a currency used to customize weapons and repair protective gear in the hub area.|$|E
