5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E

50|$|In September 1991, Bird {{launched}} The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> with Gordon Roddick, {{co-founder of}} The Body Shop. In November 1995, he launched The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Foundation to further aid {{the homeless and}} support vendors of The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue.</b> He is currently on the Board of Directors for the company. The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> magazine started as a local London venture, but expanded with specific editions and services to other British cities, and then to other countries.|$|R

Financially, The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> is a not-for-profit organisation, with all post-investment profits passed to The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Foundation (legally a separate entity). The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Foundation is the registered charity arm of the organisation. It aims to underpin the company's work by tackling {{the underlying causes of}} homelessness.|$|R
25|$|The Jacobite cause did {{not entirely}} {{disappear}} after 1746 but {{the exposure of}} the key factions' conflicting objectives ended it as a serious threat; Stuart Unionism meant an independent Scotland was no longer attainable, while the ineffectiveness of the English Jacobites was highlighted by failure to provide substantive support (the only Englishmen punished for their part in the Rebellion {{were members of the}} Manchester Regiment). France's <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> was Britain's increasing financial strength; a Stuart king would not change that and d'Eguilles argued a low level civil war in Scotland was far more useful to France.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} multi-faceted {{problems}} in Occidental Mindoro's economy. In rice farming, the <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> confronting the producers {{is the high}} cost of production. This is attributed mainly to the spiraling prices of farm inputs. A study concluded that from 1997 to 2003, the cost of production rose by 47 percent, while the income derived from marketing rice maintained 1997 levels. There are also confused reports that the average production rate has declined due to the reduced application of necessary farm chemicals. In street language, this means that the farmers simply cut the amount of inputs because they cannot afford the high capital requirements of following all the recommended inputs in the farming calendar.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 1996, Chavous {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the Council's Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Ward 3 council member Kathy Patterson, a veteran education activist, also fought for the chairmanship. Patterson strongly criticized Chavous' commitment to educational reform, but Council Chairman David A. Clarke awarded the post to Chavous after he publicly declared education reform to be the <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> facing the sity. Patterson, however, won an agreement that stripped jurisdiction over labor issues from Chavous' committee {{and gave it to}} the Committee on Government Operations (chaired by Patterson). During his first year in office, the District of Columbia Public Schools undertook an emergency $50 million project to repair leaking and structurally unsound roofs at several public schools. The project was significantly mismanaged, and forced a delay in the opening of the school year. Chavous ordered a hearing on the issue in September 1997, but a significant number of parents of schoolchildren complained he had not provided enough oversight and acted too late. In March 1997, Chavous sponsored another significant piece of legislation, a resolution disapproving a construction contract for the highly controversial Barney Circle Freeway.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, with The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Group chairman, Nigel Kershaw, Bird {{helped found}} The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Invest, a {{provider}} of finance for businesses, charities and NGOs {{with the aim of}} creating social change. It is the social investment arm of The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Group, and initially only dealt in loan finance. In 2009, The <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> Invest launched a social investment fund, and has since invested more than £30 million in hundreds of social enterprises making a positive impact across the UK.|$|R

500|$|The organising {{committee}} {{decided at}} the outset that transport would be a major issue and ultimately reflect on the success of the Games. The decision to locate most of the events and accommodation at the showgrounds reduced [...] many of the issues. Car companies in Perth made cars available and volunteer drivers assisted in taking athletes and officials around Perth, particularly to Beatty Park. The <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> was encountered by [...] teams from the United Kingdom that had to travel [...] [...] A total of 57 athletes and 23 escorts travelled from the United Kingdom in a chartered Caledonian Airways plane at the cost of 18,500 pounds. [...] The long flight required refuelling in Bahrain and a stop over in Colombo, Ceylon. Health checks [...] such as measuring legs and ankles for swelling were undertaken during the flight to Perth and back home.|$|E
500|$|A new {{committee}} was created, the Committee on Postponed Parts, to address other questions {{that had been}} postponed. Its members, such as Madison, were delegates who had shown a greater desire for compromise and were chosen for this reason as most in the Convention wanted to finish their work and go home. The committee dealt with questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights, relations with Indian tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the House. The <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input. They adopted Wilson's earlier plan for choosing the president by an electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be [...] "nineteen times out of twenty".|$|E
500|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{developed}} by a core team of between 60 and 80 people, expanding to over 100 people at its most active development period. Among the staff, twenty of them had previously worked on Xenogears. The <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> faced when building the team {{was that they were}} developing for the PlayStation 2, a console with far more power than any previous console they had worked on. A major improvement in Takahashi's view over his work on Xenogears was {{that he was able to}} make the entire game using 3D graphics, something he had been unable to do with Xenogears. Due to the amount of preparatory work and getting accustomed to the new hardware, actual development did not start until 2000, lasting approximately a year. Namco provided development support with the motion capture technology. Takahashi later noted that the sheer number of young and inexperienced developers in Monolith Soft negative impacted development, with the graphics engine being completed only six months before the game's release. Prior to its announcement, the game {{was developed}} under the working title [...] "Project X".|$|E

500|$|Square had {{announced}} that Xenogears {{may not have}} {{come out in the}} United States due to [...] "sensitive religious issues". The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of [...] "killing God", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said [...] "yabeh-o", a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name.|$|E
500|$|While Yost removed Braun from {{a number}} of games in September 2007 for defense, he praised Braun for his improvements. [...] "The great thing about it is it doesn't involve {{throwing}} at all now", said Yost, referring to Braun's <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> in the spring. [...] "It involves first-step quickness to the ball, which will increase his range. [...] soften his hands a little bit. [...] hand-eye coordination to the ball needs to be a little better. That comes with repetition, repetition, repetition." [...] Braun finished 2007 last of all eligible third basemen in fielding percentage (.895, with 26 errors; only the fourth third baseman since 1916 to play 100 games or more in a season and have a fielding percentage under [...]900), range factor (2.11), and zone rating (.697). [...] His target at first base was Prince Fielder, who finished 2007 last of all eligible major league first basemen in range factor (8.49), and first in errors (14). Similarly, his target at second base, Rickie Weeks, had the lowest fielding percentage of all NL second basemen (.976), and the lowest zone rating among all major league second basemen (.737).|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} game was first designed for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) before being ported to PS2, a console version of Invisible War was decided upon {{from the beginning}} of development. The team used their experience porting Deus Ex to PS2 when creating the console version. The team wanted to bring {{the original}} PC-based experience to consoles rather than making the game for consoles, so the team chose the Xbox as it had the largest memory capacity out of available consoles at the time. The <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> faced by the team when moving from PC to console was the smaller processing power and RAM. Due to the limited hardware of the Xbox, the environment sizes needed to be scaled down compared to the first game, but the team tried to make the smaller areas denser, with more interactive elements. When creating the game, the team rebuilt all the systems from scratch from the engine to the render and sound system. The game used a combination of the Unreal Engine and the Havok physics software. The choice of Unreal was governed by several factors including familiarity with the engine and the wish to develop for both PC and console environments; while the basic structure of the Unreal Engine was used, the team replaced the renderer, artificial intelligence (AI) programming and physics engine. Integrating Havok allowed for [...] "richer" [...] simulation of real-time physics. The AI was designed to exhibit a wider range of responses than the original game, noticing disturbances, searching environments and being able to call in reinforcements.|$|E

The Enquirer, again citing his stubbornness, endorsed Miller [...] Despite the criticism, Brinkman once again won the Republican district by a comfortable margin: [...] 35,229 (60.04%) for Brinkman to 23,451 (39.96%) for Miller.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> {{during the}} Mayoral {{election}} of 2005 was public education. Because he campaigned and won {{on the issue}} of education, Villaraigosa sought the legal authority to do so through AB 1381. AB 1381 was passed by the state legislature and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. [...] However, the plan received significant opposition among the Los Angeles Board of Education, Board President Marlene Canter and then-superintendent of LAUSD, Roy Romer, among others. [...] On December 21, 2006, AB 1381 was ruled unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|Later, an instanton liquid {{model was}} studied. This model starts from the {{assumption}} that an ensemble of instantons cannot be described by a mere sum of separate instantons.

Many phenomenological successes have been reached. Confinement {{seems to be the}} <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> in Yang–Mills theory for which instantons have no answer whatsoever.|$|E

2500|$|During the campaign, the <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> {{was whether}} the 12-year {{governorship}} of Itō should continue, {{or whether it was}} time for change in Mitazono.

Itō accepted the national agency's position to allow the plant to operate for up to 60 years from the date the reactors were commissioned.

2500|$|Romney secured {{more than}} half of the delegates {{available}} on Super Tuesday but did not secure his status as the inevitable nominee.

In the weeks leading up to March 6, both Gingrich and Santorum experienced ballot problems.
