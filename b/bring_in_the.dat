While playing for the Whitecaps, the team never lost a game and she helped <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's first {{championship}} victory in 2004. In the championship game, she made two saves in the penalty shootout and scored the game-winning penalty kick. In 2006, she helped the Whitecaps win a second W-League title after securing a shutout in the final against Ottawa Fury.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders {{suddenly}} {{were under}} pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army {{under the command of}} count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.|$|E
5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing {{the amount of time}} spent on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions had yet to be implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in August, the battalion remained on Tarakan to undertake garrison duties. During this time it undertook patrol operations to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> various pockets of Japanese troops who had not learned of the surrender; these were dangerous operations and {{in an effort to}} reduce casualties, the patrols went out with several Japanese prisoners to help talk their former comrades into surrendering. As the demobilisation process began, its numbers dwindled as long-serving men were repatriated back to Australia, while others with only limited service were transferred to other units for further service. Finally, on 25 October 1945, while still on Tarakan, the battalion was disbanded. The occasion was marked by a small ceremony at Tarakan involving the unit's remaining members. During {{the course of the war}} a total of 2,838 men served with the 2/48th Battalion, of whom 343 men were killed in action or died on active service, 675 were wounded, and 20 captured.|$|E
5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E
