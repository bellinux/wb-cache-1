50|$|Leaks {{described}} Dead Sun as a story-based action-adventure {{inspired by}} 1999's Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (the second installment in the series) and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda. The game featured an open world, and combined cinematic, violent combat with dungeon crawls, puzzles, and <b>boss</b> encounters. <b>Links</b> to past Legacy of Kain entries figured into the design, {{such as the}} shifting mechanic of the Soul Reaver titles, which enabled players to alternate between two planes of existence.|$|R
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated <b>bosses.</b> <b>Link</b> is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|R

5000|$|Indicator needle axle. This has a {{spur gear}} that engages the sector gear (7) and extends through the face to drive the {{indicator}} needle. Due to the short distance between the lever arm <b>link</b> <b>boss</b> and the pivot pin {{and the difference between}} the effective radius of the sector gear and that of the spur gear, any motion of the Bourdon tube is greatly amplified. A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.|$|R

50|$|Armos {{are living}} statue enemies. According to The Minish Cap, {{they were created}} to guard the Wind Tribe, {{and there is a}} Minish-sized chamber inside them where they can be turned on or off. They {{typically}} pose as statues or suits of armor, but attack when approached. Some Armos statues are inanimate and can be moved like blocks. There is a larger, stronger variety of Armos known as Armos Knights, which first appeared as a collective <b>boss</b> in A <b>Link</b> to the Past. In the The Wind Waker, both the standard Armos and the Armos Knights appear as common enemies. To defeat the standard Armos, an arrow had to be shot into the pink gem that was in the Armos' back or slash at it with a sword. After damaging this gem, the Armos will spin around, chasing Link for a few seconds, then explode, inflicting damage to Link if he is within range of the explosion. To defeat the Armos Knights, a bomb had to be thrown into their open mouth (which opened periodically). While the Armos Knight is dying, they, too chase Link for a few seconds before exploding. In Twilight Princess, they are hammer-wielding statues that can only be harmed from behind. There were also enemies called Titan Armos that were supposed to appear in the game but cut in the final release.|$|R
