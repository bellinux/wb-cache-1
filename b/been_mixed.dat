5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track digital recorder, a rare item at the time.

40|$|The natural {{invertible}} extension T* of an Nd-action T {{has been}} studied by Lacroix. He showed that T* may fail to <b>be</b> <b>mixing</b> even if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for d ³ 2.

Several examples are constructed when d = 2 : (i) a mixing T for which T*(n,m) has an identity factor whenever n·m < 0; (ii) a mixing T for which T* is rigid but T*(n,m) <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for all (n,m) ¹ (0, 0); (iii) a T mixing on 3 sets for which T* <b>is</b> not <b>mixing</b> on 3 sets...|$|R
