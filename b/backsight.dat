While the rifle-armed units adopted {{a dark green}} uniform, the musket-armed light infantry units wore tailless jackets in the traditional red colour. In addition to light infantry duties, they could form up in close order and perform as line infantry if required. They were armed with the [...] "New Light Infantry Land Pattern" [...] of the standard musket, which had a rudimentary <b>backsight</b> to aid individual accuracy, using the bayonet lug as a foresight.|$|E
60|$|The {{infantry}} fired steadily and stolidly, without hurry or excitement, for {{the enemy}} were {{far away and}} the officers careful. Besides, the soldiers {{were interested in the}} work and took great pains. But presently the mere physical act became tedious. The tiny figures seen over the slide of the <b>backsight</b> seemed a little larger, but also fewer at each successive volley. The rifles grew hot--so hot that they had to be changed for those of the reserve companies. The Maxim guns exhausted all the water in their jackets, and several had to be refreshed from the water-bottles of the Cameron Highlanders before they could go on with their deadly work. The empty cartridge-cases, tinkling to the ground, formed a small but growing heap beside each man. And all the time out on the plain on the other side bullets were shearing through flesh, smashing and splintering bone; blood spouted from terrible wounds; valiant men were struggling on through a hell of whistling metal, exploding shells, and spurting dust--suffering, despairing, dying. Such was {{the first phase of the}} battle of Omdurman.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they walked}} to the shooting-point, Jerry showed the lad how to hold the rifle, {{instructed}} him as to the <b>backsight,</b> and showed him how to get the foresight exactly on the nick of the <b>backsight.</b> [...] "You must just see the bead as if it were resting in the nick, and the object you aim at must just show above the top point of the bead." [...] He showed him how to load, and then told him to lie down, as he had done, on his chest, and to steady the rifle with the left arm, the elbow being on the ground. [...] "You must be quite comfortable," [...] he said; [...] "it is of no use trying to shoot {{if you are in a}} cramped position. Now, take a steady aim, and the moment you have got the two sights in a line on the rock, press the trigger steadily. Press pretty hard; it is only a pull of about two pounds, but it is wonderful how stiff a trigger feels the first time you pull at it. You need not be at all afraid of the kick. If you press the butt tightly against your shoulder you will hardly feel it, for there is plenty of weight in the barr'l, and it carries but a small charge of powder. You won't want to shoot at anything much beyond this range, but sometimes you may have to try at four or five hundred yards when you are in want of a dinner. In that case you can put in a charge and a half of powder. Now, are you comfortable? You need not grip so hard with your left hand, the gun only wants to rest between your thumb and fingers. That is better. Now take a steady aim, and the moment you have got it press the trigger. Well done! that is a good shot for a first. You hit the dust an inch or two to the right of the stone. If it had been a red-skin you would have hit him in the shoulder. You will do, lad, and by the time we get to Fort Bridger I guess you will bring down a stag as clean as nine out of ten hunters." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{levelling}} are single-levelling as already described, and double-levelling (Double-rodding). In double-levelling, a surveyor takes two foresights and two <b>backsights</b> and makes sure {{the difference between}} the foresights and {{the difference between the}} <b>backsights</b> are equal, thereby reducing the amount of error. Double-levelling costs twice as much as single-levelling.|$|R

5000|$|Altitude was set {{by moving}} a lever fore-and-aft against a scale, which rotated the {{foresight}} fore or aft, setting {{one half of}} the sight's bombing angle. Behind the altitude setting was an airspeed scale and a wheel to finely select the airspeed. This moved the <b>backsights</b> fore or aft to account for {{the other half of the}} sight's [...] "range angle". In this respect the Drift Sight was similar to earlier bombsight designs.|$|R
60|$|Private Copper's {{father was}} a Southdown shepherd; in early youth Copper had studied under him. Five years' army service had {{somewhat}} blunted Private Copper's pastoral instincts, but {{it occurred to him}} as a memory of the Chalk that sheep, or in this case buck, do not move towards one across turf, or in this case, the Colesberg kopjes unless a stranger, or in this case an enemy, is in the neighbourhood. Copper, helmet back-first advanced with caution, leaving his mates of the picket full a mile behind. The picket, concerned for its evening meal, did not protest. A year ago it would have been an officer's command, moving as such. To-day it paid casual allegiance to a Canadian, nominally a sergeant, actually a trooper of Irregular Horse, discovered convalescent in Naauwport Hospital, and forthwith employed on odd jobs. Private Copper crawled up the side of a bluish rock-strewn hill thinly fringed with brush atop, and remembering how he had peered at Sussex conies through the edge of furze-clumps, cautiously parted the dry stems before his face. At the foot of the long slope sat three farmers smoking. To his natural lust for tobacco was added personal wrath because spiky plants were pricking his belly, and Private Copper slid the <b>backsight</b> up to fifteen hundred yards....|$|E

50|$|The {{dumpy level}} was {{developed}} by English civil engineer William Gravatt, while surveying the route of a proposed railway line from London to Dover. More compact and hence both more robust and easier to transport, it is commonly believed that dumpy levelling is less accurate than other types of levelling, but such is not the case. Dumpy levelling requires shorter and therefore more numerous sights, but this fault is compensated by the practice of making foresights and <b>backsights</b> equal.|$|R

He also suggested that the post holes may have been attempts to establish accurate <b>backsights</b> for alignments. Norman Lockyer suggested that sighted from the centre stone, the northeast projection would have aligned with Capella in 1250 BC.|$|R
50|$|The prime {{method of}} coping with {{currents}} is by taking <b>backsights</b> on the land when leaving {{so as to be}} able to estimate the current and also the leeway (the angle the boat is drifting off the wind). On many islands, leading marks are set up to aid in this. The course is then adjusted to suit the conditions. There can be daily fluctuations in current but these are generally random and do not accumulate. Expert navigators can also detect currents from the shape of the waves, if the current is confined to the top layers of the water.|$|R

He found that cairns E and O were aligned in the direction of summer solstice sunrise, using cairn E for a <b>backsight</b> and cairn O as a foresight, and that cairns C and O were aligned in the direction of summer solstice sunset, using C as a <b>backsight</b> and O as a foresight.|$|E
50|$|Later {{versions}} used by RAF Coastal Command and the Royal Navy {{also included}} a further adjustment, the Fourth Vector, for attacking moving targets. This was primarily intended for use against ships and submarines. This was a fairly complex system of rotating rings and sliders that allowed the bomb aimer to dial in the relative course of the target and its estimated speed. This moved the <b>backsight</b> directly fore and aft, and turning the heading dial adjusted how much the speed dial moved the <b>backsight.</b> As the resulting mechanism was fairly large and complex, the sights were also available with the Fourth Vector removed, denoted with a *, as in the Mk. IX A*.|$|E

5000|$|Burl {{notes that}} the {{diameter}} of the bank at Brodgar is almost exactly the same as the inner banks of the Avebury and Newgrange monuments in England and Ireland respectively, 125 so-called [...] "megalithic yards" [...] (MY), at 0.8297 m per MY. This is a controversial unit originally proposed by Alexander Thom. Thom's thesis, based on a statistical analysis of Neolithic monuments in the United Kingdom, is that the builders of these sites employed a common unit of measurement, although it has not been demonstrated how this information could have been shared: see Pseudoscientific metrology.Heggie casts doubt on this as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered [...] "little evidence for a highly accurate unit" [...] and [...] "little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use". Thom and his father made other controversial contentions, for example, that Brodgar and the burial mounds that surround it were designed specifically as <b>backsights</b> for astronomical observations of the Moon. Graham Ritchie points out that the burial mounds have not been reliably dated, and he casts doubt on the astronomical prowess of the builders.|$|R
50|$|Some {{instruments}} provide three crosshairs {{which allow}} stadia {{measurement of the}} foresight and <b>backsight</b> distances. These also allow use of {{the average of the}} three readings (3-wire leveling) as a check against blunders and for averaging out the error of interpolation between marks on the rod scale.|$|E
5000|$|The Defence of Duffer's Drift {{is a short}} 1904 book by Major General Sir Ernest Dunlop Swinton. It {{purports to}} be a series of six dreams by [...] "Lieutenant <b>Backsight</b> Forethought" [...] about the defence of a river {{crossing}} in the Boer War. The infantry tactics in the early dreams are disastrous, but each time BF learns something until in the final defence he is successful.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{procedure}} {{is to set}} up the instrument within 100 m of a point of known or assumed elevation. A rod or staff is held vertical on that point and the instrument is used manually or automatically to read the rod scale. This gives the height of the instrument above the starting (<b>backsight)</b> point and allows the height of the instrument (H.I.) above the datum to be computed.|$|E
50|$|For precise work {{these effects}} {{need to be}} {{calculated}} and corrections applied. For most work it is sufficient to keep the foresight and <b>backsight</b> distances approximately equal so that the refraction and curvature effects cancel out. Refraction is generally the greatest source of error in leveling. For short level lines the effects of temperature and pressure are generally insignificant, but {{the effect of the}} temperature gradient dT / dh can lead to errors.|$|E
5000|$|The Defence of Duffer's Drift was {{published}} in 1904 when Swinton was a Captain. It appeared in the British United Service Magazine under the pseudonym, Lieutenant N. <b>Backsight</b> Forethought ("BF"), who is the narrator of the book.

Swinton served in South Africa during the Boer War, and the book [...] "embodies some recollections of things actually done and undone in South Africa, 1899-1902." ...|$|E
50|$|When Craig {{first tried}} {{to form the}} unit he {{proposed}} that it wear the dress of Scottish highland regiments, with a Glengarry tartan plaid. Prevost intended the unit {{to be used as}} skirmishing light infantry and it adopted a dark green uniform with black facings as worn by the 95th Rifles. However, they were armed with the smoothbore Brown Bess musket (possibly the New Land Service version, with rudimentary <b>backsight)</b> rather than the Baker rifle. Also, unlike the 95th Rifles, the Glengarry Light Infantry were granted colours.|$|E

It also featured a well-made peep sight fitted on the small of the stock, which was graduated for ranges from 50 to 1,100 yards. The rifle had a trigger which could be set {{to use as a}} hair trigger. A wooden cleaning rod was fitted under the barrel, and was referred to as a [...] "ramrod" [...] in the rifle's documentation.|$|E
5000|$|Sighting was {{accomplished}} {{in the manner of}} iron sights on rifles, and the Drift Sight used the same terminology of [...] "foresight" [...] and [...] "backsight", although [...] "lower" [...] and [...] "upper" [...] would be more accurate physically. The fore and backsights were thin metal wires stretched across the opening of a C-shaped metal plate. The bombs were dropped when the wires of the foresight, <b>backsight</b> and target overlapped as seen from the bomb aimer's position. A separate [...] "direction wire" [...] ran fore-aft on a plate below the foresight, providing left-right aiming.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to the war}} a major {{redesign}} of the CSBS was underway. The new Mk. X replaced the vertical slider used for altitude adjustment with a horizontally-moving <b>backsight</b> {{at the top of}} the device, and the entire foresight and drift wire area was made considerably smaller. The calculator and wind drift settings, formerly mounted on top and in front of the large compass at the rear of the earlier models, was moved to the left side of the device and changed in form to make it smaller as well. The compass, no longer containing pointers and dials, was replaced with a smaller unit. The result was a version of the CSBS that was much smaller than earlier versions.|$|E

5000|$|The 'inventor' of ley lines, Alfred Watkins, {{thought that}} in the words [...] "dodman" [...] and the builder's [...] "hod" [...] there was a {{survival}} of an ancient British term for a surveyor. Watkins felt that the name came about because the snail's two horns resembled a surveyor's two surveying rods. Watkins also supported this idea with an etymology from 'doddering ' along and 'dodge' (akin, in his mind, to the series of actions a surveyor would carry out in moving his rod back and forth until it accurately lined up with another one as a <b>backsight</b> or foresight) and the Welsh verb 'dodi' meaning to lay or place. He thus decided that The Long Man of Wilmington was an image of an ancient surveyor.https://web.archive.org/web/20070809012401/http://www.gothicimage.co.uk/books/leyhunter1.html ...|$|E
50|$|The bombsight {{solution}} is now almost complete, having calculated the ground speed and zeroed out any sideways drift. All {{that is left}} is the calculation {{of the time of}} fall, which, multiplied by the ground speed, gives the range. The CSBS solves this through the height bar, which extends vertically {{from the center of the}} device where the compass section meets the drift bar. Turning a knob at the top of the height bar (or using a slip fitting on earlier models) moves the height slider up or down to set the aircraft's altitude. Once set, the angle between backsights on the height slider and foresights on the ground speed slider indicates the proper range angle, no lookups required. The bomb aimer then sights along this angle and waits for the target to appear, dropping the bombs when it appears under a notch in the <b>backsight.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The South African War (1899-1902) {{provided}} the next opportunity for literary fiction {{to play a}} role in future army concepts. The publication of The Defence of Duffer's Drift by Captain (later Major-General Sir) Ernest Swinton, KBE, CB, DSO, in 1905, was extremely well received and became required reading for many subsequent generations of young officers. Set at a river choke point on some generic veldt anywhere in the Transvaal, the story's main character, a young and energetic Lieutenant <b>Backsight</b> Forethought, has a series of nightmares in which he loses battle after battle against his Boer adversaries. After each dream, however, a series of lessons are highlighted, and each of these was incorporated into the next battle, which eventually leads Lieutenant Forethought to victory and relief in the final dream. Although written as a fictional tale, Swinton's aim was to teach tactical lessons as well as generate discussion and debate on the planning and execution of operations. Godefroy, Andrew B.|$|E
5000|$|Towards the 1990s as {{his health}} began to fail, {{as well as}} the expansions, he {{primarily}} wrote [...] "fill in the gaps" [...] books or anthologies of short stories about characters. The last J T Edson book available in the UK, Mark Counter's Kin, was an anthology.

5000|$|The rifle had {{a simple}} folding <b>backsight</b> with the {{standard}} large lock mechanism (initially marked 'Tower' and 'G.R.' under a Crown; later ones after the battle of Waterloo had 'Enfield'), with a swan-neck cock as fitted to the 'Brown Bess.' Like the German Jäger rifles, it had a scrolled brass trigger guard to help ensure a firm grip and a raised cheek-piece on the left-hand side of the butt. The stocks were made of walnut and held the barrel with three flat captive wedges. The rifle also had a metal locking bar to accommodate a 24-inch sword bayonet, {{similar to that of}} the Jäger rifle. The Baker was 45 inches from muzzle to butt, 12 inches shorter than the Infantry Musket, and weighed almost nine pounds. Although Infantry Muskets were not issued with cleaning kits, the Baker rifle had a cleaning kit, greased linen patches and tools, stored in the 'butt-trap' or patchbox; the lid of this was brass, and hinged at the rear so it could be flipped up. It was needed because, without regular cleaning, gunpowder fouling built up in the rifling grooves, and the weapon became much slower to load and less accurate.|$|E
5000|$|Red is {{so named}} for the colour of his hair, and even Ole Devil Hardin {{typically}} refers to him by that nickname. A cousin of Dusty's, Red also serves in the Confederate army during the Civil War as a non-commissioned officer, fighting bravely and with skill. After the War he becomes {{a member of the}} O. D. Connected ranch crew and an occasional member of the Floating Outfit. Red is noted for his temper and hot-headedness but when given independent responsibility adopts a more serious and thoughtful approach. Only in the Ysabel Kid's class with a revolver, Red is good albeit not exceptional with his [...]56-calibre Spencer carbine, a large-calibre weapon that tends to command respect, and proves well able (in Waco's Debt) to make good use of an obsolete Kentucky long rifle. A competent cowhand who rides a claybank stallion, Red enjoys a fair fight with bare hands and has more skill than most having been trained by Mark Counter. Red meets Sue Ortega during the events of Wagons to <b>Backsight</b> and is about to marry her {{at the end of the}} book.|$|E
5000|$|Dusty (Dustine Edward Marsden Fog) is the {{principal}} protagonist {{in most of the}} Floating Outfit stories and Civil War stories. Short [...] but strongly built for his height, Dusty is exceptionally fast with his twin Colts and commonly considered the fastest gun in Texas, a skilled rifle shot though usually preferring a Winchester carbine as being more suited to his small stature, and unequalled in hand-to-hand combat either unarmed or with a sabre. Dusty adapts his talents to the situation whether as head of a cattle drive (e.g. in Trail Boss), light cavalry commander (e.g. in Kill Dusty Fog!), lawman (e.g. in The Town Tamers), wagon train boss (Wagons to <b>Backsight)</b> or spy (e.g. as assistant to Belle Boyd in The Rebel Spy), and his wide education from a variety of teachers renders him a shrewd solver of mysteries and fraud (one example is given in [...] "A Wife for Dusty Fog" [...] in The Small Texan). Although well able to fight in the normal manner for a Western saloon brawl, Dusty is extensively trained in judo and karate by Tommy Okasi. Dusty is a capable cattleman and knows few equals as a horseman, successfully breaking and later using as his regular mount a paint stallion that crippled Ole Devil when he tried to ride it. In the earlier part of his career Dusty uses twin Model 1860 Army Colts but acquires a pair of Civilian Model P Colts in The Peacemakers, finding them much to his liking and conferring a slight improvement in his draw speed and marksmanship.|$|E
