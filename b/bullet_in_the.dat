5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E

5|$|The Killer was {{director}} Woo's follow-up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987. The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo. According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as <b>Bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Head and Once a Thief.|$|E

5|$|Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Alan: An {{undercover}} cop {{posing as}} a high-ranking Triad assassin. He makes an origami crane every time he kills someone, a trait which was influenced by Woo's daughter {{when he saw her}} making them. Tony's character is shown as living alone and detached from others. Woo stated that this was influenced by Alain Delon's character in the French crime film Le Samouraï. Leung had previously worked with Woo on his film <b>Bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Head.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a modern}} {{revolver}} of Russian design, the OTs-38, which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the cartridge case, making the gap between cylinder and barrel irrelevant {{as far as the}} suppression issue is concerned. The OTs-38 does need an unusually close and precise fit between the cylinder and barrel due to the shape of <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> special ammunition (Soviet SP-4), which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic.|$|E
25|$|One Thai {{mercenary}} column withdrew. The CPT {{managed to}} surround the other detachment of 80 men.

25|$|The Dutch and English {{army had}} access to a large {{quantity}} of artillery, which had landed via barges landed from the Rhine.

Once the batteries were placed, the city was intensively shelled which added to the misery of the garrison.|$|E

25|$|Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall {{was treated}} for a {{concussion}} and facial injuries, and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in his book published in 2012 that the FBI had located a <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil ten inches below the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded, supporting Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from near point blank range.|$|E
25|$|As {{a platoon}} commander, de Gaulle was {{involved}} in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire 15 August and {{was among the first}} to be wounded, receiving a <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knee at the Battle of Dinant. It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that he understood the importance of artillery firepower in modern warfare; instead in his writing at the time he criticised the “overrapid” offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the “slowness of the English troops”.|$|E
25|$|Bazaine {{failed the}} {{entrance}} examination to the École Polytechnique and {{enlisted in the}} French Army as a private soldier in 1831 {{with a view to}} service in Algeria, where in 1833 he received a commission as sub-lieutenant in the recently formed Foreign Legion. He rose rapidly through the ranks (Lieutenant 1835, Captain 1837), through successful actions during the Foreign Legion campaign in Algeria and against the Carlists in Spain (1835–1839), where in 1835 he was cited for bravery and gallantry in action on several occasions and rewarded with the cross (Chevalier) of the Légion d'honneur after only four years in the Army. After serving a second campaign with the Foreign Legion in Spain in 1837-38 (wounded: <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right leg, Battle of Barbastro, 1837), Bazaine returned to Algeria in 1839 and took part in the expeditions to Milianah, Tlemcen, Morocco and Sahara. He was mentioned as instrumental in the surrender of Abd-el-Kader. In 1844 he was promoted to Major (wounded: <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right wrist during action at Macta, 1845) and then to Lieutenant Colonel in 1848 after 9 years service in Algeria and Morocco, including several years heading France's Bureau Arabe (military intelligence) as Governor of Tlemcen.

25|$|On the day, {{there were}} three {{sections}} on patrol, a total of 24 men, spread out in a head-high cornfield around the compound.
