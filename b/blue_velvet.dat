5|$|Lynch {{has been}} known to allow his {{collaborative}} partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him; Kyle MacLachlan has several times persuaded Lynch to rewrite scenes, including in 1986's <b>Blue</b> <b>Velvet</b> and the television series Twin Peaks, as he felt they were not right for his characters.

5|$|In {{the years}} since, {{the film has}} {{generated}} significant academic attention with regard to its thematic symbolism, and is now widely {{regarded as one of}} Lynch's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s. Publications including Sight & Sound, Time, Entertainment Weekly and BBC Magazine have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time. In 2008, <b>Blue</b> <b>Velvet</b> was chosen by the American Film Institute {{as one of the greatest}} American mystery films ever made.|$|E
5|$|Lynch was {{nominated}} for a Best Director Oscar for the film. Isabella Rossellini won an Independent Spirit Award for the Best Female Lead in 1987.

5|$|Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's {{apartment}} {{and she tells}} him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of <b>blue</b> <b>velvet</b> fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E

5000|$|Saul Zaentz's {{acquisitions}} {{had been}} funded {{in part by}} the success of the rock group Creedence Clearwater Revival, a group that he had managed. Creedence had been signed to Fantasy Records in 1964 as the <b>Blue</b> <b>Velvets,</b> but the label renamed it the Golliwogs so it would fit in with the bands of the British Invasion. After a series of failed releases under that name on the Fantasy and Scorpio labels, the group changed its name to Creedence Clearwater Revival. In 1968, it released its first hit record, a cover version of the song [...] "Susie Q".|$|R
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it. Principal photography of <b>Blue</b> <b>Velvet</b> began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} <b>Blue</b> <b>Velvet.</b> The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Harris {{created a}} fictional {{character}} called Hannibal Lecter, a cannibal and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Hannibal (2001), directors Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott, respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter {{is about to}} kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In David Lynch's <b>Blue</b> <b>Velvet</b> (1986), the villain of the film, Frank Booth, is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small fetishes (such as <b>blue</b> <b>velvet)</b> when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve orgasm.|$|E
