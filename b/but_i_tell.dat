They would take us back to a meaner time when money was the measure of all things. We stand for the future that was sought and won and which must now be defended and enhanced.|$|E
500|$|Springsteen himself {{remained}} quite {{interested in}} his and the band's commercial fortunes. [...] He said before the tour's start that remaining popular {{had been one of}} his motivations for the Super Bowl appearance: [...] "I've said no for about 10 years or however long they've been asking, <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you, we played on the last tour and there were some empty seats here and there and, well, there shouldn't be any empty seats at an E Street Band show. I hold pride that we remain one of the great wonders of the world ... so sometimes you got to remind people a little bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> myself I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E

500|$|The playwright William Congreve {{mentioned}} Shrewsbury cakes in {{his play}} The Way of the World in 1700 as a simile (Witwoud â€“ [...] "Why, brother Wilfull of Salop, {{you may be}} as short as a Shrewsbury cake, if you please. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you 'tis not modish to know relations in town"). The recipe is also included in several early cookbooks including The Compleat Cook of 1658. A final reference to the cakes {{can be seen to}} this day as the subject of a plaque affixed to a building close to Shrewsbury's town library by the junction of Castle Street and School Gardens. The aforementioned plaque marks the spot where the Shrewsbury Cake's recipe {{is said to have been}} pioneered in 1760 by Mr Pailin; a further quote, drawn from Richard Harris Barham's Ingoldby Legends, reads: ...|$|E
500|$|Australia {{finished}} the Games with two bronze medals. Jason Hellwig {{stated that the}} aim was to win between two and five medals. He said: [...] "wo medals absolutely is a pass ... so we're really pleased with that but we're absolutely disappointed we didn't get the mission done to win that gold medal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you what, we are absolutely determined to get it done in four years' time. It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We really need to focus on having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas. It's not like living in Austria, Sweden or Germany where you can do this on the weekend and after work." ...|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock guy {{came up to me and}} was like, 'I look stupid, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E

[...] The episode saw Baker in the role of a mysterious curator in the National Gallery.|$|E
2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I {{say to you that}} George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, and you take care of the young ones as you think best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E
