40|$|Post-conflict {{affiliation}} between former opponents {{or between}} {{one of the}} former opponents and <b>bystanders</b> might have the function of conflict management, which reduces {{the costs associated with}} aggressions. One of the suggested functions of post-conflict affiliation is decreased renewed aggressions directed from aggressors to victims. However, the effect of post-conflict affiliation on renewed aggressions by victims has not been investigated. We examined whether post-conflict affiliations decreased the number of renewed aggressions initiated by winners or losers in captive bottlenose dolphins. Both winners and losers initiated renewed aggressions. However, these aggressions decreased after post-conflict affiliation between former opponents, initiated by <b>bystanders</b> to winners, initiated by losers to <b>bystanders,</b> and initiated by <b>bystanders</b> to losers. Post-conflict affiliation between former opponents is suggested to function as reconciliation. Post-conflict affiliation initiated by losers to <b>bystanders</b> is suggested to function as the protection of losers. Post-conflict affiliations initiated by <b>bystanders</b> to one of former opponents are suggested to function as both appeasement and protection of the opponent who affiliates with <b>bystanders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Public good {{provision}} is often local and also affects <b>bystanders.</b> Is provision harder if contributions harm <b>bystanders,</b> and is provision easier if outsiders gain a windfall profit? In an experiment we observe that {{both positive and}} negative externalities reduce provision levels whenever actors risk falling back behind <b>bystanders.</b> The mere presence of unaffected <b>bystanders</b> already dampens contributions. This behavior seems to result from the interplay of two motives: the desire to realize opportunities for joint gains, and concerns for comparative performance. Individual payoff comparisons to the other actors as well as to individual <b>bystanders</b> drive contributions down. Public Good, Externality, Conditional Cooperation, Inequity Aversion...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{an effect}} of social interaction on the bystanders' intervention in emergency situations a rescue model was introduced which includes {{the effects of the}} victim's acquaintance with <b>bystanders</b> and those among <b>bystanders</b> from a network perspective. This model reproduces the experimental result that the helping rate (success rate in our model) tends to decrease although the number of <b>bystanders</b> k increases. And the interaction among homogeneous <b>bystanders</b> results in the emergence of hubs in a helping network. For more realistic consideration it is assumed that the agents are located on a one-dimensional lattice (ring), then the randomness p ∈ [0, 1] is introduced: the kp random <b>bystanders</b> are randomly chosen from a whole population and the k-kp near <b>bystanders</b> are chosen in the nearest order to the victim. We find that there appears another peak of the network density in the vicinity of k= 9 and p= 0. 3 due to the cooperative and competitive interaction between the near and random <b>bystanders.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} {{to the scene of}} an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a <b>bystander</b> created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a <b>bystander</b> is struck and killed by an ambulance.

40|$|Social animals {{benefit from}} group living. However, {{competition}} for limited resources {{may lead to}} agonistic conflicts. These conflicts can affect the behavior and the social relationships, {{not only of the}} individuals involved in the confrontation, but also of <b>bystanders.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} describe postconflict affiliative interactions among <b>bystanders</b> (quadratic affiliation) in a captive group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and test whether 1) after observing a conflict <b>bystanders</b> tend to interact with other <b>bystanders,</b> 2) conflicts increase bystanders’ rates of selfdirected behaviors (SDBs), 3) postconflict rates of SDBs mediate affiliative interactions between <b>bystanders,</b> and 4) quadratic affiliation decreases rates of SDBs to baseline levels. We used the postconflict matched-control (PC-MC) method (5 min focal samples) to record bystanders’ behavior (156 PC-MC pairs from 15 subjects). Results show that bystanders’ rates of SDBs increased above baseline levels after conflicts. <b>Bystanders</b> responded to conflicts by increasing affiliation with other <b>bystanders</b> (mainly with close associates) but not with former combatants. After quadratic affiliation, rates of SDBs decreased to baseline levels. Together with previous findings, these results support the idea that quadratic affiliation is a tension reduction mechanism in less tolerant species. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of <b>bystanders</b> to information available {{in their social}} environment can have a potent influence {{on the evolution of}} cooperation and signalling systems. In the presence of <b>bystanders,</b> individuals might be able to increase their payoff by exaggerating signals beyond their means (cheating) or investing to help others despite considerable costs. In doing so, animals can accrue immediate benefits by manipulating (or helping) individuals with whom they are currently interacting and delayed benefits by convincing <b>bystanders</b> that they are more fit or cooperative than perhaps is warranted. In this paper, I provide some illustrative examples of how <b>bystanders</b> could apply added positive selection pressure on both cooperative behaviour and dishonest signalling during courtship or conflict. I also discuss how the presence of <b>bystanders</b> might select for greater flexibility in behavioural strategies (e. g. conditional or condition dependence), which could maintain dishonesty at evolutionarily stable frequencies under some ecological conditions. By recognizing <b>bystanders</b> as a significant selection pressure, we might gain a more realistic approximation of what drives signalling and/or interaction dynamics in social animals...|$|R

While out injured, {{early in the morning}} on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. The Broncos denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a <b>bystander.</b>|$|E

A standoff between police and the URA radicals took place, lasting ten days. The lodge was a natural fortress, solidly constructed of thick concrete on a steep hillside with only one entrance, which, along with their guns, enabled the hostage-takers to keep police at a distance.|$|E
25|$|Ambiguity is {{one factor}} that affects {{whether or not a}} person assists another in need. In {{situations}} in which the <b>bystander(s)</b> are not sure if a person requires assistance (a high ambiguity situation), reaction time is slow (hearing a person fall but not sure if they are hurt). In low ambiguity situations (a person yelling out for help) reaction times for <b>bystanders</b> is quicker than high ambiguity situations. In some cases of high ambiguity, it can take a person or group up to 5 times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity. The number of <b>bystanders</b> in each condition is not a significant factor. In these cases, <b>bystanders</b> determine their own safety before proceeding. <b>Bystanders</b> are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity, insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity, significant consequence situations.|$|R

Before dinner, Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and <b>bystander</b> Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E

However, <b>bystanders</b> finally defeated the strangers in 40 % of cases. These results suggest that <b>bystanders</b> of conditions E and C 1 gained some information on the relationship existing between their prior dominant and the stranger and that they used it coherently, perhaps through transitive inference, thus contributing to the existence of transitive relationships within the triads.

Interventions encouraging adolescents to help targets of cyber-aggression are therefore typically based upon traditional school-based aggression research. Twenty-four in-depth interviews with Australian 13 - 16 year-olds revealed two themes that reflect how young <b>bystanders</b> perceive differences between aggression online and at school. The physical presence theme suggests that young <b>bystanders</b> struggle to determine online intentions {{in the absence}} of body language, leading to hesitancy in reactions and furthermore make it easier for them to ignore online transgressions and avoid becoming involved. The authority theme indicates young <b>bystanders</b> perceive that, compared to the school environment, the online environment lacks clearly established rules, authority figures and formal reporting mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract Background Students {{should be}} {{encouraged}} to help prevent or stop bullying. However, defending victims of bullying can impact on mental health. It is not only <b>bystanders</b> who may defend victims, but bullies, victims and bully-victims can also have defending behaviors. Nevertheless, most studies of defending behaviors have been limited to an examination of the reactions of <b>bystanders</b> or those not involved in bullying and have ignored the other players. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the associations between defending behaviors and mental health among bullies, victims, bully-victims and <b>bystanders.</b> Methods Associations among defending behaviors, mental health (including depressive symptoms and social anxiety), and bullying experiences were cross-sectionally examined in 3441 students (13 – 15 years old.) from 20 randomly selected junior high schools in Taiwan using a self-report questionnaire. SAS 9. 3 Survey Analysis procedures were used to conduct descriptive analysis and multiple regression models. Results Defending behaviors were associated with bullying roles and were higher in victims than in bullies or <b>bystanders.</b> Defending behaviors were positively associated with social anxiety and depressive symptoms. After stratifying by bullying roles, defending behaviors were positively associated with social anxiety in <b>bystanders,</b> and were positively associated with depressive symptoms in victims and <b>bystanders.</b> However, defending behaviors were not significantly associated with mental health indicators in bullies. Conclusions The associations between defending behaviors and mental health varied according to bullying roles. The results suggest that <b>bystanders</b> and victims experience more mental health effects than bullies. Intervention programs aimed at preventing bullying should focus on strategies that minimize social anxiety and depression in victims and <b>bystanders,</b> and urge students to help vulnerable peers during bullying events...|$|R
