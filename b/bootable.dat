5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a <b>bootable</b> Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
25|$|A {{rescue disk}} that is <b>bootable,</b> {{such as a}} CD or USB storage device, {{can be used to}} run {{antivirus}} software outside of the installed operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A <b>bootable</b> antivirus disk can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer <b>bootable</b> or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed antivirus software. Examples of some of these <b>bootable</b> disks include the Avira AntiVir Rescue System, PCTools Alternate Operating System Scanner, and AVG Rescue CD. The AVG Rescue CD software can also be installed onto a USB storage device, that is <b>bootable</b> on newer computers.|$|E
25|$|For {{computers}} {{set up to}} be <b>bootable</b> from a USB drive, it {{is possible}} to use a flash drive containing a <b>bootable</b> portable operating system to access the files of the computer, even if the computer is password protected. The password can then be changed, or {{it may be possible to}} crack the password with a password cracking program and gain full control over the computer. Encrypting files provides considerable protection against this type of attack.|$|E
25|$|As of February 2009 the {{software}} successfully booted {{and ran the}} official Wii System Menu v1.0. Shortly after, almost all versions of the Wii system software became <b>bootable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most current PC {{firmware}} permits booting from a USB drive, {{allowing the}} launch of an operating system from a <b>bootable</b> flash drive. Such a configuration {{is known as a}} Live USB.|$|E
25|$|Version 4.01 (OEM) â€“ Microsoft rewritten Version 4.00 {{released}} under MS-DOS label but not IBM PC DOS. First version {{to introduce}} volume serial number when formatting hard disks and floppy disks (Disk duplication also and when using SYS {{to make a}} floppy disk or a partition of a hard drive <b>bootable).</b>|$|E
25|$|Floppy disks {{are used}} for {{emergency}} boots in aging systems lacking support for other <b>bootable</b> media and for BIOS updates, since most BIOS and firmware programs can still be executed from <b>bootable</b> floppy disks. If BIOS updates fail or become corrupt, floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery. The music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks (e.g. synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, sequencers, and lighting consoles). Industrial automation equipment such as programmable machinery and industrial robots {{may not have a}} USB interface; data and programs are then loaded from disks, damageable in industrial environments. This equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability; existing software emulation and virtualization do not solve this problem because no operating system is present or a customized operating system is used that has no drivers for USB devices. Hardware floppy disk emulators can be made to interface floppy-disk controllers to a USB port {{that can be used for}} flash drives.|$|E
25|$|Linus Torvalds {{developed}} the Linux kernel and distributed its first version, 0.01, in 1991. Linux was initially distributed as source code only, {{and later as}} a pair of downloadable floppy disk images one <b>bootable</b> and containing the Linux kernel itself, and the other with a set of GNU utilities and tools for setting up a file system. Since the installation procedure was complicated, especially in the face of growing amounts of available software, distributions sprang up to simplify this.|$|E
25|$|A {{new release}} of Wikipedia content was {{published}} by Directmedia on 6 April 2005. This package consisted of a 2.7 GB DVD and a separate <b>bootable</b> CDROM (running a version of Linux with Firefox). The CDROM did not contain all the data, but was included to accommodate users without DVD-drives. The DVD used Directmedia's Digibib software and article format; everything could be installed to a hard drive. In addition, the DVD contained an HTML tree, as well as Wikipedia articles formatted for use with PDAs (specifically, the Mobipocket and TomeRaider formats).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, USB {{flash drive}} {{installations}} {{can be used}} to boot Ubuntu and Kubuntu in a way that allows permanent saving of user settings and portability of the USB-installed system between physical machines (however, the computers' BIOS must support booting from USB). In newer versions of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Live USB creator {{can be used to}} install Ubuntu on a USB drive (with or without a live CD or DVD). Creating a <b>bootable</b> USB drive with persistence is as simple as dragging a slider to determine how much space to reserve for persistence; for this, Ubuntu employs casper.|$|E
25|$|When a PC {{is powered}} on its BIOS follows the {{configured}} boot {{order to find}} a <b>bootable</b> device. This can be a harddisk, floppy, CD/DVD, network connection, USB-device, etc. depending on the BIOS. In {{the case of a}} floppy the BIOS interprets its boot sector (first sector) as code, for NTLDR this could be a NTLDR boot sector looking for the ntldr file on the floppy. For a harddisk the code in the Master Boot Record (first sector) determines the active partition. The code in the boot sector of the active partition could then be again a NTLDR boot sector looking for ntldr in the root directory of this active partition. In a more convoluted scenario the active partition can contain a Vista boot sector for the newer Vista boot manager with an {ntldr} entry pointing to another partition with a NTLDR boot sector.|$|E
25|$|In systems {{prior to}} PowerPC G3-based systems, {{significant}} {{parts of the}} system are stored in physical ROM on the motherboard. The initial purpose {{of this is to}} avoid using up the limited storage of floppy disks on system support, given that the early Macs have no hard disk (only one model of Mac was ever actually <b>bootable</b> using the ROM alone, the 1991 Mac Classic model). This architecture also allows for a completely graphical OS interface at the lowest level without the need for a text-only console or command-line mode: boot time errors, such as finding no functioning disk drives, are communicated to the user graphically, usually with an icon or the distinctive Chicago bitmap font and a Chime of Death or a series of beeps. This is in contrast to MS-DOS and CP/M computers of the time, which display such messages in a mono-spaced font on a black background, and require the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse, for input. To provide such niceties at a low level, early Mac OS depends on core system software in ROM on the motherboard, which also ensure that only Apple computers or licensed clones (with the copyright-protected ROMs from Apple) can run Mac OS.|$|E
500|$|Norton Internet Security 2011 was {{released}} for Beta testing on April 21, 2010. Changes include a new user interface and improved scanning of internet sites for malware. With the 2011 version, Symantec also released an application that [...] "scans" [...] the user's Facebook feed for any malware links. This application {{does not require}} a valid subscription. In a test sponsored by Symantec, Norton Internet Security 2011 was the only security suite to ever achieve a 100 percent protection score in a new third-party test from Dennis Labs. Improved reputation scan provides the user with an easy to understand interface on files stored on the user's computer. Marking them as trusted, good, poor, or bad. The final version of Norton Internet Security 2011 {{was released}} on August 31, 2010. New features in version 2011 also include Norton Rescue Tools. These tools include Norton <b>Bootable</b> Recovery tool and Norton Power Eraser.|$|E
500|$|Rogen {{predicted}} that the film would make its way to North Korea, stating that [...] "we were told {{one of the reasons}} they're so against the movie is that they're afraid it'll actually get into North Korea. They do have bootlegs and stuff. Maybe the tapes will make their way to North Korea and cause a revolution." [...] Business Insider reported via Free North Korea Radio that there was high demand for bootleg copies of the film in North Korea. The South Korean human rights organizations Fighters for a Free North Korea and Human Rights Foundation, largely made up of North Korean defectors, planned to distribute DVD copies of The Interview via balloon drops. The groups had previously air-dropped offline copies of the Korean Wikipedia into North Korea on a <b>bootable</b> USB memory device. The balloon drop was postponed after the North Korean government referred to the plan as a de facto [...] "declaration of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Intel Macs can boot in two ways: {{directly}} via EFI, or in a [...] "legacy" [...] BIOS compatibility mode. For multibooting, {{holding down}} [...] "Option" [...] gives {{a choice of}} <b>bootable</b> devices, while the rEFInd bootloader is commonly used for added configurability.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Intel models, a G4 Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.4 can run Mac OS 9 [...] "Classic" [...] applications, {{as long as}} a <b>bootable</b> copy of the OS 9 System Folder is {{installed}} from which to run the Classic environment. As of Mac OS X 10.5, the ability to run the Classic Environment was removed.|$|E
2500|$|While Wubi {{does not}} install Ubuntu {{directly}} {{to its own}} partition this can also be accomplished by using LVPM, the Loopmounted Virtual Partition Manager, to transfer the Wubi-generated Ubuntu installation to a dedicated real partition, including a <b>bootable</b> USB keydrive. [...] The advantage of this setup is that users can test the operating system and install the drivers before they install it to a dedicated partition (and avoid booting and functioning risks).|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{acquisition}} by Novell in 2003 {{and with the}} advent of openSUSE, this has been reversed: starting with version 9.2, an unsupported one-DVD ISO image of SUSE Professional was made available for download, as well as a <b>bootable</b> Live DVD evaluation. The FTP server continues to operate and has the advantage of [...] "streamlined" [...] installs, permitting the user to download only the packages the user feels they need. The ISO has the advantages of an easy install package, the ability to operate even if the user's network card does not work [...] "out of the box", and less experience needed (i.e., an inexperienced Linux user may not know whether or not to install a certain package, and the ISO offers several preselected sets of packages).|$|E
2500|$|Cosmos {{encompasses}} an AOT compiler named IL2CPU {{to translate}} Common Intermediate Language (CIL) into native instructions. [...] Cosmos compiles user-made programs and associated libraries using IL2CPU {{to create a}} <b>bootable</b> native executable that can be run with no support. [...] The resulting output can be booted from a USB flash drive, CD-ROM, over a network via Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), or inside a virtual machine. Recent releases also allow deploying to certain x86 embedded devices over Universal Serial Bus (USB). [...] While C# is the primary language used by developers (both on the backend and by end users of Cosmos), many CLI languages can be used, provided they compile to pure CIL {{without the use of}} Platform Invocation Services (P/Invokes). [...] Cosmos is mainly intended for use with [...]NET Framework, with Mono support in the works.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a typical}} PowerPC-based Macintosh system, the boot process {{includes}} loading a bootstrap loader from ROM, loading the Process Manager {{stored in the}} boot blocks of the startup device, locating a [...] "blessed" [...] System Folder on the startup device, and then loading Finder. However, because the Pippin platform ran only on non-writable CD-ROM, a modification to the boot process had to be made. For developers who were using standard 7.5.2 system software, a [...] "PippinFinder" [...] was installed into the System Folder, allowing the CD-ROM to be <b>bootable</b> on a Pippin-based system. Once development was finalized, PippinFinder {{was removed from the}} System Folder, and the Pippin-specific system software was placed onto the build. In addition, an alias of the main executable was placed into the Startup Items folder, so that upon bootup, the application will launch automatically. Developers are constrained to the base hardware profile of the Pippin platform, using no hard drive cache for downloaded content, and sharing 128 KB of NVRAM with the system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bootable</b> Mac OS X CD/DVDs are {{included}} with {{programs such as}} Drive Genius, DiskWarrior, FileSalvage, CopyCatX, and other software utilities. The <b>bootable</b> DVD used for the Mac OS X installer disc cannot be used as it lacks libraries required to create a <b>bootable</b> device.|$|E
50|$|This {{installation}} mode creates <b>bootable</b> USB flash {{drives and}} <b>bootable</b> USB Hard Disk Drives; it is a Live USB creator.|$|E
50|$|Create a <b>bootable</b> USB flash or {{hard drive}} from a <b>bootable</b> disc image (works only with DOS, Windows NT and syslinux boot sectors). For this, the user can open an ISO image with UltraISO and choose 'Bootable' and 'Write disk image' to burn onto a <b>bootable</b> USB disk.|$|E
5000|$|OS-9 RTOS: The {{standard}} OS-9 Configuration Wizard for X86 creates <b>bootable</b> USB sticks. OS-9 5.0 for X86 {{will support}} the creation of <b>bootable</b> CDs.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{versions}} of EasyBCD also support creating <b>bootable</b> USB disks, by deploying BOOTMGR and the BCD onto a removable disk and performing the necessary actions {{to make the}} drive <b>bootable,</b> after which it can be loaded into EasyBCD to add and remove the various supported entry types {{in order to create}} <b>bootable</b> repair USB sticks.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 2001, after {{creating}} a <b>bootable</b> DOS-based CD of proprietary software for offline operations (named [...] "The Vault"), Belgian developer, Tom Kerremans {{decided to create}} a free <b>bootable</b> Linux CD.|$|E
5000|$|Floppies are unpartitioned devices {{without a}} RDB and {{also do not}} use the autobooting mechanism, so were only <b>bootable</b> if the disk's dostype was one the ROM-based {{filesystem}} understood. As a result, FFS-formatted floppies were not <b>bootable</b> until the release of Kickstart 2.0, and mounting them under Workbench 1.3 involved some ugly unsupported hacks. Similarly, [...] "Directory Cache" [...] variants were not <b>bootable</b> or supported until Kickstart 3.0.|$|E
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with EasyBCD's {{ability to create}} <b>bootable</b> USB drives, {{it also has the}} option of creating portable entries that can be used on the normal PC bootloader or more practically on <b>bootable</b> external media.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bootable</b> {{business}} cards may hold malware as <b>bootable</b> media {{is an easy}} way for malware to infect a system and unsuspecting users are easily tempted by their novelty. It is also difficult for the average user to determine their contents before booting.|$|E
50|$|Kernel {{extensions}} {{were added}} to Solaris to allow for <b>bootable</b> Veritas VxFS operation. Logging or Journaling was added to UFS in Sun's Solaris 7.
