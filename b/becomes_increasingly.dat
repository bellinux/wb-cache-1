5|$|Vessels {{containing}} {{liquid nitrogen}} can condense oxygen from air. The liquid {{in such a}} vessel <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> enriched in oxygen (boiling point −183°C) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, {{industry}} in Birmingham was dominated by small workshops rather than large factories or mills.

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Posadists <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{interested}} in UFOs, claiming they were evidence of socialism on other planets. The movement <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> esoteric and New Age. The Posadist movement declined until Posadas' death in 1981, {{after which the}} movement largely collapsed.|$|R

In the course of his ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his life depends on it.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{a series}} of flashbacks detail the game's backstory. As Charlie and his new band mates {{experience}} success without Paul, the latter <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> upset, eventually vowing revenge. The flashbacks neither paint Charlie Murder in a wholly positive light, nor Paul in a wholly negative light. Charlie Murder has an in-game talk radio station, which plays in enemy-free areas.

5|$|In this episode, Veronica is {{hired by}} {{researchers}} in the disappearance of a Capuchin monkey being used for animal testing on non-human primates.

Meanwhile, Piz (Chris Lowell) <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> friendly and gives her advice, but after a heartfelt talk about love, Veronica decides to start dating Logan again. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) starts investigating Dean O'Dell's (Ed Begley, Jr.) mysterious death.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{arrogant and}} hostile toward {{the rest of}} the crew, declaring that he has become godlike, {{enforcing}} his desires with fearsome displays of telepathic and telekinetic power. Science Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) comes to believe that Valiant crew members may have experienced the same phenomenon, and destroyed the ship to keep the power from spreading. He advises Kirk that Mitchell may have to be killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees.|$|E
5|$|The story {{starts out}} as a fairly {{conventional}} adventure at sea, but it <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as hints of racism and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{is divided}} into seven {{geographical}} regions: Marmara, Aegean, Black Sea, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean. The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> rugged as it progresses eastward.|$|E

Rika feels stressed as a result of how she has been treated by her neighbours and family after converting to Catholicism from Islam; Abi is also facing ostracism.

5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> important.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest <b>becomes</b> <b>increasingly</b> fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
