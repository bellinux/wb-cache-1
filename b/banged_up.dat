500|$|A {{free agent}} in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million {{contract}} with the Chicago White Sox. [...] "I looked at the different opportunities that I had {{and this was a}} team that won 83 games last year while they were <b>banged</b> <b>up.</b> Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's {{going to be hard to}} replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 111, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. [...] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit [...]259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.|$|E

500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are <b>banged</b> <b>up,</b> the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{work in the}} Bacchus mythos to be {{published}} by Dark Horse was also the first time Bacchus appeared within a comic published in colour, The Ghost In The Glass, published in 1995.

[...] The Bacchus character's stories came to an end after the <b>Banged</b> <b>Up</b> storyline, and although Campbell eventually finished the reprinting of the previously published material, he continued publishing Eddie Campbell's Bacchus, updating the name to Eddie Campbell's Bacchus Magazine to reflect the growing number of text pieces he was running, before cancelling the book with issue sixty.|$|E

Senior tight end Jacob Pedersen was the team's second-leading receiver with 36 receptions, 501 yards, and 3 touchdowns. White caught 37 passes for 292 yards. A trio of other wide receivers – senior Jeff Duckworth, sophomore Jordan Frederick, and freshman Alex Erickson – also contributed, with each catching between 8 and 10 passes and between 100 and 200 yards. Wisconsin's offensive line was plagued by injuries all season long. Entering the bowl game, center Dallas Lewallen engaged in limited practice participation, and his status was [...] "a major question mark"; if he could not play, Dan Voltz would start at center. Starting guard Kyle Costigan was also <b>banged</b> <b>up</b> entering the game.

6000|$|It {{was quite}} evident that Aunt Betty {{would not be}} a {{hindrance}} to the departure of either of them and no wonder, for Betty had received Nellie Carr into her family with a bad grace when her widowed brother, [...] "old Carr," [...] died, leaving his only child without a home. From that day Betty had brought the poor little orphan up--or, rather, had scolded and banged her up--until Bob Massey relieved her of the charge. To do Aunt Betty justice, she scolded and <b>banged</b> <b>up</b> her own children in the same way; but for these--her own young ones--she entertained and expressed a species of affection which mankind shares in common with cats, while for Nellie Carr she had no such affection, and contrived to make the fact abundantly plain. As we not infrequently find in such circumstances, the favoured children--which numbered seven--became heart-breakers, while the snubbed one turned out the flower of the flock.|$|E
