5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being <b>beaten</b> <b>in</b> Stockholm.|$|E
