40|$|<b>Brinase</b> {{added to}} human plasma in vitro caused a {{decrease}} in fibrinogen concentration, positive paracoagulation tests and formation of a friable clot in sequence. Agarose gel filtration of these samples revealed the presence of fibrinogen derivatives both larger and smaller than the parent molecule. Infusion of the enzyme in vivo resulted in a decreased fibrinogen level, a prolonged thrombin time {{and an increase in}} fibrinogen related antigen (FRA) in serum. The elution pattern of FRA in the plasma samples obtained after infusion of <b>Brinase</b> was {{similar to that of the}} in vitro samples. The plasma pool of fibrinogen was partially consumed by infusion of <b>Brinase,</b> but the turnover of plasminogen remained unaffected. Purified plasminogen was partially degraded by addition of the enzyme but this was accompanied by a generation of proteolytic activity. These findings confirm that <b>Brinase</b> induces a proteolytic degradation of fibrinogen in plasma without activation of the plasminogen-plasmin system. Exposure of polymerization site(s) in the fibrinogen molecule is probably responsible for the reported clot promoting effect of the enzyme. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Summary. -The T {{lymphocyte}} {{populations of}} 22 young healthy adults, 21 healthy middle aged and older blood donors, 35 non-pregnant women of child bearing age and 14 patients with advanced malignant disease were assessed and compared.

The addition of the proteolytic agent <b>brinase</b> (protease 1 obtained from Aspergillus oryzae) to the rosetting test increased the T cell counts significantly in all groups.

40|$|Inflammatory response, a {{standard}} clinical condition, {{is an important}} defense mechanism that protects the tissues from invasion by organisms and damaged cells. A variety of enzymes have been used extensively {{in the management of}} pro-tein deficiencies and therapeutic applications. Proteolytic enzymes can be administered with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Proteolytic enzymes such as chymotrypsin, trypsin and serratiopeptidase {{play an important role in}} the inflammatory processes (1). Proteases are found in living organisms including plants, animals, and microbes. In fact, microbe-derived proteolytic enzymes are extracted from or synthe-sized by bacterial and fungal sources such as streptokinase, a proteolytic enzyme preparation from Î²-hemolytic streptococci, <b>brinase</b> from Aspergillus oryzae, Sutilain, a proteolytic enzyme isolated from Bacillus subtilis, arazyme from Serratia proteamaculans, and bacterial toxins like tentoxilysin (tetanus neurotoxin), botulinum neu-rotoxin and anthrax toxin lethal factor (2 - 7). Microbial proteases can be divided into different classes, according to activity under acidic, neutral and alkaline environments, chemical characteris...|$|E
