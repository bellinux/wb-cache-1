5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This <b>break-down</b> process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} sector, American {{outposts}} such as Detroit, Berlin, East Berlin, Reno, Carson, Elko and Vegas had been bitterly contested {{over the previous}} months by the US 1st Marine Division and the Turkish Brigade but by June the Reno, Elko and Vegas positions had been captured by Chinese. The front subsequently returned to its usual defensive routine, but following a temporary <b>break-down</b> in negotiations after the unilateral release of 25,000 anti-communist Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war by South Korean President Syngman Rhee, the Chinese had renewed large-scale attacks on 24 June. Concentrating on the South Korean divisions in the eastern and central sectors, the Chinese launched another offensive in June {{in an attempt to}} convince the South Korean leader to come to terms. The fighting continued {{until the end of the}} month as the Chinese successively drove back elements of ROK 9th Division in the US IX Corps sector and the ROK 1st Division in the US I Corps sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. The video opens within a black cube {{with an array of}} different colored lights with several people dancing. The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera panning around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, manipulating the motion of the cube with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A <b>break-down</b> of the song, where Timberlake is beatboxing, shows him dancing by himself. The beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version, the album version cuts the beatboxing out. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera panning around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E

Young’s research group, headed by , published their results in a paper which characterized three alleles of dbt in fruit flies. They discovered that two mutant alleles, named short and long (dbts and dbtl, respectively) that were able to alter normal cycling of per and tim. Young’s team suspected that the delay between the rise in mRNA levels of per and tim {{and the rise of}} PER and TIM protein were due to the effects of another protein. Young suspected that this protein postponed the intercellular accumulation of PER protein by destroying it. Only when PER was paired with TIM was this <b>break-down</b> not possible.

By the time that Amer realized his mistake, the Israelis had made significant advances into the Sinai.|$|E

Some torus models predict how Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the torus covering factor, something supported by studies in the x-ray of AGN. The models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in Seyfert 1s to more “dead” Seyfert 2s and can explain the observed <b>break-down</b> of the unified model at low luminosities {{and the evolution of}} the broad-line region.|$|E
25|$|A demi-pointe shoe, {{which is}} also {{variously}} called a <b>break-down,</b> pre-pointe, or a soft-block shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe {{and it has a}} toe box, although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the toe box) are typically not as deep as those found on pointe shoes. Demi-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and elastic band in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{respiration}} {{is limited}} by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (<b>break-down</b> reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO2 for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.|$|E

25|$|Marginocephalians have simple, peg-like teeth {{surrounded}} by rhamphoteca, a horny sheath of keratin. The teeth {{are arranged in}} batteries for easy replacement and have serrations {{which may have been}} useful for cutting up vegetation. Marginocephalia evolved several methods for breaking down vegetation. Pachycephalosaurs had especially large abdomens with broad girths and elongate sacral ribs suggesting the presence of a large stomach. This is presumed to have been useful for breaking down tough vegetation through bacterial fermentation. Another adaptation for advanced vegetation digestion is seen in Ceratopsians, which evolved features to improve their chewing apparatus. Derived ceratopsians have vertical grinding surfaces on their teeth to maximize <b>break-down</b> of tough vegetation. There is also evidence of advanced adductor musculature that extends from a large coronoid process on the mandible up to the ceratopsian frill, which would increase chewing force. Pachycephalosaurs had gastroliths to help in digestion of food, but only primitive ceratopsians, such as Psittacosaurus, have been found to have gastroliths.|$|E

This <b>break-down</b> process is known as digestion. The main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food in one direction: from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
25|$|After {{an end to}} {{the season}} which many {{believed}} would only spur City on, however, the following season failed to capitalise on any of the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. The transfer window saw virtually no players join the club until {{the last day of the}} season, when a last-minute burst of activity saw four different players all join in the space of around 10 hours. The free-flowing football of the previous season was suddenly rare to behold, and while City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the UEFA Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, in a result which seemed to confirm Mancini's reputation as far better at managing in domestic games than European, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. The loss resulted in Mancini's dismissal, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season but with many in the press suggesting a <b>break-down</b> of relations between Mancini and his players but also between the Italian and his board-level superiors, while a refusal to promote young players was also cited. In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, who boasted a far more impressive Champions League record but less of a reputation for trophy-winning.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, 4 December, at 08:30 C Company 1 RAR encountered {{three small}} groups of Viet Cong, and a platoon attack was launched {{under the cover of}} indirect fire, with little result. Meanwhile, a bombed out bunker system was encountered by B Company from 10:00, while other minor contacts developed as the Australians continued to advance, during which they uncovered a cache of rice. At 13:47 9 Platoon C Company was briefly contacted, and during a further reconnaissance of the area the Australians located a Viet Cong camp. They subsequently withdrew, calling in an air strike with napalm to destroy the bunkers. C Company returned to the area as dusk approached and was unable to search the area until the following day. At 07:40 on 5 December the Australians assaulted the camp with the tanks, destroying a number of bunkers at point-blank range with their main armament, while the infantry grenaded the pits. Yet once again the Viet Cong were found to have fled, leaving behind one dead body from the contact the previous afternoon. The camp was estimated to be adequate for a company-sized force and was found to be untouched by the air strike the previous day, which had fallen too far west. Leaving a small force of infantry and the tanks to destroy the camp, C Company continued and was again contacted at 11:05 by three Viet Cong at close range. Pushing on however, the Australians were subsequently fired on from at least five bunkers. Bennett ordered B Company into a blocking position to the north, while the tank troop was pushed up to support C Company which was preparing to conduct a company-attack. At 15:00 the camp was assaulted and it was again found to have been abandoned. Despite locating numerous bunkers, the Australians continued to pursue the Viet Cong, however their advance was hampered by the mechanical <b>break-down</b> of one of the Centurions; the vehicle was subsequently recovered to FSB Dyke.|$|E
