50|$|Later, the cat sneaks {{into the}} barn inside a <b>butter</b> <b>churner.</b> He pokes the chicken with a fork and {{searches}} the nest for Jerry. As the hen lands, he sneaks back into the churner and pokes the hen again. This continues until the hen sees the fork and removes the churner, grabs the fork and ends up poking Tom with the fork. The hen starts to ride on Tom like a horse, but suddenly stops when she hears chirps from her nest. Her eggs have hatched to release some baby chicks. She picks them up from her nest and sends them off to play. Jerry runs away from the nest with a few feathers and he tries {{to blend in with}} the other chicks. But one of the chicks mistakes Jerry's tail for a worm.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} wooden {{tools are}} the necessities {{of the daily}} life {{of the people of}} Ladakh region and are linked directly with geographical conditions of the region. A lot of diversity in the wooden tools used by the tribal farmers of Ladakh since ancient times is observed. The tools are made up of different, locally available materials in a unique fashion by the localites. These wooden implements are preferred over modern one’s because of their multipurpose uses. Secondly these traditional implements find wide applicability in the region because of steep terrain, where the scope of mechanized farm implements is very limited. In the present study few important traditional tools of Ladakh have been presented. The important tools viz; chepo, shak, zungba, rzgeem, saddle, khem, khaczhay, thougk, gourgur, <b>butter</b> <b>churner,</b> plough, smeing, rbhat, grookook etc. have been described in detail in this paper...|$|E
