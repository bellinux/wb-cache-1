5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically <b>before</b> <b>age</b> three.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he was probably not regularly at home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died <b>before</b> <b>age</b> 10.|$|E
5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball <b>before</b> <b>age</b> 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause <b>before</b> <b>age</b> 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} the trinucleotide repeat {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the variation in}} the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease <b>before</b> <b>age</b> 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset <b>before</b> <b>age</b> 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the removal}} of {{aluminum}} in leach liquor of nitric acid pressure leaching laterite was investigated, and a new method of aluminum removal by precipitation with calcium sulphide was presented. The effect of reaction temperature, pH value <b>before</b> <b>ageing</b> and ageing time on {{the removal of}} aluminum were examined in details. The optimum conditions were determined as follows: reaction temperature 40 °C, pH 3. 9 ~ 4. 1 (<b>before</b> <b>aging)</b> and aging time 30 min. Compared with the traditional precipitation method, the loss of nickel and cobalt was less than 1 % in the obtained aluminum precipitate slag, which is 3 % lower than that by the traditional method; the filtration rate of aluminum precipitate slurry was faster than the traditional method, when the filtration press was controlled at- 0. 04 MPa, the filtration rate of aluminum precipitate slurry could reach 0. 109 m...|$|R
