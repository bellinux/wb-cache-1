40|$|Introduction: The {{modeling}} aims {{to simulate}} or optimize {{a process in}} physical, chemical or biological environments and the derived model will provide a considerable assistance to generate data and predict unknown condition, in case of sufficient suitability. Unsuitable disposal and elimination of waste tires have polluted the environment and human life areas, it also have caused removal of {{a huge amount of}} recyclable materials and energy. Besides, attached growth biological processes of wastewater treatment are faced with very high costs of the beds used in such methods. Thus, this study targeted at the following topics: reuse of waste tires, reduction of the costs associated with preparation of biological wastewater treatment system beds, and increased productivity of refineries.  Materials and Methods: The current experimental study was conducted in pilot scale, in which ability of Fixed Bed Sequence Batch Reactor (FBSBR) and Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) was evaluated by synthetic wastewater in diverse loadings. Ultimately, the derived data were analyzed using the statistical software packages SPSS and MS Excel. Results: The maximum removal efficiencies of dissolved chemical oxygen demand for FBSBR and SBR reactors were 98. 3 % and 97. 9 %, respectively. In addition, Stover-Kincannon model provided a very suitable fitness (R 2   > 0. 99) for loading the bioreactor FBSBR. Conclusion: According to the results, not only waste tires can be reused, but also these wastes can be employed as a proper <b>biological</b> <b>bed</b> in wastewater refineries to improve their efficiency...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} survey removal hydrogen sulfide provide in septic tank by vermicomposting biofilter. Materials and Methods: In this study pilot-scale biofilter has been made of bed vermicompost and wood trash. To survey biofilter performance under real condition, the pilot installed in one wastewater pumping station of Ahwaz city, Iran. The study was carried out over 80 days. Inlet and outlet H 2 S concentration were measured on regular basis. To provide an optimal condition for bacterial growth, moisture was adjusted between 40 % and 60 % throughout the experiment.

40|$|Performance of {{fluidized-bed}} biofilm reactors (FBBRs) greatly {{depends on}} the amount of biomass attached to the inert core support particles and overall bed voidage. Thus, for proper design of an FBBR, {{it is important to know}} the biological particle (bioparticle) mixing and bed expansion behavior, which in turn influence bed volume and consequently the residence time of the liquid phase. This paper first investigates the superiority of some of the predominantly used fluidization correlations for <b>biological</b> <b>beds</b> to predict bed voidage and, second, it investigates the implications of bioparticle mixing in FBBRs. The fluidization correlation suggested by Foscolo et al. (1983) was found to be superior to the more widely used Richardson and Zaki (1954) correlation to predict FBBR bed voidage. Furthermore, from the three different sets of published experimental results of bed voidage applied in this study, the fluidization correlation suggested by Foscolo et al. (1983), along with the terminal settling velocity equation suggested by Mulcahy and Shieh (1987), was found to be superior to other sets of correlations used in this study to predict bed voidage in an FBBR, having the lowest mean deviation of 12. 7 %. A mathematical model for fluidization of a binary bioparticle mixture is also presented in this paper to model the interaction of a variety of parameters, including upflow superficial liquid velocity, core support particle size and density, and biofilm thickness. Numerical simulations using this model revealed that, for sand-like core support particles (density ranging from 1500 to 2700 kg/m(3)), a complete segregation would likely occur in the bed with larger bioparticles at the top and smaller ones at the bottom. For charcoal- or polymer-like core support particles (density ranging from 1050 to 1300 kg/m(3)), a homogeneous bed made up of both larger and smaller bioparticles would likely occur.

40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{evaluate}} the incidence and risk factors, both clinical and physical, {{of the development}} of a postradiation recto-vaginal fistula in cervical cancer patients. Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis of 222 consecutive patients receiving radical treatment for invasive cervical cancer at the Regional Oncology Centre in Bydgoszcz between 1993 and 1995 has been performed, on 140 patients treated with radiotherapy alone and 82 patients who received radiotherapy combined with surgical treatment. The doses and dose rates of brachytherapy were specified at point A, the mean dose being 49 and 46 Gy for radiotherapy alone and combined treatment, respectively. External beam irradiation was applied in fractions of 1. 8 – 2 Gy, up to a total dose of 44. 6 Gy (36 – 50 Gy). The dose and dose rate in the rectum (point R 1) were determined according to the protocol 38 th ICRU, the <b>biological</b> extrapolated dose (<b>BED),</b> using a LQ model, was calculated as a sum of a dose from external beam irradiation and brachytherapy. ResultsA total of 17 (7. 6 %) recto-vaginal cases of fistulae were found; 13 (9, 2 %) in patients treated with radiotherapy alone, 4 (4, 8 %) in patients treated with combined treatment. The median latency time was 11. 8 months (range 7 to 24). There is a strong association between the risk of developing a fistula and the <b>biological</b> extrapolated dose (<b>BED)</b> at point R 1. Addition of surgical treatment results in a higher risk of complications.

The velocity at which {{the top of the}} fluidised bed expands or contracts and the upward velocity of the porosity transition interface depend only upon the initial and final states of the bed porosity and the fluid superficial velocity.

40|$|Purpose: There {{is growing}} {{interest}} about <b>biological</b> effective dose (<b>BED)</b> and its application in treatment plan evaluation {{due to its}} stronger correlation with treatment outcome. An approximate <b>biological</b> effective dose (<b>BED</b> A) equation was introduced {{in order to simplify}} BED calculations by treatment planning systems in multi-phase treatments. The purpose of this work is to reveal its mathematical properties relative to the true, multi-phase BED (BED T) equation. Methods : The BED T equation was derived and used to reveal the mathematical properties of BED A. MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used to simulate and analyze common and extreme clinical multi-phase cases. In those cases, percent error and Bland-Altman analysis were used to study the significance of the inaccuracies of BED A for different combinations of total doses, numbers of fractions, doses per fractions and α/β values. All the calculations were performed on a voxel-basis in order to study how dose distributions would affect the accuracy of BED A. Results: When the voxel dose-per-fractions (DPF) delivered by both phases are equal, BED A and BED T are equal (0 % error). In heterogeneous dose distributions, which significantly vary between the phases, there are fewer occurrences of equal DPFs and hence the imprecision of BED A is greater. It was shown that as the α/β ratio increased the accuracy of BED A would improve. Examining twenty-four cases, it was shown that the range of DPF ratios for 3 % P error varied from 0. 32 to 7. 50 Gy, whereas for P error of 1 % the range varied from 0. 50 to 2. 96 Gy. Conclusion : The DPF between the different phases should be equal in order to render BED A accurate. OARs typically receive heterogeneous dose distributions hence the probability of equal DPFs is low. Consequently, the BED A equation should only be used for targets or OARs that receive uniform or very similar dose distributions by the different treatment phases.

According {{to the nature of}} the contaminants and/or the complex mixture of pollutants in the gaseous phase, their concentrations and the flow to be cleaned, removing non-particulate pollutants from a gas stream is achieved by different processes classified into three categories: (i) thermal and/or catalytic oxidation, biological transformation; (ii) transfer into a liquid phase (absorption) or onto a solid phase (adsorption); and (iii) phase change (condensation).
