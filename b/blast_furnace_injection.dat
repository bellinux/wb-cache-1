40|$|This Master's Thesis {{deals with}} a model-based {{pressure}} and flow control of a fine coal injection vessel {{for use in the}} <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>injection</b> process. Through a transportation pipe, pulverized coal is conveyed from the coal injection vessel to the blast furnace where it is injected through the tuyeres. Irregularities in the coal mass flow to the blast furnace might cause significant variations in the raw iron quality. Therefore, a control system should be in place to maintain a constant pressure in the injection vessel and a constant coal mass flow from the injection vessel to the blast furnace. By means of system modeling and identification, the structure and behavior of the coal injection vessel have been analyzed. It has been shown that by use of model-based design, the control goals can be achieved and the control performance can be sufficiently improved compared to the conventional PI- controllers. Several dynamic models of the plant have been developed. A number of control strategies are presented and compared by means of simulation studies. The LQG design method is used to design the controllers. All the controllers have been validated through experiments on the coal injection plant at SSAB Tunnplåt in Luleå, Sweden.

40|$|Grinding coals to a {{pulverised}} coal specification for <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>injection</b> can be costly, {{which is why}} some iron manufacturers choose a larger granulated coal size specification. However, there is a concern that these coals may have lower burnout in the raceway region {{so there is a}} technical and economic balance with coal grinding. This paper investigates how the process of grinding alters the physical properties, plus the surface chemistry, of coals and their chars formed in a drop tube furnace; it was found that in many cases the larger particle size coals gave improved combustion burnout compared to smaller sizes. The physical properties of the chars, formed from grinding coals to different sizes, resulted in char swelling in the smaller particle sizes, compared to char fragmentation for the larger size classifications. Minerals phases associated with better coal reactivity were found to undergo higher conversion to other chemical forms with the larger size coals, suggesting a potential catalytic or synergistic contribution to their burnout. A closer look at the surface chemistry suggests that the action of grinding coals has an important effect on the surface chemistry. The XPS spectra of the chars, formed in a drop tube furnace, indicated that grinding the coals to a smaller particle size reduced the carbon–oxygen and carbon–mineral interactions compared to the larger sizes and correlated with the higher burnouts. An increasing trend was identified for the carbon sp 2 bonding with larger size and higher rank coals which correlated with their burnout at low carbon conversions; however, this did not hold at higher conversions, suggesting other factors were more dominant...|$|E
40|$|Ninety-eight {{percent of}} the pig iron {{produced}} {{in the world is}} made in <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Pig-iron smelting is presently being impacted by a serious shortage of coking coals. Moreover, the production of coke used in the smelting operation has an adverse effect on the environment. One method of partially replacing coke in the smelting operation is to inject hydrocarbons into the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> The <b>injection</b> of hydrocarbon through the tuyeres alters the mass- and heat-transfer conditions inside the furnace and increases the volume and hydrogen content of the hearth gases and top gases. The hydrogen content of the gases depends on the value of the C/H 2 ratio in the fuel that is injected. All these changes decrease the amount of direct reduction that iron undergoes in the furnace. This article presents results from model calculations that took into account the complex effect of injected hydrocarbons on reduction and heat exchange in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> The models were used to quantitatively estimate the amount of reduction that takes place and to determine the value of a coefficient which characterizes the replacement of coke by injected fuel.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the question: Which are {{promising}} options for decreasing material consumption, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in the lifecycle of plastics? The research described in this thesis mainly focuses on measures that change the material system, i. e. measures that change the pattern of material flows through society. By conducting an integral analysis of material flows, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in the lifecycle of plastics, {{it is possible to}} compare different measures at different stages in the life-cycle of a material or product, up and down the product-chain. In this thesis measures to replace feedstocks (changing production routes) are compared with measures for using alternative plastic types (material substitution) and measures for using alternative processes for plastic waste management (increasing materials recycling). A calculation method is developed and used to estimate the impact of the different measures on greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels consumption over the whole lifecycle of plastics. The research that underlies this thesis leads to the following conclusions: * Changes in steamcracker feedstocks (ethane, LPG, gasoil and naphtha) only marginally influence total fossil fuels and feedstocks consumption and CO 2 emissions. Higher reductions can be achieved by using new processing routes that use biomass as feedstock, like biomass flash pyrolysis and the methanol-to-olefins process combined with methanol production from biomass. Especially a combination of these two routes turns out to be capable of inducing large reductions. * Because substitution potentials between different plastic types are limited and differences in energy use and CO 2 emissions for producing different plastic types are relatively small, no large reductions are to be achieved by substitution between plastics types (unless this would enable product changes increasing material efficiency). * Landfilling and incineration of plastic waste do not allow simultaneous reductions in fossil fuels and feedstocks consumption {{on the one hand and}} CO 2 emissions on the other hand. Although it is a cheap and relatively easily applicable option, increasing the share of waste incineration is no valuable option, because it largely increases overall CO 2 emissions. * Largest reductions of CO 2 emissions and fossil fuels consumption by measures aiming at enhanced waste management are achieved by increasing the contribution of mechanical recycling, selective dissolution or <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>injection.</b> Effort should be made to clear away the obstacles that limit the share of mechanical recycling, by developing appropriate blending and separation techniques. * We estimate that structural changes in the lifecycle of plastics in The Netherlands can lead to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels of up to 60...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} price and economic pressures, {{there is a}} need to minimise coke consumption. The lesser amount of coke used has indirectly set higher standards for coke quality and led to a wish for even more knowledge about its function in the blast furnace. Over the last 20 years, coke quality has been strongly dictated by the so- called CSR value because it was believed that a higher CSR leads to improvement in productivity and more stable operation. Due to lack of suitable coals, often cokes are made from coals with relatively inferior coals leading to coke with lower values of the so-called CRI indicia. Because of this, there was an indirect focus on cokes with lower CRI values. Therefore, this thesis will address some of the important issues of coke strength and focus on changes occurring with coke when it passes through a blast furnace. The main aim of this study is to understand the degradation mechanisms and reactivity changes of coke in order to investigate the factors that affect coke quality. Cokes excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) are used as a basis for the research. Two campaigns with similar coke (low CRI/high CSR) but different <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>injection</b> material have been studied. The coke is supplied from SSAB Tunnplåt Luleå AB. Physical and chemical properties of cokes samples from the EBF were measured. Evolution of coke properties particularly carbon structure and alkali uptake were related to CO 2 reactivity as well as coke behaviour (e. g. CSR/abrasion). In addition to this, a trial with very high CRI coke was studied. On the basis of this study, following conclusions were made. The order of carbon structure and concentration of alkali species were increased and these were the most notable changes in the coke properties as it passed through shaft to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The degree of graphitisation was increased while amorphous carbon content was decreased in the hotter zones of the EBF. A linear correlation between the height of the carbon crystallite (Lc) values and the coke bed temperature was established to demonstrate the strong effect of temperature on the carbon crystallite value (Lc) of coke in the EBF. The alkali concentration of coke increased with increasing temperature of the coke bed such that most of the alkali content was evenly distributed in the bulk of the coke rather than in the periphery of the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of coke was found to increase during progressive movement of the coke from shaft to cohesive zone of the EBF, and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkali concentration in coke. The deterioration of coke quality in the EBF, particularly coke strength (CSR) and abrasion propensity (I drum test), was related to coke graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity to demonstrate the strong effect of the coke graphitisation on the propensity of coke degradation. Differential Thermal Analysis indicated that reactions with CO 2 are enhanced as coke descends through the EBF. In addition, a trial period with poor coke quality was studied by extensive sampling. The results from this study gave the following additional conclusions: Comparison between high and poor quality coke indicate structure to be connected with alkali uptake, reaction with CO 2 and degradation. Isotropic coke carbon components are more resistant than anisotropic components when passing through the EBF. Both cokes develop a more ordered structure as they descend through the EBF.

Total heat load on the tuyere increases about 10 % and heat load on the tuyere tip increases about 50 %. Bosh temperatures remained within the usual operating range. Performance in all these areas is acceptable. Lance performance was improved during testing by changes to lance materials and operating practices. The lance fuel tip was changed from copper to a nickel alloy to eliminate oxidation problems that severely limited tip life. Ignition flow rates and oxygen-fuel ratios were changed to counter the effects of blowpipe pressure fluctuations caused by natural resonance and by coal/coke combustion in the tuyere and raceway.

To meet such situation, {{it is important to}} examine the methods employed in the calculation of the heat balance of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> In this study, the authors have discussed in parallel three kinds of methods used in the heat balance and developed new ones based on the actual situation by adjusting the items to be examined. The flow of heat in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> can be easily estimated by applying the present methods. Futhermore, the validity of the present methods has been testified by calculating the heat balance・ using data obtained in actually operating <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Titanium-bearing {{iron ores}} {{are found in}} many large {{deposits}} {{around the world and}} are becoming an important alternative source of iron ore due to shortage of high purity ores. More importantly, in many cases Ti-bearing secondary raw materials are introduced into the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> to protect the hearth and extend the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> operating life. As the refractory material in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> hearth is the most critical part of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace,</b> extending the life of this area can extend the operation life of the whole <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> The mechanism by which the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> hearth can be protected by addition of titanium to the burden is via the formation of complex titanium carbo-nitrides. These titanium carbo-nitrides with very high melting point form in the hot area of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> then precipitate in the cooler area of the hearth, i. e. the area where the most heat is lost, as an additional refractory...|$|R

In the present work, a noble technique (heating microscope) is adopted to determine the flow characteristics of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slags obtained from different <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces.</b> It is seen that the results so obtained agree very closely with the values obtained from adopting conventional methods of determining the same using the slag atlas. It is also seen that the characteristics temperature are altered with the alteration of C/S ratio and also the MgO content of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag...|$|R
