Significant changes were revealed in allele frequencies {{and the level of}} genetic diversity. Using the temporal method (Krimbas and Tsakas, 1971; Nei and Tajima, 1981), the effective population size was calculated for the studied groups of mollusks. Specific features of the metapopulation structure of Br. fruticum in an urbanized landscape are discussedyesBelgorod State National Research Universit...|$|E

40|$|Snails and slugs, {{ubiquitous}} orchid pests, can inflict a {{great deal}} of damage to virtually every part of an orchid. They wait for the cover of night to wreak their havoc. Snails and slugs, left unchecked, can infest a collection and kill your orchids fairly quickly. If you grow orchids outdoors or in a greenhouse, these pests are likely {{to be found in the}} vicinity of your growing area. Indoor growers may introduce them with a new plant, which can harbor snails, slugs or their eggs unseen in the growing medium. Snails and slugs eat mostly flowers, roots and tender new growths, although, if those are unavailable, they will consume any plant part. Because they do their damage primarily under the cover of darkness, they can be difficult to detect and eradicate. There are many different types of slugs and snails that will eat orchids; some of the more common are the orchid or <b>bush</b> <b>snails</b> (Zonitoides arboreus), the brown garden snail (Helix aspersa), the field slug (Deroceras reticulatum) and the marsh slug (Deroceras laeve). Early in the morning, you may be able to still find a snail that has been eating your flowers.
