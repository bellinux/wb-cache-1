Recent designs for brake-by-wire systems use resolvers to provide accurate and continuous measurements for both absolute position and speed of the [...] of the actuators. Incremental encoders are relative position sensors and their additive error needs to be calibrated or compensated for by different methods. Unlike the encoders, resolvers provide two output signals that always allow the detection of absolute angular position. In addition, they suppress common mode noise and are especially useful in a noisy environment. Because of these reasons, resolvers are usually applied {{for the purpose of}} position and speed measurement in brake-by-wire systems. However, nonlinear and robust observers are required to extract accurate position and speed estimates from the sinusoidal signals provided by resolvers.|$|E

As much as 69. 0 % of the errors escaped detection, but these errors had only a minor impact on the brake performance. Only 26. 6 % of the injected errors were detected and subsequently recovered from by the software. Of these were 91. 5 % detected by hardware exceptions and 8. 5 % by the software mechanisms.

30|$|The master {{controller}} {{was the primary}} means of controlling the tram and integrated throttle and <b>braking</b> <b>commands</b> into a single lever. These were mapped to the direction of travel (i.e. moving the {{master controller}} forward moved the tram forward). Participants described a process {{of working with the}} master controller to understand how throttle manipulations influenced tram speed. This was a non-technical skill and descriptions supported the joint-cognitive systems view [12]. The master controller is ultimately associated with the safety function of ensuring a smooth passenger journey task and subtask, as shown in Fig.  3. The problems observed with the master controller fell into a number of categories and included designs with low correspondence between body and arm posture, variation in reach distances, and forearm pads that did not facilitate contact with all master controller notch positions. For example, the master controller in Fig.  4 was integrated into the right-arm of the driver seat and could only be adjusted by pivoting the armrest up or down at the point it joined the rear of the chair. The way that master controller movements graduated with accelerating and braking also varied between trams, within and between the two sites. Predicting changes in tram speed was therefore less reliable and reported as a contributing factor to work-related stress.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the <b>brake</b> <b>commands</b> to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the <b>brake</b> level <b>commands.</b> Instead, the <b>brake</b> pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: cut-off valve, vent valve, auxiliary valve, and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the auxiliary reservoir, the emergency reservoir, and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new braking torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The braking torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required braking torque and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required braking torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum braking torque required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required braking torque is to be equal to the overall maximum braking torque. In the case of normal <b>braking,</b> the <b>command</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required braking torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum braking torque and the <b>command</b> <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required braking torque is smaller than the maximum braking torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required braking torque is bigger than the maximum braking torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the maximum braking torque of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R

40|$|All {{electric}} machines {{have two}} mechanical operations, motoring and braking. The nature of braking can be regenerative, where the kinetic {{energy of the}} rotor is converted into electricity and {{sent back to the}} power source or non-regenerative, where the source supplies electric power to provide braking. This thesis investigates several critical issues related to regenerative braking in both DC and AC electric machines, including the determination of boundaries in the torque-speed plane defining the regenerative braking capability region and the evaluation of operating points within that capability region that result in maximum regenerative braking recharge current. Electric machines are used in the powertrains of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles to provide motoring or braking torque in response to the driver's request and power management logic. Since such vehicles carry a limited amount of electrical energy on-board their energy storage systems (such as a battery pack), it is important to conserve as much electrical energy as possible in order to increase the range of travel. Therefore, the concept of regenerative braking is of importance for such vehicles since operating in this mode during a braking event sends power back to the energy storage system thereby replenishing its energy level. Since the electric machine assists the mechanical friction braking system of the vehicle, it results in reduced wear on components within the mechanical friction brake system. As both mechanical friction braking and electric machine braking are used to provide the requested vehicle braking torque, braking strategies which relate to splitting of the <b>braking</b> <b>command</b> between the two braking mechanisms are discussed. The reduction in energy consumption of a test vehicle along different driving schedules while using different braking strategies is also studied.

40|$|The {{organisation}} of {{the muscular}} activities {{responsible for the}} termination of gait, their modulation {{as a function of}} the rate of progression and the associated mechanical effects were investigated in normal adults, using EMG, force plate and kinematic recordings. In particular, the braking actions in reaction to a visual cue presented at the instant of heel-strike were analysed quantitatively, with a focus on representative leg and thigh muscles of the weight-supporting (stance) and oscillating (swing) limb, during walk-and-stop trials performed at three different velocities. In the stance limb, the EMG associated with braking started approximately 150 ms after the stop signal and, on average, displayed a distal-to-proximal activation sequence that primarily involved the posterior muscle groups (soleus, SOL, and hamstring, HAM). With the exception of SOL, which showed a single EMG burst, EMG patterns consisted of two or three progressively larger components occurring reciprocally in antagonistic muscles. Increasing walking speed yielded a significant reduction of the activity in distal muscles, and a simultaneous increment in proximal muscles. The mechanical effect of the earlier braking actions, estimated from the backward-directed wave of the horizontal ground reaction force, decreased in a velocity-dependent manner. In the swing limb the braking activities began approximately 330 ms after the stop signal and, on average, revealed a proximal-to-distal activation sequence with the extensor groups (quadriceps, QUAD, and SOL) playing a prominent role. They always consisted of single EMG bursts, largely co-activated in the antagonist muscles. The onset latencies of the individual components showed a close correlation, and the spatio-temporal parameters were always scaled in parallel. Unlike the stance limb, the mechanical braking action associated with the final contact of the swing limb increased with walking speed. The results indicate that the muscle synergies responsible for the rapid termination of gait in response to a ground-contact visual cue are produced by a relatively flexible set of motor commands modulated according to different velocity-dependent strategies in the weight-bearing limb, and by a single, fairly robust motor programme in the swing limb.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the design of a control scheme based on Fuzzy Logic to minimize automobile fuel consumption and exhaust emissions while maximizing battery state of charge (SOC) for hybrid vehicles. The advantages the hybrid vehicle has over the conventional vehicle are very low emission of pollutants, and more efficient fuel consumption if controlled properly. The principal components of the drive train are an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Since there are two devices, it becomes impossible for the driver to individually control both components while driving along, and {{it will be necessary to}} automate the use of these elements so that the vehicle is driven in the same way as a conventional vehicle. In the parallel configuration, both devices apply torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the hybrid vehicle is modeled, and throttle angle, motor current and <b>brake</b> torque <b>command</b> are chosen as the control inputs. Another input considered is the driver behavior. This input is obtained from an Artificial Neural Network that classifies the behavior based on the pedal angle characteristics over a period of time. The problem in question is how to distribute the energy demands for each component of the hybrid vehicle so that the objectives, maximizing the battery SOC and minimizing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, are met. Because these objectives depend on different components, we must decide how to demand energy from them to fulfill the driver request and at the same time meeting the objectives. A Fuzzy Logic Controller is designed to meet the driver demand so that the engine, motor and battery are as little exposed as possible to abrupt transitions. Smooth transitions are desired in the engine in order to decrease fuel consumption and emission of pollutants. Smooth transitions in the battery will lead to extended battery life. Simulation results verify that the controller achieves the design objectives. Because the design procedure is based on trial and error, optimality is not guaranteed.

This thesis addresses the development of a control scheme to maximize automobile fuel economy and battery state-of-charge (SOC) while meeting exhaust emission standards for parallel hybrid electric vehicles, which are an alternative to conventional passenger vehicles. The principle components of the drive train are a small internal combustion engine and an electric motor, both of them applying torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the parallel hybrid vehicle is modeled, and throttle angle, motor current and <b>brake</b> torque <b>command</b> chosen as the control inputs. A performance index describing the total fuel and battery charge used, as well as pollutants emitted over the federal drive cycle, is defined. The problem is to find the optimal control inputs, as a function of time, that minimize the performance index under the chosen drive cycle while satisfying lower and upper bounds on the controls as well as the torque command constraint, derived from the drive cycle speed that the vehicle must follow. The problem is formulated so that optimal control theory can be used by defining the Hamiltonian of the system and deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations. Four special cases for the control bounds which are of practical importance are considered. But, because of the complicated analytical derivatives, solving the general analytical problem is not tractable. The alternate approach that is chosen is a numerical optimization method that solves the constrained optimization problem using the Recursive Quadratic Programming Method.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the control allocation {{problem for a}} nonlinear over-actuated time-varying system where parameters a¢ ne in the actuator dynamics and actuator force model may be assumed unknown. Instead of optimizing the control allocation at each time instant, a dynamic approach is considered by constructing update-laws that represent asymptotically optimal allocation search and adaptation. A previous result on uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) of the equilibrium of cascaded time-varying systems, is in the thesis shown to also hold for closed (not necessarily compact) sets composed by set-stable subsystems of a cascade. In view of this result, the optimal control allocation approach is studied by using Lyapunov analysis for cascaded set-stable systems, and uniform global/local asymptotic stability is guaranteed for the sets described by; the system dynamics, the optimizing allocation update-law and the adaptive update-law. The performance of the proposed control allocation scheme is demon- strated throughout the thesis by simulations of a scaled-model ship manoeuvred at low-speed. Furthermore, {{the application of a}} yaw stabilization scheme for an automotive vehicle is presented. The stabilization strategy consists of; a high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tyre road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module. The control allocation module generates longitudinal slip reference for the low level <b>brake</b> controller and <b>commands</b> front wheel steering angle corrections, such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated by the high level module. The conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic nonlinear multi-body vehicle simulation environment.

In the vehicle model development, special efforts {{have been put in}} transmission shifting scheduling. Transmission up-shift and down-shift scheduling are separated in the modelling. Hysteresis during shifting is introduced to reduce chattering. A compression brake effect on transmission shifting is identified and considered in the modelling. The new transmission shifting model has been validated through experimental data. The transmission shifting model is combined with the compression brake model and the model of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics for a high-fidelity predictive simulation software tool. Power-width-modulation (PWM) actuation for brake coordination is proposed to further exploit the capacity of the compression brake and reduce the usage of service brake. Simulation results indicates that the PWM actuation strategy will have the same speed regulation performance as the direct torque split strategy, while the usage of the service brake is significantly reduced, and the compression brake can handle a down slope of - 4 when tracking a speed of 56 mile per hour. Simulation results also indicated the importance of vehicle mass and road grade estimation in controller performance. The estimation problem is addressed in detail next. In the third chapter, a recursive least square scheme with multiple forgetting factors is proposed for on-line estimation of road grade and vehicle mass. The estimated mass and grade can be used to robustify many automatic controllers in conventional or automated heavy-duty vehicles. We demonstrate with measured test data from the July 26 - 27, 2002 test dates in San Diego, CA, that the proposed scheme estimates mass within 5 % of its actual value and tracks grade with good accuracy. The experimental setup, signals, their source and their accuracy are discussed. Issues like lack of persistent excitations in certain parts of the run or difficulties of parameter tracking during gear shift are explained and suggestions to bypass these problems are made. In the final part of this work, an adaptive model predictive control scheme is designed for speed control of heavy vehicles. The controller coordinates use of compression brakes and service brakes on downhill slopes. The advantage of model predictive control (MPC) scheme over PI design is its ability to explicitly handle the constraints on service <b>brake</b> and compression <b>command.</b> MPC minimizes use of service brakes based on constrain optimization techniques. Given a perfect model, good performance was obtained in closedloop. We showed with simulation analysis that model uncertainties due to uncertainty in vehicle mass result in degraded and sometimes poor oscillatory closed-loop response. Unknown road disturbance (grade) was another limiting factor to the performance of the controller. It is shown that accurate estimate of mass is necessary for safe and comfortable operation in closed-loop. Also knowledge of the road grade can improve the results further by contributing in feedforward control. Therefore the estimation method presented in the third chapter of the report is used in parallel with the controller to update the estimates of mass and road grade. We show that adaptation allows robust speed tracking even if initial mass is 300 percent over or underestimated. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, full {{electric}} and hybrid electric vehicles {{have emerged as}} an alternative to conventional cars due to a range of factors, including environmental and economic aspects. These vehicles are the result of considerable efforts to seek ways of reducing the use of fossil fuel for vehicle propulsion. Sophisticated technologies such as hybrid and electric powertrains require careful study and optimization. Mathematical models play a key role at this point. Currently, many advanced mathematical analysis tools, as well as computer applications have been built for vehicle simulation purposes. Given the great interest of hybrid and electric powertrains, along with the increasing importance of reliable computer-based models, the author decided to integrate both aspects in the research purpose of this work. Furthermore, {{this is one of the}} first final degree projects held at the ETSII (Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineers) that covers the study of hybrid and electric propulsion systems. The present project is based on MBS 3 D 2. 0, a specialized software for the dynamic simulation of multibody systems developed at the UPM Institute of Automobile Research (INSIA). Automobiles are a clear example of complex multibody systems, which are present in nearly every field of engineering. The work presented here benefits from the availability of MBS 3 D software. This program has proven to be a very efficient tool, with a highly developed underlying mathematical formulation. On this basis, the focus of this project is the extension of MBS 3 D features in order to be able to perform dynamic simulations of hybrid and electric vehicle models. This requires the joint simulation of the mechanical model of the vehicle, together with the model of the hybrid or electric powertrain. These sub-models belong to completely different physical domains. In fact the powertrain consists of energy storage systems, electrical machines and power electronics, connected to purely mechanical components (wheels, suspension, transmission, clutch…). The challenge today is to create a global vehicle model that is valid for computer simulation. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to apply co-simulation methodologies to a comprehensive model of an electric vehicle, where sub-models from different areas of engineering are coupled. The created electric vehicle (EV) model consists of a separately excited DC electric motor, a Li-ion battery pack, a DC/DC chopper converter and a multibody vehicle model. Co-simulation techniques allow car designers to simulate complex vehicle architectures and behaviors, which are usually difficult to implement in a real environment due to safety and/or economic reasons. In addition, multi-domain computational models help to detect the effects of different driving patterns and parameters and improve the models in a fast and effective way. Automotive designers can greatly benefit from a multidisciplinary approach of new hybrid and electric vehicles. In this case, the global electric vehicle model includes an electrical subsystem and a mechanical subsystem. The electrical subsystem consists of three basic components: electric motor, battery pack and power converter. A modular representation is used for building the dynamic model of the vehicle drivetrain. This means that every component of the drivetrain (submodule) is modeled separately and has its own general dynamic model, with clearly defined inputs and outputs. Then, all the particular submodules are assembled according to the drivetrain configuration and, in this way, the power flow across the components is completely determined. Dynamic models of electrical components are often based on equivalent circuits, where Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws are applied to draw the algebraic and differential equations. Here, Randles circuit is used for dynamic modeling of the battery and the electric motor is modeled through the analysis of the equivalent circuit of a separately excited DC motor, where the power converter is included. The mechanical subsystem is defined by MBS 3 D equations. These equations consider the position, velocity and acceleration of all the bodies comprising the vehicle multibody system. MBS 3 D 2. 0 is entirely written in MATLAB and the structure of the program has been thoroughly studied and understood by the author. MBS 3 D software is adapted according to the requirements of the applied co-simulation method. Some of the core functions are modified, such as integrator and graphics, and several auxiliary functions are added in order to compute the mathematical model of the electrical components. By coupling and co-simulating both subsystems, it is possible to evaluate the dynamic interaction among all the components of the drivetrain. ‘Tight-coupling’ method is used to cosimulate the sub-models. This approach integrates all subsystems simultaneously and the results of the integration are exchanged by function-call. This means that the integration is done jointly for the mechanical and the electrical subsystem, under a single integrator and then, the speed of integration is determined by the slower subsystem. Simulations are then used to show the performance of the developed EV model. However, this project focuses more on the validation of the computational and mathematical tool for {{electric and}} hybrid vehicle simulation. For this purpose, a detailed study and comparison of different integrators within the MATLAB environment is done. Consequently, the main efforts are directed towards the implementation of co-simulation techniques in MBS 3 D software. In this regard, it is not intended to create an extremely precise EV model in terms of real vehicle performance, although an acceptable level of accuracy is achieved. The gap between the EV model and the real system is filled, in a way, by introducing the gas and brake pedals input, which reflects the actual driver behavior. This input is included directly in the differential equations of the model, and determines the amount of current provided to the electric motor. For a separately excited DC motor, the rotor current is proportional to the traction torque delivered to the car wheels. Therefore, as it occurs in the case of real vehicle models, the propulsion torque in the mathematical model is controlled through acceleration and <b>brake</b> pedal <b>commands.</b> The designed transmission system also includes a reduction gear that adapts the torque coming for the motor drive and transfers it. The main contribution of this project is, therefore, the implementation of a new calculation path for the wheel torques, based on performance characteristics and outputs of the electric powertrain model. Originally, the wheel traction and braking torques were input to MBS 3 D through a vector directly computed by the user in a MATLAB script. Now, they are calculated as a function of the motor current which, in turn, depends on the current provided by the battery pack across the DC/DC chopper converter. The motor and battery currents and voltages are the solutions of the electrical ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) system coupled to the multibody system. Simultaneously, the outputs of MBS 3 D model are the position, velocity and acceleration of the vehicle at all times. The motor shaft speed is computed from the output vehicle speed considering the wheel radius, the gear reduction ratio and the transmission efficiency. This motor shaft speed, somehow available from MBS 3 D model, is then introduced in the differential equations corresponding to the electrical subsystem. In this way, MBS 3 D and the electrical powertrain model are interconnected and both subsystems exchange values resulting as expected with tight-coupling approach. When programming mathematical models of complex systems, code optimization is a key step in the process. A way to improve the overall performance of the integration, making use of C/C++ as an alternative programming language, is described and implemented. Although this entails a higher computational burden, it leads to important advantages regarding cosimulation speed and stability. In order to do this, it is necessary to integrate MATLAB with another integrated development environment (IDE), where C/C++ code can be generated and executed. In this project, C/C++ files are programmed in Microsoft Visual Studio and the interface between both IDEs is created by building C/C++ MEX file functions. These programs contain functions or subroutines that can be dynamically linked and executed from MATLAB. This process achieves reductions in simulation time up to two orders of magnitude. The tests performed with different integrators, also reveal the stiff character of the differential equations corresponding to the electrical subsystem, and allow the improvement of the cosimulation process. When varying the parameters of the integration and/or the initial conditions of the problem, the solutions of the system of equations show better dynamic response and stability, depending on the integrator used. Several integrators, with variable and non-variable step-size, and for stiff and non-stiff problems are applied to the coupled ODE system. Then, the results are analyzed, compared and discussed. From all the above, the project can be divided into four main parts: 1. Creation of the equation-based electric vehicle model; 2. Programming, simulation and adjustment of the electric vehicle model; 3. Application of co-simulation methodologies to MBS 3 D and the electric powertrain subsystem; and 4. Code optimization and study of different integrators. Additionally, in order to deeply understand the context of the project, the first chapters include an introduction to basic vehicle dynamics, current classification of hybrid and electric vehicles and an explanation of the involved technologies such as brake energy regeneration, electric and non-electric propulsion systems for EVs and HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles) and their control strategies. Later, the problem of dynamic modeling of hybrid and electric vehicles is discussed. The integrated development environment and the simulation tool are also briefly described. The core chapters include an explanation of the major co-simulation methodologies and how they have been programmed and applied to the electric powertrain model together with the multibody system dynamic model. Finally, the last chapters summarize the main results and conclusions of the project and propose further research topics. In conclusion, co-simulation methodologies are applicable within the integrated development environments MATLAB and Visual Studio, and the simulation tool MBS 3 D 2. 0, where equation-based models of multidisciplinary subsystems, consisting of mechanical and electrical components, are coupled and integrated in a very efficient way...|$|R
