These numbers are continued along the other three Interstates that make up the turnpike, rather than numbering each Interstate individually, leading to discontinuous numbering on I-70—the exit numbers on tolled I-70 are much lower than those on free I-70.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside.

In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to , the River Road {{section of}} NY251 {{overlapped}} with NY35, which initially entered Monroe County {{on the former}} routing of legislative Route15 and continued north to Rochester on current NY383. The southwestern end of NY35 was moved to Mumford , shifting {{the location of the}} overlap to Main Street in Scottsville. The concurrency was replaced with one with NY383 when it supplanted most of NY35 in the early 1940s. On July 1, 1977, NY251 was truncated to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern end of its overlap with NY383 in Scottsville. The former routing of NY251 from the west end of the concurrency in Scottsville to Gates became an extension of NY386, which was a simple connector in northern Gates and southern Greece prior to the change.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, NJDOT {{announced}} that {{work on the}} $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 2013. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US1/9) would close for {{two years after the}} Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.|$|E

5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} {{as time went}} on. In the early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was truncated to end in Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was truncated to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

Notable locations the tour would appear in were the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, the Festhalle Frankfurt in Frankfurt, the Manchester Arena in Manchester and The O2 in Dublin. After the tickets of the European leg of the tour were sold-out, Shakira extended the tour into 2011 and announced a show {{to be held at}} the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, on 14 June. Later, Shakira decided to add another date to the Paris show of the tour and set 13 June to perform at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy. By 15 March, new tour dates were added at locations such as Croatia, Russia, Spain and Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The state built a bypass of the Valley Boulevard {{portion of}} the route in the early-to-mid-1930s, leaving the old road near Diamond Bar and heading {{northeast}} through the foothills, along the present freeway alignment and Mission Boulevard. To the south, the legislature added then-unrelated Route180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, connecting Route 2 (I-5) near the Santa Ana River with Route 175 (Orangethorpe Avenue, later replaced by SR 91) near Placentia. By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) near La Veta Avenue in Santa Ana and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to Pomona. The portion northeast of Diamond Bar into Pomona soon {{became part of the}} planned Pomona Freeway, {{and the name of the}} remainder was changed to Orange Freeway. The state legislature altered the definition of Route19 to reflect this in 1957 by moving its south end to Santa Ana.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{management}} of Webb, who was offered the post while awaiting repatriation from a German prisoner-of-war camp, the club joined the Football League in 1920, when a Third Division was formed from the Southern League First Division of the preceding season. Between the wars, Albion finished regularly in {{the top half of}} the Third Division South, but saved their best form for the FA Cup, eliminating numerous First Division sides from the competition. In the 1922–23 season, they were drawn to play the amateur club Corinthian in that club's first ever match in the FA Cup competition. Interest was such that the game was filmed for cinematic release, and Brighton's eventual victory, in a second replay at Chelsea's ground, Stamford Bridge, was watched by a Monday-afternoon crowd of 45,000. Ten years later, an administrative oversight meant they failed to apply for exemption to the later rounds of the FA Cup, so had to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first qualifying round, progressing through eight rounds to the last 16 of the competition before losing to West Ham United after a replay.|$|E

5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of her internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where {{they might be able to}} live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E
