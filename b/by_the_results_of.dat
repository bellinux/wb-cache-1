The starting order for Training is defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the last year's Red Bull Air Race World Championship standings. The highest ranking pilot starts first. Starting order for new race pilots is determined by a draw. The starting order for Qualifying is defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the fourth training session. The order is reversed so that the slowest pilot from the fourth training session starts first. The starting order for all sessions on Race Day is determined by the results in Qualifying.

5|$|The air pistol {{event was}} {{introduced}} on the World Championship level in 1970, {{and on the}} Olympic programme in 1988.

5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

25|$|The {{delegate}} allocation to the Democratic National Convention was as follows: 29 district delegates proportionally {{represented a}} candidate's support at each congressional district.

25|$|Any {{votes cast}} for a {{candidate}} that {{did not meet the}} 15% threshold for votes will be discarded. 14 district delegates will be proportionally allocated to each viable presidential candidate based on the primary's results in each Congressional District. All of the district delegates are considered pledged delegates, which means that they must openly commit to a candidate before the vote and are subject to review by the candidate they represent. Both the First Congressional District and Second Congressional District are allocated 7 district delegates each. These delegates independently represent each Congressional District; they are not affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the entire state.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time {{quite a number of}} the Russians of Latvia viewed the revival of the Latvian state system with mistrust.
