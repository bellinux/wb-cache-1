25|$|Fate {{generally}} implies {{there is}} a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to determinism, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance theological determinism). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.|$|E

50|$|As for the King of Hokuzan, the Veritable Records {{record the}} un-Okinawan-looking names of three kings, Haniji, Min and Han'anchi, <b>but</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of their blood relations. The last {{diplomatic}} contact of Hokuzan was of 1416.|$|R
50|$|The Vaisheshika Sutras {{mention the}} doctrines of {{competing}} schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa, <b>but</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of Buddhism, {{which has led}} scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th to 2nd century BCE.|$|R
25|$|Motivation. The {{conclusions}} of the report do not consider the motivations of the abusers; although {{the inclusion of a}} financial report by the accountancy firm of Mazars, and various financial references combine to create an impression of financial motivation, this is not discussed or challenged. The report refers to, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> attempt to explain, the enthusiasm of the judiciary and the ISPCC for incarcerating children.|$|E
25|$|Only when very {{particular}} conditions obtain can legitimate inferences {{be drawn from}} silence in contemporary sources. The doubtful relevance of silence as to the Gudalupe event in certain documents {{from the time of}} Zumárraga has already been noted under section 6.2.2 above, and Miguel Sánchez himself preached a sermon in 1653 on the Immaculate Conception in which he cites chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|Mary Joan Winn Leith in The Oxford History of the Biblical World {{believes}} that Ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture {{and given a}} theological buildup. Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the 'father of Judaism' in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the presentation style of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor {{on the one hand}} and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of Ezra.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> pretense {{at being}} like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely {{for the fun}} of watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{disagree}} {{on the details of}} Reynolds' death, including the specific time (either 10:15a.m. or 10:4010:50a.m.), the exact location (on East McPherson Ridge, near the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry, or West McPherson Ridge, near the 19th Indiana), and the source of the bullet (a Confederate infantryman, a Confederate sharpshooter, or friendly fire). One primary source was Sergeant Charles Henry Veil, his orderly and unit Color Guard, who described the events in a letter in 1864 and then contradicted some of the details in another letter 45 years later. A letter from Reynolds' sister, Jennie, stated that the wound had a downward trajectory from the neck, implying that he was shot from above, presumably a sharpshooter in a tree or barn. Historians Bruce Catton and Glenn Tucker make firm assertions that a sharpshooter was responsible; Stephen Sears credits volley fire from the 7th Tennessee against the 2nd Wisconsin; Edwin Coddington cites the sister's letter and finds the sharpshooter theory to be partly credible, but leans towards Sears' conclusion; Harry W. Pfanz agrees that the location was behind the 2nd Wisconsin, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> judgment about the source of the fire. Steve Sanders, writing in Gettysburg magazine, suggested the possibility of friendly fire based on some accounts, and concludes that it is as equally likely as enemy fire.|$|E
500|$|While George Buchanan (ca. 1579) also {{mentions}} {{the battle in}} his work Rerum Scotarum Historia, his account borrows liberally from Boece. Boece {{is thought to have}} based much of his work on John of Fordun's, Chronica Gentis Scotorum (ca. 1360). Fordun briefly mentions a battle at Mortlach <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of any at Barry: ...|$|E
50|$|French, Italian and Spanish sources, however, {{acknowledge}} the captivity (1540) and liberation (1544) of Turgut Reis, <b>but</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> {{mention of the}} captivity of Salih Reis. It is probable that the close friendship between Salih Reis and Turgut Reis and their numerous joint operations may have possibly caused a confusion.|$|R

500|$|For Underwood's plan to work, however, Claire has {{to pardon}} him and Stamper, which would damage her {{credibility}} with the public. Claire promises him that she will grant the pardons, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of them during her first {{address to the nation}} as president. Angered, Underwood calls her several times, but each time he gets her voicemail, causing him to worry that she has abandoned him. He breaks the fourth wall and says, [...] "If she doesn't pardon me, I'll kill her." ...|$|E
500|$|In the subplot, the {{relationship}} between Bart and his friend Milhouse has changed. On the bus ride to school, Bart is upset to discover that Milhouse had held a birthday party without inviting him. It turns out that Milhouse's mother, Luann, thinks Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse and has banned him from seeing Bart, a decision Milhouse is downbeat about <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> effort to defy. Suddenly deprived of his friend, a depressed Bart resorts to playing with Maggie. When Marge finds out about the situation, she decides to visit Luann. Marge admits that Bart is a [...] "bit of a handful," [...] and she explains that he and Milhouse are best friends and only have each other, so she asks Luann to allow the boys to play together. Later, Milhouse invites Bart over to his house, and Bart thanks Marge for standing up for him.|$|E

2500|$|Riesz uses {{a similar}} {{reasoning}} in his Note, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> explicit mention to the completeness of L2, although his result {{may be interpreted}} this way. He says that integrating term by term a trigonometric series with given square summable coefficients, he gets a series converging uniformly to a continuous [...] function Fthinsp& with bounded variation. The derivative fthinsp& of F, defined almost everywhere, is square summable and has for Fourier coefficients the given coefficients.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year Kate Cranston {{provided}} temporary [...] "Exhibition Cafes" [...] at the Scottish International Exhibition, apparently set up and designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, though nothing is now known of his scheme for this. The menu card designed by Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh shows the name for the tearooms, The White Cockade, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> visual connection with this reference to Jacobitism. It gives credit for supply of cakes to Miss Cranstons Bakery, 292 St Vincent St., Glasgow.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} dated Charleston, January 4, 1765, he {{mentions}} Lord Adam Gordon being present, and {{his interest in}} botanical matters. John Gordon and Lord Adam Gordon {{seem to have been}} related, perhaps as cousins by their descent through the Gordons of Aberdeenshire. However, an entry Lord Adam made at Charlestown on 9 December 1764, in a notebook he kept on his tour of the British American colonies, refers to John Gordon, Esq., as his [...] "worthy landlord and friend", <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of such a familial relationship, although it takes notice of John Gordon's two daughters.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-18th century, {{more than}} a dozen Cherokee villages—known as the Overhill towns—were {{scattered}} along the lower [...] of the Little Tennessee River, among them the villages of Chota and Tanasi. [...] The village of Mialoquo, the lowermost of the Overhill towns, was located about [...] upstream from Bussell Island. [...] Harrington's excavations on Bussell Island uncovered numerous Cherokee graves—identified by the graves' [...] "rectangular" [...] shape and the presence of European trade goods such as glass beads—although no known major Cherokee villages were located on the island. Henry Timberlake, who traveled up the Little Tennessee in 1761 on a peace mission, met a Cherokee head man named Slave Catcher near the mouth of the Little Tennessee, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of the island.|$|E
2500|$|What {{this makes}} {{clear is that}} {{there are two ways to}} {{describe}} such a screen, (1) the [...] "commonsense" [...] one, in which publicly recognizable objects are mentioned, and (2) an accurate point-by-point account of the actual state of the field, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of what any passer-by would or would not make of it. This second description would be non-epistemic from the common sense point of view, since no objects are mentioned in the print-out, but perfectly acceptable from the engineer's point of view. Note that, if one carries this analysis across to human sensing and perceiving, this rules out Daniel Dennett's claim that all qualiaphiles must regard qualia as [...] "ineffable", for at this second level they are in principle quite [...] "effable"—indeed, it is not ruled out that some neurophysiologist of the future might be able to describe the neural detail of qualia at this level.|$|E
2500|$|Chilhowee doesn't appear {{among the}} Overhill towns until the mid-18th century, {{although}} its neighbors Citico and Tallassee {{appear in the}} earliest English records of the region. [...] Colonel George Chicken, who visited the Overhill towns in 1725 in hopes of cementing an alliance against the Creeks, met at the Tanasi townhouse with the head men of Tanasi, Citico, Tallassee, Great Tellico, and [...] "Coosaw." [...] George Hunter's map of the Overhill country shows Tallassee, Citico, Tanasi, and Great Tellico, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of Chilhowee. [...] Henry Timberlake visited Chilhowee on a peace mission in 1761 and engaged in a pipe-smoking ceremony with the town's head men, but didn't elaborate. [...] Timberlake's [...] "Draught of the Cherokee Country" [...] shows 18 dwellings and a townhouse at Chilhowee, and lists Yachtino as the town's headman. [...] The 110 warriors reportedly residing at Chilhowee represented the third largest fighting contingent among the Overhill towns, behind only Citico and Chota.|$|E
