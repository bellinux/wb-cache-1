25|$|A {{roller coaster}} decade {{continued}} for the franchise as the 1987–88 season {{began with the}} team changing its name back to the Centennials. The hockey club also returned to their red, black, and white colour scheme. On the ice, the team's record improved by 15 wins and they finished {{with a record of}} 25–27–0. The point total of 50 was good enough for fourth in the Interior Division, just eight points behind the second place Kelowna Packers. Frank <b>Biller,</b> Al Rushton, and Cal McGowan led the team offensively. <b>Biller</b> posted 57 goals and 49 assists for 106 points, sixth overall in the BCJHL. Rushton chipped in with 87 points and McGowan ended up with 79 points, both good enough to be amongst the top eight scorers in the Interior Division. In the post season, the Cents suffered their third straight series sweep in the first round, this time it was against the first place Vernon Lakers.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the adoption of}} electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) technology. EBPP continues to grow and will become a multibillion dollar e-commerce industry. The technology adoption configuration {{in this context is}} quite interesting because it involves four stakeholders: <b>billers,</b> bill consolidators, banks, and consumers. Banks and bill consolidators compete to act as an intermediary between <b>billers</b> and consumers. Network externalities play a significant role: the more <b>billers</b> that adopt the technology, the more consumers are willing to use the services. Our analysis is based on the welfare economics concept of finding the socially optimum adoption configuration and the resulting adoption pattern in a market with sponsored technologies. The results show that due to network externalities, <b>billers</b> are more likely to adopt the existing technology early, though the next technology might be superior to the current one. When the higher costs of early adoption are taken into account, the model shows that <b>billers</b> are more willing to wait, ceteris paribus. Our results also show that anticipation of a new and better, but compatible, technology might cause <b>billers</b> to wait, depending on what benefits they expect by adopting early, and how much cost they anticipate to incur upgrading their technology later...|$|R

[...] However, Piller said that [...] "I don't think the teaser works at all." [...] <b>Biller</b> {{received}} so many notes on the script that he began to feel as though the experience were an audition. [...] After rewriting the script, Taylor expressed his pleasure with Biller's technical descriptions within the script and asked if <b>Biller</b> had a science background; ironically, <b>Biller</b> had instead attended Brown University specifically to avoid taking science courses—the technical details were all made up. The day after presenting the rewrite, Taylor asked <b>Biller</b> to join the Voyager writing staff. [...] <b>Biller</b> had been unaware of the vacancy, having come on board for the $15,000 fee and expecting nothing more. [...] Though initially reluctant, <b>Biller</b> took Taylor's offer for the [...] "opportunity to write television that was about something."

"Tuvix" [...] was {{formerly}} known as [...] "Untitled Tuvok/Neelix", [...] "One", and [...] "Symbiogenesis", with the third of these persisting through the episode's development and shooting. [...] The episode and its teleplay were written by Kenneth Biller; the story is credited to Andrew Shepard Price and Mark Gaberman. [...] Though described by <b>Biller</b> as [...] "high-concept", the original story by Price and Gaberman was much more light-hearted and tended more towards slapstick. [...] <b>Biller</b> and Brannon Braga felt {{the tone of the}} episode was so akin to a 1960s sitcom, the two of them even wrote a theme song for it. [...] <b>Biller</b> re-wrote the episode to focus more on the serious philosophical questions raised by the episode and especially the inevitable separation of Tuvix back into the series regulars. [...] In Biller's original treatment, Tuvix recognized that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and consented to his fissure. [...] However, after a discussion with executive producer Michael Piller, <b>Biller</b> began to [...] at the audience" [...] by throwing up roadblocks to the episode's foregone conclusion; first Tuvix was re-written to object to the procedure and then 's refusal was added to force Captain Janeway to put truth to action.

500|$|<b>Biller</b> {{incorporated}} the Vidiians into the episode, believing that their technology would present a conceivable {{method by which}} Torres could be separated.

He looked to Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying antagonists in the Star Trek franchise: [...] "liens should never be patently evil.

500|$|<b>Biller</b> and {{executive}} producer Jeri Taylor were critical of Glassner's pitch; <b>Biller</b> {{found it to be}} [...] "very melodramatic and hokey", and Taylor called it [...] "a tired idea" [...] and [...] "too on the nose for B'Elanna." [...] Producer Brannon Braga explained that the decision to purchase the concept was to do a storyline involving an evil twin in the show's first season, and [...] "get it out of the way." [...] He did feel that the concept could be a mistake, and compared it negatively to a hypothetical storyline in which [...] character Data (Brent Spiner) would be made human. Piller said the episode was almost abandoned, but he believed that the conflict between Torres' human and Klingon halves, and her identity as a woman, would make a worthwhile storyline.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Michael Piller was displeased {{with the}} depiction of the Kazon in Biller's first draft of the episode; where {{they were supposed to}} be analogous to street gangs in Los Angeles, they were instead [...] "coming across as warmed-over Klingons." [...] In addition to Jari Taylor's already extensive notes on the draft, Piller suggested <b>Biller</b> get in touch with actual gang members or a police officer who could better clue the writer into street gang culture for the episode. [...] Instead, <b>Biller</b> picked up a copy of Monsta, a book by convicted murderer and former gang member [...] "Monsta" [...] Cody.
