40|$|Abstract Background T-cells are {{key players}} in {{regulating}} a specific immune response. Activation of cytotoxic T-cells requires recognition of specific peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. MHC-peptide complexes are potential tools for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} pathogens and cancer, {{as well as for the}} development of peptide vaccines. Only one in 100 to 200 potential binders actually binds to a certain MHC molecule, therefore a good prediction method for MHC class I <b>binding</b> <b>peptides</b> can reduce the number of candidate binders that need to be synthesized and tested. Results Here, we present a novel approach, SVMHC, based on support vector machines to predict the <b>binding</b> of <b>peptides</b> to MHC class I molecules. This method seems to perform slightly better than two profile based methods, SYFPEITHI and HLA_BIND. The implementation of SVMHC is quite simple and does not involve any manual steps, therefore as more data become available it is trivial to provide prediction for more MHC types. SVMHC currently contains prediction for 26 MHC class I types from the MHCPEP database or alternatively 6 MHC class I types from the higher quality SYFPEITHI database. The prediction models for these MHC types are implemented in a public web service available at [URL]. Conclusions Prediction of MHC class I <b>binding</b> <b>peptides</b> using Support Vector Machines, shows high performance and is easy to apply to a large number of MHC class I types. As more peptide data are put into MHC databases, SVMHC can easily be updated to give prediction for additional MHC class I types.

Finally, we use three scoring functions to predict binding cores and evaluate the accuracy of prediction to judge performance of each scoring function. In the experiment, we set a parameter α in the weight formula. By changing α value, we can observe different performances of each scoring function. We compare our method with the best function to some popular prediction methods and ultimately find that our method outperforms them in identifying binding cores of HLA-DR molecules...|$|R
40|$|Predictive {{models of}} peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binding {{affinity}} are important components of modern computational immunovaccinology. Here, {{we describe the}} development and deployment of a reliable peptide-binding prediction method for a previously poorly-characterized human MHC class I allele, HLA-Cw* 0102. Using an in-house, flow cytometry-based MHC stabilization assay we generated novel <b>peptide</b> <b>binding</b> data, from which we derived a precise two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2 D-QSAR) binding model. This allowed us to explore the peptide specificity of HLA-Cw* 0102 molecule in detail. We used this model to design peptides optimized for HLA-Cw* 0102 -binding. Experimental analysis showed these peptides to have high binding affinities for the HLA-Cw* 0102 molecule. As a functional validation of our approach, we also predicted HLA-Cw* 0102 -binding peptides within the HIV- 1 genome, identifying a set of potent <b>binding</b> <b>peptides.</b> The most affine of these <b>binding</b> <b>peptides</b> was subsequently determined to be an epitope recognized in a subset of HLA-Cw* 0102 -positive individuals chronically infected with HIV- 1. A functionally-validated in silico-in vitro approach to the reliable and efficient prediction of <b>peptide</b> <b>binding</b> to a previously uncharacterized human MHC allele HLA-Cw* 0102 was developed. This technique is generally applicable to all T cell epitope identification problems in immunology and vaccinology...|$|R
