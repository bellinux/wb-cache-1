5|$|In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager Les McDowall {{introduced}} a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which {{became known as the}} Revie Plan after Don Revie who played centre-forward. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the <b>ball</b> <b>as</b> far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.|$|E

5|$|After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford {{went to work}} on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} one sack later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the <b>ball,</b> <b>as</b> had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a trick play. At the snap, quarterback Sean Glennon lateraled the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal threw the ball downfield, catching the Georgia defense off guard. Tight end Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left uncovered by a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran unimpeded 53yards for a touchdown. The play took 19seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.|$|E
