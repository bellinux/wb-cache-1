5|$|Crocodylomorphs are {{abundant}} in the Mussentuchit deposits, being represented largely by teeth. The largest known teeth have <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> to the Pholidosauridae; they are broad with rounded bases, {{and some of them}} bear longitudinal ridges. These large crocodilians would have been capable of preying upon at least juvenile Eolambia at the water's edge. The abundance of juvenile Eolambia specimens in the lakeside fossil material supports this hypothesis; larger Eolambia would have been invulnerable to crocodilians. Smaller crocodilian teeth are also present, with two distinct morphotypes: an ovoid form bearing ridges, which has <b>been</b> <b>referred</b> to two different species of Bernissartia; and a compressed, triangular form bearing heavy ornamentation, which has been attributed to the Atoposauridae. However, given the uniform small size of these teeth, and the co-occurrence of these morphotypes in some crocodilians, they may belong to the same species.|$|E
