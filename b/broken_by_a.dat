5|$|The current {{record of}} 2013 will be {{considered}} as provisional, {{until the end of}} 2013 which the ISSF will decide whether to scrap the final record altogether from then on, or keep them. The final score is added to the qualification score with the aggregate deciding the final ranking. Any post-final ties are <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single extra shot.|$|E
5|$|During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), {{some one}} hundred Russian ciphers were <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who {{included}} army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics — Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army staffs were still {{following the same}} disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.|$|E
5|$|North of Mount Tom and the Holyoke Range, the {{apparent}} {{crest of the}} Metacomet Ridge is <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> discontinuity in the once dominant traprock strata. Underlying sedimentary layers remain but lack the same profile. Between the Holyoke Range and the Pocumtuck Ridge, a stretch of , the Metacomet Ridge exists only {{as a series of}} mostly nondescript rises set among flat plains of sedimentary bedrock. Mount Warner, , in Hadley, Massachusetts, the only significant peak in the area, is a geologically unrelated metamorphic rock landform that extends west into the sedimentary strata.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>a</b> {{momentary}} pause, <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> oath from Mr. Gooch, who {{was still}} undergoing treatment in the background.|$|R
50|$|The final {{was held}} on 27 June, with a {{round-robin}} among the final 8 fencers. Ties were <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> extra bout.|$|R
5000|$|Intramolecular transesterification, {{resulting}} in a branched polypeptide. In inteins, the new ester bond is <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> intramolecular attack <b>by</b> the soon-to-be C-terminal asparagine.|$|R
5|$|The {{next season}} began badly for Kippax. Playing {{in a minor}} match at Parkes (in rural NSW) on a matting wicket, he had his nose <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{delivery}} that bounced erratically — it hit a peg accidentally left under the mat when it was laid out. On 6 November 1931, during NSW’s first match of the season at Brisbane, he was struck a severe blow to the temple by a rising ball from fast bowler Pud Thurlow. Taken to hospital, {{he retired from the}} match, but was selected for the first Test against South Africa, but scored only one run. He missed the second Test through injury, while his replacement Keith Rigg scored an impressive century on debut.|$|E
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the plunger. Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> conveniently placed pipe.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and caving in dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bullet.|$|E

60|$|The {{silence was}} <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{uncontrollable}} burst of laughter from Miss Trevor. She was quickly frowned down by her father, who reminded {{her that this}} was not a comedy.|$|R
50|$|The final was {{conducted}} on 29 May. The format was a round-robin among the top 8 fencers. Ties were <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> extra bout (ignoring the head-to-head results of the fencers during the round-robin).|$|R
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, General Sir Ian Hamilton, now decided to make his main effort at Cape Helles. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, was ordered to send a brigade from each of his two divisions to Helles to reinforce the British and French troops there. McCay's brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade were chosen. They embarked for Helles on 6 May. On the evening of 8 May, during the Second Battle of Krithia, McCay was given 35 minutes notice to conduct an advance across open ground in broad daylight. McCay protested that there was insufficient time to organise this but was overruled by Hamilton. The brigade suffered heavily. McCay led his men from the front, driving them on despite the futility of the attack. All of his staff were killed or wounded, and McCay's leg was <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bullet. The advance was also pointless, for {{it could have been}} conducted after dark without loss. As a result, his men regarded him as responsible for their fate.|$|E
5|$|The hilly {{area around}} Aarhus {{consists}} of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> complex system of tunnel valleys. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the Egå Valley to the north, with the stream of Egåen, the bog of Geding-Kasted Mose and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, {{but in the early}} 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene (57 to 24 million years ago).|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, a scissile bond is a covalent {{chemical bond}} {{that can be}} <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> enzyme. Examples would be the cleaved bond in the self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme or the peptide bond of <b>a</b> substrate cleaved <b>by</b> <b>a</b> peptidase.|$|R
50|$|Somers was {{a member}} of a U.S. team that set a new world record of 8:17.0 in the 4×200-meter {{freestyle}} relay on July 23, 1960; the record was <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> Australian relay team less than a month later.|$|R

25|$|A camera operator's {{foot was}} <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> heavy dolly during one {{intensive}} take, {{and he was}} gagged (to stop his vocal noises from being recorded on the film) and hauled out of the studio so that filming could continue without interruption.|$|E
25|$|An unmodified {{production}} F8F-1 set a 1946 time-to-climb record (after {{a run of}} 115ft/35m) of 10,000ft (3,048m) in 94 seconds (6,383 fpm). The Bearcat {{held this}} record for 10 years until it was <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> jet fighter (which still could not match the Bearcat's short takeoff distance).|$|E
60|$|I {{shall never}} forget those furtive visits. The intense {{stillness of the}} night, <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{occasional}} rustling in the grass or the hedge; {{the smell of the}} flowers in the garden beyond; the distant drone of the sea.|$|R

25|$|However, these {{criteria}} would not apply if two teams tied on points and goals scored played {{against each other}} in their final group match and no other team in group finishes with same points; in that case, the tie would be <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> penalty shootout.|$|E
25|$|The {{advance of}} the British was <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{counter-attack}} of the Batavian hussars under Colonel Quaita. This turned the tide in the battle. The Anglo-Russian troops in their turn now broke and retreated in disorder to Bakkum and Limmen, pursued by the Franco-Batavian cavalry. Only the quickly falling darkness ended the slaughter.|$|E
25|$|Kendall Bell: The Kendall Bell, now {{housed in}} Bayless Plaza, is {{traditionally}} rung by graduating seniors {{upon completion of}} their last final exam at the university.

50|$|Silicon antifuses are {{connections}} {{that are made}} <b>by</b> applying <b>a</b> voltage across a modified area of silicon inside the chip. They are called antifuses because they work in the opposite way to normal fuses, which begin life as connections until they are <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electric current.|$|R
25|$|He {{joined a}} Venetian {{regiment}} at Corfu, his stay being <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> brief trip to Constantinople, ostensibly {{to deliver a}} letter from his former master the Cardinal. He found his advancement too slow and his duty boring, and he managed to lose most of his pay playing faro. Casanova soon abandoned his military career and returned to Venice.|$|E
25|$|Louis Jammet, {{owner of}} the famous French Jammet Restaurants longest serving in restauranters in Ireland died in a Portobello nursing home. There was a {{diplomatic}} incident with the French embassy {{when one of his}} restaurants on Nassau street had several windows <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> group of Radical Irish Nationalists on the outbreak of Victory in Europe Day.|$|E
25|$|High {{winds are}} a disagreeable {{characteristic}} of the weather, particularly during the winter and spring, and wind shifts are sudden and pronounced. A winter warm spell can be abruptly <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> strong pampero, a chilly and occasionally violent wind blowing north from the Argentine pampas. Summer winds off the ocean, however, have the salutary effect of tempering warm daytime temperatures.|$|E

50|$|The {{degeneracy}} in {{a quantum}} mechanical {{system may be}} removed if the underlying symmetry is <b>broken</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> external perturbation. This causes splitting in the degenerate energy levels. This is essentially a splitting of the original irreducible representations into lower-dimensional such representations of the perturbed system.|$|R
