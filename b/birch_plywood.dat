5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded <b>birch</b> <b>plywood,</b> {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E

25|$|Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most {{commonly}} manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded {{together in a}} hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and <b>birch</b> <b>plywood</b> but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured {{to a number of}} specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.|$|E
25|$|The de Havilland Albatross {{airliner}} of 1936 had a fuselage {{of wooden}} sandwich construction: wafers of <b>birch</b> <b>plywood</b> were spaced apart by a balsa sheet. This same construction achieved fame with its wartime {{use in the}} Mosquito fast bomber. As well as being a construction of light weight and high performance, it also avoided the use of aluminium, a strategic material during wartime, and could use the skills of woodworkers, rather than those of specialised aircraft metalworkers. When Germany attempted to copy this aircraft as the Moskito it was a failure, primarily for materials reasons. The original phenolic Tego film adhesive was only produced by a factory that was destroyed by bombing. Its replacement led directly to catastrophic failures and loss of the aircraft.|$|E

The floor had a 12mm Xyligen Basileum treated Finnish <b>Birch</b> combi <b>plywood</b> floor on the lower deck and both decks a non-slip flooring. Electrical features were the fluorescent light on the bus' ceilings, and twin circular halogen headlights. Also, CCTV was available.

The oval-shaped, semi-monocoque fuselage was made of 'shpon', molded <b>birch</b> <b>plywood.</b> The wings were also covered with 'shpon'. The upper wing had two spars, but the lower wing only had one. Internal bracing wires were not used in the wings as it was built up from plywood ribs with large lightening holes and stringers.

An airfoil enclosed the axle of the fixed undercarriage and a small ski served as a tailskid. It had an imported [...] Napier Lion engine enclosed in a metal cowling.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study was}} an {{analysis}} of the potential to shorten pressing time or reduce pressing temperature for plywood resinated with alcohol- and ester-modified PF resin. <b>Birch</b> and pine <b>plywoods</b> were produced using such modified resin at a temperature range of 135 to  115 [*]°C, at a constant pressing time (4  min) and at pressing times ranging from  240 to 150  s at a constant pressing temperature (135 [*]°C). Tests showed that the application of PF resin modified with polyols and esters makes it possible, under standard pressing conditions, i. e. 135 [*]°C and pressing time of 4  min, to produce plywood with improved properties in comparison to respective control plywoods. Moreover, it was shown that the used modifiers enhance resin reactivity, facilitating an adequate course of resin curing, resulting in the manufacture of plywoods with good properties even at a pressing temperature reduced by  20 [*]°C or pressing time shortened to 150  s...|$|R
40|$|Current paper {{deals with}} {{stiffness}} optimisation of silver <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula) <b>plywood</b> rib stiffened hollow core sandwich panels. Such a structural solution has several advantages over conventional plywood boards - weight and material savings {{are just some}} of them. However hollow core panels demand special attention to accurate structural design for selected loading scenarios. In order to acquire mechanical behaviour of plywood boards and rib-stiffened panels the ANSYS finite element (FE) calculation code has been employed linked with predefined design of computer experiments. Based on acquired mechanical responses from FE analysis metamodelling technique has been implemented to optimise cross-section parameters of rib stiffened panels. Optimisation results demonstrated that such a strategy allows to obtain an optimum solutions and to substitute conventional thick plywood boards (h> 30 mm) with equivalently stiff hollow core sandwich alternative. This could be of particular interest for applications where bending is dominating load case and structure span length is at least 20 times larger than thickness. In such a case weight reduction of plywood hollow-core panels may reach up to 45 %, comparing with conventional plywood boards. Experimental validation of obtained optimal designs confirmed the match between load/deflection curves among conventional and equivalent rib stiffened panel designs. Some slight stiffness deviations observed in tests are mainly caused by geometrical intolerances included in manufactured prototypes...|$|R

500|$|The I-185, {{designed}} in early 1940, {{was based on}} the I-180, which was itself a development of the I-16, but was virtually a new design. The monocoque fuselage was similarly built of 'shpon', molded <b>birch</b> <b>plywood,</b> and also had an integral fin, but it was considerably longer than that of the I-180. The two-spar, all-metal wing was smaller and thinner than the I-180's wing, nearly as thin as that of the Supermarine Spitfire's wing at 13% at the root and tapered to 8% at the wing tip. The wing had a NACA-230 profile and was skinned in duralumin. Pneumatically powered split flaps and leading edge slats were fitted. The outer wing panels had 3° of dihedral. The fabric-covered control surfaces were framed in duralumin. The protected [...] fuel tanks were mounted between the wing center section spars. The I-185 used a conventional undercarriage with a retractable tailwheel. The unproven 1,492kW (2,000hp) 18-cylinder, two-row Tumansky M-90 radial engine was carried on welded steel tubes. It was fitted with a ducted spinner to improve cooling with the air expelled through gills as in the I-180 to provide additional thrust. The synchronized armament was mounted in the fuselage, two [...] ShKAS machine guns and two [...] Berezin UBS machine guns. A [...] bomb could be carried under overload conditions. The first prototype was completed in May 1940, but the only available example of the M-90 did not provide enough power for take-off. The prototype was modified to use another experimental engine, the [...] Shvetsov M-81 radial, but this was not nearly powerful enough for flight tests. The I-185 (M-81) finally took to the air on January 11, 1941, but it was decided not to waste further development and await a more powerful engine which was fortunate as the M-81 was cancelled in May 1941.|$|E

The duralumin slotted flaps were electrically powered and ran the length of the wing center section, divided by the engine nacelles. Automatic leading edge slats were mounted on the outer panels. All control surfaces were built from wood and covered in fabric. The tailplane had 7° dihedral with twin fins. It had a duralumin structure and was covered in 'shpon'. The main gears of the conventional undercarriage retracted aft into the rear of the engine nacelles and the tail wheel retracted into the rear fuselage. Six protected fuel tanks were in the wing center section, plus four more in the outer wings. They had a total capacity of [...] (including oil).
