25|$|The stencil {{duplicator}} or mimeograph machine is a low-cost printing press that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Once prepared, the stencil is {{wrapped around the}} ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Thomas Alva Edison invented the mimeograph in 1875.|$|E
500|$|Mania.com's Chris Beveridge {{noted that}} {{character}} development between Yuuji and Ai was not consistent. [...] "Yuuji {{comes across as}} little more than a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> for the most part with just the scribble of [...] "angst" [...] on him", Beveridge observed. Overall, Gonzo's experimentation with computer animation [...] "look highly fake and out of place".|$|E

500|$|Phillip Leslie Wilcher {{was born}} on 16 March 1958 to Naomi Joy Thompson (8 April 1929 – 21 June 2005) and Leslie James Wilcher (born 16 January 1923), a World War II veteran. Wilcher grew up in Camperdown. As of 2004, he resided in Concord and owns no cell phone, watch, computer, or car: [...] "My entire life since I was a boy was writing music and that has overshadowed everything. [...] I would be happy living in an {{oversized}} cardboard box with a piano and a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> of manuscript paper".|$|E
500|$|According to Jockie, one of {{the main}} reasons that Chrisye was chosen to record [...] "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" [...] was that he had a unique voice with a soft timbre, which went well with the {{keyboards}} used; Jockie, however, felt that Chrisye's voice lost its dynamics when mixed with mellow music, which led him to give their collaboration Jurang Pemisah more of a rock feel. Gutawa compared Chrisye's voice to a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper, able to be applied to anything. Sys NS wrote in 2007 that he had been looking for [...] "someone with the voice of an angel" [...] to sing [...] "Lilin-Lilin Kecil", and in his opinion Chrisye fitted the role perfectly.|$|E
500|$|The {{partnership}} between Garran and Hughes is regarded {{by some as}} unusual, given that Garran was [...] "tall, gentlemanly, wise and scholarly", and patient with his staff, whereas Hughes was [...] "short of stature [...] renowned for bursts of temper." [...] Nevertheless, the partnership was a successful one, with Hughes recognising the importance of Garran's constitutional expertise, remarking once about the World War I period that [...] "the best way to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at [...] elbow, with a fountain pen and a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper, and the War Precautions Act." [...] Likewise, Garran respected Hughes' strong leadership style, which had been important in guiding the country through the war, although in describing the Nationalist Party's loss in the 1922 federal election, Garran later said that [...] "Hughes also overestimated his own hold on Parliament [...] his hold on the people was probably undiminished." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have seen}} the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and [...] "believes in a life after death", {{subsequently}} returning to his personal heaven.

2500|$|Lin {{became one}} of the most senior {{military}} field commanders within the Jiangxi Soviet. He commanded the First Army Group, and achieved a degree of power comparable to that of Peng Dehuai, who commanded the Third Army Group. According to Comintern representative Otto Braun, Lin was [...] "politically... a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> on which Mao could write as he pleased" [...] during this period. After Mao was removed from power in 1932 by his rivals (the 28 Bolsheviks), Lin frequently attended strategic meetings in Mao's name and openly attacked the plans of Mao's enemies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, Mead {{signed for}} Southampton for one season {{to assist the}} club's reserve team as a useful inside-forward, {{but he had no}} {{intention}} of taking up football as a full-time occupation. On 21 December 1907, he was at Fratton Park, Portsmouth for a reserve fixture when he was summoned to The Dell where the Saints had an emergency as both regular goalkeepers, Herbert Lock and Tom Burrows were unavailable through injury. Mead therefore played in goal in a Southern League match against West Ham United. According to Holley & Chalk's [...] "The Alphabet of the Saints" [...] he [...] "shaped up well but was only required to save two shots and kept a <b>blank</b> <b>sheet</b> in a 0–0 draw." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1840 one of {{the reforms}} {{introduced}} by Rowland Hill was {{the elimination of the}} free franking privilege granted to members of parliament and other government officials. It was common for members of parliament to give out signed <b>blank</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper to friends and business associates on which they could write letters and mail them at no cost. Parliament members were even appointed to the boards of large companies in order that their mailings could make use of the free franking privilege.|$|R

5000|$|Lichtenberg {{figures are}} {{named after the}} German {{physicist}} Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, who originally discovered and studied them. When they were first discovered, {{it was thought that}} their characteristic shapes might help to reveal the nature of positive and negative electric [...] "fluids". In 1777, Lichtenberg built a large electrophorus to generate high voltage static electricity through induction. After discharging a high voltage point to the surface of an insulator, he recorded the resulting radial patterns by sprinkling various powdered materials onto the surface. By then pressing <b>blank</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper onto these patterns, Lichtenberg was able to transfer and record these images, thereby discovering the basic principle of modern xerography.|$|R
