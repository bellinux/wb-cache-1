I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{played two}} seasons for the Colts from 1948 to 1949. During his first year, he saw action in nine games {{including}} {{one as a}} starter. On 54carries, he rushed {{for a total of}} 194yards and a touchdown. Gambino also recorded sixreceptions for 28yards and made three kickoff returns for 57yards. The following season, he played in ten games and started in six. He made 56carries for 208yards and ten receptions for 67yards and a touchdown. At the time, Gambino was one of four Colts players who were bald. The Baltimore Sun published an article that explored the unusual occurrence and concluded that it had [...] "nothing to do with wearing a helmet." [...] In When the Colts Belonged to Baltimore, author William Gildea described Gambino: [...] "In street clothes he looked like Robert Mitchum—wide-brimmed hat, long overcoat, baggy but creased trousers, a cigarette <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> a craggy smile. Yesteryear's running back." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly {{than he was}} in the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of the}} season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18. When an opposition player did well against Nash, it was something to savour; years later leading Richmond player Don [...] "Mopsy" [...] Fraser wrote [...] "Trouncing Nash does a lot for your confidence, even an ageing Nash." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{waited with}} interest. Old Jolyon {{held up his}} hand; dark-rimmed glasses {{depending}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb quivered slightly with a suggestion of menace.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Instantly {{the drum}} stopped; and I {{distinctly}} saw Martin raise his right hand, and, {{as it appeared}} to me, seize Jean Marie's naked foot <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, Rocco," [...] said Luca, {{turning the}} note {{round and round}} perplexedly <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb; [...] "do you think Maddalena will be {{lucky enough to get}} married to Fabio?" ...|$|R
500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have you got the cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E

6000|$|BRASSBOUND. What {{could you}} say? (He takes back the portrait: she relinquishes {{it without a}} word. He looks at it; shakes his head; and takes it quietly <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb to tear it.) ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Smith {{would take}} the carte <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb and stare at it. It was all covered with such devices as Potage la Mariposa--Filet Mignon a la proprietaire--Cotellete a la Smith, and so on.|$|R
60|$|She held it close. He {{raised his}} hand to the glass, and they both peered at an almost {{intangible}} filament he held <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb. It was a long hair; the hair of a woman.|$|R
60|$|The doctor {{held the}} thin wrist {{for a moment}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> and let it go.|$|E
60|$|Wrayson stopped smoking. The {{cigarette}} burned unheeded <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> His {{eyes were}} fixed upon his visitor.|$|E
60|$|It was the Moolah who {{approached}} {{them with}} four splinters of palm-bark protruding from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Smallest {{foot of the}} lot," [...] he said critically, holding Jane's foot <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> {{and thumb}} {{as if it were}} an art {{treasure}} which he had been invited to examine. [...] "And belonging to the finest built lady." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Mordaunt {{knelt on}} one knee on the greensward, and with a touch in which respect and reverence were mingled with the deepest and manliest emotion, he took <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb {{the tip of the}} girl's gloved hand.|$|R
6000|$|On Mr. Pendyce's foot, or by {{the side}} of his chair, whence he could see what was being eaten, sat the spaniel John, and now and then Mr. Pendyce, taking a small portion of {{something}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, would say: ...|$|R
60|$|Jacob took {{a golden}} angel from his pouch {{and began to}} play with it <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{took up a}} {{paper-knife}} and, balancing it <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> tapped {{lightly with}} it on the table.|$|E
60|$|Borrowdean's eyebrows were raised. He {{held his}} {{cigarette}} <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{and looked at}} it for several moments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank ye, sir," [...] {{replied the}} aged butler, filling his clay from Shelton's pouch; then, taking a front tooth <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and <b>his</b> thumb, {{he began to}} feel it tenderly, working it to and fro with a sort of melancholy pride.|$|R
60|$|They {{took him}} into the house, and a big man picked him up <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, {{and said he was}} not dead but half choked; so they wrapped him in cotton-wool, and warmed him and {{he opened his eyes and}} sneezed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly {{thou art}} a chip {{of the old}} tree," [...] said Hauskuld, taking Alric's ear <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb; [...] "but there are means to take which {{have been known to}} bend stouter hearts than thine. Say, wilt thou show me the cave?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jack did not speak, {{but held}} the letters <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{as if they}} had been burning coals.|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned back}} in his chair and, {{twisting}} the paper-knife idly <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> watched his chief clerk closely.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, half-breathless, bending forward towards me, and crumpling my card <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> {{into the}} {{smallest}} possible dimensions.|$|E
60|$|The note, the accounts, the rosebud, {{and his own}} photograph, he {{restored}} to their places again. The other photograph he took <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, and held it towards {{the bars of the}} grate. There he held it for half-a-minute or more, meditating.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{goodness}} sake," [...] he said, [...] "don't offend this fellow; {{he may be}} as mad as ten hatters, if you like, but he has us <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb. This is {{the very}} time he appointed {{to talk with us}} about our--well, our exeat." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{took him}} into the house, and a big man picked him up <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb {{and said he was}} not dead but half choked. So they wrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and {{he opened his eyes and}} sneezed.|$|R
60|$|Disappointment {{leaped into}} Saxon's face, but Billy, {{crumbling}} a clod <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{had not made}} up his mind.|$|E
60|$|Holmes sat {{for some}} little time {{twisting}} this letter <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers,</b> and frowning, {{as he stared}} into the fire.|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry {{turned in}} his chair. His cigar was burning now idly <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> His heavy eyebrows were drawn together.|$|E
60|$|He {{took out}} a {{blackened}} pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until {{it was in a}} bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And you refuse?' {{said the}} {{astonished}} minister, as she still stood immovable {{on the brink}} of the pool. He persuasively took her sleeve <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb as if to draw her; but she resented this by a quick movement of displeasure, and he released her, seeing that he had gone too far.|$|R
60|$|He disgusted me much {{while with}} him, for when a horrid blowfly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly {{for a few}} moments <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, and before I knew {{what he was going to}} do, put it in his mouth and ate it.|$|R
