40|$|Background. Microwave {{bandpass}} mutually detuned resonator filters in the <b>parallel</b> <b>channels</b> {{are fundamentally}} different from traditional filters cascaded resonator tuned to the same frequency ? {{the connection between the}} resonators in them is essentially absent because of both the parallel mutual position relative to the direction of propagation, and the mutual detuning frequency. Therefore, the traditional methods of analysis and design using the ladder diagrams of low-frequency counterparts cannot be applied. Objective. Creating models of microwave bandpass mutually detuned resonator filters in the <b>parallel</b> <b>channels</b> based on the low-frequency counterparts. Methods. Analysis of all known publications devoted to the microwave bandpass mutually detuned resonator filters in <b>parallel</b> <b>channels</b> allowed to reveal inherent patterns (types of oscillations in <b>parallel</b> <b>channels,</b> the location of the poles of attenuation above or below the bandwidth), manifested regardless of the types of resonators. Results. The analogy between the characteristics of the microwave bandpass mutually detuned resonator filters in <b>parallel</b> <b>channels</b> and low frequency of prototypes based on bridging bandpass filters is established. Conclusions. To simulate microwave bandpass mutually detuned resonator filters in <b>parallel</b> <b>channels,</b> low-frequency prototypes based on bridging bandpass filters can be used, design techniques of which are well specified. ????????????. ????????? ??????? ??? ?? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ???????????, ??????????? ?? ???? ???????: ????? ????? ???????????? ? ??? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??-?? ????????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ???????, ??? ? ??-?? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???????. ??????? ? ??? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ? ?????????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ???? ?????????????? ??????????. ???? ????????????. ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ?? ???? ?????????????? ??????????. ???????? ??????????. ?????? ???? ????????? ??????????, ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ???????, ???????? ??????? ???????? ?? ??????????????

40|$|Abstract — The {{idea that}} no more {{dependence}} can be consumed than produced was used to obtain an outer bound to the capacity region of the single output two-way channel in [1]. A <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> extension of this bound was used to obtain an outer bound of 0. 64628 bits/transmission for the sum-rate point of the binary multiplying channel (BMC) which improved over Zhang-Berger-Schalkwijk bound of 0. 64891 bits/transmission [2]. It is not obvious that this selection of <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> would yield the best sum-rate outer bound for the BMC using the idea of dependence balance. We show that for all binary adaptive <b>parallel</b> <b>channels,</b> the best sum-rate outer bound for the BMC is 0. 64628 bits/transmission and corresponds to the <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> selection of [1].

Our conclusion is that <b>parallel</b> <b>channels</b> is the best scheme in supporting many data-rates, if we also take into account code-design and receiver complexity.

30|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>channels</b> {{are used}} to model {{statistical}} behaviors of communications in conveying multiple data simultaneously between nodes, connected with multiple links. The internal structure of storage systems or singular value decomposed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are an example of <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> models. In these channels, the links {{do not need to}} be the same, and their statistical behaviors can differ. The question then arises about whether the <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> capacity is achievable via polar codes. In [7, 8], it is demonstrated, under a non-identically distributed channel assumption, that when all channel parameters (CP) are given to the transceiver, polar codes can achieve the capacity in both degraded and non-degraded channel settings.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{difference}} between a parallel and a serial communication channel {{is the number of}} electrical conductors used at the physical layer to convey bits. Parallel communication implies more than one such conductor. For example, an 8-bit <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> will convey eight bits (or a byte) simultaneously, whereas a serial channel would convey those same bits sequentially, one at a time. If both channels operated at the same clock speed, the <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> would be eight times faster. A <b>parallel</b> <b>channel</b> may have additional conductors for other signals, such as a clock signal to pace the flow of data, a signal to control the direction of data flow, and handshaking signals.|$|R

We then show that even the Gaussian MAC wiretap channel is inseparable in general. Finally, we show that, when the channel gains are drawn from continuous distributions, and when the secure degrees of freedom (s. d. o. f.) region is considered, then the Gaussian MAC wiretap channel is almost surely separable.
