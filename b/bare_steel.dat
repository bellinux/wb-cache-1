2500|$|Congress first {{proposed}} a bridge {{at the site}} of the current structure on May 24, 1886. The resolution required that the United States Department of War study the feasibility of a bridge at the site, and a [...] wide design was proposed later that year. The following year, the War Department suggested a [...] "Lincoln-Grant Memorial Bridge". The Washington Post supported the idea of naming the bridge after both Robert E. Lee and Grant. Congress again passed a resolution requesting another design, and in late 1887 the department proposed a [...] "General Ulysses S. Grant Memorial Bridge". The new bridge would be a suspension bridge [...] high, with [...] of clearance below it. Designs for the bridge at this time included a <b>bare</b> <b>steel</b> truss bridge, a low masonry arch bridge, and a Romanesque Revival structure by Paul J. Pelz with two massive central towers, two barbicans on each end, and exuberant ornamentation. Senator John W. Daniel sponsored legislation in 1897 funding a survey of the bedrock in the Potomac River. Congress approved the legislation the same year, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers began the survey in July. The survey was delivered in March 1898.|$|E

40|$|Structural Composite beams {{are known}} to be {{economical}} since the savings in steel can reach up to 50 % by weight over non-composite beams. The composite action can be achieved by achieving the shear connection between the beam and the concrete using the shear connectors, however, the composite construction have been well established for hot-rolled steel members and yet to be studied and researched for cold formed steel beams. This paper presents the ability of the cold formed lipped C-channel section {{to be used as a}} composite beam with Ferrocement slab. The shear connection is developed by using shear bolts size 12 mm diameter which were being tested and proven to create adequate shear connection. Three variations of the ferrocement flange were tested for bending and compared with the bending capacity of the <b>bare</b> coldformed <b>steel</b> beam. British standards 5950 - 3. 1 and 5950 - 5 were used for analytical calculation to validate the laboratory results. The laboratory results showed significant increase in the flexural strength of the composite beam compared with the <b>bare</b> cold form <b>steel</b> beam. However, this increase dropped as the width of the beam’s flange increased. Experimentally, the results show the significant increase in the flexural strength of the composite beam when compared with the <b>bare</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> beam of 75. 9 %, 84. 9 % and 119 % for the CF 200, CF 250 and CF 300 respectively. Theoretically, the increase in the flexural strength of the composite beam when compared with the <b>bare</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> beam was 52. 9 %, 62 % and 73. 8 %. This study has also the effect of using the ferrocement in delaying the cracking of the beam by providing more stress resistance in the flange that reached 33. 24 N/mm...|$|R
2500|$|Because {{it had no}} intersections, the autobahn {{required}} {{a huge number of}} bridges and underpasses. These were initially purely utilitarian in design, but after inspecting the first completed stretch, Todt sought to give them a more unified and aesthetic appearance. Paul Bonatz, who was hired in 1934 to oversee bridge design on the Reichsautobahn, wrote a few months before that they should be as unnoticeable as possible, minimal in mass and in obstruction of view. Like the rest stops, they were also designed to reflect local building styles and materials. One exception that proved the rule was the <b>bare</b> <b>steel</b> bridges spanning the Dessauer Rennstrecke high-speed section, which expressed its high-tech purpose and also alluded to the Junkers aircraft company that was headquartered in Dessau. The relatively few large bridges were major design statements; Todt wrote in 1937 that they [...] "should not be [...] for 1940, nor yet for 2000, but... should extend their dominating presence, like the cathedrals of our past, into future millennia." [...] The first of these was the Mangfall Bridge at Weyarn, a girder bridge designed by German Bestelmeyer that spanned the valley on two double pylons of reinforced concrete. Built in 193436, this served as the model for several subsequent autobahn bridges, and a model of one of the huge pylons dominated the Reichsautobahn exhibit at the Gebt mir vier Jahre Zeit exhibition. Subsequently, the preferred style for the large bridges evolved away from this modern form toward viaducts derived from Roman bridges, which had a more imposing mass, allowed the reflection of regional building styles in their use of stone and brick, and embodied the Nazi claim to be the heirs to the great builders of ancient times. These included the Holledau Bridge by Georg Gsaenger (193738) and the bridges over the Saale at Hirschberg, Thuringia, and Jena; in 1938 Friedrich Tamm designed a huge imitation Roman viaduct for the Werra valley at Hedemünden. Another factor in this change in style was the shortage of steel caused by the policy of autarky and by rearmament and war; there was also a near failure of a continuously welded bridge, which had to be quietly reinforced and led to mistrust of steel construction. Many later bridges had a reinforced concrete core clad in stonework or brick. However, with the bridges the shift was never as complete as it was in other aspects of Reichsautobahn architecture: in 194041, along the Rhine, a stone bridge was under construction at Frankenthal {{and at the same time}} at Rodenkirchen in Cologne, an ultra-modern suspension bridge by Bonatz. In addition to the self-image of modernity, another reason for this was the enormous cost of stone construction in man-hours and in material; so much masonry construction was carried out in the Third Reich that shortages occurred. Hence many of the viaducts were in simplified, modernized form, for example the series at the Drackensteiner Hang by Paul Bonatz and the bridge over the Lahn valley at Limburg, by Bonatz and Gottwalt Schaper.|$|E

40|$|Commercial 316 LVM {{austenitic}} stainless steel samples have been coated by immersion in a bath of molten Al- 12. 6 %Si alloy for 120 s. The coating consists of the Al 12 (Fe,Cr) 3 Si 2 intermetallic. In vitro corrosion behaviour has been evaluated in the Ringer's solution by means of potentiodynamic curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results reveal that the coated specimens exhibit lower susceptibility to localised corrosion {{with respect to the}} substrate. XPS analysis suggests that the ennoblement of the pitting potential is due to the formation of a chromium oxyhydroxide containing passive layer. The intermetallic coating shows a good biocompatibility, as demonstrated by culturing human mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow which attached, grew and differentiated to the osteoblastic lineage to a similar extent on coated and <b>bare</b> <b>steels.</b> In summary, this study proposes a method that generates Ni-free coatings of the stainless steel with useful properties for biomedical applications. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

As-deposited amorphous RuO 2 thin films on stainless steel were transformed to pure rutile-type RuO 2 at temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 600 °C, the resistivity of which had a value less than 200 μΩ ° cm. The PZT films processed on RuO 2 needed slightly higher temperature (610 °C) in order to be completely transformed into the perovskite phase than PZT on stainless steel (600 °C). The films showed best ferroelectric properties when depositing it on the 100 nm thick RuO 2 bottom electrodes fired at 400 °C for 10 minutes.
