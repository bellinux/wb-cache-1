25|$|Until {{recently}} (within {{the last}} 20 years), β-blockers were contraindicated in CHF, owing to their negative inotropic effect {{and ability to}} produce bradycardia – effects which worsen heart failure. However, current guidelines recommend β-blocker therapy for patients with systolic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction after stabilization with diuretic and ACEI therapy, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. As with ACEI therapy, {{the addition of a}} β-blocker can decrease mortality and improve left ventricular function. Several β-blockers are specifically indicated for CHF including: <b>bisoprolol,</b> carvedilol, nebivolol and extended-release metoprolol. The antagonism of β1 inotropic and chronotropic effects decreases the amount of work the heart must perform. It is also thought that catecholamines and other sympathomimetics have an effect on cardiac remodeling, and blocking their activity can slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{cardiovascular}} diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, ischemic heart diseases, and myocardial infarction after the acute event. Patients with compensated congestive heart failure may be treated with <b>bisoprolol</b> as a comedication (usually with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic, and a digitalis-glycosid, if indicated). In patients with congestive heart failure, it reduces the need for and the consumption of oxygen of the heart muscle. It is very important to start with low doses, as <b>bisoprolol</b> reduces also the muscular power of the heart, which is an undesired effect in congestive heart failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> β1-selectivity is {{especially}} important in comparison to other nonselective beta blockers. The effects of the drug are limited to areas containing β1 adrenoreceptors, which is mainly the heart {{and part of the}} kidney. <b>Bisoprolol</b> minimizes the side effects that might occur from administration of a nonspecific beta blocker where blockage of the other adrenoreceptors (β2, β3, α1, α2) occurs. The other receptors elicit a variety of responses in the body, and their blockage could cause a wide range of reactions, but β1 adrenoreceptors are cardiospecific for the most part, making <b>bisoprolol</b> ideal for treatment of cardiac events.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> was {{patented}} in 1976 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Bisoprolol</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 2.98 to 4.94 USD per month. In the United States, as of 2015, it costs about 25 to 50 USD a month.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> is {{beneficial}} in treatment for {{high blood pressure}} (hypertension), reduced {{blood flow to the}} heart (cardiac ischemia); congestive heart failure, and preventive treatment before and primary treatment after heart attacks, decreasing the chances of recurrence. <b>Bisoprolol</b> targets hypertension (elevated blood pressure). In cardiac ischemia, the drug is used to reduce the activity of the heart muscle, so reduces oxygen and nutrient demand, and reduced blood supply can still transport sufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> has {{a higher}} degree of β1-selectivity {{compared}} to other β1-selective β-blockers such as atenolol, metoprolol, and betaxolol. However nebivolol is approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective.|$|E
50|$|A {{common problem}} when {{comparing}} drugs is that different medications {{can be of}} different potency. For example, 20 mg of the beta blocker propranolol are much less effective than 20 mg of the beta blocker <b>bisoprolol.</b> To reflect this, the WHO has decided on a DDD for propranolol of 160 mg and for <b>bisoprolol</b> of 10 mg. Individual patients can still be prescribed higher or lower doses, for instance in children, patients with liver or kidney impairment, patients with a combination therapy, or {{due to differences in}} drug metabolism between individuals or ethnicities (genetic polymorphism).|$|E
50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> {{has both}} lipid- and {{water-soluble}} properties, {{making it a}} prime candidate over other β-blockers and even over other β1-blockers, being water-soluble, it has decreased incidence of central nervous system side effects (inability to diffuse into brain) compared to purely lipophilic compounds. <b>Bisoprolol</b> has an approximate half-life of 10-12 hours, and when ingested has nearly complete absorption into the blood stream. The high absorption is indicative of high bioavailability (approx. 90%). When being eliminated, the body evenly distributes it (50-50) between kidney excretion and liver biotransformation (then excreted). These factors make it a convenient once/day dosage when administered.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bisoprolol</b> is cardioprotective {{because it}} {{selectively}} and competitively blocks catecholamine (adrenalin) stimulation of β1 adrenergic receptors (adrenoreceptors), which are mainly {{found in the}} heart muscle cells and heart conduction tissue (cardiospecific), but also found in juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. Normally, adrenalin and noradrenalin stimulation of the β1 adrenoreceptor activates a signalling cascade (Gs protein and cAMP) which ultimately leads to increased contractility and increased heart rate of the heart muscle and heart pacemaker, respectively. <b>Bisoprolol</b> competitively blocks the activation of this cascade, so decreases the adrenergic tone/stimulation of the heart muscle and pacemaker cells. Decreased adrenergic tone shows less contractility of heart muscle and lowered heart rate of pacemakers.|$|E
50|$|Beta-blockers should {{generally}} be avoided {{in people with}} a history of asthma or bronchospasm as they may make the disease worse. A beta 1 selective beta blocker like <b>bisoprolol</b> may be tried in those in whom other options are not available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bisoprolol,</b> marketed {{under the}} tradename Zebeta among others, is a {{medication}} {{most commonly used}} for heart diseases. This specifically includes high blood pressure, chest pain from not enough {{blood flow to the}} heart, and heart failure. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Negative inotropic agents {{decrease}} myocardial contractility, and {{are used}} to decrease cardiac workload in conditions such as angina. While negative inotropism may precipitate or exacerbate heart failure, certain beta blockers (e.g. carvedilol, <b>bisoprolol</b> and metoprolol) have been believed to reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure. Quite recently, however, the effectiveness of beta blockers has come under renewed critical scientific scrutiny.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, feeling tired, diarrhea, and {{swelling}} in the legs. More severe side effects include worsening asthma, blocking {{the ability to}} recognize low blood sugar, and worsening heart failure. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may be harmful to the baby. <b>Bisoprolol</b> is in the Beta blocker family of medications and is of the β1 selective type.|$|E
50|$|Overdose of <b>bisoprolol</b> {{leads to}} fatigue, hypotension, low blood sugar, bronchospasms, and bradycardia. Bronchospasms and low blood sugar because at high doses drug {{can be an}} {{antagonist}} for β2 adrenergic receptors located in lung and in liver. Bronchospasm is due to blockage in lungs of β2 receptor and low blood sugar because of decreased stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver via β2 receptor.|$|E
50|$|Hydralazine is {{not used}} as a primary drug for {{treating}} hypertension because it elicits a reflex sympathetic stimulation of the heart (the baroreceptor reflex). The sympathetic stimulation may increase heart rate and cardiac output, and in people with coronary artery disease may cause angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Hydralazine may also increase plasma renin concentration, resulting in fluid retention. To prevent these undesirable side effects, hydralazine is usually prescribed in combination with a β-blocker (e.g., propranolol) and a diuretic. Beta-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include <b>bisoprolol,</b> carvedilol, and nebivolol.|$|E

The drug is highly cardioselective at 5 mg. In addition, at doses above 10 mg, nebivolol loses its cardioselectivity and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors. (While the recommended starting dose of nebivolol is 5 mg, sufficient control of blood pressure may require doses up to 40 mg).

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} effects and safety profile of initial monotherapy with either <b>bisoprolol</b> or enalapril in elderly patients with heart failure (HF). Methods In CIBIS III, 1010 patients with {{mild to moderate}} HF and age >= 65 years were randomized to monotherapy with either <b>bisoprolol</b> or enalapril for 6 months. Results <b>Bisoprolol</b> had a similar effect as enalapril on the combined end-point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization (HR 1. 02; p= 0. 90), {{as well as on}} each of the individual end-points. A trend towards fewer sudden deaths was observed with <b>bisoprolol</b> (NS). On the other hand, more cases of worsening HF requiring hospitalization or occurring while in hospital were observed in the <b>bisoprolol</b> group (HR 1. 67; p= 0. 03).

40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the thermal behavior of crystalline and amorphous <b>bisoprolol</b> fumarate and its compatibility with amorphous valsartan. This pharmacologically relevant drug combination is a potential candidate for fixed-dose combination formulation. Methods DSC and TMDSC were used to examine thermal behavior of <b>bisoprolol</b> fumarate. SSNMR and XRPD were applied to probe the solid state forms. The thermal behavior of physical mixtures with different concentrations of <b>bisoprolol</b> and valsartan were examined by DSC and TMDSC, and the observed interactions were investigated by XRPD, solution- and solid-state NMR. Results The phase transitions from thermal methods and solid-state NMR spectra of crystalline and amorphous <b>bisoprolol</b> fumarate are reported. Strong interactions between <b>bisoprolol</b> fumarate and valsartan were observed above 60 C, resulting in the formation of a new amorphous material. Solution- and solid-state NMR provided insight into the molecular nature of the incompatibility. Conclusions A combined analysis of thermal methods, solution- and solid-state NMR and XRPD experiments allowed the investigation of the conformational and dynamic properties of <b>bisoprolol</b> fumarate.
