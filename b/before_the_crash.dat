5|$|The {{aircraft}} was registered VH-AET by the Commonwealth and hired out to Australian National Airways on 20 December 1944. Australian National Airways converted {{it to the}} civil aircraft configuration about a year <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> VH-AET flew for 7,477 hours.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time in the months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} serving Flight 3054 was an Airbus A320-233, {{serial number}} 789, registration PR-MBK; it was powered by two IAE V2500-533 engines. It {{was built in}} 1998 and had been operated by several other airlines before entering service with TAM in February 2007. The aircraft was owned by Pegasus Aviation and had flown more than 21,000 hours over 10,000 cycles <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E

5|$|The aircraft, a 7-year old McDonnell Douglas MD-11, {{serial number}} 48448, {{registration}} HB-IWF, was manufactured in 1991 and Swissair was its only operator. It bore {{the title of}} Vaud, in honour of the Swiss canton of the same name. The cabin was configured with 241seats. First and business class seats were equipped with an in-seat in-flight entertainment system. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney 4462 turbofan engines and had logged about 36,000 hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{had been}} used since 25 seconds after take-off from Namsos and {{was used for the}} remainder of the flight. From 20:29:21 all four engines showed increasing torque and immediately <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> the aircraft had shifted its angle from −2.5degrees to 5degrees. At 20:29:29 the ground proximity warning system showed 'minimum'. The aircraft crashed into the western side Torghatten at 20:29:30 at 170meters (560ft) elevation.|$|E
5|$|Tisdale {{testified to}} passing the order by {{telephone}} to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, {{and that it}} was correctly read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was not uncommon for objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages. Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order.|$|E

After {{witnessing}} the crash, he sends Ethan Rom (William Mapother) and Goodwin Stanhope (Brett Cullen) to investigate. He chooses Goodwin in order to remove Ben's competition for the affections of Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), a woman recruited to the island three years previously {{in order to help}} the Others with their fertility problems.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the lack of sales, and for the poor {{condition}} of many surviving specimens, was that while the fair was open, the economic Panic of 1893 began, one of the worst depressions in the nation's history—fifty cents could make the difference between a family eating or starving {{at a time when the}} average visitor to the fair spent $1.18. Fairgoers were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty-cent piece, and those who had bought Columbian half dollars <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> often spent their souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{introduces}} {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, who experience a plane crash and end up on a mysterious island. Three of the characters, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), are featured <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> in flashbacks of their experiences on the plane as it breaks apart in mid-air; this narrative technique would be reused in almost every subsequent episode of the series. The Lost pilot {{is one of the}} most critically acclaimed television pilots of all time. Both parts earned high ratings, with Part 1 breaking the record for a pilot episode with 18.6 million viewers, and the episode would later win many awards and accolades.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems emergency parachute, designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 191 brought strong {{criticism}} from the media regarding the DC-10's safety and design. The DC-10 {{had been involved in}} two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors, American Airlines Flight 96 (1972) and Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (1974). The separation of engine one from its mount, the widespread publication of the dramatic images of the airplane missing its engine seconds <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> and a second photo of the fireball resulting from the impact, raised widespread concerns about the safety of the DC-10. The final blow to the airplane's reputation was dealt two weeks after the crash, when the aircraft was grounded by the FAA. Although the aircraft itself was later exonerated, the damage in the public's eye was already done.|$|E

5|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash. She {{sustained}} severe brain damage, having fractured her skull and then hemorrhaged. In addition, she suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized. The last thing that Vulović could remember from <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> was greeting passengers as they boarded. The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.|$|E
25|$|The Sikorsky S-76C+ has {{emergency}} pontoons {{for water}} landings {{but they were}} not deployed, and no distress signals were heard <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> although it later emerged that the pilots had tried to send an emergency message shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E
