5000|$|Enteromius baudoni is {{a species}} of {{tropical}} freshwater fish from Central and Western Africa. It is found in western Africa, in the river basins of the Chad Basin, the Volta basin, the Niger River basin, the Gambia River basin, the Senegal River basin, the Sassandra River basin, and the Bandama River basin. [...] In central Africa, it {{is found in the}} Ubangui River ecosystem. [...] It typically inhabits tropical freshwater ecosystems between 24 and 26 C. [...] It was originally described by Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger as Barbus baudoni in 1918, [...] and the holotype, collected from Bangui, Central African Republic, is stored at the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle in Paris. [...] The species was originally classified in the <b>Barbus</b> <b>genus,</b> but was reclassified as belonging to the Enteromius genus in 2015 after examining extensive taxon, geographical, and genomic sampling of the species in the Cyprinidae family.|$|E
40|$|The genus Barbus is {{characterized}} by a complex taxonomical structure, due to high number of species and its morphological plasticity; it counts more than 25 species in Europe, displaying different ecological preferences. 21 taxon’s from <b>Barbus</b> <b>genus</b> including Barbus lacerta was used in phylogenetic analysis. Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene sequence analysis of Barbus lacerta is presented firstly in this study. A phylogenetic tree (neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analysis) was reconstructed based on the sequences of COI, with Cyprinus carpio as an outgroup. As a result, five clades come out from phylogenetic reconstruction and in phylogenetic tree Barbus lacerta determined to be sister group of Barbus macedonicus, Barbus oligolepis and Barbus plebejus complex...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} and evolutionary {{patterns in the}} genus Barbus were examined through {{the analysis of the}} complete sequences of three mitochondrial genes: ATPases 8 and 6, which overlap slightly, and cytochrome b. This complex genus includes diploid as well as tetraploid and hexaploid species that are distributed throughout the Palaearctic, Ethiopian and Asiatic biogeographical regions. Given that genome duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism in eukaryotes, in the present report we attempt to describe its role {{in the evolution of the}} genus Barbus, as well as drawing systematic and phylogenetic conclusions. The phylogenetic results indicated the splitting of the current <b>Barbus</b> <b>genus</b> into five main mitochondrial lineages corresponding to (i) the genus Barbus sensu stricto (tetraploid, which is subdivided into the subgenera Barbus and Luciobarbus), (ii) the hexaploid species, (iii) the Ethiopian tetraploid species, (iv) the African diploid species, and (v) the Asian diploid species. The branching of 'foreign' genera as sister groups of some of these monophyletic assemblages (such as Aulopyge is to Barbus sensu stricto or Varicorhinus is to the hexaploid barbels) demonstrates the polyphyly of the group. Moreover, the relationships between the proposed lineages also show that genome duplication may be considered as a homoplasic character since it must have occurred over at least three independent periods and/or in three independent areas. In relation to the possible saltational evolutionary model for the polyploid species examined here, it was found that, although feasible at the nuclear level, the mitochondrial markers looked at do not appear to have undergone this type of evolution. Rather, they seem to have experienced more or less constant change through time...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} of 25 different {{populations of the}} <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus</b> S. str. have been studied using different parsimony grouping methods and similarity indexes. The results indicate that Barbus S. str. is composed of two different groups. They are provisionally placed into two different subgenera (Barbus and Lucioharbus) {{in order to make}} the taxonomic work easier. The European species (B. barbus, B. plebejus, B. ciscaucasicus, B. cyclolepis, B. petenyi, B. haasi and B. meridionalis) are included in the subgenus Barbus. Within this group there are two evolutionary lines, one formed by central European species and the other by Mediterranean species which live in mountain fluvial courses. The subgenus Luciobarbus is constituted by Iberian, northern African and Asian species. The relationships between them are not satisfactorily resolved. Two northern African species (B. nasus and B. magniatlantis) are not included in any subgenus, as their phylogenetic relationships are not clear enough. The fossil record of this genus has been reviewed and new remains from the middle Miocene of Spain are reported as being the earliest known fossils of the <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus.</b> The first known fossils of Luciobarbus date from the Upper Miocene in Spain, Africa and Asia. The dispersion of Barbus in two main periods is postulated, one of them during the main Alpine orogenic phase at the end of the Oligocene, the other during the Upper Miocene transgression. The first one maybe favoured Barbus and the second Luciobarbus. Barriers that might have fragmented the different populations of the <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus</b> have been evaluated and a comprehensive biogeographic model, which minimizes the dispersion events, is proposed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} phylogenetic {{relationships among}} north Mediterranean {{species of the}} <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus</b> using sequences of the cytochrome b gene. Our {{results indicate that the}} species belong to two major clades that are consistent with those previously defined from morphological features. The first clade includes species ranging from France to the Black Sea. In this clade, there is a well-supported monophyletic group of large-sized fluvio-lacustrine barbs; however, the monophyly of the small-sized rheophilic species is not clear. The second clade comprises species found in Spain, Greece, and Asia Minor and probably represents the oldest group present in the north Mediterranean rivers. In general, there is good concordance between geography and phylogenetic relationships. These results are compared to those from previous morphological- and allozyme-based studies and demonstrate widespread discordance and polyphyly in the traditional taxonomy of the <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus.</b> This study {{is one of the first}} reporting the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of a genus that is widely distributed in European rivers and contains species that are a major component of the European ichthyofauna...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMitochondrial {{sequences}} {{contribution to}} dismantling the polyploid <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus</b> (Cyprinidae, Cyprininae) constitutes a diversified assemblage of about 800 species inhabiting Eurasia and Africa. In several cases, the mere possession of barbels was deemed enough to classify numerous species. In the genus {{in the last}} ten years, the phylogeny of Barbus, based on molecular markers, improved remarkably, and progress in karyology showed entire tetraploid and hexaploid lineages of generally limired geographic range which allowed interesting deductions on their evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of these species started using allozymes. These markers were efficient in detecting sibling species and hybridization events, and in describing phylogenetic relationships among related species having the same ploidy level. However, due to the " functional diploidisation" phenomena which occurred after ancestral polyploidisation, calculation conventions are necessary, i. e. "minimising" and "maximising" coding methods. If species of different ploidy levels are included in the analysis, these conventions can become more influential than the data themselves when used for large phylogenetic constructions. While nuclear data are most informative in population genetics, the mitochondrial genes sequences (mainly of the cytochrome b gene) allowed the avoidance of statistical biases associated with the nuclear markers. As a result, the phylogenetic relationships between lineages established in several geographic areas showed that conventional taxonomy needed substantial improvement. In particular, the <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus</b> must be limited to peri-Mediterranean tetraploid species. Mitochondrial markers proved a powerfull tool in the detection and description of the main biogeographic lineages and in the redefinition of this problematic group...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Three {{species in}} the group of "small " Barbus from West Africa were {{analyzed}} by enzyme electropho-resis to assess their genetic differentiation.

Phenetic dendrograms (Nei distances) and cladograms (compatibility networks) of the <b>genus</b> <b>Barbus</b> are proposed, based on three African diploid species, two diploid species from Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia, one African tetraploid species, and two French tetraploid species.

40|$|International audienceGenetic {{relationships}} among 24 Italian and Adriatic populations of barbs (<b>genus</b> <b>Barbus)</b> were assessed using electrophoretic analysis of allozymes and mitochondrial DNA sequences of the cytochrome b gene.

Populations assigned to the same nominal taxa (B. caninus, B. petenyi and B. rebeli), were very divergent in both allozymes and mtDNA, indicating that these populations deserve recognition as different units for conservation and management. On the other hand, the two fluvio-lacustrine taxa considered as distinct species (i. e. B. plebejus and B. tyberinus) are genetically very close to each other, showing no clear differences at either allozymes or mtDNA. The population of B. caninus from Pellice River carried allozyme alleles and mtDNA specific for B. plebejus, indicating a genetic introgression towards the former species...|$|R
