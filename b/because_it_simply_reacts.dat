Proper decryption of the data requires a key or the so-called scrambling matrix. The second one is digital watermarking, which aims at embedding messages into the multimedia data [10]. Intuitively, the time domain sample scrambling method is thus far the most attractive and desired, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> takes a segment of time domain sample values and directly scrambles them into a different segment of samples.

40|$|One way {{to build}} a {{reactive}} system is to construct an action table indexed by the current situation or stimulus. The action table describes what course of action to pursue for each situation or stimulus. This paper describes an incremental approach to constructing the action table through achieving goals with a hierarchical search system. These hierarchies are generated with transformations called concretizations, which add constraints to a problem and which can reduce the search space. The basic idea is that an action for a state is looked up in the action table and executed whenever the action table has an entry for that state; otherwise, a path is found to the nearest (cost-wise in a graph with costweighted arcs) state that has a mappring from a state in the next highest hierarchy. For each state along the solution path, the successor state in the path is cached in the action table entry for that state. Without caching, the hierarchical search system can logarithmically reduce search. When the table is complete the system no longer searches: <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> <b>reacts</b> by proceeding to the state listed in the table for each state. Since the cached information is specific only to the nearest state in the next highest hierarchy and not the goal, inter-goal transfer of reactivity is possible. To illustrate our approach, we show how an implemented hierarchical search system can completely reactive...|$|R
