5|$|There {{were rumors}} of plots {{and even of}} his escape, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> no serious {{attempts}} were made. For English poet Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.|$|E
5|$|Deputies term {{of office}} was set for 6 years, with {{elections}} for the half of the deputies held every three years. For the first renewal election the to-be-replaced or reelected members had been chosen by lot. The Sejm was to meet every two years, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> the gatherings happened less often, between every two and three years. Sessions lasted two months.|$|E
5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} power over the Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops, but these were denied based on the fear that they might revolt or desert in a war.|$|E

5|$|To further {{add to his}} confusion, he {{encountered}} a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks {{very similar to the}} Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he thought was west, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the culmination of the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E

Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality,</b> even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 40, Octavian and Antony {{approved}} the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality,</b> this provision was useless for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Octavia Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40BC. During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as Antonia the Elder and Antonia Minor).|$|E

5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): this tank is {{described}} in many sources as early version of the T-26 mod. 1933. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> this is the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps163–16) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank (which can be identified by rivets for mounting of a burning mixture tank, rivets for hinges of a filling hatch {{on the left side}} and a welded drain port on the right side behind a front track bogie) with a mounted riveted turret with a small rear niche from the early BT-5 light tank.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas became {{governor}} of Buenos Aires after the {{brief period of}} anarchy {{following the end of}} the Cisplatine War in 1828. In theory, Rosas only held as much power as governors of the other Argentine provinces, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> he ruled over the entire Argentine Confederation, as the country was then known. Although {{he was one of the}} Federalists, a faction which demanded greater provincial autonomy, in practice Rosas exercised control over the other provinces and become the virtual dictator of Argentina. During his 20-year government, the country witnessed the resurgence of armed conflicts between the Unitarians (his rival political faction) and the Federalists.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E

5|$|French {{involvement}} in Vietnam {{started in the}} late 18th century when the Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine assisted Nguyễn Ánh, to found the Nguyễn Dynasty by recruiting French volunteers. In return, Nguyen Anh, who took the reign name Gia Long allowed Catholic missionaries to operate in Vietnam. However, relations became strained under Gia Long's successor Minh Mạng as missionaries sought to incite revolts {{in an attempt to}} enthrone a Catholic. This prompted anti-Christian edicts, and in 1858, a French invasion of Vietnam was mounted, ostensibly to protect Catholicism, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> for colonial purposes. The French steadily made gains and completed the colonisation of Vietnam in 1883. Armed revolts against colonial rule occurred regularly, most notably through the Cần Vương movement of the late-1880s. In the early-20th century, the 1916 southern revolts and the Thái Nguyên uprising were notable disruptions to the French administration.|$|E
5|$|Harold Brighouse's play Hobson's Choice {{takes place}} in the Salford of 1880, and the 1954 film version was shot in the town. Walter Greenwood's 1933 novel Love on the Dole was set in a fictional area known as Hanky Park, said in the novel to be near Salford, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> based on Salford itself. A more modern fictional setting {{influenced}} by the area is Coronation Streets Weatherfield. The Salford of the 1970s was the setting for the BAFTA award winning East is East. Salford was featured in the second series of the Channel 4 programme The Secret Millionaire, screened in 2007. Salford is also home to the theatre venue Studio Salford.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns a mysterious entity is {{controlling}} the world's other lifeforms and sending {{them against the}} player. This entity {{turns out to be}} Bolbox, a lifeform that has evolved into a freakish and evil advanced being by consuming the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> is a gigantic single-celled organism. In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced civilization on Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and observe until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.|$|E

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> some damping is present as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrender}} of the fortresses began {{a long period}} of conflict between the Greeks of the reconstituted Byzantine Empire and the forces of the Principality for control of the Morea. Prince William was absolved by the Pope of his oaths to Palaiologos, and warfare began almost as soon as he returned to the Principality. Despite this precarious situation, Geoffrey absented himself from the Morea, without William's permission, and spent the years 1263–65 in Italy, ostensibly on a pilgrimage, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> living with the wife of one of his feudatories, John of Katavas. His absence allowed the inhabitants of Skorta to rise up and aid the Byzantine troops in their offensive, which was halted by the same John of Katavas in the Battle of Prinitsa. Geoffrey was again deprived of his barony for this act, but was pardoned and restored to it on his return.|$|E
5|$|Thi oversaw I Corps with a {{great deal}} of autonomy, and the other {{officers}} felt threatened, which was accentuated by Thi's alignment with Buddhist activist movements in his region, traditionally a Buddhist stronghold. The Buddhists were opposed to expansion of the Vietnam War and the American leadership viewed Thi negatively. In early 1966, feeling more confident about his hold on power, Kỳ orchestrated Thi's removal, and announced that Thi would be going to the US for medical treatment, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>reality</b> into exile. Thi refused to go along with Kỳ's false story and wanted to stay in Vietnam, and this led to civil unrest in I Corps, where Thi was popular. The disquiet escalated into open rebellion by pro-Thi military units, allied to Buddhist anti-junta activists who were calling for civilian government and an end to the US-driven war expansion policy. After three months of virtual secession, Kỳ's forces quelled the dissidents, and Thi emigrated to the U.S., where he lived for the rest of his life.|$|E
