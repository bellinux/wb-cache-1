It subsequently served through the Cold War as a reserve formation until 1991 when the division was disbanded for a final time as the Australian Army was restructured and the focus of Australian field force operations shifted from the divisional-level to brigades.|$|E

The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
25|$|Another line of {{research}} at Liverpool was measuring the fission cross section of uranium-235, on which Frisch and Peierls' calculations depended. They had assumed that almost every collision between a neutron of any energy and a uranium-235 nucleus would produce a fission. The value they used for the cross section was that published by French researchers in 1939. <b>But</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> correct? Data published by the Americans in the 15 March and 15 April 1940 issues of Physical Review indicated that the fission cross section was much smaller. No pure uranium-235 was available, so experiments at Liverpool were conducted with natural uranium. The results were inconclusive, but tended to support Frisch and Peierls. By March 1941, the Alfred Nier had managed to produce a microscopic amount of uranium-235 in the United States, and a team under Merle Tuve at the Carnegie Institution of Washington was measuring the cross section. The uranium-235 was too valuable to send a sample to Britain, so Chadwick sent the Americans a list of measurements {{he wanted them to}} carry out. The final result was that the cross section was larger than Frisch and Peierls had assumed, but the resulting critical mass was still only about 8 kilograms.|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, virtual peace ruled Mexico {{for most}} of the Porfiriato. There were no grand-scale civil wars nor any foreign {{attempts}} to invade Mexico, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> worth the trouble? Although Creelman devotes the vast majority of his writing to admiring Díaz as an individual, aside from the regime, Creelman is sure to also point out the perceived flaws of the Porfiriato: the restricted press, the feudal-like hacienda system, the infrastructural needs outside of major cities (and in major cities), the brutal administration of justice for trivial or political causes, the general neglect for rural Mexico, and the forced migration of Indian populations outside of their native lands. On his treatment towards the Indians, Díaz states that “they are accustomed to look to those in authority for leadership instead of thinking for themselves. That is a tendency they inherited from the Spaniards, who taught them to refrain from meddling in public affairs and rely on the Government for guidance.” ...|$|E
