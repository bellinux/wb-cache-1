Many early trade union pioneers were drawn from the ranks of Primitive Methodist Preachers, and a basic 'welfare state' used to operate among chapel-goers, their neighbours and families. In common with some other non-conformists, Bourne accepted women as of equal status with men by (amongst other things) appointing women Preachers.|$|E

6000|$|And do {{you suppose}} you will lose {{anything}} by approaching your conventional art from this higher side? Not so. I called, with deliberate measurement of my expression, long ago, the decoration of the Alhambra [...] "detestable," [...] not merely because indicative of <b>base</b> <b>conditions</b> of moral being, but because merely as decorative work, however captivating in some respects, it is wholly wanting in the real, deep, and intense qualities of ornamental art. Noble conventional decoration belongs only to three periods. First, there is the conventional decoration of the Greeks, used in subordination to their sculpture. There are then the noble conventional decoration of the early Gothic schools, and the noble conventional arabesque of the great Italian schools. All these were reached from above, all reached by stooping from {{a knowledge of the}} human form. Depend upon it you will find, as you look more and more into the matter, that good subordinate ornament has ever been rooted in a higher knowledge; and if you are again to produce anything that is noble, you must have the higher knowledge first, and descend to all lower service; condescend as much as you like,--condescension never does any man any harm,--but get your noble standing first. So, then, without any scruple, whatever branch of art you may be inclined as a student here to follow,--whatever you are to make your bread by, I say, so far as you have time and power, make yourself first a noble and accomplished artist; understand at least what noble and accomplished art is, and then {{you will be able to}} apply your knowledge to all service whatsoever.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade wind {{turbines}} {{have proven to be}} a promising source of renewable power. Wind turbines are generally placed in remote locations and are subject to harsh environmental conditions throughout their lifetimes. Consequently, the failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause loss of revenue due to long down times. Asset management in wind turbines can aid in assessing and improving the reliability and availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Maintenance policies {{play an important role in}} asset management and different maintenance models have been developed for wind turbine applications. Typically, mathematical models for maintenance optimization provide either an age <b>based</b> or a <b>condition</b> <b>based</b> preventive maintenance schedule. Age based preventive maintenance schedules provide the owner with the possibility to financially plan for maintenance activities for the entire lifetime of the wind turbine by providing the expected number of replacements for each component. However, age based preventive maintenance schedule may not consume the operating life of the wind turbine components to the maximum. <b>Condition</b> <b>based</b> maintenance scheduling has the advantage of better utilizing the operating life of the components. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age <b>based</b> and <b>condition</b> <b>based</b> maintenance scheduling. This paper also presents an artificial neural network (ANN) <b>based</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring method which utilizes data from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to detect failures in wind turbine components and systems. The procedures to construct ANN models for condition monitoring application are outlined. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ANN <b>based</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring method it is applied to a case study from a real wind turbine. Furthermore, a mathematical model is presented together with a case study which presents its application within the maintenance management framework.

The formulation is based on finding a reduced order model that satisfies interpolation <b>based</b> first-order necessary <b>conditions</b> for H 2 optimality and results in a method that is numerically effective and suited for large-scale problems. We provide a new elementary proof of the interpolation <b>based</b> <b>condition</b> that clarifies the importance of the mirror images of the reduced system poles. We also show that the interpolation <b>based</b> <b>condition</b> is equivalent to two types of first-order necessary conditions associated with Lyapunov-based approaches for H 2 optimality. Under some technical hypotheses, local convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed for sufficiently large model order with a linear rate that decreases exponentially with model order.

To study this problem, the well-known Jensen inequality is generalized {{to the case of}} multiple terms by introducing an individual slack weighting matrix for each term, which can be optimized to reduce the conservatism. With the help of the multiple Jensen inequalities and by developing a novel linearizing technique, two novel Lyapunov functional based approaches are established to obtain sufficient stability conditions expressed by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that these new conditions are always less conservative than the existing ones. Moreover, by the positive operator theory, a single LMI <b>based</b> <b>condition</b> and a spectral radius <b>based</b> <b>condition</b> are obtained <b>based</b> on an existing sufficient stability condition expressed by coupled LMIs.
