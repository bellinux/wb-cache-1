40|$|This {{technical}} note describes factors affecting batch leaching of metals from dredged material. Factors evaluated include time of sediment-water contact, sedi-ment salinity regime, and sediment oxidation status. Background Contaminated dredged material is often placed in confined disposal facilities where movement of contaminants by leachate {{is an important}} environmental con-cern. No laboratory testing protocol has been routinely applied to predict leachate quality and quantity from confined dredged material disposal facilities. In 1984, the US Army Corps of Engineers initiated investigations of confined disposal facility (CDF) leachate by developing a theoretical framework for prediction of leachate quality based on mass transport theory. The theoretical framework in-cluded both <b>batch</b> and column <b>testing</b> in an integrated approach. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> provides a quick, relatively easy method for determining the distribution of con-taminants between dredged material and leachate. Equilibrium distribution (partitioning) coefficients derived from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> can then be used to relate leachate contaminant concentrations to solid phase contaminant concentrations. Column testing more closely approximates contaminant losses under field condi-tions in a CDF than do <b>batch</b> <b>tests.</b> Leachate results predicted by <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{can be compared to}} those observed from column leaching experiments by combining column tests results, distribution coefficients from <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> and mass transport theory.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the {{distillation}} time on the yield and chemical composition of the bark essential oil of Cedrelopsis grevei Baill. was investigated. Distillation kinetics were determined for three batches of bark sampled from two sites, i. e., Itampolo (batches IT 1 and IT 2) and Salary (SAL), located in a region {{in the south of}} Madagascar with characteristically large populations of C. grevei. The bark samples were subjected to steam distillation, and the essential oil was collected at 3 -h intervals. The total yield (calculated after 14  h of distillation) varied from 0. 9 to 1. 7 %, according to the <b>batch</b> <b>tested.</b> Moreover, the essential oils obtained were characterized by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. During the course of the distillation, the relative percentages of the most volatile components (monoterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons) diminished progressively, whereas the least volatile ones (oxygenated derivatives) increased at a consistent rate. Principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (AHC) of the results, performed on 13 principal components, allowed distinguishing three chemical groups, corresponding to the three batches, irrespective of the distillation time. This indicated that the chemical variability currently observed with commercial samples is not mainly linked to the experimental conditions of the extraction process, as the distillation time did not significantly alter the chemical composition of the essential oils...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{has been}} associated with intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin (Ig), and plasma donations used to prepare IV Ig are now screened to prevent transmission. Thirty-six patients from the United Kingdom received infusions from a batch of anti-HCV antibody-screened intravenous Ig (Gammagard; Baxter Healthcare Ltd., Thetford, Norfolk, England) that was associated with reports of acute hepatitis C outbreak in Europe. The aim {{of this study was to}} document the epidemiology of this outbreak. METHODS: Forty-six patients from the United Kingdom treated with Gammagard (34 exposed and 12 unexposed to the batch) returned epidemiological questionnaires. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent of the exposed patients (28 of 34) became positive for HCV RNA. Eighteen percent of the patients (6 of 34) who had infusions with this <b>batch</b> <b>tested</b> negative for HCV RNA, but 2 of the patients had abnormal liver function and subsequently seroconverted to anti-HCV antibody positive. Twenty-seven percent of the patients (9 of 34) developed jaundice, and 79 % (27 of 34) had abnormal liver transferase levels. Virus isolates (n= 21), including an isolate from the implicated batch, were genotype 1 a and virtually identical by sequence analysis of the NS 5 region, consistent with transmission from a single source. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C infection can be transmitted by anti-HCV-screened IV Ig.

40|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{to measure}} maximum acetate {{utilization}} rates {{were used to}} determine the distribution of acetate utilizers in expanded-bed sand and expanded-bed granular activated carbon (GAC) reactors. The reactors were fed a mixture of acetate and 3 -ethylphenol, and they contained the same predominant aceticlastic methanogen, Methanothrix sp. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> were performed both on the entire reactor contents and with media removed from the reactors. Results indicated that activity was evenly distributed within the GAC reactors, whereas in the sand reactor a sludge blanket on top of the sand bed contained approximately 50 % of the activity. The Monod half-velocity constant (Ks) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens in two expanded-bed GAC reactors was searched for by combining steady-state results with <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> data. All parameters necessary to develop a model with Monod kinetics were experimentally determined except for Ks. However, Ks was a function of the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration, and <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> results demonstrated that maximum acetate utilization rates were not a function of the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration. Addition of a competitive inhibition term into the Monod expression predicted the dependence of Ks on the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration. A two-parameter search determined a Ks of 8. 99 mg of acetate per liter and a Ki of 2. 41 mg of 3 -ethylphenol per liter. Model predictions were in agreement with experimental observations for all effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentrations. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> measured the activity for a specific substrate and determined the distribution of activity in the reactor.

The most efficient population for pyrite oxidation was composed of the three bacterial species. The influence of the relative abundance of the different strains in the inoculum was studied. The cobalt solubilization rate obtained with #T. ferrooxidans$ increased when #L. ferrooxidans$ was present but was not affected by the initial concentration of #L. ferrooxidans$. The bioleaching with #T. ferrooxidans$ was only improved by adding #T. thiooxidans$ when the initial concentration of #T. thiooxidans$ was higher than the initial concentration of #T. ferrooxidans$.

40|$|A {{spheroidal}} composite inorganic sorbent {{was developed}} for U. S. Department of Energy-Efficient Separations and Processing Crosscutting Program (USDOE-ESP) for potential use in removing radioactive cesium isotopes from acidic high-salt waste streams such as those at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The sorbent, zirconium monohydrogen phosphate (ZrHP) embedded with fine powder of ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP), was prepared using a unique internal gelation process {{which can be used}} to make porous reproducible microspheres that are structurally strong, have a low tendency for surface erosion, and improve the flow dynamics for column operations. Both ZrHP and AMP are excellent sorbent materials and, being inorganic, are stable in high radiation fields. AMP is a very effective sorbent for removing cesium from salt-bearing waste streams for a wide range of acidity. In the pH range of 2 to 10, ZrHP is also a very effective sorbent for removing Cs, Sr, Th, U(VI), Pu(IV), Am(III), Hg, and Pb from streams of lower ionic concentrations. Crucial to developing the spheroidal AMP-ZrHP sorbent was to determine the ideal weight percentage of AMP that could be embedded in the ZrHP microspheres in order to maintain the structural integrity of the microspheres and also achieve a good cesium separation. A total of 12 preparations were made. The dry weight percentage of AMP ranged from 30 to 60. Overall, the best composite microspheres prepared contained 50 % AMP (by dry weight measurement).

40|$|This study {{focussed}} on {{the reduced}} platen compression (RPC) {{testing of the}} cancellous bone of the proximal tibia. The objective {{of this study was}} to improve the current testing methods with an emphasis on the location of the RPC specimens, and to correlate the mechanical properties of the rodent cancellous bone with the various density measures. Analytical studies were made to assess the effect of the size and shape of the platen based on the values from mechanical testing of the cancellous bone. RPC specimens are made from transverse slices of the proximal tibia metaphysis. Specimen location was determined using planar radiograph method at a distance of 1. 75 mm distal to the growth plate. The distance from the top of the proximal tibia to the line at 1. 75 mm distal to the growth plate was measured and this distance is termed as the first cut distance. Specimen thickness of 2 mm was then cut for the RPC test. Endocortical method was followed to determine the platen sizing for RPC testing. The cancellous bone was then tested in compression to failure. Correlations were performed between the mechanical properties of the cancellous bone and the density measures from pQCT and radiographic techniques. SigmaStat and TableCurve 2 D were used to perform the correlations and estimate the P value for the correlation. Linear and power law fits were made for all the correlations. Based on this study, several improvements to the reduced platen compression test were recommended. An improved specimen location method was developed. However, it requires a corrective distance to account for the tissue that cannot be identified in the radiographic analysis. A new method for estimating the density of the cancellous bone that is directly tested by the platen was developed. Correlations between the density of the cancellous bone and the mechanical properties show that, there is a strong correlation between ultimate stress and aluminum layer intensity. Elastic modulus correlates best with the last <b>batch</b> <b>tested</b> in this study.

40|$|Waste rock dumps at {{coal mines}} in the Elk Valley {{are the primary}} source of {{selenium}} (Se) in the Elk River. The mobile Se oxyanions, Se(IV) and Se(VI), can be adsorbed to mineral phases or reduced biotically or abiotically to Se solid phases, such as Se(0). Microbial analyses and geochemical testing were conducted to determine if Se can be sequestered in anoxic coal waste rock by these mechanisms. Testing was conducted on a waste rock sample collected from the West Line Creek waste rock dump in the Elk Valley and a water sample collected from the rock drain flowing beneath the dump. Microbial analyses included culturing with plate and broth media and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The key finding from these analyses was that bacteria capable of reducing Se(VI) to Se(0) were present in the waste rock sample and bacteria capable of reducing Se(IV) to Se(0) were present in the rock drain water sample. Geochemical <b>tests</b> included abiotic <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock and pure minerals, non-sterile <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock, and desorption <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on waste rock, as well as several solids analysis techniques, such as X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at circumneutral pH in an anoxic glove box to simulate an anoxic zone of a waste rock dump. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> on pure minerals present in the waste rock sample determined that siderite can reduce Se(VI) to Se(IV) and that siderite, pyrite, and sphalerite can adsorb Se(IV) and reduce Se(IV) to Se(0).

The observed values of Kp stabilized when the soil solids concentration was above a certain value. Typical Kp values obtained from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> conducted under high soil solids concentrations were close to those obtained from column tests.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A {{modified}} equation {{from that}} of Nancollas and Reddy is presented to describe the rate of calcium removed from water in CacO 3; precipitation. The mass of CaCO 3; precipitated at any moment was obtained by monitoring pH and utilizing this in the equilibrium equations for the Ca - H 2 CO 3 system including ion pairing and ionic strength effects. Both batch and back mixing steady state conditions were studied. The precipitation rate constant {{was found to be}} independent of pH, and functionally related to the state of initial supersaturation in the <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> and the state of supersaturation in the steady state tests. Both steady state and <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> gave the same dependence of the precipitation rate constant with supersaturation...|$|R

The removal efficiencies of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole by an MBR were systematically examined and compared under near-anoxic (DO 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 0. 5 mg/L) and aerobic (DO 3 ̆e 2 mg/L) conditions. Preliminary <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> confirmed that sulfamethoxazole is amenable to both aerobic and anoxic biotransformation. However, carbamazepine-a known persistent compound-showed degradation only under an anoxic environment. In good agreement with the <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> during near-anoxic operation, under a high loading of 750 J. l 82 ̆ 2 /Ld, an exceptionally high removal (68 ± 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{hospital}} wastes {{produced during}} the course of health-care activities pose a threat to public health and environment than any other type of wastes. In the present paper physiochemical properties of the incinerated solid waste sample such as sampling, <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> operation, sequential extraction and chemical speciation have been studied. The results show that the concentration of heavy metals decreases with increase in L/S ratio. <b>Batch</b> <b>test</b> analyse shows the static view of leachate produced by the ash and sequential extraction shows the potential mobility of heavy metals. Chemical speciation and distribution of heavy metals varied greatly this trend was due to the higher ion exchange capacity of the extractants and formation of anionic metal species, leading to more metal species leaching out of each chemical fraction...|$|R
