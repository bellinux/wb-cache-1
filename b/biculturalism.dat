25|$|In {{reaction}} to events in Quebec and formal {{demands of the}} Lesage government, Lester Pearson's ruling Liberal government in Ottawa sought to address the new political assertiveness of Quebec. He commissioned the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> in 1963. Pearson also recruited Pierre Trudeau, who campaigned against the violation of civil liberties under Duplessis and {{the economic and political}} marginalization of French Quebecers in the 1950s. Trudeau saw official bilingualism in Canada as the best way of remedying this.|$|E
25|$|Trudeau's {{first major}} {{legislative}} push was implementing {{the majority of}} recommendations of Pearson's Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> via the Official Languages Act, which made French and English the co-equal official languages of the Federal government. More controversial than the declaration (which was backed by the NDP and, with some opposition in caucus, the PCs) was {{the implementation of the}} Act's principles: between 1966 and 1976, the francophone proportion of the civil service and military doubled, causing alarm in some sections of anglophone Canada that they were being disadvantaged.|$|E
25|$|Canada adopted {{its first}} Official Languages Act in 1969, in {{response}} to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism.</b> The current Official Languages Act was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's efforts to address two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of linguistic minority communities. As well, following the adoption in 1982 of the Charter of Rights, it was necessary to create a legislative framework within which the Government of Canada could respect its new constitutional obligations regarding the official languages.|$|E
25|$|Pearson {{also started}} {{a number of}} Royal Commissions, {{including}} the Royal Commission on the Status of Women and the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism.</b> These suggested changes that helped create legal equality for women, and brought official bilingualism into being. After Pearson's term in office, French was made an official language, and the Canadian government provided services in both English and French. Pearson himself had hoped {{that he would be}} the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada and fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for candidates for Prime Minister after Pearson left office.|$|E
25|$|Easton was {{a member}} of the {{executive}} committee of the Inter-University Consortium for Political Research (1962–64); chairman of the Committee on Information and Behavioral Sciences Division, National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (1968–70); and a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University (1957–58). He has served as a consultant to The Brookings Institution (1955); the Mental Health Research Institute of the University of Michigan (1955–56); the Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> (1964–66); and as a Ford Professor (1960–61), funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation. Easton also served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Political Methodology, Youth and Society, and International Political Science Abstracts, and was editor of Varieties of Political Theory (1966).|$|E
25|$|During Pearson's time as Prime Minister, his Liberal {{minority}} governments introduced {{universal health}} care, student loans, the Canada Pension Plan, the Order of Canada, and the Maple Leaf flag. His Liberal government also unified Canada's armed forces. Pearson convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism,</b> {{and he kept}} Canada out of the Vietnam War. In 1967, his government passed Bill C-168, which de facto abolished capital punishment in Canada by restricting it to a few capital offenses {{for which it was}} never used, and which themselves were abolished in 1976. With these accomplishments, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian Prime Ministers.|$|E
25|$|With the Quiet Revolution, Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> {{and later}} the October Crisis the party's {{position}} on the national question {{became the subject of}} broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the Canadian Labour Congress to work with the Quebec Federation of Labour on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate class-based programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal's mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of Québec solidaire. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the Parti Quebecois.|$|E

Cisneros was quoted by Robin Ganz as saying that she is grateful to have [...] "twice as many words to pick from...two {{ways of looking at}} the world," [...] and Ganz referred to her [...] "wide range of experience" [...] as a [...] "double-edged sword." [...] Cisneros's ability to speak two languages and to write about her two cultures gives her a unique position from where she is able to tell not just her story, but also the stories of those around her.|$|E

2500|$|Official {{bilingualism}} {{should not}} be confused with personal bilingualism, which is the capacity of a person to speak two languages. This distinction was articulated in the 1967 report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism,</b> which stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2016, the {{university}} was the world's largest English-French bilingual university. The university {{is one of the}} three bilingual universities in Ontario that is not federated with a larger university. Since its inception {{the university}} has seen itself as fostering English-French bilingualism. However, bilingualism was only made an official university policy in 1965 when the Government of Ontario passed An Act respecting Université d'Ottawa through the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Section 4 of that Act specifically states that an object and purpose of the university is"to further bilingualism and <b>biculturalism</b> and to preserve and develop French culture in Ontario", and [...] "to further ... Christian principles". [...] Despite that law, these parts of the university's mandate are now arguably superseded by the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalizes multiculturalism (not <b>biculturalism)</b> and freedom of religion.|$|E
2500|$|From 1963 to 1971, Rudnyckyj was {{a member}} of the Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> and with others {{promoted}} the idea of a multilingual Canada which recognized the importance of regional languages. His contribution to the Fourth Book of the Report of the Royal Commission, which dealt with the needs and contributions of [...] "other ethnic groups" [...] to Canadian society, was substantial and directly led to the promulgation of the new policy of [...] "Multiculturalism" [...] by the federal government of Canada, and thereafter, by several provinces as well.|$|E
2500|$|As Levitt has shown, {{attitudes of}} historians, both Anglophone and Francophone, toward Bourassa {{consistently}} have been colored by {{the position of}} each historian on the major issues Bourassa addressed. Goldwin Smith, a fellow anti-imperialist, introduced him into historical literature in 1902. The isolationism of the 1930s and the <b>biculturalism</b> of the 1960s (Bourassa, while a champion of Francophone rights, always opposed separatism) occasioned favourable treatment among Anglophones, while Lionel Groulx, his one-time foe, described him as [...] "l'incomparable Éveilleur." [...] Bourassa's position on social issues - Catholic, moderately reformist, emphasizing the family and agricultural values - likewise has called forth praise and blame.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} Reid's second book, Lament for a Notion, is {{an allusion to}} George Grant's 1965 classic, Lament for a Nation. [...] Reid asserts in this work that Canada's system of {{official}} bilingualism has been an expensive failure, based on a utopian model developed by former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau rather than on what Reid suggests is the more practical model of [...] "territorial bilingualism", proposed by the 1963-1970 Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> (B Commission). [...] He also argues that the existing system of bilingualism costs the Canadian economy four billion dollars every year to sustain.|$|E
2500|$|English-speaking Canada showed {{concern at}} the changes {{happening}} in Quebec {{society and the}} protests of the Québécois. In 1963, Canada's Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson, asked the famous question, [...] "What does Quebec want?" [...] as he instituted a royal commission of enquiry into bilingualism and <b>biculturalism</b> to find an answer for this question, and to propose measures to satisfy {{the demands of the}} Québécois. French-speaking communities beyond Quebec were also pushing for increased linguistic and cultural accommodations; in 1965 the report of the Laurendeau-Dunton royal commission recommended making French an official language in the parliaments of Canada, the provincial assemblies of Ontario and New Brunswick, in federal tribunals and in all federal government administration of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, Locke was {{probably}} {{best known as}} a children's writer. In the 1960s, when Locke began contributing to the New Zealand School Journal (published by the School Publication Branch of the Department of Education) her career as a writer became truly established. She was commissioned by the School Publication Branch to write a series of historical booklets from 1962 to 1968, designed to educate children about New Zealand's social history, and later compiled in The Kauri and the Willow: How we Lived and Grew from 1801–1942 (1984). While writing these series Locke realised her lack of knowledge about Māori language, culture, history, and spirituality. This led her to study the language, and incorporate <b>biculturalism</b> as a central feature of her writing long before it was fashionable to do so. According to The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature, she expressed the Māori point of view [...] "with sympathy and insight in novels that in this respect were in advance of general perceptions and political correctness".|$|E
2500|$|Lesage's {{statement}} to the Quebec National Assembly that the French Canadian identity, culture, and language were endangered by a [...] "cultural invasion from the USA," [...] which threatened to make Canada a [...] "cultural satellite of the United States" [...] mirrored exactly the Gaullists concern for France's cultural survival in the face on an English onslaught. In this light, France and Quebec set about in the early 1960s negotiating exchange agreements {{in the areas of}} education, culture, technical cooperation, and youth exchange. The federal government of Lester B. Pearson, which had just appointed a Royal Commission on Bilingualism and <b>Biculturalism</b> and was taking other steps to ensure the place of French within Canada, would not stand for a province usurping a federal power (foreign policy), and so signed a Master Agreement with France in 1965 that allowed for provinces to cooperate directly with France, but only in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction (such as education).|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1952, a mere {{five days}} before King George VI's death, that Vincent Massey became the first Canadian-born person to be {{appointed}} as a governor general in Canada since the Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal was made Governor General of New France on 1 January 1755, {{as well as the}} first not to be elevated to the peerage since Sir Edmund Walker Head in 1854. There was some trepidation about this departure from tradition and Massey was intended to be a compromise: he was known to embody loyalty, dignity, and formality, as expected from a viceroy. As his viceregal tenure neared an end, it was thought that Massey, an anglophone, should be followed by a francophone Canadian; and so, in spite of his Liberal Party attachments, Georges Vanier was chosen by Conservative prime minister John Diefenbaker as the next governor general. Vanier was subsequently appointed by Queen Elizabeth II in person at a meeting of her Canadian Cabinet, thus initiating the convention of alternating between individuals from Canada's two main linguistic groups. This move did not, however, placate those who were fostering the new Quebec nationalist movement, for whom the monarchy and other federal institutions were a target for attack. Though Vanier was a native of Quebec and fostered <b>biculturalism,</b> he was not immune to the barbs of the province's sovereigntists and, when he attended la Fête St-Jean-Baptiste in Montreal in 1964, a group of separatists held placards reading [...] "Vanier vendu" [...] ("Vanier sold out") and [...] "Vanier fou de la Reine" [...] ("Vanier Queen's jester").|$|E
