5|$|Scholars {{continue}} to debate whether Chacoan organization {{was based on}} primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its function as the region's ceremonial center. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> little to no modern excavation in the canyon, the question remains largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no Supreme Court {{decision}} {{on the issue of}} what exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law. However, because {{there have been so many}} divergent opinions and fact specific determinations from subsequent cases, it is not likely that the case would be strictly followed by other courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Catalan from the Occitan sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a consciousness of its being different from Occitan since the later Middle Ages {{and because the}} elaboration (Ausbau) processes of Catalan and Occitan (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars {{point out that the}} process that led to the affirmation of Catalan as a distinct language from Occitan started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.|$|E

500|$|Despite Cissé's two goals, {{there had}} been {{speculation}} linking Liverpool with re-signing Michael Owen, who had left the club for Real Madrid a year earlier. Liverpool fans had even chanted Owen's name during the match, singing, [...] "There's only one Michael Owen." [...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important for me, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{a lot of speculation}} about me of late and about my position within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated the importance of the two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he can do and great credit to him. We're the players – it's up to us to play and the management decides which players we have." [...] Carragher confirmed that Liverpool missed their captain Gerrard, but was delighted to win the match despite this.|$|E
500|$|Scully finally {{gives in}} and {{contacts}} Mulder; she tells Doggett that before Mulder left, {{they had worked}} out a plan that, if Mulder was to return, he would be arriving by train. [...] Doggett urges Scully to contact Mulder and {{tell him not to}} come, fearing that the Shadow Man is a set up, and that Mulder is in harm's way. [...] Scully replies that she wants to see Mulder, and that it is too late to call it off. [...] Reyes, Doggett, and the husband/NSA agent cover Scully at the train station. However, as the train pulls up, the Shadow Man appears and guns down the husband/agent before approaching Scully. Before the Shadow Man can kill Scully, Doggett appears and shoots him twice, sending him falling onto the train tracks, where the train seemingly runs over him without stopping. [...] <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a shooting, much to Scully's dismay, a train employee radios to the conductor to keep the train moving and not to stop at that station.|$|E
500|$|The USAF {{continues}} {{to rely on}} the B-52 because it remains an effective and economical heavy bomber in the absence of sophisticated air defenses, particularly in the type of missions that have been conducted {{since the end of the}} Cold War against nations with limited defensive capabilities. The B-52 has also continued in service <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no reliable replacement. The B-52 has the capacity to [...] "loiter" [...] for extended periods, and can deliver precision standoff and direct fire munitions from a distance, in addition to direct bombing. It has been a valuable asset in supporting ground operations during conflicts such as Operation Iraqi Freedom. The B-52 had the highest mission capable rate of the three types of heavy bombers operated by the USAF in the 2000–2001 period. The B-1 averaged a 53.7% ready rate, the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit achieved 30.3%, while the B-52 averaged 80.5%. The B-52's $72,000 cost per hour of flight is more than the B-1B's $63,000 cost per hour, but less than the B-2's $135,000 per hour.|$|E

500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> this new life breathed into the band {{with the addition of}} Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E

One hundred years later (2000), the total {{increased}} to 80.5% (3,064,862); not <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an influx of whites toward the island (or an exodus of non-White people), but a change of race conceptions, mainly because of Puerto Rican elites to portray Puerto Rico's image as the [...] "white island of the Antilles", partly as a response to scientific racism.|$|E

Chapters 4–10 contain a series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce). [...] Chapter 11 is God's lament over the {{necessity}} of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is {{a large part of}} the people of Israel, whom God loves. [...] God promises not to give them up entirely. Then, in Chapter 12, the prophet pleads for Israel's repentance. [...] Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of Assyria, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no repentance. [...] In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial began}} on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying {{on day one}} and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to mean {{so much to me}} {{over a long period of}} time. The closest you could come is to say, 'How do you feel about your children?'" [...] Rowling also revealed that the lawsuit has [...] "decimated her creative work" [...] over the prior month, causing her to cease work on a new novel. In his testimony, Vander Ark said that he too had had reserves about publishing the encyclopedia and that the publishing company had talked him into it. [...] "It's been difficult <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a lot of criticism, obviously, and that was never the intention. ... This has been an important part of my life for the last nine years or so," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Air {{travel and}} the other methods of travel which have made global {{interaction}} easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the BCG vaccine was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and miliary TB in childhood. [...] But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are rifampicin and isoniazid. [...] There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB. [...] The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant TB {{is also known as}} [...] "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis." [...] "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" [...] is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of [...] "second-line" [...] antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, it is still important to put in the effort to help and treat patients with [...] "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" [...] in poor countries.|$|E

2500|$|He {{held the}} {{position}} of vice president of public affairs for the Church of Scientology International in 2009, and was a Reverend within the organization. Adams traveled to Melbourne, Australia in December 2009 for the World Religions Conference. In an appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program hosted by Tony Eastley, AM, Adams stated, [...] "From one church in 1954 to ... we're in 165 nations now; we have 8,000 churches, missions and groups right across this fair earth of ours." [...] Adams disputed assertions of abuse within Scientology publicized {{on the floor of}} the Australian Senate by Senator Nick Xenophon and commented, [...] "It's not that the allegations aren't serious charges; the fact of the matter is that they are unsubstantiated rumours. Many of these so-called charges, so-called allegations are very old. I mean, 12 or 15 years ago, these incidents occurred, were thoroughly reviewed." [...] Regarding statements by Senator Xenophon that women within Scientology who became pregnant were pressured into having abortions, Adams said, [...] "That's someone's statement of... it's totally false. There's no proof whatsoever; no one has ever made... no one has come forward and said here's the proof." [...] Adams asserted to The Age that all of the critical statements made by Senator Xenophon about Scientology in the Australian Senate were [...] "meritless". He commented, [...] "One way to measure that is how law enforcement responds to any of these allegations. There has been no interest <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no evidence. Apostates are not credible witnesses, like former spouses or employees - they are trying to find a reason why they departed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Media {{coverage}} of the spill was intense {{from the moment the}} oil reached the shore. [...] The spill was the major headline in many morning newspapers on February 5, also receiving wide coverage on radio and television. [...] The same morning, a U.S. Senate subcommittee interviewed local officials as well as Fred Hartley, president of Union Oil, on the disaster in the making. [...] Three major television networks were there along with over 50 reporters, the largest media turnout for any Senate subcommittee meeting since the Committee on Foreign Relations discussed the Vietnam War. [...] During the meeting, local officials made their case that the Federal government had a conflict of interest, in that they were making money from the same drilling they were mandated to oversee and regulate. [...] Hartley defended Union's record and denied that the event was a disaster: [...] "I don't like to call it a disaster, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no loss of human life. [...] I am amazed at the publicity for the loss of a few birds." [...] Most controversially, offshore drilling operations – all of which were suspended immediately on February 3, by direct request of the Walter Hickel Secretary of the Interior, pending a [...] "complete reevaluation and reassessment of the situation" [...] – had resumed after just a break of several hours, just long enough for a closed-door meeting between oil company representatives and Department of the Interior officials. [...] Local officials, not invited to the meeting, were furious that [...] "complete reevaluation and reassessment" [...] could have occurred in such a short time, and in a meeting that excluded them; the fierce exchange was covered on national television, along with grim footage of the thousands of dying birds on the tarred beaches of Santa Barbara, and the spontaneous efforts of hundreds of civilian volunteers to pile straw on the oil, scrub rocks with detergent, and struggle to save a few of the less-oiled birds.|$|E
