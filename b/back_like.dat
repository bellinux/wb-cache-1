5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its <b>back</b> <b>like</b> a scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|E
25|$|Jie {{was also}} a known alcoholic, {{but he did not}} drink regular wine. He drank a type of pure alcohol wine (清醇). The people working for him who could not supply this drink were killed.

25|$|I {{remember}} {{one set of}} twins in particular: Guido and Ina, aged about four. One day, Mengele took them away. When they returned, {{they were in a}} terrible state: they had been sewn together, back to <b>back,</b> <b>like</b> Siamese twins. Their wounds were infected and oozing pus. They screamed day and night. Then their parents—I remember the mother's name was Stella—managed to get some morphine and they killed the children in order to end their suffering.|$|E
25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her {{what she would do}} if Leslie went away and never came <b>back.</b> <b>Like</b> Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her <b>back.</b> <b>Like</b> auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E

25|$|The rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum {{is almost}} {{the size of a}} small rabbit. It is grey to reddish-grey in colour on the back, while its underside is a light cream colour. It has white hair patches underneath its small, round ears and both above and below the eyes. A mid-dorsal stripe runs from the crown of the head to the middle of the <b>back.</b> <b>Like</b> other possums, it has a prehensile tail, adapted for grasping especially by wrapping around. However, the tail is unique in its appearance compared to that of other possums as it is covered with fur only halfway down. Males are 33.4 to 37.5cm long while females are generally bigger and range from 34.9 to 38.3cm in length and weigh between 1,280 and 2,000grams. Another uncommon feature in the appearance of this species is that it has vertical pupils.|$|E
25|$|The {{ordinary}} Bohra {{is highly}} conscious of his identity, {{and this is}} especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a topi), and women wear the rida, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns and lace. The rida's difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern and lace. The rida does not call for covering of women's faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the 'pardi' that usually hangs on the <b>back</b> <b>like</b> {{the hood of a}} jacket but it is not used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community's values of equality and justice for women, which they believe, is a tenet of the Fatimid Imamate's evolved understanding of Islam and the true meaning of women's chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community.|$|E
500|$|Verdi {{received}} the draft libretto {{a few weeks}} later, by early July 1889, {{at a time when}} his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote <b>back.</b> <b>Like</b> Boito, Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare. The composer did not speak English, but he owned and frequently re-read Shakespeare's plays in Italian translations by Carlo Rusconi and Giulio Carcano, which he kept by his bedside. He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare's Macbeth (in 1847) and Othello (in 1887) and had considered King Lear as a subject; Boito had suggested Antony and Cleopatra.|$|E

500|$|... "Baby Boy" [...] is {{considered}} to be a sequel in ways to [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde"; a 2002 Jay-Z song featuring Beyoncé. The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Beyoncé's deemed them as personal to her. Paul remarked, [...] "She's telling me about her fantasies and picturing me and her going here and there, all over the world... I'm answering <b>back,</b> <b>like,</b> 'I'm wit it'." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the toast–chorus–verse form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other verses and choruses. The pattern is repeated twice; a further chorus and verse follow, resolving at the toasting and final verse.|$|E
500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). But {{to me it was}} so much bullshit. The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we on the front line were running <b>back</b> <b>like</b> rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E

He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats.

500|$|Lionsgate, in {{association}} with Matriarch/Geffen Records released the soundtrack online as a digital download on November 3, 2009, and in stores on November 23. Daniels confirmed that there are plans to release Blige's [...] "I Can See in Color" [...] as a single from the soundtrack. The song was written by Blige, Raphael Saadiq and LaNeah Menzies and is produced by Raphael Saadiq. The soundtrack consists of various artists (Labelle, Donna Allen, Jean Carn, Sunny Gale, and MFSB); with some artists having recorded songs that were covers and other songs that were recorded specifically for the album. The album received positive praise; mainly the song [...] "I Can See In Color" [...] - which was released as a single - that was recorded and co-written by Blige. The trailer features the song [...] "Destiny" [...] taken from Blige's 2001 album No More Drama. A song titled [...] "My Good Lovin' (<b>Back</b> <b>Like</b> That Remix)", featuring Da Brat and Lil' Mo, was featured in the film but exempted from the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a <b>back</b> <b>like</b> Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 26, NFL.com analyst Lance Zierlein {{wrote that}} the Bears' five biggest needs {{entering}} the draft were at outside linebacker, nose tackle, offensive line, safety, and wide receiver. The general consensus regarding the Bears' seventh-overall pick was to select an edge rusher like Vic Beasley (Clemson), Dante Fowler (Florida), Shane Ray (Missouri) and Randy Gregory (Nebraska), though WBBM-TV's Greg Gabriel believed the Bears should trade down from the pick, with players like Arik Armstead (Oregon), Danny Shelton (Washington), Eddie Goldman (Florida State), Jordan Phillips (Oklahoma) and Malcom Brown (Texas) being fits for the Bears' new 3–4 defense if the Bears were to trade down to a spot between 10th and 20th. Another suggested position to draft with the first-rounder was wide receiver, particularly Alabama's Amari Cooper, who, despite not being considered [...] "a true need, a talent like his would be tough to pass up here." [...] A defensive position considered for the pick was nose tackle; Sports Illustrated writer Andy Staples believed a 3–4 defense should focus on NT, and as a result, the Bears should draft Shelton, followed by a linebacker in later rounds, such as Eric Kendricks (UCLA), Benardrick McKinney (Mississippi State), Stephone Anthony (Clemson) and Paul Dawson (TCU) in the second round, and afterwards, draft a running <b>back</b> <b>like</b> Buck Allen (USC) or Mike Davis (South Carolina).|$|E

500|$|Blek is {{a puzzle}} {{game in which}} the player draws a [...] "snake-like" [...] black line on the screen that is {{recorded}} and played <b>back</b> <b>like</b> a pattern, recurring repeatedly across the screen. The object is {{to draw a line}} that it will remove colored dot targets when it repeats across the screen without hitting a black dot. Lines that travel off the top or bottom of the screen reset the level, while lines that travel off the left or right of the screen reflect back towards the dots. Aside from repeating the player's drawn pattern, the stroke mimics the player's pace in drawing the stroke. The game begins with no prompt or tutorial other than to use a finger on the screen and experiment. The first puzzles are [...] "on open, white canvasses" [...] where the player can solve the simple puzzles [...] "by accident". The 80 levels progress in difficulty and require more complex solutions. Added elements include a [...] "chain reaction" [...] dot that launches other dots when struck. Its sound consists of a [...] "whoosh" [...] that accompanies the traveling stroke, a [...] "chime" [...] when colored dots are hit, and a human [...] "disappointed grumble" [...] when black dots are hit, resetting the level. The game is depicted in flat, plain colors, with no pause feature and no option menu other than Game Center achievements. Players navigate between puzzles using three small onscreen icons. There are no in-app purchases or in-game advertisements.|$|E
