These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of defamation suits.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the BEA's {{preliminary}} report, the investigation into Lubitz found he had been treated for suicidal tendencies prior to his training as a commercial pilot and had been temporarily denied a US pilot's license because of these treatments for depression. The final report of the BEA confirmed the preliminary report's findings, saying the co-pilot began showing symptoms of psychotic depression. For five years, Lubitz had frequently been unable to sleep {{because of what he}} believed were vision problems; he consulted over forty doctors and feared he was going blind. Motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that blindness would cause him to lose his pilot's licence, he began conducting online research about methods of committing suicide before deciding to crash Flight 9525.|$|E

Pandora was imprisoned in the labyrinth by Zeus when he was infected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> released from Pandora's Box. Kratos rescued Pandora after he learned {{that she was the}} key to pacifying the Flame of Olympus that surrounded Pandora's Box. Kratos reluctantly allowed Pandora to sacrifice herself to open the Box and mourned her death, as Pandora reminded him of his deceased child Calliope. Pandora reappeared in Kratos' psyche and helped him find the power of hope locked deep inside himself, which allowed him to overcome and kill Zeus. The character was voiced by Natalie Lander in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance {{continued}} unchecked through February, {{its forces}} moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri {{on the first}} day of fighting, and later the city of Byumba. As with the previous RPF advances, the Hutu civilians in the area fled en masse from the areas the RPF were taking, travelling back into the government-controlled territory. These exoduses were likely driven primarily <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of the RPF established by years of propaganda, although the RPF soldiers were guilty in some areas of small scale killing of Hutu civilians. Prunier attributes this to a combination of retribution for the massacre of Tutsi perpetrated in these areas in late January, as well as some indiscriminate killing. This RPF violence increased the fear felt by the Hutu population, but also served to further alienate the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.|$|E

25|$|When {{news of this}} {{reached the}} American {{authorities}} at Boston, they hurriedly made plans to drive the British from the area. The Penobscot River was the gateway to lands controlled by the Penobscot Indians who generally favored the British. Congress feared that if a fort were successfully constructed {{at the mouth of}} the river, any chance of enlisting the Penobscots as allies would be lost. Massachusetts was also motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of losing their claim over the territory to rival states in any post-war settlement.|$|E
25|$|A second {{mission was}} set up in India by another former businessman, Colin Mackenzie of J. and P. Coats, a {{clothing}} manufacturer. Mackenzie's India Mission originally operated from Meerut in North West India. Its location was governed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that the Germans might overrun the Middle East and Caucasus, in which case resistance movements would be established in Afghanistan, Persia and Iraq. When this threat was removed late in 1942 after the battles of Stalingrad and El Alamein, the focus was switched to South East Asia.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-17th century, Ireland was convulsed by {{eleven years}} of warfare, {{beginning}} with the Rebellion of 1641, when Irish Catholics, threatened by expanding power of the anti-Catholic English Parliament and Scottish Covenanters {{at the expense of}} the King, rebelled against English and Protestant domination. The Rising, launched in Ulster by Phelim O'Neill, provoked an outbreak of anarchic violence around the country, after which it was joined by most Irish Catholic lords and their followers. In some respects, the rebellion was the end product of the long term alienation of Irish Catholics with English policies in Ireland. However, it was sparked off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of impending civil war in the British Isles as a whole.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Charles de Gaulle {{government}} {{cleaned up}} the French Penal Code, principally getting rid of the anti-Semitic laws. The article against homosexual relations between adults and minors, however, remained in force until 1982. The homophobic atmosphere of the 1940s-1960s meant that for the returning victims, the possibility of telling their story was thwarted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of further stigmatisation. In his book, Seel also notes an increase of homophobic attacks in Mulhouse, after the war. In his family itself, Seel found a negative reaction to his homosexuality. His closest relatives decided to avoid broaching the subject while other members of the extended family made humiliating jokes. His godfather disinherited him.|$|E

This Reconciliation can only happen once every 200 years. All previous attempts failed; the most recent resulted in the horrific death or madness of those involved. A secret society known as the Tabula Rasa formed after this failure; its directive is to prevent the use of magic on the Earth, motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that such a disaster may occur again.

25|$|In {{the face}} of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the {{following}} Soviet aggressions against Poland and the Baltic countries, Finland's situation seemed increasingly dangerous. On October 4, Finland's government asked if Sweden was prepared to contribute to Åland's defense with military means. The following day, Molotov invited a Finnish delegation to Moscow, with Sweden's parliament being informed the day after. On October 12, {{it turned out that the}} political support was deemed insufficient in Sweden for a military engagement on Åland: the Rightist Party was in favor, the Social Democrats were split, and a majority of the Farmers party (Bondeförbundet) and all the Liberals were opposed. The opposition to Swedish military assistance on Åland was strengthened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that intervention would become extended to Mainland Finland, which few parliamentarians would support.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{first began}} {{developing}} nuclear weapons during World War II under {{the order of}} President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939, motivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that they {{were engaged in a}} race with Nazi Germany to develop such a weapon. After a slow start {{under the direction of the}} National Bureau of Standards, at the urging of British scientists and American administrators, the program was put under the Office of Scientific Research and Development, where in 1942 it was officially transferred under the auspices of the United States Army and became known as the Manhattan Project, an American, British and Canadian joint venture. Under the direction of General Leslie Groves, over thirty different sites were constructed for the research, production, and testing of components related to bomb making. These included the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, under the direction of physicist Robert Oppenheimer, the Hanford plutonium production facility in Washington, and the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee.|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents is {{rife with}} the {{constant}} presence of fear which manifests itself in a seemingly endless variety of outlets. Alvarez depicts quite vividly the fear evoked in the girls' mother, Laura, near the chronological beginning of the book, as she [...] "sees the black V.W. , and her heart plummets right down to her toes". Even after the García family has spent several years in the United States, safe {{from the threat of}} Trujillo's retribution, a relentless paranoia continues to plague Carlos, their father, [...] "who still lives in fear of the SIM and who is afraid to speak of 'revolt' out loud". This initial fear of Carlos' punishment {{for his role in the}} attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the García family’s flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives. The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced.|$|E

[...] Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite [...] "The Raven" [...] and to lecture– in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary salon, a guest noted, [...] "to hear [...] repeat the Raven... is an event in one's life." [...] It was recalled by someone who experienced it, [...] "He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing {{in the center of the}} apartment he would recite... in the most melodious of voices...

500|$|For Final Fantasy XII, Balthier was {{voiced by}} Gideon Emery in English and Hiroaki Hirata in Japanese. Emery commented that while voicing the {{character}} of Balthier, he developed a [...] "small crush" [...] on Fran, Balthier's partner. He also commented that the biggest challenge of voicing Balthier was having to stay consistent, adding that he spent {{more than four hours}} in a small booth while doing the voice, which could cause him to [...] "drift away from the character" [...] if he goes on for too long. He also described him as being similar to the character. Emery auditioned for Balthier, seeing him after he did this and [...] "instantly {{fell in love with the}} character". He described him as a cross between Han Solo, James Bond, and Jack Sparrow, citing suave yet cocky attitude. He was thankful that he was not aware of Balthier's popularity since his reveal, stating that he would have been [...] "crippled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of not delivering on what the fans expected". He stated that he took no inspiration from anyone else for the role, wanting to ensure that he was unique. Instead, he cited the pictures and animation of the character as his inspiration. Emery cited Jack Fletcher, the voice director, as a great help in voicing the character and setting up the scene for him. To give Final Fantasy XII a Western feel, Balthier's movements were recorded by a Western motion capture actor.|$|E
500|$|The {{first act}} was {{completed}} by March 1890; {{the rest of the}} opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi's usual practice. The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been [...] "an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes". Progress was slow, with composition [...] "carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods" [...] partly caused by the composer's depression. Verdi was weighed down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of being unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors Franco Faccio and Emanuele Muzio. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: [...] "in writing Falstaff, I haven't thought about either theatres or singers". He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio's death that November: [...] "Will I finish it ? Or will I not finish it? Who knows! I am writing without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day". By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into: ...|$|E
