25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century it {{was common}} for women, {{especially}} those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.|$|E
25|$|The school {{began in}} the late 1960s as an {{educational}} experiment. The curriculum was unique, varied and highly specialized, following a trimester system, and students were encouraged to address their teachers <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> and focus on independent learning. The school attracted innovative teachers and self-directed students. Around 1980, with the introduction of a school Disciplinarian, this model gave way to a more traditional, but still high-achieving academic environment.|$|E
25|$|Kees {{was born}} in Beatrice, Nebraska, to John Kees, a {{hardware}} manufacturer, and Sarah Green Kees, a schoolteacher. The Kees family was well-to-do, John Kees being part owner of F.D. Kees Manufacturing Co., which patented and produced corn-husking hooks as well as innovative products such as a window defroster for automobiles and a moving lawn sprinkler that resembled a farm tractor. Weldon Kees was a precocious child whose playmates included Robert Taylor and whose pastimes included producing his own magazines, giving puppet shows and even acting. He was treated like a small adult by his parents, whom he addressed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E

500|$|Throughout its run, {{the series}} was led by three (season 5) and four (seasons 1–4, 6) primary cast members, who were {{credited}} <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> Its original main cast members were Conrad, Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season, Port moved to New York City after receiving employment with Diane von Fürstenberg and was commissioned to star in the spin-off The City.|$|E
500|$|The {{actors who}} {{featured}} in the live-action cutscenes and performed the voice work for the original Resident Evil were credited <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> only. Valentine's actor, [...] "Inezh", was at high school at the time. Valentine was voiced by Catherine Disher in Resident Evil 3; Heidi Anderson in the 2002 remake of Resident Evil, Kathleen Barr in Under the Skin; and Michelle Ruff in the non-canon game [...] Patricia Ja Lee provided the voice and motion capture for Valentine in Resident Evil 5 and the voice for The Umbrella Chronicles. Atsuko Yuya voices Valentine in the Japanese versions of the games.|$|E
500|$|Throughout its run, The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} led by five (seasons 1–2), six (seasons 3–10 with the {{exception}} of some of season 5), and seven (some of season 5) housewives, who are credited <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> and is distinguished within The Real Housewives franchise in that it was, until the introduction of The Real Housewives of Potomac in 2016, the only installment with a predominantly black cast. Its original main housewives were Lisa Wu, DeShawn Snow, NeNe Leakes, Kim Zolciak, and Shereé Whitfield. Snow departed from the program after the first season, and alleged that producers considered her to be [...] "too human for a circus show" [...] and was replaced by Kandi Burruss in the second season.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} how women in pregnancy {{would like to}} be addressed and to ascertain their preferred choice of title during pregnancy. A questionnaire was administered to 925 antenatal women. Midwifery and medical staff (183) were invited to respond to a similar questionnaire. The response rate was 71. 2 % from the survey of pregnant women. The vast majority (82. 1 %) preferred to be addressed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> Women were in favour of being called ’patient’ (32. 8 %) as <b>their</b> <b>first</b> choice. The staff survey yielded a response rate of 77 %. The majority (81. 8 %) of health professionals preferred to address women <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> ’Mother’ (28. 7 %) was the most popular first choice. We conclude that women in pregnancy do have a preference on how they {{would like to be}} addressed and this is predominantly by <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> Health professionals also prefer to call pregnant women <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> The term ’patient’ was the most popular first choice of title of women in pregnancy but the term ’mother’ was the preferred choice of the health professionals. Medical staff were more likely to choose ’patient’ than midwives...|$|R

50|$|A person {{belonging}} to the Albu Salih tribe will go by the last name Al Salihiy (Also spelt Al Salihi, Alsalahi, and Alsalhi).

500|$|Throughout its run, {{the series}} was led by four (season 2) and five (season 1) primary cast members, who were {{credited}} <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> Its original main cast members were Port, Erin Lucas, Jay Lyon, Olivia Palermo, and Adam Senn. Lucas, Lyon, and Senn were replaced by Erin Kaplan and Roxy Olin beginning {{in the second half}} of the first season. The aforementioned women's storylines were largely developed by a number of supporting cast members. Alexandra Crandell was credited as [...] "Adam's girlfriend", while Samantha Swetra was labeled [...] "Whitney's friend". Kelly Cutrone was featured the owner of the PR firm People's Revolution and the employer of Port and Olin, while Joe Zee was credited as Palermo's boss at Elle.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{say that}} {{they did not want to}} force modernity onto the story. There were some {{creative}} challenges, such as the decision to include the sign [...] "221B" [...] on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.|$|E
500|$|After the {{production}} of their second album, The Wiggles, who were called <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> when they performed, began to wear costumes on stage as Fabinyi suggested and as The Cockroaches had done, and adopted colour-coded shirts: Greg in yellow, Murray in red, Jeff in purple, and Anthony in blue. [...] The coloured shirts also {{made it easier for}} their young audience to identify them. [...] As Field reported, the decision to emphasise colour was [...] "a no-brainer, considering our pre-school-age audience". [...] Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours, but Field and Page [...] "met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt". [...] Another early development used throughout the group's history was their signature finger-wagging move, which was created by Cook after seeing professional bowlers do it on television. [...] They used the move when being photographed with children because it was their policy that touching children, no matter how innocently, was inappropriate. It also protected them from possible litigation; as Paddick has explained, [...] "There is no doubting where their hands are".|$|E
5000|$|Noskwith {{recalled}} {{that most people}} were addressed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> there: the two exceptions were Alan Turing, known as [...] "Prof"; and F.A.

2500|$|Many NA members {{identify}} themselves in meetings <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> only.

5000|$|Lao names (Lao: ຊື່ [...] ) {{are given}} in Western order, where the family name goes after the <b>first</b> given <b>name.</b> On {{official}} documents, both <b>first</b> given <b>name</b> and surname are written, but it is customary to refer to people in formal situations <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name,</b> plus titles and honorifics, alone.|$|R
500|$|From her {{earliest}} {{years she}} was known for her compassionate heart and desire to help others, but also for her temper, blunt honesty and moodiness. As a small child, she once lost patience while posing for a portrait painter and told the man, [...] "You are a very ugly man and I don't like you one bit!" [...] The Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible, sleeping on hard camp cots unless they were ill, taking cold baths every morning. Servants called Olga and her siblings <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names</b> and patronyms rather than by their imperial titles. However, Olga's governess and tutors also noted some of the autocratic impulses of {{the daughter of the}} Tsar of All the Russias, one of the wealthiest men in the world. On a visit to a museum where state carriages were on display, Olga once ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive. Her wishes were not honored, much to the relief of her governess, Margaretta Eagar. She also felt the rights of eldest children should be protected. When she was told the Biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors, she sympathized with the eldest brothers rather than Joseph. She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the Biblical story of David and Goliath. When her French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, was teaching her the formation of French verbs and the use of auxiliaries, ten-year-old Olga responded, [...] "I see, monsieur. The auxiliaries are the servants of the verbs. It's only poor 'avoir' which has to shift for itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main humorous base of {{the series}} was a merciless parody of the British class system. This {{permeated}} almost every interaction and was especially evident in the conversations between the maintenance men and the ostensibly higher-class store personnel. The episodes rarely left the store, and to parody {{the stereotype of the}} British class system, characters rarely addressed each other <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> even after work, instead using their formal titled names ("Mr", [...] "Mrs", [...] "Miss", or even [...] "Captain"). When they did address each other <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> it was usually either as an aside, or often for comic effect (e.g. an underling addressing a superior).|$|E
2500|$|Merriam School. Named for Florence A. Merriam {{who taught}} for 35 years in Acton. Merriam offers a {{project-based}} curriculum. At Merriam, teachers teach {{the same group}} of students for two years (i.e., a teacher will teach first grade one year, second grade the next and then wrap back to first). This practice is called [...] "looping". Merriam School is housed in the Parker Damon Building which it shares with the McCarthy-Towne school. At Merriam as well as at McCarthy-Towne, students call their teachers <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are no area {{codes in}} Iceland, and all {{telephone}} numbers have seven digits. The international dialling code is +354. Due to the Icelandic naming system, people are listed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> in the telephone directory, and not <b>by</b> <b>their</b> last name (which is usually patronym, or, rarely, a matronym).|$|R
50|$|Sexaholics Anonymous {{was founded}} by Roy K (in 12-Step fellowships it is {{customary}} to refer to members <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> and the <b>first</b> initial of <b>their</b> last name, {{in order to preserve}} their anonymity).

2500|$|A [...] "teacher as coach" [...] philosophy: Students address {{teachers}} <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> {{and every}} written assignment and oral presentation has an intensive draft and revision process so the student can {{interact with the}} teacher as much as possible. A result {{of this is that}} work is not graded in the traditional way at Parker. Work is commented on extensively and compared to a rubric of standards for a given [...] "division". The bulk of teacher feedback is usually given with the aim of aiding further revision rather than as a final assessment of the student (see below) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Squad, informality was everything. Everyone called DCI Haskins simply [...] "Haskins" [...] (except to his face), though Regan would {{occasionally}} call {{him by his}} first name, Frank. No one ever called Regan [...] "Mister" [...] - except the villains, or sometimes Carter when talking to Haskins. To the Squad, he was always simply [...] "the Guv'nor", or just [...] "Guv". In turn, he invariably called Carter and the other Squad members <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> But off-duty he and George Carter were friends and drinking buddies, so in private Carter called him Jack. This is all in accordance with widespread police convention.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, {{he became}} the Circuit Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit in Alabama. Here he became known as [...] "the {{fighting}} little judge," [...] a nod to his past boxing association. He gained a reputation for fairness regardless of {{the race of the}} plaintiff. It was common practice at the time for judges in the area to refer to black lawyers <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> while their white colleagues were addressed formally as [...] "Mister"; Black lawyer J. L. Chestnut later said that [...] "Judge George Wallace was the most liberal judge that I had ever practiced law in front of. He was the first judge in Alabama to call me 'Mister' in a courtroom." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dutch people quickly {{start calling}} people <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> In the Netherlands, a younger person, a child, a relative, a friend, or an {{acquaintance}} are addressed with an informal je/jij ("you"). The formal u {{is used to}} address people one does not know, or is only slightly acquainted with. [...] "U" [...] {{is also used to}} address a higher-ranking business person, although it can soon be replaced by the informal je. When meeting someone in the Netherlands for the first time, they are generally called Sir or Madam, but one will soon be asked to refer to them <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> In other countries, it takes much longer for people to associate on a <b>first</b> <b>name</b> basis. There is no special rule that tells how to deal with this: it is safe to follow the lead of the other person. When someone introduces him/herself with just <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name,</b> it is safe to assume that they prefer to be addressed with the informal jij/je.|$|R
2500|$|According to Magness, {{the names}} on the Talpiot ossuaries {{indicate}} that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>name</b> and hometown. [...] "This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end." ...|$|R
