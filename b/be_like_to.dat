40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he got older. He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do the same to a human.|$|E

She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other.

Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E

How can one describe what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another self? For that matter, what can we know about what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ourselves?

To accommodate this, Sesame Street puppeteers Joey Mazzarino, Carmen Osbahr, and Matt Vogel were brought in to do the muppet versions of Jack, Liz, and Tracy Jordan. This angle would later be used again in the show's fourth season episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Kenneth appears as a muppet while walking by a high-definition camera. In addition, the program was parodied by Sesame Street, in the show's 39th season, entitled [...] "30 Rocks".|$|E

In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and {{the embodiment of the}} American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.|$|E

500|$|Director Nate Fox {{stated that}} much of the {{inspiration}} of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series, DMZ and [...] Both center on a city after a large disaster. The series also inspired the crafting of the game's grim take on the superhero genre. Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game. However, any correlation to DC Comics' Static Shock was unintentional. Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of [...] "spending time in a lawless place" [...] within the game. Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence, in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City; similarly, Spider-Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> move about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions. They had toyed around with a version of the game that they compared to a superhero version of Animal Crossing, and along side superhero work, the hero would have an alter-ego of property developer to meet the citizens' more common needs, but dropped this and focused solely on superhero activities after about six months of work. The character of Cole was created to be a [...] "kind of an everyman" [...] so that players could then [...] "get into the headspace of what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities". The team also avoided giving Cole an alter-ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game's story.|$|E

[...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E
500|$|The Doors {{wanted to}} {{capitalize}} on the experimental climate in popular music at the time that brought about groundbreaking works like The White Album and Electric Ladyland while redefining what could be accomplished within the rock medium. Looking for a new, creative sound, Rothchild hired Paul Harris to arrange string and orchestral arrangements for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and local jazz horn players. Session musicians Doug Lubahn and Harvey Brooks also served as additional bass guitarists. The music on The Soft Parade incorporated art rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, and psychedelic rock styles. Drummer John Densmore and Manzarek, who both had jazz backgrounds, asserted they were receptive to Rothchild's jazz concept: [...] "We'd [...] always talk about using some jazz musicians – let's put some horns and strings on, man, let's see what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> record with a string section and a big horn section", recalled Manzarek.|$|E

[...] Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do the same.

500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it must <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives.

[...] He also said that he [...] "realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under" [...] but said that he [...] "couldn't pass it up". Lindsay was initially against casting Hall, based on seeing him on Six Feet Under, but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script, Lindsay changed his mind, describing Hall as [...] "absolutely perfect" [...] to portray Dexter. To prepare for the part, Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers, read transcripts of interviews with serial killers, and spent time with the head blood-spatter analyst at the Miami precinct.
