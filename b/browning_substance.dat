5000|$|Cleve {{worked on}} the {{synthesis}} of complex chemical compounds until 1872. He theorized in 1874 that the element didymium consisted of two elements. This theory was proven right {{with the discovery of}} praseodymium and neodymium in 1885 by Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1879, Cleve proved that the newly discovered element scandium was an element predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev to be [...] "eka-boron". He isolated a quantity of scandium in this same year and determined its atomic weight. He discovered the element holmium in 1879 by examining a sample of erbium oxide. While removing impurities from a sample of erbium oxide, Cleve discovered a <b>brown</b> <b>substance</b> and a green <b>substance,</b> and the <b>brown</b> <b>substance</b> was holmium oxide (the green substance was thulium oxide). However, this sample may have been impure. He separated thulium from an erbium oxide sample in 1879. Additionally, Cleve and Abraham Langlet discovered helium in the mineral cleveite in 1895.|$|R

40|$|Russet {{spotting}} (RS) is {{a physiological}} disorder induced in iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) {{by exposure to}} parts per million levels of ethylene at 5 ± 2 °C.

After testing six media and four temperatures, the conditions for the in virro culture selected were as follows: RPMI- 1640 + 20 Vo (vlv) heat-inactived fetal bovine serum or Meyer's M 3 (without agar) media, at 37 "C, under 5 VoCO, in air atmosphere, and renewal of the medium twice a week. The average survival rates of the larvae were signiticantly increased when the pH of the culture medium was increased (from 4. 0 to 7. 2) or decreased (from 7. 2 to 4. 0) after L, to Lo moulting. The length of the larvae at the onset of culture affected the survival and moulting of themselves, but these were culture medium-dependent. On the other hand, we have observed that several L. and Lo were attached, by means of a <b>brown</b> un-known <b>substance</b> apparently secreted by themselveb, to the bottom ofthe substratum.

50|$|The false {{codling moth}} {{presents}} {{a problem to}} the citrus industry. All stages of fruit development of citrus are susceptible to a false codling moth infestation. Eggs are laid {{on the surface of}} the fruit. After emerging from the egg the larvae burrow into the rind. In citruses such as the orange the skin around the point of penetration develops a brown discoloration. The bored hole itself will also show signs of stress, excreting a <b>brown</b> <b>substance.</b> Once the fruit has been penetrated it is no longer a marketable item, and once compromised, the incidence of disease and mold increases. The open cavity is a point of entry for other pests and pathogens. Often fruits afflicted early in development prematurely drop.

The establishment of a false codling moth population results in increased pesticide usage.|$|R
40|$|Background : Health {{industry}} has always used natural products as an alternative. Propolis, a natural antibiotic, is a resinous yellow brown or dark <b>brown</b> <b>substance</b> derived from honey bees (Apis mellifera). The main chemical compounds contained in propolis are flavonoids, phenolics and other various aromatic compounds. Flavonoids {{are well known}} plant compounds that have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties. Propolis {{is expected to be}} an alternative used for root canal treatment with lower toxicity compared to calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2. Over the last decade, a new material, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was developed, and has been used as the gold standard. All materials used in mouth should be biocompatible. The initial level of material biocompatibility evaluation involves toxicity and genotoxicity tests. Purpose : This research is aimed to conduct comparison test of genotoxicity effect of propolis extract, MTA and Ca(OH) 2 on fibroblast BHK- 21 cell culture. Methods : This research was conducted with single-cell gel electrophoresis method. Results : The results indicate that propolis extract cannot cause DNA damage, while MTA can cause apoptosis and Ca(OH) 2 can cause neucrosis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ability to}} produce humic-like {{polymeric}} ompounds, with L-tyrosine as the starting material, was evaluated using different mineral systems, e. g. on Ca-, A 1 - and Cu(II) -saturated montmorillonite, nontronite and kaolinite, and on quartz. Clay minerals proved {{to be effective in}} the formation of these compounds, but not quartz, except in the presence of Cu(II). The newly formed compounds were fractionated by alkaline xtraction. With clay systems, the amounts of substances produced appear to be related more to the interlayer cation than to the clay type. Copper cations appear to be more effective when not associated with the clay structure. Humic substances, the major organic onstituents of soils and sediments, are known to affect the physical, chemical and biological properties and the fertility of soils. Several biotic and abiotic pathways have been proposed for their synthesis in soils: the classic Waksman (1932) theory suggests that humic substances originate from modified lignin, while, at present, many authors indicate a mechanism involving quinones. An important step in this process is the oxidative polymerization of phenols, polyphenols or similar compounds to quinones or semi-quinones. These polymers undergo polycondensation with amino compounds, which probably also involve ring cleavage (Stevenson, 1982). Deamination and decarboxyla-tion reactions can also occur (Wang, 1991). Furthermore, the formation of dark <b>brown</b> <b>substances</b> of high molecular weight by reactions involving quinones is a well known step in the formation of melanins, as described by Raper (1927).
