It holds a meeting room and kitchen {{on the first floor}} and an oculus opening on the full-length second floor, which is intended for presentations, exhibits, reading, studying, and computer usage. The community center also has a <b>backup</b> <b>generator</b> for use as an emergency broadcast and a warming and cooling center. It can hold 80 people on its first floor and 110 on its second, and has movable furniture and a large television on each floor to accommodate a variety of programming.|$|E
25|$|After about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of Roseanne and subsequently, The Wonder Years in the meantime), ABC {{was able}} to regain power via a <b>backup</b> <b>generator.</b> ABC's play-by-play man, Al Michaels (who was {{familiar}} with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974-1976) then proceeded to relay reports to Ted Koppel at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Michaels was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on-site reporting at the World Series.|$|E
25|$|A {{major power}} failure {{occurred}} on 20 June 2000 at approximately 5pm, affecting the entire Television Centre resulting in {{services such as}} BBC Two and BBC Radio 4 coming off air, and BBC News 24 went off air before being relocated to the BBC's Westminster studios. The Six O'Clock News suffered severe lighting problems {{and had to be}} cancelled halfway through, and the BBC's <b>backup</b> <b>generator</b> caught fire. Troubles were experienced in the South East region, as Newsroom South East started later than planned. The fire alarms went off at Television Centre later that day, leaving only a skeleton crew. Eventually many programmes returned, from different locations: Newsnight was presented from the main news studio with intermittent technical problems. The failure was due to a substation in Shepherd's Bush and normal services resumed the following day.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{feasibility}} study for a control system for existing <b>backup</b> <b>generators</b> in South Africa. The strategy is to install a system to enable <b>backup</b> <b>generators</b> (BGs) to be dispatched only when a large generator fails.

500|$|During {{the shoot}} U2 played an eight-song set, which {{included}} four performances of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing {{the roof of}} the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans. A <b>backup</b> <b>generator</b> was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming.|$|E
2500|$|The group gathers as Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) {{takes his}} first steps after the {{amputation}} of his foot. [...] Suddenly, walkers swarm the courtyard, scattering the group. T-Dog (IronE Singleton) races after Carol (Melissa McBride) and sacrifices himself by barreling into a walker horde {{to let her}} escape. Rick, Glenn (Steven Yeun), and Daryl (Norman Reedus) find the gate's lock broken and re-secure it to prevent further walkers from entering. Rick accuses Axel and Oscar of the treachery, but an alarm begins sounding due to activation of a <b>backup</b> <b>generator,</b> potentially drawing more walkers. Rick realizes the prisoners cannot be at fault and lets them lead him to the generator room. There they find Andrew (Markice Moore), whom Rick had left for dead, as the instigator. Andrew is about to kill Rick when Oscar shoots him, and then turns the gun over to Rick. They stop the generator and disable the alarm.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 May 2012, General Atomics {{conducted}} the successful first flight of its upgraded MQ-9 Block 1-plus Reaper. The Block 1â€“plus version {{was designed for}} increased electrical power, secure communications, automatic landing, increased gross takeoff weight (GTOW), weapons growth, and streamlined payload integration capabilities. A new high-capacity starter generator offers increased electrical power capacity to provide growth capacity; a <b>backup</b> <b>generator</b> is also present and is sufficient for all flight-critical functions, improving the electrical power system's reliability via three independent power sources. New communications capabilities, including dual ARC-210 VHF/UHF radios with wingtip antennas, allow for simultaneous communications between multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground parties, secure data links, and an increased data transmission capacity. The new trailing arm main landing gear allows the carriage of heavier payloads or additional fuel. Development and testing were completed, and Milestone C was achieved in September 2012. [...] Follow-on aircraft will be redesignated MQ-9 Block 5. On 15 October 2013, the USAF awarded General Atomics a $377.4 million contract for 24 MQ-9 Block 5 Reapers. The MQ-9 Block 5 flew its first combat mission on 23 June 2017.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 October 1961, Thresher, {{in company}} with the {{diesel-electric}} submarine , headed south on a 3-week test and training cruise to San Juan, Puerto Rico, arriving 2 November. Following customary procedure while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no shore power connection was available in San Juan, the ship's backup diesel generator was used to carry the [...] "hotel" [...] electrical loads. Several hours later, the <b>backup</b> <b>generator</b> broke down and the electrical load {{was transferred to the}} ship's battery; however, most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, so lighting and air-conditioning were shut down. Without air-conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching [...] after about ten hours. (Four men received Navy Commendation Medals for their work that night, attempting to repair the diesel generator under the extreme conditions of heat and humidity.) Eventually, it became apparent that repair of the generator would not be complete before the battery was depleted, so restart of the reactor was attempted, but by that time, there was not enough charge remaining in the battery, and it ran down before restart of the reactor could be accomplished. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. Since Cavalla was moored alongside, cables, borrowed from another ship in the harbor, were connected between Thresher and Cavalla, which started her diesels, providing power that enabled Thresher to restart her reactor.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{transferring}} the load to the <b>backup</b> <b>generator,</b> an ATS may also command the <b>backup</b> <b>generator</b> to start, {{based on the}} voltage monitored on the primary supply.
