500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Wood {{received}} an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, as he told Boult, [...] "it was hard to refuse, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} and critics challenge {{the validity of}} Pinter's critiques of what he terms [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power" [...] or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being [...] "terribly disturbed {{as a young man}} by the Cold War. And McCarthyism... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very strongly then and feel as strongly now that {{we have an obligation to}} subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny." [...] Scholars agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|After Bryant and Scott {{departed}} the project, director Philip Kaufman {{tried to}} re-write the story, with the resulting treatment heavily inspired by Olaf Stapledon's books Last and First Men and Star Maker. He later described this version as being [...] "less 'cult-ish' {{and more of}} an adult movie, dealing with sexuality and wonders rather than oddness". He intended this version to feature Spock facing off against a Klingon nemesis, A role for whom Kaufman wanted Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Kaufman explained {{that it would have}} featured the two undergoing a psychedelic experience and summed it up by saying that [...] "I'm sure the fans would have been upset, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it could really open up a new type of science fiction." [...] While Povill had felt that Bryant and Scott's treatment was unsuccessful, he thought that Kaufman's was worse.|$|E

500|$|... "To Her Door" [...] and [...] "Treaty" [...] were voted {{into the}} APRA Top 30 Australian songs {{of all time}} in 2001. Paul Kelly and the Messengers gave their last {{performance}} in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career. He justified his decision: [...] "We forged a style together. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that's why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up". Paul Kelly and the Messengers' final album, Hidden Things, was a collection of previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities. It was released in May 1992, and reached No.29. One track, [...] "Rally Around the Drum", written with Archie Roach, was about an indigenous tent boxing man.|$|E
500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a little embarrassed with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not without}} misgivings, Miles, and {{sometimes}} those that were keenly painful; but, on the whole, I will not say <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my power, <b>but</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> we were dear to each other." ...|$|R

500|$|When {{running along}} Blackpool's beach, at 7 am, {{no matter the}} weather, Matthews wore shoes that {{contained}} lead, {{so that when he}} changed into his football boots, his feet felt light, giving himself the impression that he could run faster. Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had some very good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> a little sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
500|$|After {{four years}} in the role, Irving decided to leave Holby City and return to {{performing}} in theatre. He stated: [...] "I've had four great years <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{the time had come to}} leave. The show has gone from strength to strength so now seems a good time to go." [...] Of his decision to leave, Irving explained that, while he enjoyed Meyer's sureness and confidence, he found it difficult to [...] "switch off" [...] the character outside of work, and had been forced to [...] "put the rest of his life on hold" [...] whilst part of the series, deeming it to be an [...] "intense experience." [...] He felt that, had he stayed in the series, Meyer could not have remained enigmatic much longer, and believed: [...] "you have to stop when a character's time is through." [...] Following Irving's departure from Holby City, Benji Wilson of the Radio Times questioned whether he would ever consider returning. Irving responded: [...] "I don't know–my feeling is that Meyer was of his time. He's the kind of character that belongs at the launch of series like Holby and I think that's where he should remain. The memory of Meyer is important to me and I want it to stay as it is." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they {{were sort of}} interchangeable in the information they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought we were all in a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with this woman and then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2016 Summer Games marked Karma's Olympic début. She {{qualified}} for the women's individual archery tournament after receiving a wildcard from the Tripitate Commission in June 2016 based on her results at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships and the 2016 Archery World Cup qualification event in Antalya. In an interview with Kuensel before the Games, Karma said: [...] "I’m very excited and nervous at the same time. It is {{time for me to}} show what I’ve learned so far against the world’s best archers.”, and to Archer 360, [...] "While in the Sambodromo, I’m hoping to make my country proud. I have a good chance if I am able to maintain my home scores." [...] She competed on 5 August in the ranking round, finishing 60th out of 64th competitors with 588 points. Karma scored 81 points less than the leading competitor, South Korea's Choi Mi-sun. On 8 August she competed in the Round of 64 and was drawn against Tuyana Dashidorzhieva of Russia, the fifth ranking athlete in the ranking round. Karma tied with Dashidorzhieva in the first set before the Russian outscored her by three points to secure the second set. Karma and Dashidorzieva tied with each other in the game's following two sets until the Russian won the final set to win the match. This meant Karma was eliminated from the competition. After the events ended, Karma stated that despite being defeated she enjoyed the match and wanted to compete with archery champions whether she won or lost: [...] "I remember being a bit nervous with the big cameras in the blinds. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> excited that {{it was the first time}} in my life that this would happen," ...|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "You did," [...] Jake {{agreed in}} an apologetic tone. [...] "It's your privilege, <b>but</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> rather hurt, <b>I</b> don't see why that should prevent my asking {{if your father}} was in." ...|$|R

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lambert {{oversaw the}} first two seasons of the programme, {{eventually}} leaving in 1965. [...] "There {{comes a time when}} a series needs new input," [...] she told Doctor Who Magazine thirty years later. [...] "It's not that I wasn't fond of Doctor Who, I simply felt that the time had come. It had been eighteen very concentrated months, something like seventy shows.

[...] He tried to escape from the authorities who suspected him of tearing down the posters, but he was caught while trying to reach Rome and ended up in jail for a short time. He refused to enlist in the army of the Republic of Salò, Mussolini's puppet state after the Allied invasion in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Although initially, {{the album}} was not meant for release and Faraz did not {{want it to be}} more than an experiment. [...] "The album was good <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{strongly}} about re-doing it. Not revamping but redoing it," [...] he says. However, Akhtar Qayyum went on to strike a record deal with Sound Master and {{the album was}} released in 1999. [...] "I had no idea that Akhtar would go out and release it, which he did. It did well but I wasn't expecting the album to hit the market," [...] says Faraz. This led to relations between Akhtar and Faraz restrain and Akhtar soon left the band due to musical differences.|$|E
