Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E

5|$|In late April 2004, Fertig {{was called}} up to the SmackDown! brand with vignettes playing on the show announcing his new character, Mordecai, a {{religious}} Zealot-type character, which was partially based on his previous Seven gimmick. During numerous promos, Mordecai claimed {{to be on a}} crusade to rid the world of sin. He consistently wore white and had <b>blonde</b> <b>hair</b> and a beard as a sign of his purity. Mordecai debuted in ring for the SmackDown! brand on May 16, 2004 during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, defeating Scotty 2 Hotty. In later appearances, Mordecai condemned the audience for their sins, and led them in prayer. Fertig's Mordecai character was originally created to have a feud with The Undertaker.|$|E
5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to her grip for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original <b>blonde</b> <b>hair</b> colour for the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|Released as the album's second {{single in}} mid-1986, {{the song was}} a {{commercial}} success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped platinum <b>blonde</b> <b>hair.</b> It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple dress with a matching bow in her <b>blonde</b> <b>hair,</b> bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had <b>blonde</b> <b>hair</b> and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, a deck of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the <b>blonde</b> <b>hair</b> referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short <b>blonde</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September, Kaitlyn was {{attacked}} by an unknown assailant prior to her championship match at Night of Champions. Upon her return, she announced her assailant had <b>blonde</b> <b>hair,</b> and Assistant SmackDown General Manager Eve Torres accused Phoenix before attacking her. On the September 28 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix was suspended by Torres, but the suspension was later reversed by SmackDown General manager Booker T. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Phoenix lost to Torres. Phoenix reverted to her villainous persona on the October 18 episode of Superstars, when she berated Kaitlyn for thinking that Phoenix attacked her and demanded respect from Kaitlyn, before losing {{to her in a}} singles match. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Phoenix was defeated by AJ Lee in a singles match, but the match was restarted by Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero, allowing Phoenix to win. After the match, in storyline, Guerrero fired Phoenix for her poor performance. In reality, Phoenix had given her notice to WWE in September and left the company for family reasons.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her <b>blonde</b> <b>hair.</b> She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, <b>blonde</b> <b>hair</b> and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
