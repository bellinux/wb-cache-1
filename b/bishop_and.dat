5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and <b>bishop,</b> <b>and</b> to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a working document, compiled {{for the use of the}} <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E

Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|As first {{commissioned}} in 1926, US395 {{was a minor}} spur {{route of}} U.S. Route 195 connecting Spokane, Washington with Canada. During the 1930s, US395 was extended from Spokane to San Diego, over the Camino Sierra, using several existing state routes. The extension first appeared on the Official Nevada Highway map in 1935.

5|$|Beneath the ealdormen, reeves—royal {{officials}} who were noble local landowners—were {{in charge of}} a town or royal estate. The authority of church and state was not separated in early medieval societies, and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> local abbots, who also attended the king's royal councils.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as <b>bishop</b> <b>and</b> senior pastor of the church.

5|$|Helliwell {{returned}} to playing non-League football when joining Southern League club Ilkeston Town in 1998 and featured {{for them in}} FA Cup matches against Football League teams Carlisle United and Swindon Town. Having {{returned to}} semi-professional football, he worked part-time as an electrician. Helliwell took over as caretaker manager at Ilkeston after Keith Alexander resigned in October 2000, and led the team to {{the first round of}} the FA Cup before John McGovern was appointed in November. In March 2001, Helliwell was appointed as one of a three-man management team at Ilkeston alongside former Burnley teammate Charlie <b>Bishop</b> <b>and</b> former York teammate Chris Marples. The trio guided the club to safety at the end of 2000–01; Marples was consequently hired as manager on a permanent basis in May 2001 and Helliwell returned to his playing role. After Marples left Ilkeston in March 2002, <b>Bishop</b> <b>and</b> Helliwell took caretaker charge before John McGinlay was appointed later that month. Helliwell retired from football following 2001–02, having spent four seasons with Ilkeston.|$|E

In 1973, Ruth <b>Bishop</b> <b>and</b> colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the large income the Abbot was sustaining, Bishop Alnwick appears to have not taken strong {{measures}} against the Abbot's indiscretions. He ordered that the number of canons should be increased to 30 and the number of boys in the almonry increased to 16.
