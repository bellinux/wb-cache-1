50|$|The {{physical}} {{origin of}} the Mott transition is the interplay between the Coulomb repulsion of electrons and their degree of localization (<b>band</b> <b>width).</b> Once the carrier density becomes too high (e.g. due doping), {{the energy of the}} system can be lowered by the localization of the formerly conducting electrons (<b>band</b> <b>width</b> reduction), leading to the formation of a band gap, e.g. by pressure (i.e. a semiconductor/insulator).|$|E

40|$|For {{a set of}} ten {{crystalline}} materials (oxides and semiconductors), we {{compute the}} electronic band structures using the Tran-Blaha (TB 09) functional. The <b>band</b> <b>widths</b> and gaps are compared with those from the local-density approximation (LDA) functional, many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), and experiments. At the density-functional theory (DFT) level, TB 09 leads to band gaps in much better agreement with experiments than LDA. However, we observe that it globally underestimates, often strongly, the valence (and conduction) <b>band</b> <b>widths</b> (more than LDA). MBPT corrections are calculated starting from both LDA and TB 09 eigenenergies and wave functions. They lead to a much better agreement with experimental data for <b>band</b> <b>widths.</b> The <b>band</b> gaps obtained starting from TB 09 are close to those from quasiparticle self-consistent GW calculations, at a much reduced cost.

30|$|Experimentally, the 17.4 and 18.9 μm {{features}} in the gas-phase IR spectrum have a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 0.4 μm at 1065 K (Frum et al., 1991). Chase et al. (1992) found that the <b>band</b> <b>widths</b> of C 60 shift little in the solution and in the solid state, suggesting that C 60 in the solid state is virtually a gas-phase-like, freely rotating molecule. The <b>band</b> <b>widths</b> are partially due to vibration-rotation coupling, scaling roughly with the square root of the temperature. Therefore, one can, in principle, estimate the temperature by comparing the observed <b>band</b> <b>widths</b> with the experimental values. A comparison between the experimental results of Frum et al. (1991) and Chase et al. (1992) suggests that the <b>band</b> <b>widths</b> of solid- phase C 60 are 2 – 3 times narrower than those of gas-phase at the same temperature. The FWHMs of the observed 17.4 and 18.9 μm features are 0.26 – 0.36 μm, implying a gas temperature of 400 – 900 K. The implicated temperature might be higher if C 60 is in the solid phase. While interesting, these results should be viewed with some caution because they {{might be related to}} the experimental conditions, which are quite different from those of circumstellar envelopes. The 17.4 and 18.9 μm features might be blended with weak C 70 emission (see, e.g., figure 1 of Cami et al., 2010), slightly affecting their FWHMs. Moreover, if the C 60 bands arise from regions with large temperature fluctuations, the situation will be complicated in that the shifts of peak wavelengths can make an additional contribution to the band broadening.|$|R

Numerical analysis of dispersion relation for such gap biexcitons shows that these type of biexcitons have <b>band’s</b> <b>width</b> small compared with the <b>band’s</b> <b>width</b> of free two exciton states.

50|$|The video (VF) input is a {{composite}} video signal (video information with sync) of maximum 1 volt on 75 Ω impedance. (1 V limit is for luminance signal. Some operators may accept superimposed color signals slightly over 1 V.) After buffer and 1 V clipping circuits the signal {{is applied to the}} modulator where it modulates an intermediate frequency signal (which is different from the one used for aural signal.) The modulator is an amplitude modulator which modulates the IF signal in a manner where 1 V VF corresponds to low level IF and 0 volt VF corresponds to high level IF. AM modulator produces two symmetrical side bands in the modulated signals. Thus IF <b>band</b> <b>width</b> is two times the video <b>band</b> <b>width.</b> (i.e. if the VF bandwidth is 4.2 MHz, the IF bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.) However, the modulator is followed by a special filter known as Vestigal sideband (VSB) filter. This filter is used to suppress a portion of one side band, thus bandwidth is reduced. (Since both side bands contain identical information, this suppression doesn't cause a loss in information.) Although the suppression causes phase delay problems the VSB stage also includes correction circuits to equalise the phase.|$|E

The PE-TDDFT and PERI-CC 2 methods were combined with molecular dynamics simulations, where the solute geometry was kept either as rigid, flexible or partly-flexible (restrained) body. The first approach, termed RBMD-PE-TDDFT, was employed to estimate the inhomogeneous broadening for subsequent convolution with the vibrationally-resolved spectra of the molecule in solution determined quantum-mechanically (QM).
