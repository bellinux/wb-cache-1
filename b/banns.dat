5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory {{court of}} the Diocese of Worcester issued a {{marriage}} licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage <b>banns</b> to be read once {{instead of the usual}} three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.|$|E
25|$|After next Easter, matrimonial <b>banns</b> must be published, {{and bishops}} should {{dispense}} with this only for grave reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{court also}} ruled that two couples who had {{previously}} had a wedding ceremony in the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto using an ancient common-law procedure called {{the reading of the}} <b>banns</b> would be considered legally married.|$|E
25|$|The women disembarked in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal. After their arrival, {{their time}} to find husbands varied greatly. For some, it was as short as a few months, while others took {{two or three years}} before finding an {{appropriate}} husband. For the process of choosing a husband, and the marriage, most couples would officially get engaged in church, with their priest and witnesses present. Then, some couples went in front of the notary, to sign a marriage contract. Marriages were celebrated by the priest, usually in the woman’s parish of residence. While the marriage <b>banns</b> customarily were to be published three times before a wedding could take place, the colony’s need for women to marry quickly led to few filles du roi having marriage <b>banns</b> announced. It is known that 737 of these filles du roi were married in New France.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} marriages were {{authorized}} {{by calling the}} <b>banns</b> in the spouses' churches. The first civil marriage license issued to a same-sex couple was to Michael Stark and Michael Leshner, who had the usual waiting period waived and completed the formalities of marriage just hours after the court ruling, on June 10, 2003.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2001, Rev. Brent Hawkes {{forced the}} issue by {{performing}} two same-sex marriages, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that Ontario law authorizes him to perform marriages without a previous license, via the issuance of <b>banns</b> of marriage. The registrar refused to accept the records of marriage, and a lawsuit was commenced over whether the marriages were legally performed. In other provinces, lawsuits were launched seeking permission to marry.|$|E
25|$|This vow was {{observed}} into the intertestamental period (the interval between {{the writing of}} the Hebrew Bible and {{the writing of the}} Christian New Testament). 1 Maccabees (part of the Christian Deuterocanon) 3:49 mentions men who had ended their nazirite vows, an example dated to about 166 BCE. Josephus mentions {{a number of people who}} had taken the vow, such as his tutor <b>Banns</b> (Antiquities 20.6), and Gamaliel records in the Mishna how the father of Rabbi Chenena made a lifetime nazirite vow before him (Nazir 29b).|$|E
25|$|Ontario {{became the}} third {{jurisdiction}} {{in the world}} (after the Netherlands and Belgium) {{as well as the}} first jurisdiction in the Americas to legalize same-sex marriage. The first legal same-sex marriage registered in Ontario was that of Paula Barrero and Blanca Mejias, married by <b>banns</b> at the Emmanuel Howard Park United Church on September 29, 2001 and registered the same year. The officiant was Rev. Dr. Cheri DiNovo (now MPP for Parkdale–High Park). The Office of the Registrar General apparently did not recognize the names as both being women and issued a marriage certificate. The marriage licence form requested only the names of the bride and groom, not the sex of the applicants.|$|E
25|$|While {{the baby}} is rescued and Ava names her Avery, both Sonny and Ava are sent to prison leaving the child in Kiki's care. Kiki is devastated when Ava is killed trying to escape prison. Meanwhile, Sonny is given a pardon and is free to raise Avery and Kiki decides against {{fighting}} for custody. Morgan and Kiki side with Sonny when Michael decides he wants to raise Avery believing he is only taking custody of Avery to punish Sonny. Michael wins the custody battle and <b>banns</b> everyone, including Kiki from visiting Avery. Furious when Michael hires Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) -- the woman who caused Ava to go into premature labor—as Avery's nanny, Kiki goes along with Morgan's plan to drug Michael {{to get him to}} act out in public so he will lose custody of Avery. Just before they go back to court, baby Avery is kidnapped. Meanwhile, Morgan and Kiki bond and rekindle their romance as she forms a connection with the mysterious Denise DeMuccio—claiming to be her mother's identical twin. As Kiki bonds with Denise, Silas is very weary of their growing connection. Kiki is devastated when she finds Silas murdered in July 2015 and believes Franco is responsible. During Franco's trial, Kiki is shocked to learn that Denise is actually a very much alive Ava. Kiki is devastated when Franco suddenly admits that Ava and Morgan have been sleeping together behind her back.|$|E
500|$|On 10 February 1616, Judith Shakespeare married Thomas Quiney, a vintner of Stratford, in Holy Trinity Church. [...] The {{assistant}} vicar, Richard Watts, {{who later}} married Quiney's sister Mary, probably officiated. The wedding {{took place during}} the [...] pre-Lenten [...] season of Shrovetide, which was a prohibitive time for marriages. In 1616, the period in which marriages were banned without dispensation from the church, including Ash Wednesday and Lent, started on 23 January, Septuagesima Sunday and ended on 7 April, the Sunday after Easter. Hence the marriage required a special licence issued by the Bishop of Worcester, which the couple had failed to obtain. Presumably they had posted the required <b>banns</b> in church, since Walter Wright of Stratford was cited for marrying without <b>banns</b> or licence: but this was not considered sufficient. The infraction was a minor one apparently caused by the minister, as three other couples were also wed that February. Quiney was nevertheless summoned by Walter Nixon to appear before the Consistory court in Worcester. (This same Walter Nixon was later involved in a Star Chamber case and was found guilty of forging signatures and taking bribes). Quiney failed to appear by the required date. The register recorded the judgement, which was excommunication, on or about 12 March 1616. It is unknown if Judith was also excommunicated, but in any case the punishment did not last long. In November of the same year they were back in church for the baptism of their firstborn child.|$|E

500|$|... "Run the World" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash and Tricky Stewart. Lopez's vocals {{for the song}} were produced by Kuk Harrell, who also provided backing vocals alongside Anesha Birchett, Lauren Evans and The-Dream. The vocals were recorded by Jim Annunziato, Josh Gudwin at Record Plant Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, Larrabee Studios in Hollywood, California and MSR in New York City, New York. Brian [...] "B-Luv" [...] Thomas and Chris [...] "Tek" [...] O'Ryan handled audio engineering of [...] "Run the World", with additional engineering from Andrew Wuepper, Pat Thrall, Chris Galland and Chris Soper and assistance from Dustin Capulong, Nick <b>Banns</b> and Steven Dennis. The song was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua {{with the assistance of}} Jesus Garnica at Larrabee Studios.|$|E
500|$|In 1641 Bellingham {{was elected}} {{governor}} {{for the first}} time, running against Winthrop. [...] The Body of Liberties was formally adopted during his term. [...] However, he served for just one year, {{and was replaced by}} Winthrop in 1642. [...] Bellingham's defeat may have been caused in part by the scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage. [...] A friend who was a guest in his house had been courting Penelope Pelham, a young woman of twenty. [...] According to Winthrop, Bellingham, now 50 and a widower, won her heart, and, without waiting for the formalities of the <b>banns</b> of marriage, officiated at his own wedding. [...] When the issue came before the colonial magistrates, Bellingham (as the governor and chief magistrate) refused to step down from the bench to face the charges, thus bringing the matter to a somewhat awkward end. [...] Bellingham's term in office was characterized by Winthrop as extremely difficult: [...] "The General Court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of Bellingham's unfriendliness to some other magistrates. [...] He set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings, which did much to retard business".|$|E

2500|$|Two {{years after}} Lachmann's first husband died, [...] "Pauline Thérèse Lachmann" [...] (as the {{marriage}} <b>banns</b> read) and her rich Portuguese suitor were married on 5 June 1851, {{at a church}} in Passy; the writer Théophile Gautier {{was one of the}} witnesses. The day following the wedding, however, according to the memoirs of Count Horace de Viel-Castel, the new Madame de Païva gave her husband a letter ending the marriage. [...] "You have obtained the object of your desire and have succeeded in making me your wife," [...] she wrote. [...] "I, on the other hand, have acquired your name, and we can cry quits. I have acted my part honestly and without disguise, and the position I aspired to I have gained; but as for you, Mons. de Païva, you are saddled with a wife of foulest repute, whom you can introduce to no society, for no one will receive her. Let us part; go back to your country; I have your name, and will stay where I am".|$|E
2500|$|For {{its first}} 16 years, Greenwich was Dutch property. Within weeks of his arrival, one of Dutch Director Peter Stuyvesant's first actions was to {{strengthen}} {{his claim to}} the area to prevent large English colonies from establishing themselves closer to the Dutch on Manhattan. [...] He purchased and received title from the Munsee named Seyseychimmus, to all the land between {{the west bank of}} the Mianus River and Stamford's Mill River, (natively called the Seweyruc), and confiscated the Feake/Patrick property in the process. [...] Angered by this, Stamford men, who answered to the New Haven Colony, demanded renegotiation of the border between New Netherland and New England. In 1650, [...] The Treaty of Hartford terms weakened Dutch control. Treaty terms, negotiated by Peter Stuyvesant and men from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, dictated that while the Dutch would continue to own the land of Groenwits, they would treat inhabitants there as jurisdictional neutrals. (This language was related to the plight of Elizabeth Fones Winthrop Feake Hallett, a niece, daughter-in-law and ward of Gov. John Winthrop, and her legal, matrimonial, political and land title disputes. She was a politically charged figure in English inter-colony squabbling). Further, this treaty prevented the Dutch from establishing any more homesteads within 6 miles of {{the west bank of the}} Mianus River. (This river was natively called the [...] "Kechkawes" [...] and called [...] "Greenwich Bay" [...] by the English). [...] Eroding jurisdictional oversight of Greenwich inhabitants resulted in early Greenwich farmers who [...] "live in a disorderly and riotous manner, sell intoxicating liquors to the Indians, receive and harbor servants who have fled their masters, and join persons unlawfully in marriage." [...] There were also cases of runaway Dutch Manhattan teenagers coming to Greenwich to be wed by a farmer there, (likely Andrew Crabb), who dispensed with the publication of pre-wedding <b>banns,</b> or advance public notification. In 1656, when Dutch power had significantly declined, the New Haven Colony did exert jurisdiction over Greenwich and considered it a part of Stamford. With the fall of New Netherland to the English in 1664, the General Assembly in Hartford declared Greenwich a separate township from Stamford.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, dear," [...] said Jude gaily at breakfast; [...] "as this is Saturday I mean to {{call about}} the <b>banns</b> at once, {{so as to}} get the first {{publishing}} done to-morrow, or we shall lose a week. <b>Banns</b> will do? We shall save a pound or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have a year. Make {{the most}} of it! And be sure you're in time to claim your wife! Be back to have your <b>banns</b> up in time to be married on the 11th April. If you're not, I tell you I shall have my <b>banns</b> up, and you may get back too late.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} {{just now}} going on was concerning the <b>banns,</b> the last publication {{of which had}} been on the Sunday previous.|$|E

60|$|Saturday! Saturday! Saturday! oh, how I am {{longing for}} Saturday, when I shall see you again! We {{will go on}} Sunday and hear the <b>banns</b> together.|$|E
60|$|Wendy {{was married}} in white {{with a pink}} sash. It is strange to think that Peter did not alight {{in the church and}} forbid the <b>banns.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of justice it is almost due to me," [...] said Wildeve. [...] "Think what I have gone through to win her consent; the insult that it is to any man to have the <b>banns</b> forbidden: the double insult to a man unlucky enough to be cursed with sensitiveness, and blue demons, and Heaven knows what, as I am. I can never forget those <b>banns.</b> A harsher man would rejoice now in the power I have of turning upon your aunt by going no further in the business." ...|$|E
60|$|Sue absently {{agreed to}} <b>banns.</b> But her {{mind for the}} moment was running on {{something}} else. A glow had passed away from her, and depression sat upon her features.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may not be," [...] spake up one {{of those}} of Emmet. [...] "The <b>banns</b> have not been duly published, neither is there any priest here to marry them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Stanbury {{is ready}} at any time," [...] {{continued}} Nora. [...] "He {{would have the}} <b>banns</b> at once read, and marry me in three weeks,--if I would let him." ...|$|E
60|$|A natural {{incident}} relieved her anxiety. Izz {{mentioned the}} omission of the <b>banns</b> to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron's privilege of speaking to Angel on the point.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{a bit of}} the Regulations," [...] Matthews whispered. [...] "Just like forbiddin' the <b>banns</b> in church. Really, it was all settled {{long ago}} when the names first came up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Sally, {{we think}} your young man very nice. We are {{prepared}} to welcome him into our family. Let the <b>banns</b> be called and I will compose a nuptial song." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And pray,' cried Lucilla, {{rallying}} her sauciness, 'how do {{you propose}} ever to have <b>banns</b> to publish, if young men and maidens are never to meet by water nor by land?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha-ha! Such well-kept news!" [...] laughed they, Yes--so they laughed, alas for me. [...] "Whose <b>banns</b> {{were called}} in church to-day?" [...] - Christ, how I wished my soul could flee! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, it will do. I didn't {{know the}} two had walked {{together}} since last fall, when her aunt forbad the <b>banns.</b> How long has this new set-to been mangling then? Do you know, Humphrey?" ...|$|E
