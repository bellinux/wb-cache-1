40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} cardiac {{electrical function}} in the Spectacled Flying Fox (bat) infested with Ixodes holocyclus. Design: Prospective clinical investigation of bats treated for naturally occurring tick toxicity. Procedure: ECGs were performed on bats with tick toxicity (n = 33), bats that recovered slowly (n = 5) and normally (n = 5) following treatment for tick toxicity, and on normal bats with no history of tick toxicity (n = 9). Results: Bats with tick toxicity had significantly prolonged corrected QT intervals, bradycardia and rhythm disturbances which included sinus <b>bradydysrhythmia,</b> atrial standstill, ventricular premature complexes, and idioventricular <b>bradydysrhythmia.</b> Conclusions: The QT prolongation observed on ECG traces of bats with tick toxicity reflected delayed ventricular repolarisation and predisposed to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death in response to sympathetic stimulation. The inability to document ventricular tachycardia in bats shortly before death from tick toxicity {{may be explained by}} a lack of sympathetic resporisiveness attributable to the unique parasympathetic innervation of the bat heart, or hypothermia-induced catecholamine receptor down-regulation. Bradycardia and rhythm disturbances may be attributable to hypothermia...|$|E
40|$|Epsom salts {{contains}} the active compound magnesium sulfate {{and is used}} most commonly as a laxative. There are potential serious toxic effects, including cardiac arrest, when the serum concentration rises above therapeutic values. We present a case of deliberate self poisoning with a large quantity of Epsom salts, resulting in a toxic serum magnesium concentration of 9. 7 mmol/l (0. 70 â€“ 1. 0 mmol/l). Clinical features included limb weakness, vomiting and confusion, with a subsequent rapid deterioration in level of consciousness and <b>bradydysrhythmia.</b> There was no significant response to calcium gluconate, so haemodialysis was urgently arranged. The patient made a full recovery. Hypermagnesaemia is unusual in patients with normal renal function. Although clinical severity does not always correlate with serum magnesium values, risk of cardiac arrest occurs with concentrations > 6 mmol/l. Initial treatment is supportive. Dialysis should be considered when life threatening features or renal impairment are present...|$|E

Third-degree atrioventricular	 (AV) 	 block	 (also referred to	as	complete	heart	block) 	 is	the	complete dissociation of	the	atria	and	the	ventricles. 1 	Third-degree AV	block	exists	when	more	P	waves	than QRS complexes	exist	and	no	relationship	(no	con-duction) 	 exists	between	them. 2 	The	escape	rhythm may arise	within	the	AV	node	(resulting	in	a	narrow QRS complex),	 or	lower	in	the	conduction	system (producing a	wide	QRS	complex).

50|$|Parasympatholytic {{drugs are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to treat}} slow heart rhythms (bradycardias or <b>bradydysrhythmias)</b> caused by myocardial infarctions or other pathologies, {{as well as to}} treat conditions that cause bronchioles in the lung to constrict, such as asthma. By blocking the parasympathetic nervous system, parasympatholytic drugs can increase heart rate in patients with bradycardic heart rhythms, and open up airways and reduce mucous production in patients suffering from asthma.|$|R
40|$|In 20 {{children}} needing {{treatment for}} symptomatic sick sinus syndrome, {{the average age}} at presentation was 7. 1 years and ranged from 9 months to 18 years. Symptoms were never precise but, in retrospect, 5 children had syncope, 7 had a rapid heart action, 6 had dyspnoea or tachypnoea, 2 had nonspecific chest pains, 2 had pale spells, and 1 had a sudden hemiplegia. Symptoms followed cardiac surgery in 15 cases and were related to unoperated congenital heart disease in 2 and to myocarditis in 2. The aetiology was unknown in 1 case. The type of cardiac surgery resulting {{in the development of}} the sick sinus syndrome was predominantly related to atrial suturing. Both tachy- and <b>bradydysrhythmias</b> were found, including wandering atrial pacemaker (9 cases), junctional rhythm (19 cases), supraventricular tachycardia (9 cases), atrial flutter (11 cases), and atrial fibrillation (2 cases). Both atrial (8 cases) and ventricular (7 cases) premature beats were seen. All patients were given trials of drug therapy but difficulties were encountered. Cardioversion was used for tachyarrhythmias in 11 cases without serious problems. Six children had permanent cardiac pacemakers inserted with good results. Recognition of the sick sinus syndrome in childhood is important and treatment must be regulated by the severity of symptoms...|$|R
