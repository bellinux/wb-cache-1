This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock.</b> In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E

Orphaned as a child by his mother's death and his father's abandonment, Hamilton was taken in by an older cousin and later by a prosperous {{merchant}} family. He was recognized for his intelligence and talent, and sponsored {{by a group of}} wealthy local men to travel to New York City to pursue his education. Hamilton attended King's College (now Columbia University), choosing to stay in the Thirteen Colonies to seek his fortune.|$|E
5|$|Very {{was born}} on August 28, 1813, in Salem, Massachusetts and {{spent much of his}} {{childhood}} at sea. He was the oldest of six children, <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock</b> to two first cousins; his sister Lydia also became a writer. His mother, Lydia Very, was known for being an aggressive freethinker who made her atheistic beliefs known to all. She believed that marriage was only a moral arrangement and not a legal one. His father, also named Jones Very, was a captain during the War of 1812 and was held in Nova Scotia for a time by the British as a prisoner of war. When the younger Jones Very was ten, his father, by then a shipmaster, took him on a sailing voyage to Russia. A year later, his father had Very serve as a cabin boy on a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. His father died on the return trip, apparently due to a lung disease he contracted while in Nova Scotia.|$|E

She {{is the child}} of Jalil and Nana <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wedlock.</b> She suffers shame {{throughout}} her childhood because of the circumstances of her birth. Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam {{is that she is}} isolated {{in every sense of the}} word. She is a woman who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants connection with another human being." [...] Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a [...] "friend and a doting alternative mother" [...] to her through the [...] "common hardship" [...] of being married to the [...] "abusive, psychologically imposing" [...] Rasheed.|$|R

50|$|Pahlavi's first {{marriage}} was to Mirza 'Ali Muhammed Khan Ghavam, Nasir ud-Daula (born 1911). They {{were married in}} March 1937 and divorced in 1942.

5|$|Welles's alleged {{biological}} son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock</b> to Welles {{and actress}} Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles {{when he was}} 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play Chimes at Midnight. This was the only {{significant amount of time}} that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was 16, Welles's eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles's influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles's youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of Chimes at Midnight.|$|E
5|$|Castro was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock</b> at his father's farm on August 13, 1926. His father, Ángel Castro y Argiz, was {{a migrant}} to Cuba from Galicia, Northwest Spain. He had become financially {{successful}} by growing sugar cane at Las Manacas farm in Birán, Oriente Province {{and after the}} collapse of his first marriage he took his household servant, Lina Ruz González – of Canarian origin – as his mistress and later second wife; together they had seven children, among them Fidel. Aged six, Castro was sent to live with his teacher in Santiago de Cuba, before being baptized into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of eight. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, so he was sent to the privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945, Castro transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sports.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese colonial-era, a {{sizeable}} minority of mixed-race Japanese-Palauans emerged. Japanese-Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between Japanese men and Palauan women. Most of them lived in urban areas, and {{were brought up}} in accordance to Japanese norms and values and spoke Japanese in their daily lives. A few sought further education in Japan, {{and at the same}} time had limited knowledge of Palauan customs and language, although children that were <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock</b> reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both Japanese and Palauan fluently. Although Japanese-Palauan children were generally classified as Japanese in official figures and had access to Japanese social privileges, many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in Japanese and Palauan circles. In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations, spouses and mistresses of Japanese men were shunned upon, and Palauan nationalists (especially Modekngei) actively discouraged mixed unions between Japanese men and Palauan women. The Japanese government encouraged such intermarriages, and provided social benefits to women who had married Japanese men. However, only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying Palauan women, although they were allowed to keep mistresses. The civilian government suppressed unions between Palauan men and Japanese women, and there was only one known case of a union between a Palauan man and a Japanese woman during the Japanese colonial-era.|$|E
50|$|<b>Born</b> in Utrecht, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock,</b> {{he was the}} son of Cypriaan Gerard Berger van Hengst and Johanna Wagenaar. Wagenaar's {{parents were}} of {{different}} social strata: his father was an aristocrat, while his mother was of more humble origins. For this reason, Wagenaar's parents were not married, and thus Wagenaar received his mother's name as his family name. While Wagenaar resented that his parents never got married, he was by no means neglected by his father.|$|R
5000|$|In Medieval Wales, {{prior to}} its conquest by and {{incorporation}} in England, a [...] "bastard" [...] was defined solely as a child not acknowledged by his father.

5000|$|Section 309 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 {{as amended}} (codified as section 1409 of Title 8 of the United States Code) deals with U.S. {{citizenship}} for children born outside the U.S., <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock,</b> to an American parent. If {{a child is}} <b>born</b> abroad, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock,</b> to an American mother, the child automatically acquires U.S. citizenship at birth, provided the mother had [...] "previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year". An illegitimate foreign-born child of an American father and an alien mother, on the other hand, is recognized as a U.S. citizen only if a much more complex and stringent set of conditions are met: the father's paternity must be convincingly established prior to the child's 18th birthday, and the father must also agree in writing to provide financial support to the child until he or she reaches age 18.|$|R
50|$|At the court, Meurig {{makes his}} claim for Mallilie, {{producing}} written {{proof of his}} paternity. The manor lies within Wales; under Welsh law, a recognised son, <b>born</b> in or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wedlock,</b> has an over-riding claim to his father's property. Cadfael intervenes, stating that Meurig cannot inherit as he murdered Bonel. He produces the vial and challenges Meurig to display his scrip (linen pouch) to show where the strongly scented oil leaked into it. Meurig flees. Cadfael asks the court to send word of Meurig's guilt to Shrewsbury and returns to Rhydycroesau.|$|R
