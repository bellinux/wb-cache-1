5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} <b>between</b> <b>males</b> {{have been found to be}} more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place <b>between</b> <b>males.</b> The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E

5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing <b>between</b> <b>males.</b> Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E

500|$|Motohiro {{wanted the}} series to counter {{concurrent}} anime trends. The use of moe (slang) was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like Mobile Suit Gundam and Patlabor {{that focus on}} conflicts <b>between</b> <b>male</b> characters. As the series was [...] "anti-moe", the team decided to avoid having the female lead character Akane remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict <b>between</b> the <b>male</b> characters appeared to attract the shonen ai genre fans. Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance <b>between</b> <b>male</b> characters, he believed the fight scenes <b>between</b> <b>male</b> characters unintentionally attracted female fans. The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.|$|R
5|$|In most {{grasshopper}} species, conflicts <b>between</b> <b>males</b> over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays.

5|$|Whether Smilodon {{was sexually}} dimorphic has {{implications}} for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression <b>between</b> <b>males</b> was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, {{there would have been}} evolutionary selection for competition <b>between</b> <b>males.</b> The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.|$|E

5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} <b>between</b> <b>males</b> usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact.

A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the differences among selected factors that have influenced the appointment of female and selected male superintendents in Georgia. Participants were all sixteen superintendents (100 percent of the female population) and sixteen selected male superintendents. Techniques for matching the population included controlling for the following: number of students served by the district, number of schools in the district, being appointed or elected to the superintendency, school board selection process, number of school board members, and geographical location. A thirty-three item survey, developed by the researcher, was used to collect the data for the study. The statistical procedure used was the t test, and the level of significance was preestablished at. 05 The major findings of the study were: (1) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the number of birth or adopted children which they have, (2) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the age at which their first administrative position was received, (3) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the number of years served in their present position, (4) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the age at which they received the rank of superintendent, (5) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the number of years which they served as principals, (6) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the level of their central office experience, and (7) a significant difference was found to exist <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female superintendents regarding the number of years served as central office administrator prior to their superintendenc...|$|R
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked.

The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that}} of the stoat.
