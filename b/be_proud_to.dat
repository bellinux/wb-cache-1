5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The Yiddish King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{expansion}} in Henry and Clem's South Bend business came from their {{being in the}} right place {{to meet the needs of}} the California Gold Rush that began in 1849. From his wheelbarrow enterprise at Placerville, John M. had amassed $8,000. In April 1858, he quit and moved out to apply this to financing the vehicle manufacturing of H & C Studebaker, which was already booming because of a big order to build wagons for the US Army. In 1857, they had also built their first carriage—"Fancy, hand-worked iron trim, the kind of courting buggy any boy and girl would <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> be seen in".|$|E

25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would we allow him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. And what about prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would we allow him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? The answer is that in those cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One should <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E

500|$|Smythe also envisioned {{building}} a new shrine for his team. He described it as [...] "a place where people can go in evening clothes, {{if they want to}} come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. [...] They referred to the arena plan as [...] "Smythe's Folly". [...] To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. [...] In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} Champions League group {{stage in the}} 2003–04 season and faced Dynamo Kiev, Internazionale and Lokomotiv Moscow. Without a win in their first three matches, Arsenal faced an early exit from the {{competition}} but managed a victory against Dynamo Kiev, after defender Ashley Cole scored via a header. At the San Siro, Arsenal beat Internazionale 1–5, in a performance described as [...] "one of the greatest results in [...] history". A win in their final group game against Lokomotiv Moscow was enough for Arsenal to top their group and play an unseeded team in the last 16. Arsenal eliminated Celta Vigo and faced fellow English club Chelsea at the quarter-final stage. Going into the first leg, Arsenal were favourites, having played their London rivals three times during the course the season, winning each occasion. Former Dutch international Johan Cruyff backed Arsenal to win the competition, saying [...] "If Arsenal win it playing football the way only they know how then Europe would <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> have such champions". In spite of Robert Pirès scoring a vital away goal at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea beat Arsenal 1–2 at Highbury to progress into the semi-finals. A year later, Arsenal exited the Champions League after losing 2–3 to Bayern Munich on aggregate, in the last 16 stage.|$|E

500|$|The Surrey {{committee}} initially {{attempted to}} keep the dispute private, but Crawford sent copies of the letters to the newspapers, explaining in a letter that he wished to end speculation about his absence from the Surrey team. Burns notes that this [...] " [...] a strong response from the public, mainly unsympathetic to the young amateur" [...] in the letters pages of many newspapers. Many commentators felt that the argument could have been resolved easily had either side made concessions. Green comments that the committee probably either expected Crawford to back down, or were happy to sacrifice him to establish their authority. Another of the players involved, Rushby, left Surrey {{at the end of}} the season to play league cricket, but later returned to the team. Crawford's father made a further attempt to end the dispute between Surrey and his son in 1910, asking the committee to reverse their decision. Wisden reported that Alverstone declined on the grounds that it would suggest a lack of confidence in the committee, but that if Crawford [...] "came forward in a sportsmanlike way [...] would <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> give his personal support to the step proposed.

[...] Kerri Mason of Billboard felt that the [...] "country ballad" [...] made no contextual sense. Nekesa Mumbi Moody, while reviewing Born This Way for Florida Today, compared the song to [...] "Speechless", a similar tempo song included on The Fame Monster (2009).

[...] Amy Sciarretto of Artistdirect concluded that the song was [...] "a bit bluesier than anything you'd expect from the dance floor icon."

500|$|Griswold {{first met}} Edgar Allan Poe in Philadelphia in May 1841 {{while working for}} the Daily Standard. At the outset, their {{relationship}} was cordial, at least superficially. In a letter dated March 29, 1841, Poe sent Griswold several poems for The Poets and Poetry of America anthology, writing that he would <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> see [...] "one {{or two of them}} in the book". Griswold included three of these poems: [...] "Coliseum", [...] "The Haunted Palace", and [...] "The Sleeper". In November of that year, Poe, who had previously praised Griswold in his [...] "Autography" [...] series as [...] "a gentleman of fine taste and sound judgment", wrote a critical review of the anthology, on Griswold's behalf. Griswold paid Poe for the review and used his influence to have it published in a Boston periodical. The review was generally favorable, although Poe questioned the inclusion of certain authors and the omission of others. Poe also said that Griswold [...] "unduly favored" [...] New England writers. Griswold had expected more praise and Poe privately told others he was not particularly impressed by the book, even calling it [...] "a most outrageous humbug" [...] in a letter to a friend. In another letter, this time to fellow writer Frederick W. Thomas, Poe suggested that Griswold's promise to help get the review published was actually a bribe for a favorable review, knowing Poe needed the money.|$|E

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E
