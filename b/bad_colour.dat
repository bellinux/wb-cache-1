The skill with which the thirteenth century illuminators in books, and the Indians in shawls and carpets, use the minutest atoms of colour to gradate other colours, and confuse the eye, is the first secret in their gift of splendour: associated, however, with so many other artifices which are quite instinctive and unteachable, that it is of little use to dwell upon them. Delicacy of organization in the designer given, you will soon have all, and without it, nothing. However, not to close my book with desponding words, let me set down, as many of us like such things, five Laws to which there is no exception whatever, and which, if they can enable no one to produce good colour, are at least, as far as they reach, accurately condemnatory of <b>bad</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E

40|$|The $U$-polynomial of Noble and Welsh {{is known}} to have {{intimate}} connections with the Potts model as well as with several important graph polynomials. For each graph $G$, $U(G) $ is equivalent to Stanley's symmetric <b>bad</b> <b>colouring</b> polynomial $XB(G) $. Moreover Sarmiento established the equivalence between $U$ and the polychromate of Brylawski. Loebl defined the $q$-dichromate $B_q(G,x,y) $ as a function of a graph $G$ and three independent variables $q,x,y$, proved that it is equal to the partition function of the Potts model with variable number of states and with a certain external field contribution, and conjectured that the $q$-dichromate is equivalent to the $U$-polynomial. He also proposed a stronger conjecture on integer partitions. The aim of this paper is two-fold. We present a construction disproving Loebl's integer partitions conjecture, and we introduce a new function $B_{r,q}(G;x,k) $ which is also equal to the partition function of the Potts model with variable number of states and with a (different) external field contribution, and we show that $B_{r,q}(G;x,k) $ is equivalent to the $U$-polynomial and to Stanley's symmetric <b>bad</b> <b>colouring</b> polynomial...|$|R

60|$|There is, however, I think, one law about distance, {{which has}} some {{claims to be}} {{considered}} a constant one: namely, that dullness and heaviness of colour are more or less indicative of nearness. All distant colour is pure colour: it may not be bright, but it is clear and lovely, not opaque nor soiled; for the air and light coming between us and any earthy or imperfect colour, purify or harmonise it; hence a bad colourist is peculiarly incapable of expressing distance. I do not of course mean that you are to use <b>bad</b> <b>colours</b> in your foreground by way of making it come forward; but only that a failure in colour, there, will not put it out of its place; while a failure in colour in the distance will at once do away with its remoteness: your dull-coloured foreground will still be a foreground, though ill-painted; but your ill-painted distance will not be merely a dull distance,--it will be no distance at all.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Classical liquid foods {{treatments}} {{methods are}} {{various forms of}} thermal processing which trigger unwanted reactions (<b>bad</b> <b>colour,</b> loss of flavour, nutrients and vitamins). Therefore great needs of fresh-like foods induce interests in non-thermal processing methods such as Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) developed to minimise the above observed degradations. Many empirical experimental results have been obtained: PEF applied to liquid foods should hold some characteristics {{in order to obtain}} the inactivation of the unwanted micro-organisms. Some authors affirm that the exposed microorganisms to PEF may result in dielectric breakdown of the cell membrane that can be reversible or not depending on the parameters of the applied PEF. But the modelling of the destruction due to PEF still remained not well known. The aims of the present study are to propose models and solutions that describe quantitatively that phenomenon of microorganism inactivation obtained by PEF. We limit the analysis to the specific case of Saccharomyces-cerevisiae micro organism. The originality of this article consists in combining electromagnetic studies with finite elements method to analyse that mechanism of inactivation. Different models and graphs of values of physical quantities focusing on the effects of the PEF on microbiological cells also constitute some of the results...|$|E

In this examination, six kind of gingerbread was made. The difference in the compound of the examined gingerbreads was use of various kinds of sweeteners. For this examination were used honey, invert sugar and malt extract. For the other gingerbread doughs were used these combinations of sweeteners (invert sugar + honey, invert sugar + malt extract and honey + malt extract). For this sensory analysis were used eight descriptors [...] shape, colour, surface, smell, porosity, aroma of spices, overall flavour and overall impression. Besides the sensory analysis, also was measured colour of gingerbreads with using spectrophotometer. By the sensory analysis and spectrophotometric determinativ was found, that the darkest gingerbreads were with invert sugar in combination with honey and the lightnest gingerbreads were with malt extract and with honey. From {{the results of this}} sensory analysis was defined that, the sample where invert sugar was used, gave best results. The use of malt extract for gingerbread dough is not suitable, mainly because of the <b>bad</b> <b>colour,</b> smell and flavour of the final product.

40|$|The Amish {{religious}} movement {{have its}} roots in the Protestant Reformation in the 16 th century. The Amish people are anabaptists and have strict rules for their way of life. They were persecuted in Europe and Amish groups emigrated to Pennsylvania. Today the most traditional part of the movement – the Old Amish People – lives in Lancaster County west of Philadelphia, USA. This paper describs a study of the colours in Old Amish Quilts, traditional Amish patchwork quilts used as bed covers. The patches are single-coloured fabric pieces forming clear symmetrical patterns with deep and strong colours. The quilts are important in Amish culture; they are made for the bride’s wedding chest. Nowadays traditional Amish quilts also are made for turists as wall decorations – “wallhangings”. The selection of quilts for my survey consists of five Old Amish Quilts from Lancaster Heritage Museum and The American Quilt Study Group, 15 quilts, at that time, belonging to The Esprit Collection and eight new quilts with traditional patterns (wallhangings). The colour analysis was carried out using Natural Colour System (NCS) with the aim of identifying general principles for selection of colours. The analysis shows that most hues are located in {{the lower part of the}} colour circle ・from red (R) to green (G), and most nuances - with relatively high degree of blackness or chromaticness - in the lower part of the colour triangle. Colour choice is often dependent on moral or religious preferences. For example, in quilts from Lancaster County, yellowish colours are - as representing ・hochmut・ (arrogance) - regarded as <b>bad</b> <b>colour</b> choice. The strong colours in Old Amish Quilts have no counterpart in public life. In Lancaster county Amish people wear black, brown and dark blue clothes and their wagons are black; colourfulness is restricted to the bedrooms and the private sphere...|$|E

This system still provides the majority of the visual information we receive about the world, including information about geomet-ric structure and motion.

According to a socio-economic survey, both lagoons have been moderately to high saline water bodies {{and the latter}} was an important center of prawn fishery until the late 1960 s. Two irrigation projects upstream (Udawalawe irrigation scheme and Muruthawela Wewa), which came into operation in 1967 and 1968 respectively, increased fresh-water inflows to these two lagoons and altered flora, fauna, and water quality, with a decline of lagoon fishery as a result. At the same time, the increase in freshwater favorised the Mangrove Apple Sonneratia caseolaris to expand spontaneously. Following many hectares of vegetation increase of this species, our study focused on recovering the economic loss of fisheries decline by using new ethnobotanic infor-mation on this species. We found that the pulp of {{the fruit of the}} Mangrove Apple is tasty and can be used to prepare a fruit drink. However, it has not been commer-cialised, or even practiced widely at homes, {{due to the fact that}} numerous small seeds in the fruit release certain phenolic compounds when damaged, giving a <b>bad</b> <b>colour</b> and an astringent taste to the pulp.

40|$|Iron is {{commonly}} present in groundwater worldwide. The presence of iron {{in drinking water}} is not harmful to human health, however it is undesirable because of the associated aesthetic and operational problems, namely: <b>bad</b> taste, <b>colour,</b> stains on laundry and plumbing fixtures, and aftergrowth in the distribution system. Iron is generally removed from groundwater {{by the process of}} aeration followed by rapid sand fihration. This study reveals that two mechanisms are involved in this process, namely: "floc filtration" and "adsorptive filtration". Floc filtration comprises the oxidation of iron(ll), wbicb is the dominant form of iron in groundwater, to iron(lll) followed by floc formation and removal ofthe flocs by rapid sand filtration. In adsorptive fihration, iron(ll) is adsorbed onto filter media and subsequently oxidised to iron(lll), forming a coating on the filter media. Under the ommonly applied treatment conditions in iron removing plants the floc filtration is expected to be dominant and tbe adsorptive filtration complimentary. A pilot study conducted at the Gilze water treatment plant of Water Supply North West Brabant demonstrated that adsorptive filtration has several potential advantages over floc filtration, namely: longer filter runs due to slower head loss development, better fihrate quality, shorter ripening time and less backwash water use. In existing groundwater treatment plants, the high irondi) adsorption capacity ofthe iron oxide coated filter media makes it potentially possible to switch tbe goveming mode of operation from floc filtration to adsorptive filtration. To achieve this two options can be considered, they are: (i) iron(ll) adsorption under anoxic conditions followed by oxidation with oxygen-rich water and, (ii) adsorption of iron(ll) in the presence of oxygen and simultaneous oxidation. The first option might be attractive specifically when two filtration steps are available...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{public space}} {{is one of}} the main {{components}} in urban planning because it emphasizes the interaction between people and the city itself. Public space often refers to a place that is open and accessible to all citizens but the idea of public space has changed during time and different cultures. This thesis is an analyse of urban public space in a large scale city, Beijing. The historic capital of China is right now in an intensive development phase where the urban public space is transforming. Although Beijing is more and more influenced by Western urban planning, the city still retains the traditions and symbols of ancient imperial times mixed with communist planning ideals. The analyse focused on three different categories: Form, Activities and Image/Symbols and were done through a field study of four different public spaces. These observations were also combined with literature studies and interviews with Chinese planners. The main questions were: • What perceptions does planners in Beijing hold of the idea of public space? • How is the urban public space in Beijing organized and shaped? • What kinds of activities do the residents of Beijing pursue in the use of urban public space? • How is symbolism used in Chinese planning of the urban public space, and what role does it have? It was found that Beijing has a top-down urban planning system which seems to carry on short-term goals where citizen participation is absent. Because of the rapid development, the relation to the urban context and the design quality is often poor. Chinese public space are generally of large scale, many of them expressing the power of the regime. Another conclusion was that the shape of the space is very different from Europe. Chinese public space can generally be divided into two different categories; spaces of spatiality -rooms within rooms or monumental spaces of symmetry. There is an obvious connection between outdoor quality and outdoor activities. A hypothetical conclusion is that well-defined human scale spaces results in spaces of vitality that encourages people to take part in social activities. It was also found that symbolism is an important part of Chinese culture and urban community. Feng shui is important in the way of avoiding <b>bad</b> elements. <b>Colours,</b> orientation, hierarchy and shape are important factors to consider when planning Chinese urban public spaces.
