That is an opportunity of a new usage in our country of the vegetable oils, for electricity production and heating, instead of the current situation of using it in transportation as biodiesel fuel. The research is concentrated on crude vegetable oils obtained from some indigenous cultures: rape, soy, sun flower, corn and <b>bastard</b> <b>saffron.</b> An analysis of the agricultural potential of oleaginous plants is made, the feedstock and the costs being essential in the choosing of the energy crops sort. The typical properties of some crude vegetable oils are presented and the first experiments on their ignition conditions...|$|E
