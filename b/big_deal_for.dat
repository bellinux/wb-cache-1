With the {{independent}} release of “Emotions” this rapidly selling single created a bidding war with the major labels. That bidding war birthed a deal with Atlantic Records, thus solidifying a history-making joint venture. The deal with Creator’s Way and the Atlantic was the <b>biggest</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> an independent rap label and an established record company at that time. This allowed Traxster and the artists to have creative control over their projects. Traxster single-handedly produced, recorded, and mixed Adrenaline Rush, which is certified platinum. Soon after, Trax and his group, Shock The World, were also signed to Atlantic as recording artists, and was scheduled to release an album Blast For Me - A Thugs Religion in 1998. Due to financial and creative differences, the group split, and some members of Shock The World members decided to continue their career with Twista. This conflict led to the shelving of the group’s album and in 2002, Twista was released from Creator’s Way and was signed directly to Atlantic Records. The two reunited in 2005 to collaborate on the double-platinum record Kamikaze, but Traxster’s presence was missing from Twista’s following two albums.|$|R
