5|$|The Grizzlies {{had been}} created as an {{expansion}} team along with the Toronto Raptors in 1995. For the six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies performed poorly; they only once finished <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> in the Midwest Division and never reached the playoffs. The Grizzlies were owned by Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, who also owned the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). In 1999, Bill Laurie, owner of the NHL's St. Louis Blues, attempted to buy the Grizzlies, {{with the intent to}} move it to St. Louis. After interference by the NBA, the Grizzlies were sold to Michael Heisley. He immediately started the process to relocate the team, and seven U.S. cities were candidates for the team—Anaheim, California; Buffalo, New York; Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Las Vegas, Nevada; and San Diego, California—before settling on the move to Memphis {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Middlesbrough {{ultimately}} finished 12th in {{the table}} with 46 points, winning twelve, drawing ten and losing sixteen matches - slightly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> season, but their dismal form in the early and late part of the season prevented them from attaining an even higher position and at one time put them {{in danger of being}} relegated. The fact that they were 8 points away from a UEFA Cup spot and 8 points away from getting relegated neatly summed up their season.|$|E
25|$|A cataclysmic {{event for}} Chikun {{happened}} {{at the beginning of}} 1986. At around lunch time on January 6, 1986, Cho was leaving in his car when a motorcyclist came around from his blind spot. He had avoided Cho's car, only to have slid and overturned on his motorcycle. Cho was helping the motorcyclist to stand up, and then he went to pick the bike up when a car hit him. His right thigh was broken and he suffered other injuries. He was sent into the emergency room and had an operation the day after. The injuries would take three months to heal. Cho was determined not to let it affect him. Since his head and hand were fine, he went ahead and played {{the first game of the}} Kisei tournament. He played a good game, only to lose by 2.5 points. Cho recovered from the loss and took the next two games. Kobayashi then took 3 in a row and Cho was without a title for the first time in 8 years—something tremendous, considering he was only 29 years old. He went on to lose in a playoff for the Meijin, only to end the year with winning the Gosei title. This year ended <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> with a record of 35 wins and 17 losses.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B, explaining {{that while he}} thought it was [...] "much more fun" [...] than the previous week's episode and enjoyed Peter's expanded presence, he was growing slightly wearied by the [...] "hint-dropping" [...] of Peter's past. Murray thought the climax was [...] "so exciting" [...] that he was willing [...] "to forgive {{the fact that this is}} the third week in a row that Walter's big idea has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious". IGN's Travis Fickett rated it 7.5/10, writing that {{he thought it was}} a solid episode because the [...] "characters are coming together nicely, the story is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> week's – but already it seems the show is hitting a formula". Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe [...] "a solid show, but [...] exceptional yet".|$|E
500|$|... "Lotto" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote highly {{of the serious}} dialogue in the episode, noting that [...] "if there's been a consistent element to Paul Lieberstein's work on this show ... it's that he understands what makes the main characters tick, {{and is able to}} use that for real emotional resonance ... When the show wants to give Jim, or Pam, or Dwight, or now Andy a quiet, emotional moment, it's usually still able to do so very well, and that includes most of Andy and Darryl's interaction here in 'Lotto. He was, however, more critical of the episode's humor, noting that many of gags had been done before. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode superior to the previous episode commenting that [...] "While perhaps not monumentally <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> week's outing and damaged by a weak B-story, 'Lotto' had a greater sense of purpose that holds greater value to the season as it moves forward". He also complimented the writers for not focusing too much on Andy. He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E

500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. And {{when you have an}} actor of Hugh Laurie's range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems". The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships we care about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So different is the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E

The game was played in 20-minute halves at Regents Field in Ann Arbor. A newspaper account of the game noted that the score {{would have been more}} lopsided except that the Wolverines gave up the ball several times [...] "on fouls and off-sides." [...] The account also reported that [...] "Michigan showed up vastly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> year at this time in every feature of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Against Air Force, Notre Dame's next opponent, Montana again {{entered the}} game in the fourth quarter. Although Air Force led 30–10, Notre Dame won the game, 31–30. After the win against North Carolina, Devine said that Moose Krause, the Notre Dame Athletic Director, said that the game was the [...] "greatest {{comeback}} I've ever seen." [...] After the game against Air Force, Krause was quoted as saying: [...] "This one's <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> week."

2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} Fourth of July matchup with the New York Mets. The game was only the Dodgers second sellout {{of the season and}} for five innings Rubby De La Rosa offered hope, as he was working on a no-hitter. However, he gave up three doubles in the sixth and the Dodgers found themselves on the wrong end of [...] a 5-2 contest. The Dodgers offense continued to sputter the next day as they left 13 men on base in a 6-0 shut out loss to the Mets. The Dodgers lost their fifth straight game, when the Mets beat them 5-3 on July 6. [...] "Right now it's a little embarrassing because our team is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>last</b> place..." [...] Matt Kemp said to reporters after the game, [...] "I think we're all disappointed in ourselves at this moment, but we need to just not make excuses, keep playing the game and turn this thing around." [...] Another terrific pitching performance by Clayton Kershaw snapped the losing streak. He pitched eight shutout innings, while striking out nine in the 6-0 victory. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher with nine or more strikeouts in four consecutive starts since Hideo Nomo in 1996 Chad Billingsley matched Kershaw with eight shutout innings on July 8, Rafael Furcal came up with his first RBI since May 29 {{in the bottom of the}} eighth and rookie closer Javy Guerra escaped a bases loaded situation in the ninth as the Dodgers won their second straight shutout, 1-0, against the San Diego Padres. The next day was another pitching duel. Aaron Harang [...] and Rubby De La Rosa both pitched great games, De La Rosa only allowed one hit in his six innings of work and Harang was working on a no-hitter when he was taken out of the game after six. The Dodgers did not record a hit in the game until Juan Uribe doubled with two outs in the bottom of the ninth off Luke Gregerson. Dioner Navarro then singled him home for the winning run in the Dodgers second straight 1-0 victory over the Padres and their third straight shut out win. Andre Ethier hit two home runs on July 10, to lead the Dodgers to a 4-1 victory, their first series sweep of the season and first four-game winning streak of the season. They climbed out of last place and headed into the all-star break with a [...] 41-51 record.|$|E

Hart was a capital half-back too, and there was no better goal-keeper in the college than Wilson. We have not got any one to take their places, and there are four other vacancies in the team, and in each case those who have left were a lot bigger and stronger than any of the young ones we have got to choose from. I don't know who they will be yet, and must wait for the trial matches before we decide; but I think there is plenty of good material to choose from, and we shall be nearly all up to last year's mark, except in point of weight--there is a terrible falling off there, and we have no one who can fill the place of Wade. He was as strong as a bull; yes, he is an awful loss to us! There was not a fellow in the college who could go through a grease as he could. You remember last year how he rolled those fellows of Bishop's over and carried the ball right through them, and then kicked the deciding goal? That was grand! Why don't some of you fellows grow up like him?" [...] And he looked round reproachfully at his listeners.
