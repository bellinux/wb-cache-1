The former include Macomber and Spinks, the latter H. Engerding and E. Mazza. B. <b>Botte</b> suggested that the Words of Institution were originally not written but recited from memory.|$|E

500|$|Perrault's son Pierre Darmancour {{was assumed}} to have been {{responsible}} for the authorship of Histoires with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the youngest niece of Louis XIV, which was signed [...] "P. Darmancour". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of [...] "Les Souhaits Ridicules" [...] and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called [...] "Peau d'Ane". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat <b>Botté)</b> existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen {{years old at the time}} the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for [...] "La Belle au bois dormant", which the paper had published in 1696.|$|E
2500|$|Italian. The acute accent (sometimes called accento chiuso, [...] "closed accent" [...] in Italian) is {{compulsory}} only {{in words}} {{of more than}} one syllable stressed on their final vowel (and a few other words). Words ending in stressed -o are never marked with an acute accent (ó), but with a grave accent (ò). Therefore, only é and è are normally contrasted, typically in words ending in -ché, such as perché ("why/because"); in the conjugated copula è ("is"); in ambiguous monosyllables such as né ('neither') vs. ne ('of it') and sé ('itself') vs. se ('if'); and some verb forms, e.g. poté ("he/she/it could" [...] (past tense)). The symbol ó can be used in the body of a word for disambiguation, for instance between <b>bótte</b> ("barrel") and <b>bòtte</b> ("beating"), though this is not mandatory: in fact standard Italian keyboards lack a dedicated ó key.|$|E
