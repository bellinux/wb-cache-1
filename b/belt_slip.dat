50|$|Poor take-up {{adjustment}}: this is {{a simple}} adjustment on most systems yet it is often overlooked. The chain take-up device ensures that the chain is pulled tight as it leaves the drive unit. As wear occurs and the chain lengthens, the take-up extends under the force of its springs. As they extend, the spring force becomes less and the take-up has less effect. Simply compress the take-up springs and your problem goes away. Failure to do this can result in chain surging, jamming, and extreme wear on the track and chain. Take-up adjustment is also important for any conveyor using belts {{as a means to}} power rollers, or belts themselves being the mover. With poor-take up on belt-driven rollers, the belt may twist into the drive unit and cause damage, or at the least a noticeable decrease or complete loss of performance may occur. In the case of belt conveyors, a poor take-up may cause drive unit damage or may let the <b>belt</b> <b>slip</b> off of the side of the chassis.|$|E
50|$|The Barrett 240LWS {{features}} a removable and telescoping buttstock, that can has 6 adjustable positions. It {{differs from the}} buttstock of the 240LW by being half of its size in length, and doesn't have a polymer cheek piece. There are two telescoping rods that allows the buttstock to be extended to the desired position, when depressed from the top portion. The rods have indentations on them, which lock into positional latches within {{the rear of the}} buttstock. The hydraulic buffer is permanently encased within the stock and is necessary for recoil reduction from the reciprocating movement of the bolt group. Early prototypes had steel QD sling sockets {{on both sides of the}} stock, however current production versions will have solid steel sling loops on either side of it. This is to alleviate any damage that may occur to a sling mounted on the QD socket, and the amount of stress that it could take while carrying the machine gun. It also {{features a}} Picatinny rail that is longer compared to the Picatinny rail of the M240 machine guns, and where the Barrett M107A1 rear sight can be mounted and other various optics. The design of the feed tray cover hinge has been altered to be in the shape of a hexagon, thus allowing for the feed tray cover to be able to stay open while at a 45 degree angle to the receiver, while the machine gunner is loading a belt of ammunition. The feed tray has also been altered, with two protruding spring-loaded teeth which can bend in the direction of the ammunition belt. These teeth allows the operator to securely place a belt of ammunition on the feed tray, while at an upright angle, and not have the <b>belt</b> <b>slip</b> out while closing the cover. In addition they allow the operator to be able to squeeze the front of the belt into a closed cover because the teeth only bends in the direction of the belt, and the belt will pass over them, then the teeth will click upwards, thus locking the belt in place. Another click forward, and the belt of ammunition will be in place to fire. This allows the operator to feed a belt of ammunition into his 240LWS without ever having to possibly expose his position or line of sight, by opening the feed tray cover.|$|E

The aim was to quantify kinematics of child occupants during swerving maneuvers focusing on the child’s lateral movement and seat belt position relative to the child’s shoulder. A study was conducted on a closed-circuit test track with 16 children aged 4 - 12, restrained in the rear seat of a modern passenger vehicle. A professional driving instructor drove at 50 km/h making sharp turns in a repeatable fashion, resulting in inboard motion of the children. The children were exposed to two turns in each of two restraint systems. Shorter children were on a booster or highback booster cushion. The taller children were seated on a booster cushion or with only a lap and shoulder seat belt. Four film cameras were fixed in the vehicle monitoring the child. Vehicle data were also collected.

The main injury mechanism for rear seated restrained children, aged 3 - 13, who sustained head injuries rated AIS 2 +, {{has been found to}} be the contact of the head with the seat back or with other parts of car interior. Previous studies showed that pre-crash manoeuvres could influence the injury outcome. This thesis quantifies the static belt measurement and the kinematics of child volunteers exposed to steering manoeuvres when restrained on different types of booster cushion. A study was conducted on a test track with 18 children divided into two groups based on their stature. Each child was tested for the static belt measurement on three different booster cushions and performed two steering manoeuvres on each of two of these boosters. Cameras were used to monitor the child during the event. Different parameters were extracted from the videos in order to analyse the kinematics of the child. From the static belt measurement arose that tall children can achieve a better belt fit than short children, especially in terms of shoulder belt position and its “grabbing” effect.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} an electro-mechanical dual acting pulley {{continuously variable}} transmission (EMDAP CVT) system and presents a method of measuring belt-pulley clamping force indirectly using a DC motor current sensor. The EMDAP CVT mainly consists of two movable primary (input) and secondary (output) pulley sheaves connected by metal pushing V-belt. Two DC motor’s actuation systems adjust the CVT ratio. Additionally, the secondary actuation system controls belt-pulley clamping force by adjusting the flatness of the spring discs placed {{at the back of}} each secondary pulley sheave to keep the belt tight and prevent <b>belt</b> <b>slip.</b> Ideally, a force sensor is used to measure the belt-pulley clamping force however the use of force sensor inside transmission gearbox is not feasible due to high temperature and oily environment. A viable solution for indirectly measuring the clamping force using current sensor for DC motor is proposed. Since the DC motor actuates the movable pulleys to clamp the belt, the relationship between the DC motor current and belt-pulley clamping force can then be investigated experimentally. The results will give positive impact on precisely controlling belt-pulley clamping force of EMDAP CVT using current sensor which is relatively simpler and less expensive than force sensor...|$|E

40|$|Van Doorne’s {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) {{is the most popular}} CVT design for automotive transmission, but it is only applicable to low-power passenger cars because of its low torque capacity. To overcome this limitation of traditional single-belt CVT, a novel dual-belt Van Doorne’s CVT (DBVCVT) system, which is applicable to heavy-duty vehicles, has been previously proposed by the authors. This paper, based on the published analytical model and test rig of DBVCVT, further proposes an intelligent multiobjective fuzzy controller for slip and speed ratio control of DBVCVT. The controller aims to safely control the clamping forces of both the primary and the secondary pulleys in order to improve the transmission efficiency, achieve the accurate speed ratio, and avoid the <b>belt</b> <b>slip</b> under different engine loads and vehicle speeds. The slip, speed ratio, and transmission efficiency dynamics of DBVCVT are firstly analyzed and modeled in this paper. With the aid of a flexible objective function, the analytical model, and fuzzy logic, a Pareto rule base for fuzzy controller is developed for multiobjective DBVCVT control.

This paper focuses {{on the development of}} a transmission ratio controller for a hydraulically actuated metal push-belt continuously variable transmission (CVT), using models for the mechanical and the hydraulic part of the CVT. The controller consists of an anti-windup PID feedback part with linearizing weighting and a setpoint feedforward. Physical constraints on the system, especially with respect to the hydraulic pressures, are accounted for using a feedforward part to eliminate their undesired effects on the ratio. The total ratio controller guarantees that one clamping pressure setpoint is minimal, avoiding <b>belt</b> <b>slip,</b> while the other is raised above the minimum level to enable shifting. This approach has potential for improving the efficiency of the CVT, compared to non-model based ratio controllers. Vehicle experiments show that adequate tracking is obtained together with good robustness against actuator saturation.

When the FEAD undergoes forced vibration due to crankshaft excitation, dynamic tension fluctuations can cause the belt to slip on the accessory pulleys [2]. The probability of <b>belt</b> <b>slip</b> increases with the peak drop in belt tension over the pulley during steady state operation [3].

In this study, the rotational response of a typical FEAD is extended to include the clutch and isolator. An analytical solution is then obtained by considering it as a piecewise-linearized system moving about an equilibrium angular displacements. The performance of the ordinary FEAD with regard to tension fluctuation is then compared to that of the system equipped with a decoupler/isolator. The results obtained indicate that within the practical working range of engine speeds, use of either an isolator or a decoupler-isolator could significantly lower the dynamic tension drop across the accessory pulley...|$|E
