40|$|ABSTRACT: Design and {{development}} of civil aircraft for commuter role {{is a relatively new}} effort in our country. National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) are developing a short haul, twin turboprop commuter aircraft, named Saras. We are currently testing two prototypes (PT 1 and PT 2) of Saras in flight. This paper gives some details about the data acquisition and processing. Subsequently, some aspects of analyzed data are highlighted by using ‘classical ’ techniques wherein steady state aircraft maneuvers are used to generate data. Design expectations of various characteristics are mainly based on wind tunnel test results and were supplemented, wherever required, by panel method computations as well as engineering estimates. The results of flight data analyses are compared with design data. It can be inferred that flight data show reasonably good match with design data for elevator power, power-off drag polar whereas trim tab adequacy is not borne out in flight as per design data. The other two characteristics of engine torque resulting in zero thrust and that of rudder blowback are purely results of flight testing for which no results were available from design data.

40|$|No. 2606 * Surnrnary. [...] Oscillation of control-surface tabs has {{occurred}} in flight. General experience and the investigations of this report suggest that the oscillations were flutter, involving translation of the tab, arising from bending of the local control-surface structure, coupled with rotation of the tab about its hinge, arising from either backlash or elasticity of the tab controlling me&anism. Binary flutter calculations show that, for this coupling, the normal remedy, i. e. mass-balancing, is only partially effective (static mass-balancing roughly doubles the backlash flutter speed but may decrease the elastic flutter speed). If the tab controlling mechanism is adequately stiff, elimination of backlash gives higher flutter speeds than would be obtained by mass-balancing alone and in practice probably removes the danger of flutter. Flutter is completely prevented by aerodynamically balancing and dynamically mass-balancing (e. G. on hinge line) the tab. 1. I~troductio~. [...] 1. 1.

40|$|Building Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system {{maintain}} comfortable {{indoor environment}} by supplying processed air to each terminal precisely through duct system. Testing, Adjusting and <b>Balancing</b> (<b>TAB)</b> plays {{critical role in}} achieving desired air distribution. Traditional TAB method is inaccurate and inefficient due to its trail-and-error natural, which forces people to pay high but expect low. Recently, it has been proposed that non-iterative approach to TAB is promising to improve performance and reduce cost. In this paper, a novel non-iterative balancing method is developed and implemented for TAB engineers to adjust dampers systematically and efficiently. Different from other TAB methods, this method is based on modeling and optimization. The mathematical model for duct system is firstly developed from its components including fan, duct segments and dampers to predict flow rates and pressures in the duct system for any damper positions. To identify the parameters in the model, flow rate measurements are taken for each terminal on real system under different damper positions. With the obtained model, optimal damper positions that gives desired air distribution are calculated by minimizing a specific objective function. To facilitate the adjusting process in real duct system, a sequential tuning instructions are generated which can help engineers to adjust dampers to their proper position using flowmeter as indicators. In this sequential tuning process, each damper only adjusts once to reach balance. Because the pressure and airflow dynamics of the duct system has been modeled, the entire TAB procedure is deterministic and non-iterative. Simulations are performed to validate {{the effectiveness of this}} method in Matlab/Simulink environment. Comparison study with existing methods shows that the proposed TAB method significantly shorten the duration of process and reduces balancing error while using easily-accessible equipment like pressure sensor and flowmeter only. It can be expected that the TAB service contractor will apply this method for advanced duct system where accurate air distribution is strictly required...|$|R

The main objective of TRENDS was the calculation of environmental pressure indicators caused by transport. The environmental pressures considered are associated with air emissions from the four main transport modes, i. e. road, rail, ships and air. In order to determine these indicators a system for calculating a range of environmental pressures due to transport was developed within a PC-based MS Access environment. Emphasis is given on the latest features incorporated in the model and their applications. One of the recently developed features of the software provides an option for simple scenario analysis including vehicle dynamics (such as turnover and evolution) for all EU 15 member states. This feature is called the Transport Activity <b>Balance</b> module (<b>TAB)</b> and enables the production of collective results for all transport modes as well as a comparative assessment of air emissions produced by the various modes.

In addition, a detailed assessment of the results produced by TRENDS was conducted by means of comparison with data found in the literature.
