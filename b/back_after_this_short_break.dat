5000|$|After touring {{for their}} hit album, White fell ill. They {{released}} Extended Play EP in 1998, {{and in the}} song [...] "Props' Vote of Gratitude", Alex Gifford raps for the first time, explaining to the attentive listener that the band would [...] "be <b>back</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>short</b> break". Gifford moved to New York and produced the Jungle Brothers' 1999 album V.I.P. in which he raps with The Black Eyed Peas among others. White provided the drums for the eponymous track. He has also produced [...] "Shadows", a track for Rufus Wainwright on his 2001 album Poses. White has since released a mix compilation for the Beatz and Bobz series, and he has also appeared {{as a member of}} the De-Fex music project.|$|R
5000|$|I {{had this}} idea about making edits {{where all of}} the songs would clock in under 5 minutes each. My {{absolute}} first idea {{was to make a}} radio edit version of the album, where every song would simply be cut at precisely 3:50 or something, except for the track America, in which we instead would add like 10 minutes of commercials after the [...] "We'll be <b>back</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>short</b> break!" [...] phrase. But once I was sitting down with the tracks it became sort of a challenge. Some of the songs I prefer in the original version, but some (like Idiocracy and Mrs Modern Mother Mary for instance) really turned out more like I initially intended them to be, and I prefer them. Also, I could use my original idea for an intro to the album - it was scrapped for the official release since I felt it gave away the TPE1 link way too soon. The Slipsync track uses recurring themes, a trademark POS conceptual instrumental passage, and was originally thought as a Japanese bonus track, but then it felt more right on this edited album version, called SCARSICKER.|$|R
