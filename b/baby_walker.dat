25|$|The underdrawings of {{both the}} Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas show several {{features}} not in the finished works, but present in some copies; {{it is likely that}} these were originally copied from the prime versions during an early stage of the composition’s development. One such feature, which appears in both underdrawings, is a group of figures identified as St Joseph making a <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> for the Christ child, who appears with his mother and another female figure, probably a midwife. It has also been suggested that the child learning to walk is the infant John the Baptist, appearing with his mother St Elizabeth, as Leonardo would have been unlikely to depict the figures of Mary and Christ twice in the same painting. Leonardo also experimented with including some kind of beast of burden – a horse, ass or ox – which appears in different positions in the two underdrawings. Behind these an architectural structure with an arched opening was planned. At a later stage the landscape of the Buccleuch picture seems to have had a bridge like that of the Lansdowne Madonna, which was then painted over.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} fatal head injuries associated with <b>baby</b> <b>walkers.</b> Skull fractures and hospital admissions are significantly higher for infants who have received head injuries while using a walker. Thirty to 50 % of infants regularly placed in walkers experience an accident or injury related to the device. Most injuries are minor cuts, abrasions and contusions. While there are many hazards, no benefits have been documented. The walkers do not help children learn to walk. Options for preventing injury including banning <b>baby</b> <b>walkers,</b> product design regulations, and public education about the risks. An outright ban would be difficult, because walkers are not considered inherently dangerous; they become so when parental supervision is lacking. Although design specifications will decrease some walker-related injuries, they will not prevent severe or fatal head injuries associated with falls down stairs.

50|$|Baby {{furniture}} {{refers to}} furniture created for babies. It {{is often used}} to help the parents of the baby keep it safe and comfortable in the home. Before baby furniture, parents would sleep with their children in their own beds, which could be dangerous for the child. Eventually, infant beds started to be built with the child's safety in mind; the intention was to keep the baby from rolling off the bed, so mangers and bassinets were created. Over time, more furniture was created with the infant's safety in mind, and there are several types and functionalities of these. Typical pieces include an infant bed (such as a crib, bassinet, or cradle), changing table, high chair, playpen, <b>baby</b> <b>walker,</b> and toy chest. Products, features, and costs vary between countries and have changed over time. Safety is of paramount importance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} conditions {{related to}} <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> injuries in a Greek population. DESIGN: Analysis of all <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> related injuries recorded during a 12 month period by the childhood injury surveillance system established {{in one of}} the two teaching hospitals for children serving the population of Athens. SETTING: Emergency clinics of A Kyriakou Children's Hospital in Athens, Greece. SUBJECTS: 49 babies with <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> related injuries brought to the emergency clinics during the period May 1994 to April 1995. RESULTS: The incidence of these injuries was 16 per thousand person years of users, or 3. 5 per thousand babies per year. More boys than girls were brought to the hospital for these injuries and the incidence density was highest during the ninth and 10 th month of age. Falls from heights, particularly stairs, were the most frequent cause of <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> related injuries, especially among younger babies. The majority of these injuries were of minor severity, but three babies had bone fractures and one had a second degree facial burn. Six babies required hospitalization and for seven others, a follow up visit was needed. The higher proportion of hospitalization among girls than boys raises the possibility that boys with minor injuries are more frequently brought to the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Baby walkers impart a significant risk of injury from a consumer product that provides no clearly identifiable benefit. As most <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> injuries happen on stairs, modifications in product design are required to reduce these injuries. Moreover, parents should be forcefully advised of the risks and predisposing conditions, if baby walkers are to be used at all...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) is {{a primary}} source for children's {{consumer}} product injury surveillance data in the US. Differing interpretations of the emergency department based NEISS <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> data by various parties prompted this detailed examination, reclassification, {{and analysis of the}} NEISS data to explain these discrepancies. METHODS: Case selection was performed by searching the NEISS 1982 - 91 database for the <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> product code and various text strings for children less than 24 months old. False negative and false positive cases were identified and reclassified. Adjusted population rates were computed and the types and locations of hospitals contributing to the sample were examined. RESULTS: One per cent false positive and 4 % false negative misclassification rates were observed. In 1991, two children's hospitals reported 14 % of the <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> related injuries, though these hospitals made up just 2 % of the sample frame. Through random allocation, one state currently contains four acute care hospitals and the only two children's hospitals reporting to the NEISS system. These six hospitals contributed 18 % of the walker cases whereas the state represents only 3 % of the US infant population. CONCLUSIONS: Misclassification in NEISS <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> reports is minimal, with false negatives outweighing false positives. For trend analysis of product related injuries at the frequency of occurrence observed for baby walkers, NEISS suffers from low sensitivity due to sampling error. For children's injuries, NEISS' estimates have been affected by children's hospitals coming {{in and out of the}} sample and currently reflects a random geographic imbalance because one state contributes both of the reporting children's hospitals. To overcome these problems improved multiple product coding, a unique <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> code, and stratification of children's hospitals in an enlarged NEISS sample is recommended...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{understand}} {{the opinion of}} the parents about the <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> and compare the age of gait acquisition between infants that used a walker and those that did not. METHODS: In this quali-quantitative study, an interview involving a semi-structured questionnaire was carried out with 26 parents, 14 of whose infants used the equipment (BWG) and 12 of whose infants did not (NBWG) prior to gait acquisition. After extensive content analysis, categories for interpreting the results emerged. For data triangulation, the age of gait acquisition was documented by weekly telephone contact. Student's t-test was used for comparison between groups with a significance level of &# 945;= 0. 05. RESULTS: The following categories were identified in the parents' reports: a) information about the baby walker; b) doubt/decision to use it vs. certainty about not using it; c) beliefs about the use of a baby-walker; and d) benefits and harm from use. The age of independent gait acquisition did not differ between groups (p= 0. 837) : BWG initiated gait at 376. 17 (SD= 32. 62) days and NBWG did so at 378. 75 (SD= 27. 99) days. CONCLUSIONS: The beliefs and feelings that permeate the decision to use a <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> illustrate the different rationales adopted by parents about the role of this equipment in the child's development of gait and autonomy. The use of a <b>baby</b> <b>walker</b> did not influence the age of gait acquisition.
