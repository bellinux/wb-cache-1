5|$|Once Australia's wartime {{military}} forces had been demobilised, the part-time force was re-established {{in the guise}} of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), which was formed in 1948. Within this, an amalgamated 16th/28th Battalion was raised. This battalion existed until August 1952 when, following the reintroduction of national service, the 28th Battalion was re-raised in its own right, based in East Perth with sub-units at Albany, Katanning and Geraldton. Heart of Oak was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953, but it was replaced the following year by Colonel Bogey. In 1960, following the introduction of the Pentropic organisation and the suspension of national service, this battalion was subsumed into the newly formed Royal Western Australia Regiment, providing three company-sized elements to the regiment's 1st Battalion (1 RWAR). The Australian Army ceased using the Pentropic organisation in July 1965 and at this time 1 RWAR was split into two smaller battalions: 1 RWAR and 2 RWAR. In early 1966, these were renumbered 16 RWAR and 11 RWAR, with the companies that had originally come from the 28th Battalion being allocated to 16 RWAR. In October 1966, when national service was reintroduced, the 28th Battalion was re-formed as a full battalion known as 28 RWAR, and fulfilling the role of a remote area battalion, catering for the training needs of men eligible for call up who wished to exercise the option to serve in the CMF instead of the Regular Army, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not parade regularly due to where they lived or what civilian occupation they held. The national service scheme ended in December 1972, after which many who had joined the CMF to defer full-time national service took their discharge. Numbers fell significantly and in 1977 the 28th Battalion was reduced to an independent rifle company, along with the 11th Battalion. This continued until October 1987, when the two companies were amalgamated to form the current 11th/28th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment.|$|E

25|$|After the war, when Australia's {{military}} was reorganised the 43rd Battalion was reformed once again as an amalgamated unit {{known as the}} 43rd/48th Battalion, which remained in existence until 1960 when it was subsumed into the Royal South Australia Regiment (RSAR), following a reorganisation that saw the creation of six multi-battalion state-based regiments within the Citizen Military Forces. In 1961, the battalion was entrusted with the 14 battle honours awarded to the 2/43rd Battalion for their involvement in the fighting in North Africa and the South-West Pacific during the Second World War. Although it currently no longer exists, for a period after 1966, following the reintroduction of national service, the 43rd Battalion was re-raised within the RSAR, as a remote area battalion within the Citizens Military Force, offering special conditions of service for soldiers who had elected {{to serve in the}} CMF rather than the Regular Army, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence.|$|E
500|$|In the 1978 {{edition of}} their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that Harrison had [...] "desperately" [...] {{employed}} [...] "last-minute devices" [...] to save Extra Texture, by featuring [...] "'zany' ex-Bonzo Dog Band drummer 'Legs' Larry Smith on a track, and by instructing his graphic designers to 'get a little humour into the packaging'. They do; and 'Legs' duly sings; {{but it is}} all too little, too late." [...] Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden identified the song and the album art, {{as well as the}} single [...] "You", as evidence that Harrison was attempting to re-engage with his listeners. Woffinden welcomed this approach but, noting the lack of a lyric sheet with the album, he added: [...] " [...] is not a success, since most of the vocals are lost in the raucous mix; Larry might have had pearls of wisdom to impart, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> tell?" [...] More recently, Richard Ginell of AllMusic has described the song as a [...] "baffling salute" [...] to Smith, while former Mojo editor Mat Snow dismisses it as [...] "a throwaway among throwaways".|$|E

500|$|In December 1902, Dunlap died penniless {{and alone}} at age 43. According to the Sporting Life, the [...] "last {{two years of}} his life were spent in abject poverty and mental gloom" [...] in a Philadelphia {{boarding}} house. According to several accounts, a policeman at the morgue saw the body and believed it to be Dunlap. [...] Lave Cross was called to the morgue and confirmed that the body was Dunlap. [...] His funeral was poorly attended by his former baseball colleagues, and one former player who did attend observed, [...] "There were not enough friends of Dunlap at his funeral to bury him and we had to call on the hack drivers to make up the list of active pall-bearers." [...] Following Dunlap's death, William A. Phelon, Jr., editor of Sporting Life wrote:"So Fred Dunlap has passed into the great beyond, and the man whose salary figure marked the high-water limit of the long ago is gone! ... What a ball player this Dunlap was and what an artist in getting the fat salaries! ... Dunlap was a real infielder of the type so popular ten years ago -- [...] one of the solid, bulky style through whom no grounder seemed able to pass, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> nevertheless wave the hot ones goodbye with graceful ease when occasion demanded. [...] With the gloves now in use to aid, Dunny would have been even a bigger wonder now than then." ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, Australia's {{military}} was rapidly demobilised and then re-formed with the part-time element, the Citizens Military Force (CMF), being established in 1948. The force was recreated on a reduced scale, though, {{and there was}} no room on the order of battle initially for the 49th Battalion. In 1965, conscription was reintroduced {{in the form of the}} national service scheme, and this saw an influx of manpower into the CMF. The following year, the 49th Battalion was re-raised as a [...] "special conditions" [...] battalion within the Royal Queensland Regiment, catering for the training needs of men who were eligible for call up who elected to serve in the CMF rather than the Regular Army, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not parade regularly due to where they lived or what civilian occupation they held. The national service scheme ended in December 1972, after which many who had joined the CMF to defer national service took discharges. The immediate effect on the battalion was significant, with its personnel dropping from around 1,000 to approximately 200, but later it was able to rebuild its numbers to the extent that by 1982 it had a strength of 22 officers and 548 other ranks. In 1984–1985, the 49th Battalion was moved from the 7th Brigade, to the 6th, becoming that brigade's third infantry battalion. [...] In 1991, the 49th Battalion became a Ready Reserve battalion, offering Reservists an increased training opportunity over and above normal Reserve service; when the scheme ended in 1997 it was once again amalgamated with the 25th Battalion to become the 25th/49th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, and returned to the 7th Brigade.|$|E
500|$|Scream was {{a turning}} point in terms of casting for the horror genre, which {{normally}} involved relatively unknown actors. The genre was considered unsuitable for bigger names as the films had lower budgets and often attained negative critical response. Drew Barrymore read the script and was interested in being involved. She approached the production team herself to request a role. Barrymore, a member of the Barrymore family of actors and granddaughter of actor John Barrymore, had become a star in her own right following her appearance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest, and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott. [...] Her involvement was believed to be instrumental in attracting other popular actors to the film in spite of its smaller budget, and in causing Craven to reconsider his decision to direct the film. [...] Before filming began, Barrymore was faced with unexpected commitments that meant she would no longer be available to play the demanding lead role. She instead played the smaller role of Casey Becker, which allowed her to remain involved and still gave the production the advantage of her stature. Killing off one of their biggest stars early in the film was considered a calculated risk, but it was believed that it would be so shocking and unexpected that the audience would then believe that any character could die. Actresses including Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead role of Sidney; the producers also approached Reese Witherspoon, though she never auditioned. Craven had seen Neve Campbell in the TV show Party of Five and asked her to audition for the part. He believed she could portray a character who was [...] "innocent", <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> also realistically handle herself while dealing with the physical conflict and emotions required by the role. Campbell was initially reluctant to perform in another horror film so soon after her supporting role in The Craft. After a successful audition, Campbell accepted an offer to play the lead character. She accepted because Scream would be her first leading role, and because she adored the character, saying [...] "She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie." ...|$|E

Such an event, however, has occurred, and on the author of the work before us rests its responsibility. Prophetic of infidel times, and indicating the unsoundness of our general education, [...] "The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation," [...] has started into public favour with a fair chance of poisoning the fountains of science, and sapping the foundations of religion. Popular in its subject, as well as in its expositions, this volume has obtained a wide circulation among the influential classes of society. It has been read and applauded by those who can neither weigh its facts, nor appreciate its argument, nor detect its tendencies; while those who can - the philosopher, the naturalist, and the divine - have concurred in branding it with their severest censure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} between great, white and small, black (in shamans, tngri, etc.) was also formative {{in a class}} division of three further groups of spirits, made up of [...] "spirits who were not introduced by shamanist rites into the communion of ancestral spirits" [...] <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> nonetheless be called upon for help—they were called [...] "'the three accepting the supplications' (jalbaril-un gurban)". The whites were of the nobles of the clan, the blacks of the commoners, and a third category consisted of [...] "the evil spirits of the slaves and non-human goblins". White shamans could only venerate white spirits (and if they called upon black spirits they [...] "lost their right in venerating and calling the white spirits"), black shamans only black spirits (and would be too terrified to call upon white spirits since the black spirits would punish them). Black or white was assigned to spirits according to social status, and to shamans [...] "according to the capacity and assignment of their ancestral spirit or spirit of the shaman's descent line." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, {{following}} the reintroduction of national service, the 22nd Battalion was re-raised {{as part of}} the Royal Victoria Regiment, as a remote area battalion within the Citizens Military Force, offering special conditions of service for those eligible for call up who elected to serve in the CMF rather than the Regular Army, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence. The battalion also included a small detachment of Tasmanians, who had originally been recruited into the 50th Battalion, but who were reallocated when the decision to re-raise that unit was cancelled. With the abolition of national service in late 1972, 22 RVR lost the vast majority of its soldiers. To keep the battalion viable C Company of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (2 RVR), with depots in Shepparton and Echuca, was attached to 22 RVR. 22 RVR was closed on 30 June 1975 and C Company returned to 2 RVR, which subsequently became the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment in [...] 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Don D'Ammassa {{described}} Goodkind {{as part of}} a [...] "host {{of brand}} new writers [...] no previous experience writing fiction <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> turn out one large epic adventure after another", taking advantage of publishers' realization in the mid-1990s that traditional fantasy literature was a highly lucrative market. [...] D'Ammassa described the series as having an inconsistent background that was reinvented and expanded in each new book, [...] "regardless of how well it meshes with what he has previously established." [...] D'Ammassa stated that Goodkind possessed [...] "undeniable storytelling skills and a talent for inventing detailed and interesting societies", but described his characters as lacking depth, with a confusing morality that has [...] "heroes performing acts every bit as heinous as those of the villains, sometimes with no apparent justification", and he ascribed much of the popularity of the series to its [...] "perverse sexual undertones" [...] and sadomasochistic scenes described in [...] "excruciating detail". [...] D'Ammassa also stated that the [...] "rules" [...] found in the books are actually witticisms and concluded Goodkind's books to date were unlikely to produce anything of interest beyond their present popularity.|$|E

2500|$|Mozart himself, {{during his}} short stay in Dresden, {{was an almost}} daily visitor to the Körners' house. For the charming and witty Doris he was all aflame and with his south German vivacity he paid her the naïvest compliments. He {{generally}} came shortly before dinner and, after he had poured out a stream of gallant phrases, he sat down to improvise at the pianoforte. In the next room the table was meanwhile being set and the soup dished up, and the servant announced that dinner was served. <b>But</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> tear himself away when Mozart was improvising! The soup was allowed to grow cold and the roast to burn, simply {{so that we could}} continue to listen to the magic sound which the master, completely absorbed in what he was doing and unaware {{of the rest of the}} world, conjured from the instrument. Yet one finally grows tired even of the highest pleasures when the stomach makes known its demands. After the soup had grown cold a few times while Mozart played, he was briefly taken to task. [...] "Mozart", said Doris, gently laying her snow-white arm on his shoulder, [...] "Mozart, we are going in to dine; do you want to eat with us?" [...] But it was precisely Mozart who never did come; he played on undisturbed. Thus we often had the rarest Mozartian musical accompaniment to our meal, Doris concluded her narrative, and when we rose from table we found him still sitting at the keyboard.|$|E
