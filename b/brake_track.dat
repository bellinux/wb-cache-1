Echoing the product’s name, four hundred and four of the limited edition wheelsets were produced.

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{new kind}} of rail transit vehicle braking mode, this paper {{introduces}} its composition, structure, working principle and braking control methods, and analyzes its application. 1 Concept and classification of magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> The force which slowing down or stopping the train, keeping the train speed stability when downhill driving, making the train stopped in place even on the slopes is known as brake. The way using electromagnetic effect for braking, is known as the electromagnetic brake. According to the application of electromagnetic brake implementation on rail transit vehicle, there are two main types: electromagnetic rail brake and electromagnetic eddy current brake. Electromagnetic rail brake (also called magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake)</b> is a kind of contact friction braking, basing on the wheel/rail adhesion. The electromagnetic force sucks the magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> which mounted on bogie and rail. Through the device {{at the bottom of the}} magnetic rail wear, the sliding friction between the plate and rails, train the kinetic energy into heat energy and make it escape into the atmosphere, so as to realize the train slowing down or stop.

5000|$|In the cabs of light-rail cars the {{emergency}} brake {{is often a}} large red button, which the train crew {{refers to as the}} [...] "mushroom"; this also activates the magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brakes.</b> The mechanism of an emergency brake may differ, depending on railcar design. Emergency-braking a train (without <b>track</b> <b>brakes)</b> will give about 1.5 m/s2 (0.15 g) deceleration. The braking distance will be approximately 250 m at 100 km/h and 600 m at 160 km/h. High-speed trains are usually equipped with a magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake,</b> which can give about 0.3 m/s2 extra, and give braking distances like 850 m at 200 km/h and 1900 m at 300 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power of}} {{electromagnetic}} <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> comes from electromagnetic attraction between the <b>brake</b> and the <b>track.</b> They {{are intended to}} provide retardation beyond the adhesion limit of the wheels alone, which ultimately {{is limited by the}} weight of the vehicle. <b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are fitted on the bogies between each pair of wheels and in line with the running rails. In operation they are first dropped into position on the rails, using air actuators, and then current is applied to strong electromagnet coils within the shoes. This pulls the brake shoes hard against the track with a force that can exceed the vehicle's weight, and strong braking forces result.|$|R

50|$|The {{cable cars}} of San Francisco are fitted with {{mechanical}} <b>track</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{controlled by a}} large braking lever next to the grip lever. Pulling back on this lever forces replaceable pine wood blocks against the rails; as a result, a cable car descending a steep hill emits an odor of smoldering wood. These <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> are routinely used many times while traversing a cable car route.|$|R
50|$|<b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{a form of}} brakes {{unique to}} railborne vehicles. The braking force derives from the {{friction}} resulting from the application of wood or metal braking shoes directly to the tracks (as the name suggests). Early examples of <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> used on the horse hauled mineral tramways that preceded the steam locomotive were described as sledge brakes, and are usually associated with lines that used gravity propulsion.|$|R
50|$|Cable cars {{remained}} {{especially effective}} in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not lose traction as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car {{up the hill}} at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel <b>brakes</b> and <b>track</b> <b>brakes,</b> but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco. However, the extensive cable car system of Chicago operated over a large relatively flat area.|$|R

50|$|The {{total amount}} of weight {{transfer}} is only affected by four factors: the distance between wheel centers (wheelbase {{in the case of}} <b>braking,</b> or <b>track</b> width in the case of cornering) the height of the center of gravity, the mass of the vehicle, and the amount of acceleration experienced.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the risk}} of damage to the {{trackwork}} at points, etc., <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> are typically recommended for use only in emergency situations, adding their force to the main brakes (electric brakes and disc brakes), especially vital if a tram or train loses control and sanding is ineffective, or the disc brakes have failed. In practice, some rail systems (such as the MBTA Green Line in Boston, Massachusetts) use them much more frequently, to compensate for rails made slippery by weather conditions, or as a roll-back prevention measure on hills. <b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually operated by a driver’s emergency stop button mounted separately to the normal traction/brake controller, or by the release of the “dead man’s handle”. Systems which use them frequently may have a separate switch to actuate the <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> without activating other emergency stopping measures.|$|R

40|$|Based on the authors' {{research}} efforts over the years, an in situ structural health monitoring (SHM) technique {{taking advantage of}} guided elastic waves has been developed and deployed via an online diagnosis system. The technique and the system were recently implemented on China's latest high-speed train (CRH 380 CL) operated on Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway. The system incorporated modularized components including active sensor network, active wave generation, multi-channel data acquisition, signal processing, data fusion, and results presentation. The sensor network, inspired by a new concept - "decentralized standard sensing", was integrated into the bogie frames during the final assembly of CRH 380 CL, to generate and acquire bogie-guided ultrasonic waves, from which {{a wide array of}} signal features were extracted. Fusion of signal features through a diagnostic imaging algorithm led to a graphic illustration of the overall health state of the bogie in a real-time and intuitive manner. The in situ experimentation covered a variety of high-speed train operation events including startup, acceleration/deceleration, full-speed operation (300 km/h), emergency <b>braking,</b> <b>track</b> change, as well as full stop. Mock-up damage affixed to the bogie was identified quantitatively and visualized in images. This in situ testing has demonstrated the feasibility, effectiveness, sensitivity, and reliability of the developed SHM technique and the system towards real-world applications.
