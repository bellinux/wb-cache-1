Of the 50 stream channel profiles and roughness coefficients compiled by Barnes (1967), {{it was determined that}} upper Marx Creek was most comparable to Catherine Creek in Union, Oregon. Upper Marx Creek was determined to be comparable to Catherine Creek because the streambeds of both streams are comprised of cobbles and small boulders, and both streams have small trees and <b>brush</b> <b>lining</b> their banks. The streambed roughness coefficient value of Catherine Creek was 0.043, so the same value was input to the Marx Creek model’s stream segments.|$|R
