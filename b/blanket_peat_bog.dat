Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level.

The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power. The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E
40|$|The far {{north-east}} of Scotland {{encompasses a}} wide range of landscapes, from the rolling hills of Moray and the coastal flagstone cliffs of Caithness, to the <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> of the Flow Country and the ancient rugged mountains of eastern Sutherland. These landscapes have all formed during a long and complex geological history, from rocks that were buckled and warped by continental collisions that occurred many hundreds of millions of years ago, to the sculpting of the hills and valleys by glaciers just a few thousand years ago. Since Neolithic times, the inhabitants of the region have made use of its geological resources and also changed its appearance irrevocably. This book describes the whole of that geological and human history, laying bare the events that have shaped the landscape of this remote but intriguing corner of Scotland. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of atmospheric lead deposition and its possible sources were assessed in eastern Canada and in western Scotland, using <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> as geochemical archives. Short cores {{were taken from}} two remote sites located close to the sea. Significant lead enrichments in the upper layers at both sites reflect the increasing emission of lead into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities during the last century. At the Scottish site, a region under aeolian influence from Europe, anthropogenic derived lead could be recognized by the distinctive unradiogenic composition (206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios down to approximately 1. 115), being clearly different from the pre-industrial values (206 Pb/ 207 Pb approximately 1. 166). In contrast, the lead pollution in eastern Canada (influenced by North American sources) is identified by a more radiogenic lead isotope composition (206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios up to approximately 1. 199) compared to preindustrial values (206 Pb/ 207 Pb approximately 1. 161). Emission inventories and isotope characteristics suggest that industrial (coal burning, mining) and traffic (leaded gasoline) outputs {{are the most likely}} sources during the first and {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, respectively, in both, western Scotland and eastern Canada alike. The Scottish record is in line with previous studies of past atmospheric lead deposition.

40|$|The British Geological Survey is {{undertaking}} {{a holistic}} investigation of an upland catchment near Talla Linnfoots Reservoir in the Southern Uplands. The main {{aim of the}} study is to develop an integrated earth model of the site to aid the understanding of landscape evolution and environmental change in response to climate change over the past 12. 000 years. To do this we are building an attributed 3 D geological model of the site. One advantage of a 3 D geological model over a conventional paper based or 2 D GIS approach is the ability to generate volumetric data, for example the total thickness of peat deposits. This type of data could be useful when making landslide hazard assessments of large <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> prior to electricity generation developments, as recognised in the recent Best Practice Guide produced by the Scottish Executive in 20061. To build the 3 D geological model of the site we used traditional site investigation data, including geological and soil surveying. Initial auguring proved a variable thickness of peat over the site. Trial pits, boreholes and light-weight penetrometer techniques did not provide sufficient data density for the resolution required. Shallow geophysical techniques were applied to provide information between borings. Terrestrial LiDAR techniques were used to create a high resolution (1 m cell size) Digital Terrain Model (DTM) to provide the ground surface layer to the 3 D geological model. Ground investigation data was assembled in the GSI 3 D software package enabling the visualisation of all observations and measurements in their true 3 D spatial positions. We used a combination of shallow geophysical techniques, including Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). One great advantage of these techniques is that they provided a continuous linear dataset, which could be imported into the modelling software. Borehole and penetrometer control was used to validate and interpret the geophysical model. This study showed that the application of geophysical techniques to assessment of peatland stratigraphy enables rapid and accurate data collection with minimal environmental impact. Future work at Talla site will involve constraining the lithostratigraphic model using absolute dating techniques including C 14 and cosmogenic methods. This will provide insight into the timing of de-glaciation and the onset of peat growth since the Late Glacial in the Scottish Lowlands...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of methanogenic bacteria was assessed in peat and soil cores taken from upland moors. The sampling area was largely covered by <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> together with small areas of red-brown limestone and peaty gley. A 30 -cm-deep core of each soil type was taken, and DNA was extracted from 5 -cm transverse sections. Purified DNA {{was subjected to}} PCR amplification with primers IAf and 1100 Ar, which specifically amplify 1. 1 kb of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene, and ME 1 and ME 2, which were designed to amplify a 0. 75 -kb region of the alpha-subunit gene for methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR). Amplification with both primer pairs was obtained only with DNA extracted from the two deepest sections of the <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> core. This {{is consistent with the}} notion that anaerobiosis is required for activity and survival of the methanogen population. PCR products from both amplifications were cloned, and the resulting transformants were screened with specific oligonucleotide probes internal to the MCR or archaeal 16 S rRNA PCR product. Plasmid DNA was extracted from probe-positive clones of both types and the insert was sequenced. The DNA sequences of 8 MCR clones were identical, as were those of 16 of the 17 16 S rRNA clones. One clone showed marked variation from the remainder in specific regions of the sequence. From a comparison of these two different 16 S rRNA sequences, an oligonucleotide was synthesized that was 100 % homologous to a sequence region of the first 16 clones but had six mismatches with the variant. This probe was used to screen primary populations of PCR clones, and all of those that were probe negative were checked for the {{presence of}} inserts, which were then sequenced. By using this strategy, further novel methanogen 16 S rRNA variants were identified and analyzed.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of slope failures on blanket bogs, but their nature and controls are poorly understood. This study investigates {{the mechanisms of}} blanket bog failure on Cuilcagh Mountain, north-west Ireland, and identifies the critical factors affecting the stability of peatland hillslopes. This is achieved by means of extensive field investigations involving hydrological monitoring, soil sampling and comprehensive laboratory analyses to determine the physical, hydrological and geotechnical properties of the <b>blanket</b> <b>peat.</b> The results from these investigations {{form the basis of}} hillslope hydrology and slope stability modelling using finite-element modelling programmes (commercial SEEP/W and SLOPE/W software). A total of 47 failures scars were identified on Cuilcagh Mountain involving an estimated 300, 000 m 3 of peat. Detailed field investigations revealed two main types of peatland slope failure: shallow translational peat slides associated with the failure of clay underlying the <b>blanket</b> <b>peat,</b> and <b>bog</b> flows in which failure occurs as a slurrytype plastic flow with the failure zone located within the peat. Peat slides were more prevalent on the steeper slopes (7. 0 - 17. 00) of Cuilcagh, whereas bog flows were found exclusively on low gradient slopes (1. 5 - 7. 50) with deep accumulations of peat (typically up to 2. 5 m). Previously it had been suggested that bog failures were confined to steep slopes or peripheral areas of blanket bogs. However, on Cuilcagh Mountain they appear to {{be an integral part of}} the natural evolution of the main peatland, with the presence of many failure scars at different stages ofre-vegetation and recovery. Conventional methods of slope stability analysis (Factor of Safety using limit equilibrium methods) were found to be adequate for use on peat slide failures, but were not as suitable for analysing the slopes prone to bog flows. Sensitivity analyses indicate that cohesion of the failure material (Le. the catotelm <b>peat</b> for <b>bog</b> flows and the underlying clay for peat slides) is the most critical factor contributing to slope failure. A reduction in cohesion is thought to be related to decomposition andlor progressive failure of the peat, or weathering and creep of the underlying clay. Increased overburden pressure from continuing peat accumulation is also an important factor in reducing the overall stability of a peatland slope. The initiation of <b>bog</b> flows and <b>peat</b> slides can occur from the progressive failure of the material in question, but there is more evidence to suggest that both types of failure are more frequently initiated as a result of a specific trigger event usually associated with high intensity rainfall...|$|R

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) is {{undertaking}} {{a holistic}} multi-disciplinary {{study of a}} small upland catchment near Talla Linnfoots in the Southern Uplands, Scotland. The site, which covers about 3. 5 km 2, {{is located on the}} interfluve between two major public water supply reservoirs northeast of Moffat. One of the aims is to develop an integrated 3 -dimensional (3 D) earth model of the site, which will lead to understanding landscape evolution within the catchment, in response to environmental changes during the past 12. 000 years. Geologically, the Talla catchment is dominated by glacial and periglacial deposits overlying resistant Ordovician greywacke bedrock. The valley fill comprises undulating moraines and <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bogs,</b> as well as narrow spreads of alluvium along Talla Water and its headwater tributaries. The lower valley sides are covered with thin colluvium mantling glacial till deposits; steeper rock slopes are mantled in scree. The study consisted of three phases. The first comprised geological, geomorphological and soil surveys. These were followed by multidisciplinary site investigation of the shallow subsurface using several geophysical, geotechnical and intrusive techniques. This was followed by interpretation of the results and development of an attributed 3 D geological model. Characterising the ground was achieved using traditional site investigation methods such as geological and soil surveying, trial pitting and borehole drilling, as well as light-weight penetrometer traverses. This was combined with an array of shallow geophysical techniques, including Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). These were applied on traverses between boreholes and pits, to gain additional continuous information on lateral extent and thickness of the geology to rockhead and provided a rapid, accurate representation of the shallow subsurface structure, where intrusive data was sparse. The catchment 3 D geological model was constructed using “Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3 D” (GSI 3 DTM) software. This utilizes a high resolution (1 m cell size) Digital Terrain Model (DTM), created by terrestrial LiDAR survey, linked with mapped geology, borehole, auger hole and geophysical data, to form slices and sections. This approach enabled the geoscientists to construct regularly spaced intersecting cross-sections by correlating boreholes and the outcrops-subcrops of geological units to produce fence diagrams of the area. These can then be variably attributed eg by sediment type, chemical composition, geotechnical properties and permeability etc. Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along the sections and the limits of the units produces a solid model comprising a series of stacked triangulated volume objects. Geophysical sections were used as an additional data source, which enabled the interpretation of measurements in their true 3 D positions and improved the accuracy of the model along these traverses. On-going studies at Talla include monitoring of shallow groundwater heads and water chemistry in instrumented shallow boreholes. The eventual aim is to establish a linked model of shallow-groundwater movement and surface drainage through time. Adoption of this type of novel 3 D geospatial modelling approach allows geoscientists to visualise, explore and interrogate the landscape evolution of small catchments, such as Talla in three dimensions. It can form an unrivalled template for catchment monitoring. ...|$|R

The resulting 550 -bp PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences corresponding to these mxaF genes revealed strong sequence conservation. Of the 172 amino acid residues, 47 % were conserved among all 22 sequences obtained in this study. Phylogenetic analysis of these MxaF sequences showed that those from type I and type II methanotrophs form two distinct clusters and are separate from MxaF sequences of other gram-negative methylotrophs. MxaF sequences retrieved by PCR from DNA isolated from a <b>blanket</b> <b>bog</b> <b>peat</b> core sample formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster within the MxaF sequences of type II methanotrophs and may originate from a novel group of acidophilic methanotrophs which have yet to be cultured from this environment...|$|R
5000|$|Scotland {{is roughly}} {{half the size of}} England and Wales and has {{approximately}} the same amount of coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing, the key factors in the pre-modern economy. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700 cm per year in the east and over 1,000 cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog,</b> the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made agriculture and internal communication difficult. The relative importance of climate and human interference has been debated, but Scotland was certainly much more heavily forested before humans arrived, around 5000 BP; for example, the Outer Hebrides were wooded [...] "down to the western shoreline", implying that climate alone does not explain Scotland's low tree cover.|$|E
50|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size of England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, today about 700 cm per year in the east and more than 1,000 cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog,</b> the acidity of which, combined with high levels of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power. The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E
40|$|The {{particulate}} methane monooxygenase gene pmoA, encoding the 27 kDa polypeptide of the membrane-bound particulate methane monooxygenase, was {{amplified by}} PCR from DNA isolated from a <b>blanket</b> <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> and from enrichment cultures established, {{from the same}} environment, using methane as sole carbon and energy source. The resulting 525 bp PCR products were cloned and a representative number of clones were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the derived amino acid sequences of the pmoA clones retrieved directly from environmental DNA samples revealed that they form a distinct cluster within representative PmoA sequences from type II methanotrophs and may originate from a novel group of acidophilic methanotrophs. The study also demonstrated {{the utility of the}} pmoA gene as a phylogenetic marker for identifying methanotroph-specific DNA sequences in the environment...|$|E
40|$|In {{central and}} {{northern}} Meshera the habitats for many characteristic <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> species now show a very fragmented pattern. As a result, {{the potential for}} viable populations of characteristic <b>peat</b> <b>bog</b> species has decreased considerably. Peat-mining and other human influences {{are the most important}} reasons. To maintain and increase the potential for viable populations of characteristic species, protection and restoration of especially high <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> are the most important strategies. To this end, a local environmental action programme (leap) has been developed for <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> in Egorievsk subregion. All local stakeholders, such as administration, forestry, peat-mining company and NGOs, support the LEAP. At the short term, protection of <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> seems tobe the most realistic strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{observations}} on the macrofungi were performed in phytocenoses with Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karsten from „Tinovul Găina-Lucina” and „Tinovul de lângă drum” <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> of the Natura 2000 site „Găina Lucina”, situated in Obcina Mestecănişului Mountains (Eastern Carpathians). In the two investigated <b>peat</b> <b>bogs,</b> 41 macromycetes species of phylum Basidiomycota were found. Some of these are characteristic for forested <b>peat</b> <b>bogs,</b> such as: Arrhenia onisca, Arrhenia sphagnicola, Cortinarius tubarius, Galerina paludosa, Galerina sphagnorum, Galerina tibiicystis, Hypholoma elongatum, Lactarius helvus, Russula emetica and Russula paludosa.

40|$|<b>Peat</b> <b>bogs</b> and {{specially}} raised bogs {{are vulnerable}} ecosystems {{all over the}} world and they create refuges for some rare plant species. The aim of this paper is to provide information regarding the conservation status of five oligotrophic <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> situated in the volcanic mountains in the Oriental Chain of Carpathians, in Maramureș County. The studied <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> are: Tăul lui Dumitru (Dumitru Pond), Mlaștina Vlășinescu (Vlășinescu <b>Peat</b> <b>bog),</b> Iezeru Mare (Big Tarn), Tăul Chendroaiei (Chendroaiei Pond) and Tăul Negru (Black Pond), all of them have the status of nature reserve and under the IUCN categories they are included in category IV Habitat/Species Management Area (www. iucn. org, 2016). The analysis of the selected <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> reveals that all five of them have the vegetation included in the Natura 2000 priority habitat 7110 * Active raised bogs. The conservation status of these <b>peat</b> <b>bogs</b> was evaluated and it is variable from moderate to very good conservation status...|$|R
