5|$|Sociologists {{increasingly}} {{draw upon}} computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena. Using computer simulations, artificial intelligence, text mining, complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like {{social network analysis}} and social sequence analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through <b>bottom-up</b> modelling of social interactions.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Khan {{moved to}} Karachi and {{started working on}} the {{improvement}} of sanitary conditions in Karachi suburbs. He laid {{the foundations of the}} Orangi Pilot Project for the largest squatter community of Orangi in the city. He remained associated with this project until his death in 1999. Meanwhile, he maintained his support for rural communities around Karachi, and also helped to develop the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme. OPP became a model for participatory <b>bottom-up</b> development initiatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern that}} the line-ending words follow is often {{explained}} if the numbers 1 to 6 {{are allowed to}} stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a <b>bottom-up</b> pairing of {{the lines of the}} preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third). Given that the pattern for the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a <b>bottom-up</b> approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a <b>bottom-up</b> approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E
25|$|From a <b>bottom-up</b> perspective, {{happiness}} {{represents an}} accumulation of happy experiences. <b>Bottom-up</b> influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. <b>Bottom-up</b> approaches {{are based on the}} idea that there are universal basic human needs and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.|$|E
25|$|It is {{theorized that}} the {{collective}} intelligence factor c is an emergent property resulting from <b>bottom-up</b> {{as well as}} top-down processes. Hereby, <b>bottom-up</b> processes cover aggregated group-member characteristics. Top-down processes cover group structures and norms that influence a group's way of collaborating and coordinating.|$|E
25|$|Theories of {{the causes}} of SWB tend to emphasise either {{top-down}} or <b>bottom-up</b> influences.|$|E
25|$|Many ecologists {{argue that}} <b>bottom-up</b> and {{top-down}} control do not play equally critical {{roles in the}} structure and dynamics of populations in an ecosystem; however, data suggests that both <b>bottom-up</b> and top-down forces impact the structure of food webs and the spatial and temporal abundance and distribution of organisms (Bertness 2007), although to what extent each plays a role is not fully understood.|$|E
25|$|Fabrication of nano-channels is {{categorized}} into top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> methods. Top-down {{methods are}} the conventional processes utilized in the IC industry and Microelectromechanical systems research. It begins with photolithography on a bulk silicon wafer. <b>Bottom-up</b> methods, in contrast, starts with atoms or molecules with intrinsic nano-scaled dimension. By organize and combine these building blocks together, it {{is able to}} form a nanostructures as small as only a few nanometers.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} method {{utilized}} for <b>bottom-up</b> fabrication is self-assembled monolayers (SAM). This method usually use biological materials {{to form a}} molecular monolayer on the substrate. Nano-channels can also be fabricated from the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and quantum wires. The <b>bottom-up</b> methods usually give well-defined shapes with characteristic length about few nanometers. For these structures to be utilized as nanofluidic devices, the interconnection between nano-channels and microfluidic systems becomes an important issue.|$|E
25|$|AAHM connects {{top-down}} and <b>bottom-up</b> anti-hunger development initiatives, linking governments, UN organizations, and NGOs {{together in}} order to increase effectiveness through unity.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} of the <b>bottom-up</b> review influenced {{the development of the}} FY 1994 Defense budget, although detailed work on the budget had begun as soon as Aspin took office. In March 1993 Aspin introduced a FY 1994 budget proposal costing $263.4 billion, about $12 billion below current levels, and reflecting cuts in the military services similar to those later included in the <b>bottom-up</b> review. To some critics of high military spending, Aspin's budget plan differed little from that of the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|Although Israel {{does not}} have an ‘umbrella type’ policy for science, {{technology}} and innovation optimizing priorities and allocating resources, it does implement, de facto, an undeclared set of best practices combining <b>bottom-up</b> and top-down processes via government offices, such as those of the Chief Scientist or the Minister of Science, Technology and Space, as well as ad hoc organizations like the Telem forum. The procedure for selecting research projects for the Israeli centres of research excellence is one example of this <b>bottom-up</b> process.|$|E
25|$|Evolution, on {{the other}} hand, takes a <b>bottom-up</b> approach; it {{explains}} how more complexity can arise gradually by building on or combining lesser complexity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bottom-up</b> approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a <b>bottom-up</b> fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{approach}} to proving Courcelle's theorem involves {{the construction of}} a finite <b>bottom-up</b> tree automaton that acts on the tree decompositions of the given graph.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bottom-up</b> {{heapsort}} {{was announced}} as beating quicksort (with median-of-three pivot selection) on arrays of size ≥16000. This version of heapsort keeps the linear-time heap-building phase, but changes the second phase, as follows.|$|E
25|$|The usage-based {{model is}} based on {{inductive}} learning, meaning that linguistic knowledge is acquired in a <b>bottom-up</b> manner through use. It allows for redundancy and generalizations, because the language user generalizes over recurring experiences of use.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{sense and}} {{representation}} was reviewed in 1998 by Francis Crick and Christof Koch. They concluded sensory neuroscience {{can be used}} as a <b>bottom-up</b> approach to studying consciousness, and suggested experiments to test various hypotheses in this research stream.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} {{topics of}} each centre are selected through a broad <b>bottom-up</b> process consisting of consultations with the Israeli academic community, {{in order to}} ensure that they reflect the genuine priorities and scientific interests of Israeli researchers.|$|E
25|$|This brings FCC {{into line}} with Ḗmile Durkheim, who argued that the {{earliest}} divine beings were ritually generated representations of society. Durkheim's 'society', according to FCC, {{was in the first}} instance the <b>bottom-up</b> authority of Female Cosmetic Coalitions.|$|E
25|$|Cographs may be {{recognized}} in linear time, and a cotree representation constructed, using modular decomposition, partition refinement, LexBFS , or split decomposition. Once a cotree representation has been constructed, many familiar graph problems may be solved via simple <b>bottom-up</b> calculations on the cotrees.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bottom-up</b> {{processes}} include group composition, {{namely the}} characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level encompassing. An example of such <b>bottom-up</b> processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members. Furthermore, collective intelligence {{was found to be}} related to a group's cognitive diversity including thinking styles and perspectives. Groups that are moderately diverse in cognitive style have higher collective intelligence than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.|$|E
25|$|Targeted {{proteomics}} using SRM and Data-independent acquisition {{methods are}} often considered alternatives to shotgun proteomics {{in the field}} of <b>bottom-up</b> proteomics. While shotgun proteomics uses data-dependent selection of precursor ions to generate fragment ion scans, the aforementioned methods use a deterministic method for acquisition of fragment ion scans.|$|E
25|$|China in a 2006 report {{outlined}} {{policies for}} improving innovation. They include 20 large megaprojects {{in areas such}} as nanotechnology, high-end generic microchips, aircraft, biotechnology, and new drugs. This is combined with a more <b>bottom-up</b> approach on a Silicon Valley model consisting of small start-ups, venture capital, and cooperation between industry and universities.|$|E
25|$|The {{system will}} likely {{be an example of}} {{event-driven}} architecture, <b>bottom-up</b> made (based on the context of processes and operations, in real-time) and will consider any subsidiary level. Therefore, model driven and functional approaches will coexist with new ones able to treat exceptions and unusual evolution of processes (multi-agent systems, B-ADSc, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In contrast, <b>bottom-up</b> {{techniques}} build or {{grow larger}} structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly. Dual polarisation interferometry is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another {{variation of the}} <b>bottom-up</b> approach is molecular beam epitaxy or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key {{to the discovery of}} the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>bottom-up</b> approach, we {{calculate}} the smaller values of fib first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(n) time since {{it contains a}} loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, {{in contrast to the}} top-down approach which requires O(n) space to store the map.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{failure to}} reevaluate the current {{paradigm}} {{and recognize that}} both <b>bottom-up</b> and top-down forces affect many features of ecosystem structure and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they even begin.|$|E
25|$|The Unión de Trabajadores por Cuenta Propia (UTCP, Union of Self-Employed Workers) {{is not an}} {{organism}} of UGT. It is a <b>bottom-up</b> association, formed by the farmers' union UPA and the professional and autonomous workers' union, UPTA, who united in this manner to enhance their representation inside the Union and to form a united front on factional issues where they have common interests.|$|E
25|$|Wales {{went on to}} {{establish}} self-governance and <b>bottom-up</b> self-direction by editors on Wikipedia.

25|$|Academic {{explanations}} of ethnic conflict generally fall {{into one of}} three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist or constructivist. Recently, several political scientists have argued for either top-down or <b>bottom-up</b> explanations for ethnic conflict. Intellectual debate has also focused on whether ethnic conflict has become more prevalent {{since the end of the}} Cold War, and on devising ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation.|$|E
25|$|Trophic cascades are {{powerful}} interactions that strongly regulate biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem function. Trophic cascades were originally {{thought to be}} rare, but {{it has become clear}} that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales. Trophic cascades are common and pervasive aspects of many communities long thought to be controlled by <b>bottom-up</b> forces and/or resistant to consumer control.|$|E
25|$|While these {{previous}} studies {{focused on how}} emotion affects memory for emotionally arousing stimuli, in their arousal-biased competition theory, Mather and Sutherland (2011) argue that how arousal influences memory for non-emotional stimuli depends on the priority of those stimuli {{at the time of}} the arousal. Arousal enhances perception and memory of high priority stimuli but impairs perception and memory of low priority stimuli. Priority can be determined by <b>bottom-up</b> salience or by top-down goals.|$|E
25|$|American {{efforts to}} promote {{democracy}} {{in the region are}} generally characterized by top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> democratization strategies, which can be pursued simultaneously. The former top-down approach involves putting rhetorical and diplomatic pressure on regimes to reform and can {{go so far as to}} involve direct American military engagement installing democratic government (as is the case in Iraq following the 2003 invasion). The U.S. government generally pursues the latter <b>bottom-up</b> approach by funding international organizations that help strengthen the bases for gradual democratic transition (the rule of law, accountable government institutions and expanded political competition) in the MENA region by offering technical assistance and training to political parties and electoral management bodies, engaging with civil society, producing assessments and polls, and promoting female political participation. Some have criticized American democracy promotion in MENA for ineffectiveness, a lack of consistency, taking a one-size-fits-all approach and using democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Moreover, It's said that US democracy promotion had been accompanied by heavy costs for US and considerable damage to the target countries.|$|E
