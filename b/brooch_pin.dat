She {{has appeared in}} Mauvaise passe; Our Mutual Friend; Surviving Picasso; Cracker (UK TV series); The <b>Brooch</b> <b>Pin</b> and Sinful Clasp; and The Witches.|$|E
50|$|In 1990 her {{animated}} film The <b>Brooch</b> <b>Pin</b> and the Sinful Clasp using stop frame animation won the following awards, Grand Prize at Zagreb World Festival of Animated Film, The Direction Award for best first {{animated film}} at British Animation Awards and The Time Out Film Award. It {{was also a}} part of Between Imagination And Reality a programme of film and video selected by Tilda Swinton.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1963 film, Jason and the Argonauts, Hylas (played by Scottish actor John Cairney) is {{depicted}} as an intelligent and witty character who serves a role as the [...] "sidekick" [...] of Hercules. In the film he is not abducted by water nymphs, but instead crushed under {{the body of the}} stricken Talos when he foolishly tried to retrieve a goddess' gold <b>brooch</b> <b>pin</b> dropped by Hercules. Hercules then leaves the Argonauts afterwards to search for his friend in vain.|$|E
40|$|The text {{presents}} accessories as <b>brooches,</b> <b>pins</b> and buckles, {{which were}} {{used on the}} Migration Period womans dress from Rogaland county in Norway. Central questions concern types in use and how and where on the dress they were fastened. The text is mainly an overview of previous publications by different authors, but contains further discussions on some topics...|$|R

50|$|Articles of {{personal}} use; for example, <b>brooches</b> (fibulae), <b>pins,</b> razors, tweezers, etc., often found as dedications to a deity, for example, in the Dictaean Cavern of Crete. No textiles have survived other than impressions in clay.|$|R
50|$|The obverse of {{the medal}} was {{designed}} by Charles E. Barber. It depicts a bust of Admiral Sampson. The reverse {{was designed by}} George T. Morgan. It depicts a Navy officer, Sailor, and Marine standing upon a block identifying the action for which the medal was awarded. Suspending the ribbon of the medal is a <b>brooch</b> <b>pin</b> {{with the name of}} the recipient's ship. The recipient's name is engraved on the lower rim of the medal, this being one of only two medals officially issued named to a recipient.|$|E
50|$|A {{new set of}} {{brooches}} particularly {{display a}} bolder stroke — making, mixing an urban visual zap with Bosshard's habitual coolness. The key piece here is an experiment with free form and a larger scale: a lineal strip of silver is bent into a striking electric signature. The usual conventions of jewellery (solidity, the concealment of clasps and pins, {{the focus on the}} materials) are inverted: space becomes the dominant feature, and the lines which define themselves in that space. Thus the <b>brooch</b> <b>pin</b> is liberated from its usual role as practical appendage and becomes simply another line in space; {{an integral part of the}} design.|$|E
50|$|Hera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns {{him to take}} {{nothing but}} provisions. However, Hercules steals a <b>brooch</b> <b>pin</b> {{the size of a}} javelin from a {{treasure}} building, surmounted by a giant statue of Talos, which comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos' heel, to release the giant's ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas, hiding his body. Hercules refuses to leave until he ascertains the fate of his friend. The other Argonauts refuse to abandon Hercules, so Jason calls upon Hera again. She informs them that Hylas is dead and that Hercules will not continue on with them.|$|E
40|$|Known for her poetry, {{including}} her classic "Paddle Your Own Canoe," Sarah Bolton began writing {{at a young}} age and contributed poems to newspapers and to the Home Journal. She was poet laureate of Indiana during the 1840 s and 1850 s, and published some songs. Bolton worked on behalf of women's rights in the Hoosier State during the mid-nineteenth century, especially the right to own property. She and her husband lived in Geneva, Switzerland, while he was consul there during President Franklin Pierce's administration. Bolton is wearing a dark dress and has a lace shawl. She has a <b>brooch</b> <b>pinned</b> to her white lace collar...|$|R

2500|$|Fibula is Latin for [...] "brooch" [...] {{and is used}} {{in modern}} {{languages}} to describe the many types of Roman and post-Roman Early Medieval <b>brooches</b> with <b>pins</b> and catches behind the main face of the brooch. The brooches discussed here are sometimes also called fibulae, but rarely by English-speaking specialists.|$|R
50|$|Medals {{that are}} {{intended}} to be hung from a ribbon also include a small suspension piece at the crest with which to loop a suspension ring through. It is through the ring that a ribbon is run or folded so the medal may hang pendent. Medals pinned to the breast use only a small cut of ribbon that {{is attached to a}} top bar where the <b>brooch</b> <b>pin</b> is affixed. Top bars may be hidden under the ribbon so they are not visible, be a plain device from which the ribbon attaches, or may even be decorative to complement the design on the medal. Some top bars are elaborate and contain a whole design unto themselves.|$|E
60|$|I saw, for {{the first}} time, that the lost <b>brooch</b> was <b>pinned</b> in its place again. There was {{something}} real {{in the sight of}} it, something real in the touching of it afterwards, which seemed to steady the whirl and confusion in my thoughts, and to help me to compose myself.|$|R
50|$|Grand Duke Karl II of Baden was {{the person}} to {{commission}} the grand ducal crown, although he died before its completion in 1811. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. The precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like <b>brooches</b> <b>pinned</b> to fabric. At {{the intersection of the}} four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds. The cap {{on the inside of the}} crown is made of the same crimson velvet which also covers the reverse sides of the arches of the crown.|$|R
60|$|In {{other rooms}} {{artisans}} {{are at work}} upon various tasks of marqueterie,--table-tops, album-covers, paper-weights, <b>brooches,</b> <b>pins</b> and the like,--and in others they are sawing the smalts and glass into strips, and grinding the edges. Passing through yet another room, where the finished mosaic-works--of course not the pictorial mosaics--are polished by machinery, we enter the store-room, where the crowded shelves display blocks of smalts and glass of endless variety of color. By far the greater number of these colors are discoveries or improvements of the venerable mosaicist Lorenzo Radi, who has found again the Byzantine secrets of counterfeiting, in vitreous paste, aventurine (gold stone), onyx, chalcedony, malachite, and other natural stones, and who has been praised by the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice for producing mosaics even more durable in tint and workmanship {{than those of the}} Byzantine artists.|$|R
5000|$|Mariana {{was fond}} of luxurious clothes and adornments. Her dress is {{extensively}} lined with silver braids and decorated with red ribbon. Her many pieces of jewellery include bracelets, gold chains and an elaborate gold <b>brooch</b> <b>pinned</b> at her breast. Her doll-like face pouts and her cheeks are heavily lined with rouge. Her brown hair is adorned with red ribbons and worn {{in a series of}} braids that reach widely on either side. Mariana wears a large white and red plume to the right which pictorially frames her face. Her left hand holds an elaborately folded and outsized white cloth, which in its attention to line and abandonment of scale has been described as [...] "worthy of El Greco". She wears a tightly fitted bodice which accentuates her waist but gives her the appearance of being flat chested. She holds a lace scarf in her left hand.|$|R
60|$|Nothing of {{the kind}} happened, however. Mr. Merrill's {{railroad}} being a modest one, his house was modest likewise. But Ephraim thought it grand enough, and yet acknowledged a homelike quality in its grandeur. He began by {{sitting on the edge}} of the sofa and staring at the cut-glass chandelier, but in five minutes he discovered with a shock of surprise that he was actually leaning back, describing in detail how his regiment had been cheered as they marched through Boston. And incredible as it may seem, the person whom he was entertaining in this manner was Mrs. Stephen Merrill herself. Mrs. Merrill was as tall as Mr. Merrill was short. She wore a black satin dress with a big cameo <b>brooch</b> <b>pinned</b> at her throat, her hair was gray, and her face almost masculine until it lighted up with a wonderfully sweet smile. That smile made Ephraim and Jethro feel at home; and Cynthia, too, who liked Mrs. Merrill the moment she laid eyes on her.|$|R
25|$|With a penannular <b>brooch,</b> the <b>pin</b> {{is pushed}} through {{folds of the}} cloth, which are then pulled back inside the ring; the free end of the pin passes through {{the gap in the}} ring. The pin is then rotated around the ring by 90 degrees or so, so {{that as long as the}} pin is held down by slight {{pressure}} it cannot escape over the terminals, and the fastening is secure.|$|R
50|$|Late Iron Age and Roman {{artefacts}} {{found at}} the site include ceramic loom weights and parts of pots and plates; Roman coins from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD, but particularly the late 3rd to late 4th centuries; copper items including <b>brooches,</b> a <b>pin</b> and a bracelet, iron items, particularly nails; lead items including weights, pot rivets and lead shot; and stone items including several quern-stones and a whetstone.|$|R

60|$|With this dwarf tree in my arms, when {{came the}} auspicious afternoon, I {{followed}} Lady Pollacke's parlourmaid--her neat little bonnet {{tied with a}} bow under her ear--down my Bateses, and was lifted by Mrs Bowater into the carriage. How demure a greeting we exchanged when, the maid and I having seated ourselves together under its hood, my glance fell upon the bloodstone <b>brooch</b> <b>pinned</b> conspicuously for the occasion near the topmost button of her trim, outdoor jacket. It gave me so much confidence that even the sudden clatter of conversation that gushed out over me {{in the doorway of}} Lady Pollacke's drawing-room failed to be disconcerting. The long, flowery room was thronged with company, and everybody was talking to everybody else. On my entry, as if a seraph had spoken, the busy tongues sank instantly to a hush. I stood stilettoed by a score of eyes. But Sir Walter had been keeping good watch for me, and I at once delivered my great pot into his pink, outstretched hands.|$|R
50|$|A ribbon is {{an award}} made from ribbon and {{presented}} to mark an achievement. Such ribbons {{usually have a}} <b>pin,</b> <b>brooch</b> or bridle clip as a fastener with which the award can be attached to clothing, animals, walls, or other surfaces.|$|R
50|$|A {{very large}} number of both Celtic and Gallo-Roman fibulae have also been found on the site. In a {{multitude}} of different shapes and sizes, these bronze clasps, sometimes hinged, were used either as ornamental <b>brooches</b> or for <b>pinning</b> garments together.|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristic}} garb {{of women}} included earrings with basket-shaped pendants, disc brooches with early Christian motifs, and garment pins. The early Christian symbols include crosses, bird-shaped <b>brooches</b> and <b>pins</b> decorated with bird figures (one bird-shaped brooch bears an incised cross). The Romanized populace of Pannonia in general became ‘Avarized’, and their ‘island’ of late antique culture is documented {{only in the}} immediate vicinity of Keszthely, where their traditional costume was worn until the beginning of the 9th century.|$|R
50|$|Impressive archaeological finds {{dating back}} to the Neolithic period suggest that the site was an {{important}} centre in antiquity. Since about 1810, a large number of artefacts have been found relating to pre-Roman Carthage, the Iron Age, the Roman Empire, Armenia, the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings. These include items as varied as coins which belonged to the Coriosolites in Brittany. Also, tokens, <b>brooches,</b> <b>pins,</b> knives, glass beads, keys, pottery, flint tools, mounts, pilgrim badges, pieces of leather, worked wood and iron tools. They came to be discovered after the beginning of large-scale dredging (to accommodate the needs of the nearby growing seaport of Liverpool) started to cause notable sand erosion along the coastline near Meols. These finds suggest that the site was used as a port {{as far back as the}} Iron Age some 2,400 years ago, and was once the most important seaport in the present-day North West England. Thus trading connections are believed to have reached far across Europe.Some of these artefacts are on display locally, at the Museum of Liverpool.In the 1890s the local authorities built the first sea wall. The rapidly eroding coastline was saved, but the sea wall changed the currents and archaeological sites at Meols were buried in the sand. The remains of a submerged forest off Dove Point have now also disappeared but they were visible until the spring of 1982.|$|R
2500|$|A fibula (/ˈfɪbjʊlə/, plural fibulae /ˈfɪbjʊli/) is a <b>brooch</b> or <b>pin</b> for {{fastening}} garments. The fibula {{developed in}} a variety of shapes, but all were based on the safety-pin principle. [...] Technically, the Latin term, , refers to Roman brooches; however, the term is widely used to refer to brooches from the entire ancient and early medieval world that continue Roman forms. Nevertheless, its use in English is more restricted than in other languages, and in particular post-Roman brooches from the British Isles are just called brooches (for example, the penannular brooches), where in German they would probably be fibulae.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>brooch</b> and <b>pin</b> {{were cast}} in silver with {{exquisite}} geometric and zoomorphic interlace patterns and inset with three green-glass cabochon gems (one {{of which is}} missing). Several moulded sections were used, although the main ring was cast in one piece, other goldsmith's techniques {{were used in the}} decoration. both front and back were partially gilded, with gold and gold foil also used in parts of the decoration. There may have been inset pieces of amber, which are now missing. There is decoration on both front and back, in rather different styles, a feature also found in the Tara Brooch and Hunterston Brooch.|$|R
5000|$|Grand Duke Karl II of Baden was {{promoted}} from margrave of grand duke by Napoleon I, the cousin by marriage of his wife, Stéphanie Louise Adrienne de Beauharnais. Having {{come into a}} large amount of jewels and precious metals during the secularisation of many churches Karl II ordered a crown, befitting his new title on the 20th of May 1808. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. Karl II died in 1811 before the crown was completed; the persons in charge hurried production of the crown in time for the funeral. The rush is evidenced by the relative simplicity of the crown, and the use of cheap materials in the production such as steel and even paper mache! [...] The aforementioned precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like <b>brooches</b> <b>pinned</b> to fabric. At the intersection of the four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds. The cap {{on the inside of the}} crown is made of the same crimson velvet which also covers the reverse sides of the arches of the crown. The crown was never worn by any of the grand dukes.|$|R
2500|$|For National dances, {{women and}} girls may wear an [...] "Aboyne" [...] (after the Aboyne Highland Games, where women {{are not allowed to}} wear kilts for dancing to this day, and so this outfit was devised as an alternative). [...] The outfit {{consists}} of a full tartan skirt, white blouse, a velvet vest laced up the front, and a [...] "plaid" [...] or [...] "plaidie" [...] pinned to the shoulder and waist. A dancer may choose to wear a decorative <b>brooch</b> to <b>pin</b> a plaidie to the shoulder. Another outfit option for women performing National dances is to wear a white dress with a plaid on the shoulder. [...] Men and boys have the option of wearing tartan trews instead of a kilt for the National dances).|$|R
50|$|Twelfth and {{thirteenth century}} Icelandic writers {{commonly}} {{believed that their}} country had been settled by Norwegians of noble birth who had been persecuted in Norway. The problem that dogged medieval Icelandic historiography was an understandable desire to avoid the charge that the country had been founded {{by a group of}} unruly Scottish Vikings. However, it is no longer possible to dismiss these tales of Aud and her father Ketil as unverifiable oral traditions, as this Scottish tradition in Icelandic oral history is of far greater antiquity than the thirteenth century saga age. The National Museum of Iceland contains an impressive collection of somewhat debased penannular <b>brooches</b> and <b>pins</b> of undoubted Celtic provenance from the ninth and tenth centuries which would fit well {{in the context of the}} Hebridean Norse-Gael.|$|R
50|$|Leuk {{was already}} {{inhabited}} in the pre-Roman era. Scattered La Tène era graves with poppy-head <b>pins,</b> <b>brooches</b> and a belt hook {{have been found}} in Leuk. In the 6th century it belonged to the demesne of the King of Burgundy Sigismund, who donated it to the Abbey of Saint-Maurice. The local population of Romanized Celts gradually became Germanized {{around the turn of the}} millennium due to invading Alamanni. However, even by the 14th century there was still a strong Roman minority in Leuk.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1854 in Loppi, Finland as {{a son of a}} {{bookkeeper}} Anders Gustaf Hollming of Loviisa and of Katarina Petterson. Hollming was apprenticed to the goldsmith Karl F. Ekholm in Helsinki {{at the beginning of the}} 1870s years. In 1876 he settled in St.Petersburg and registered as a goldworker. In 1880 he qualified as master and opened his workshop at 35 Kazanskaya Street and was hired by Fabergé soon. He had three sons from Erika G. Abrahamsson. In 1900 the Hollming workshop moved to 24 Bolshaya Morskaya under the same roof as Fabergé. In 1913 he ran the workshop together with Otto Hanhinen, his father's assistant. He mainly produced cigarette-cases in silver, gold and enamel, miniature Easter Eggs and small gem-set, enameled jewels such as cuff-links, <b>brooches</b> and <b>pins.</b> Many times he produced these objects for the House of Fabergé.|$|R
50|$|The Canterbury Helmet is an Iron Age helmet {{found in}} a field near Canterbury, Kent, England, in December 2012. Made of bronze, {{it is one of}} only a few helmets dating from the Iron Age to ever have been found in Britain. The helmet {{currently}} resides in the British Museum, and is undergoing conservation work. It was found by an anonymous metal detector, who found it together with an iron <b>brooch</b> and a <b>pin,</b> and it is thought to have contained a bag with cremated human remains.|$|R
50|$|The zipper {{may be used}} {{to secure}} an article of clothing, a tent or other fabric enclosure, luggage, or other soft container. Another popular method of {{securing}} clothing presses a thin and sharpened wire through the fabric using a <b>brooch</b> or safety <b>pin.</b> A buckle is used in place of a zipper at times. Buttons are another way to secure clothing, and require dexterous fingers to properly use. Snap fasteners (also named poppers and press studs) and the hook and loop fastener are a few less common zipper alternatives.|$|R
5000|$|The team {{uncovered}} {{what seems}} to be a sizeable 10th century BC necropolis under the forum. All the tombs contained urns with ashes of the dead, except the one of the Lady of the Forum, who must therefore have enjoyed a special social status not to be incinerated. She was about 165 cm tall and 30 years of age when she died and was buried with her jewelry, including an amber necklace, bronze <b>brooches</b> used to <b>pin</b> her robe, and a ring-shaped bronze ornament to hold her hair.|$|R
