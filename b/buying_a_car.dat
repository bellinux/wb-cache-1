25|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} (also {{known as}} multi-objective programming, vector optimization, multicriteria optimization, multiattribute optimization or Pareto optimization) {{is an area}} of multiple criteria decision making, that is concerned with mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization has been applied in many fields of science, including engineering, economics and logistics where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of trade-offs between two or more conflicting objectives. Minimizing cost while maximizing comfort while <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>car,</b> and maximizing performance whilst minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle are examples of multi-objective optimization problems involving two and three objectives, respectively. In practical problems, there can be more than three objectives.|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, the {{triangular}} structure is often exploited for rhetorical reasons, {{in particular in}} advertisements. A commercial slogan (popular in the 1980 s) such as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>car,</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Saab” has a real impact. Here the sentence initially understood as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> 0 … ” yields a contradiction as a Saab is <b>a</b> <b>car</b> 0. Reinterpreted as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> 1 …” (in which car 1 is the class of cars that are not Saab), it gets the exclusive interpretation. The cognitive effort is worthwhile in terms of effect as the hearer ends up with “buy a Saab” and “don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> {{that is not a}} Saab”.|$|R

One of them is when conflicts between the host family and the students {{can not be solved}} by communicating with each other and that is when the student will be asked to stay with another host until they find a new match.
