25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company will {{step up the}} voltage of the power being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E
2500|$|Before salsa pianist Eddie Palmieri {{takes his}} first solo at a live concert, he will often stand up, and start {{clapping}} clave. Once {{the audience is}} clapping clave along with him, Palmieri will sit <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the piano and proceed to take his solo. Palmieri's solos tend to be rhythmically complex, with avant-garde elements such as harmonic dissonance. By clapping clave along with Palmieri's solo, the audience is able to both [...] "de-code" [...] its rather esoteric musical [...] "message," [...] and participate in its creation at a fundamental level.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the period}} between 1940 and 1981 saw Guatemala assert its claim over and over again, {{occasionally}} even threatening to invade, but <b>backing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the sight of UK military reinforcements. Several attempts to mediate the dispute went awry due to concerns {{on both sides of}} the border. Meanwhile, people of Guatemalan descent were settling in Belize, both legally and illegally.|$|R

2500|$|Leeds City Vixens {{was started}} in 1993 by Martin Cockerill and his children. At first it was called Meanwood Vixens but it grew into what {{is now known as}} Leeds City Vixens. Immediately the team made a name for itself and grew as part of the Sheffield and District Girl's League, winning the u12's, u14's and u16's [...] Leeds City Vixens open age played in the Yorkshire & Humberside League. In the season 1999/00 they {{finished}} 2nd with 51 points. In 2000/01 they got 41 points and finished 5th. In 2001/02 they finished 10th with 16 points. In 2002/03 they finished 5th with 27 points and got promoted to the next tier. They started playing in the Northern Combination League for the 2003/2004 season. A bad finish left them 10th {{at the end of the}} season and they were relegated <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the 2004/2005 season, they finished top of the Yorkshire & Humberside League which brought them back up to the Northern Combination, where they remain. In the 2005/06 season they finished 2nd. In the 2006/2007 season they finished 2nd and came close to promotion. Over the course of the season they won 15 games, drew 4 games, and lost 2 games.

50|$|As {{pressure}} for reform built up nationally, the League {{decided to hold}} another Hyde Park meeting. The government banned it, saying it was illegal, but the League countered that the ban itself was illegal and posted posters to this effect on 1 May. The government <b>backed</b> <b>down.</b> Eventually 200,000 met at Hyde Park on 6 May and speeches were made on ten different platforms. The government planned to use violence, having sworn in large numbers of special constables on 4 May, but <b>backed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the last minute.|$|R
50|$|Like Olivia, Anne gets {{pregnant}} {{and she also}} decides to get an abortion, but <b>backs</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the last minute.

She travels to the snowy mountains of Kashmir where Olivia spent her last years in solitude, seldom visited by the Nawab. Anne plans to bear her child in a hospital nearby.|$|R
60|$|But to {{continue}} my description of our costume. We all wore homespun grey trousers of strong material. Peterkin and Jack wore leggings in addition, {{so that they}} seemed to have on what are now termed knickerbockers. Peterkin, however, had no coat. He preferred a stout grey flannel shirt hanging down to his knees and belted round his waist {{in the form of a}} tunic. Our tastes in headdress were varied. Jack wore a pork-pie cap; Peterkin and I had wide-awakes. My facetious little companion said that I had selected this species of hat because I was always more than half asleep! Being peculiar in everything, Peterkin wore his wide-awake in an unusual manner--namely, turned up at the <b>back,</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the front, and curled very much up at the sides.|$|E
6000|$|... "But to get <b>back.</b> <b>Down</b> <b>at</b> {{the lower}} end of the valley I got winded and gave over. I began to speculate, for when my wind left me my dander got hotter and hotter, and I knew I'd never know peace of mind till I dined on roasted mammoth-foot. And I knew, also, that that stood for skookum mamook pukapuk--excuse Chinook, I mean there was a big fight coming. Now the mouth of my valley was very narrow, and the walls steep. High up on one side was one of those big pivot rocks, or {{balancing}} rocks, as some call them, weighing all of a couple of hundred tons. Just the thing. I hit back for camp, keeping an eye open so the bull couldn't slip past, and got my ammunition. It wasn't worth anything with the rifle smashed; so I opened the shells, planted the powder under the rock, and touched it off with slow fuse. Wasn't much of a charge, but the old boulder tilted up lazily and dropped down into place, with just space enough to let the creek drain nicely. Now I had him." ...|$|E

Father Francisco sends him to recuperate at his native village where Miguel’s widow mother still lives.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{important}} accomplishment was in helping to prevent {{the establishment of the}} Spanish Inquisition in Naples, a matter about which the Neapolitans were very adamant. Neapolitan feelings about the Spanish Inquisition were so strong that a baronial rebellion in 1547 liberated hundreds of people from inquisititorial prisons. [...] The obvious popular hostility, combined with persuasive arguments by Paolo and other opponents of the [...] "Holy Office," [...] led to the Crown <b>backing</b> <b>down,</b> <b>at</b> least for the time being.|$|R
50|$|Shiners are planktivores, {{feeding on}} a variety of zooplankton, protozoans and diatoms.

50|$|The Germans, with {{interests}} of their own, were eager {{to take advantage of}} whatever opportunities the conflict in the islands might afford.

Brendan and two others do through with the heist, which ends in the accidental death of the driver. Chris is reprimanded by Tony for not using his leadership to stop Brendan. Junior, angered that his authority was flouted, stages a mock execution for Chris in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Brendan is shot in the eye by Mikey Palmice.|$|R

The wax will settle <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the bottom, forming one blob once again. Severe cases can require many heat-cool cycles to clear.|$|E
5|$|At the war's end in 1945, Ull {{only had}} {{fourteen}} members. Its average member age was lowered to 65 {{years after the}} admission of five new members in 1946 and 1947.

One of the new members, Erik Plahte, would serve as chairman from 1951 to 1973, when he <b>backed</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the age of 84. Another of the new post-war members, Jakob Vaage, took over. He was then aged 68. By 1953, all the club's elected positions were held by post-war members.
