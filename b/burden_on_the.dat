5|$|The kingdom {{to which}} James succeeded, however, had its problems. Monopolies and {{taxation}} had engendered a widespread sense of grievance, {{and the costs}} of war in Ireland had become a heavy <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government, which had debts of £400,000.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E

3000|$|The ITEP {{analysis}} {{indicates a}} very strong positive correlation between <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> adjacent segments of the income distribution. The correlation between <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top 5 percent and the next 15 percent is [...]. 92. This strong correlation means that higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next 15 percent in some states than others are not an indication of greater tax regressivity {{at the top of}} the income distribution. Hence, the revenue-dampening effect of higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next 15 percent cannot be interpreted as an effect of regressivity on tax volatility. We suspect that the result is related to the very weak correlation between next- 15 burdens and changes in AGI.|$|R

5|$|Compensation {{for large}} amounts of damage to houses along the route during {{construction}}, along with higher construction costs than calculated was a heavy <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> company, and in 1934, the municipality of Aker took over the common stock, though the preferred stock remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange until 1975, as Oslo Sporveier gradually took over {{the operation of the}} western suburban lines. Akersbanerne opened the connecting Sognsvann Line in 1934.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E
5|$|A silver cross {{originally}} {{stood on}} its conical dome and a crystal chandelier, bought by King Smbat II from India, {{hang in the}} cathedral. In the 1010s, {{during the reign of}} Catholicos Sarkis I, a mausoleum dedicated to the Hripsimean virgins was erected next to the cathedral. The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were left on the cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water pipes and easing of the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> residents of Ani.|$|E
30|$|Conversely, {{the revenue}} effect of an income {{shock to the}} top of the income {{distribution}} is conditioned by the initial tax burden. For the 24 states with <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top 5 percent of 6.9 percent or more, a larger negative income shock at the top led to a greater decrease (or smaller gain) in revenue. But among the other 24 states, which had <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top 5 percent of less than 6.9 percent, a larger negative income shock to this top group led to a smaller loss (or bigger gain) in revenue.|$|R

The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant {{in order to make}} her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|After being educated by a governess, Allen joined Summer Fields School in Oxford in 1912. He {{began to}} play cricket seriously at school; by his second year, he reached the school second team, from where he progressed to the first team then the captaincy. His ability {{attracted}} the attention of Eton College, where a friend of Allen's father, C. M. Wells, was a housemaster. The family had planned to send Allen to Haileybury, but Wells persuaded Allen senior to send his son to Eton instead, although it was a considerable financial <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> family. Allen, although not initially keen on the prospect, started there in the winter of 1915–16.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced {{at the end of its}} tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding further to the <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remaining battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left the province to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building {{had proved}} to be an {{excessive}} <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> limited capital reserves of the WCHS. The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.|$|E
5|$|Food waste puts a large <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{finances}} of each {{household and}} local councils in the UK; wasted food {{is estimated to}} cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E
5|$|No {{treatments}} stop {{or reverse}} its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes {{may be beneficial}} with respect to {{activities of daily living}} and can potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August the Immigration Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee ordered Lazar Kaganovich {{to solve}} the railway crisis in 1935. Kaganovich first prioritised {{bottleneck}} areas over other less-traveled areas; his second priority was investing in heavy traffic lines, and thirdly, the least efficient areas of the rail network were left to themselves. Another problem facing rail transport was the massive industrialisation efforts pushed on by the authorities. The industrialisation {{proved to be a}} heavy <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railways, and Vyacheslav Molotov and Kaganovich even admitted this to the 18th party congress. Even so, the Soviet Government continued their industrialisation efforts to better prepare themselves for a future war with Germany, which became reality in 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> finances {{of the governments}} which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much {{more expensive than the}} last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Norsk Hydro had {{a strong}} liquidity, while the Green Revolution and {{increased}} industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold. The increased transport was a heavy <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime. A number of upgrades were made to the line, and the two locomotives 9 and 10 were bought in 1958. This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20, 21 and 22 from Henschel. In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives were bought, and the voltage on the line increased from 10 to 15 kV.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{occurred}} on Lady Day 1644, when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels, and {{broke through the}} walls of the New Salt Channel. The Commissioners authorised {{the construction of a new}} sea sluice at Kent Wall, and work began in May 1646, but in September, they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead. The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted, in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel, and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage. The Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore deteriorated, and failed in 1650. A new sluice with three channels was built in 1669. The financial <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge, as they had to pay rent on all land that was not available to its original owners, and so in 1671, an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels. Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley, and was largely completed by 1684. The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother, which was built along the southern edge of the valley. It was called the Craven Channel, and ended at Craven Sluices.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much of a <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E
