40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed in the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of external and internal flap rippling on the aerodynamics of a nonaxisymmetric nozzle. Data were obtained at several Mach numbers from static conditions to 1. 2 over a range of nozzle pressure ratios. Nozzles with chordal boattail angles of 10, 20, and 30 degrees, with and without surface rippling, were tested. No effect on discharge coefficient due to surface rippling was observed. Internal thrust losses due to surface rippling were measured and attributed to a combination of additional internal skin friction and shock losses. External nozzle drag for the baseline configurations were generally less than that for the rippled configurations at all free-stream Mach numbers tested. The difference between the baseline and rippled nozzle drag levels generally increased with increasing <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> <b>angle.</b> The thrust-minus-drag level for each rippled nozzle configuration was less than the equivalent baseline configuration for each Mach number at the design nozzle pressure ratio...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) analysis has been performed {{to study the}} plume effects on sonic boom signature for isolated nozzle configurations. The objectives of these analyses were to provide comparison to past work using modern CFD analysis tools, to investigate the differences of high aspect ratio nozzles to circular (axisymmetric) nozzles, and to report the effects of under expanded nozzle operation on boom signature. CFD {{analysis was used to}} address the plume effects on sonic boom signature from a baseline exhaust nozzle. Nearfield pressure signatures were collected for nozzle pressure ratios (NPRs) between 6 and 10. A computer code was used to extrapolate these signatures to a ground-observed sonic boom N-wave. Trends show that there is a reduction in sonic boom N-wave signature as NPR is increased from 6 to 10. As low boom designs are developed and improved, there will be a need for understanding the interaction between the aircraft boat tail shocks and the exhaust nozzle plume. These CFD analyses will provide a baseline study for future analysis efforts. For further study, a design of experiments has been conducted to develop a hybrid method where both CFD and small scale wind tunnel testing will validate the observed trends. The CFD and testing will be used to screen a number of factors which are important to low boom propulsion integration, including <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> <b>angle,</b> nozzle geometry, and the effect of spacing and stagger on nozzle pairs. To design the wind tunnel experiment, CFD was instrumental in developing a model which would provide adequate space to observe the nozzle and boat tail shock structure without interference from the wind tunnel walls...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of animal drawn implements should {{be within the}} range of the pulling capacity of draught animals. The effects of design and operational parameters such as <b>tail</b> <b>angle,</b> side rake angle and radius of curvature of a curved soil tillage implement on horizontal and vertical forces have been investigated under laboratory conditions. Seven different wings of different radii of curvature (150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 mm) were designed. The range of <b>tail</b> <b>angle</b> used was between 32 ° and 54 ° and the range of side angle was between 40 ° and 65 °. The effect of curvature on the horizontal force showed anomalous behaviour for different <b>tail</b> <b>angles.</b> For smaller <b>tail</b> <b>angles</b> (about 30 ° to 40 °) the horizontal force decreased significantly with an increase of radius. For a <b>tail</b> <b>angle</b> of about 45 °, the horizontal force decreased first with the increase of radius of curvature and then increased with further increase of radius. For <b>tail</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 50 ° the horizontal force increased with an increase of radius. The variation of the behaviour of radius and force relation is presumably due to the edge rake angle, since it varies with the radius. For larger radii, the effect of edge rake angle on the horizontal force is much more pronounced than the effect of radius on the horizontal force. For the vertical force (directed downward), it was observed that, for all <b>tail</b> <b>angles</b> used, the force increased significantly with a decrease of radius and this relation was described well by a third order polynomial equation. Variation of <b>tail</b> <b>angle</b> showed a significant effect on both horizontal and vertical forces. This is mainly due to an increase of normal compression forces and gravitational force when the <b>tail</b> <b>angle</b> is increased. For the range of <b>tail</b> <b>angle</b> used the horizontal force could be described by a trigonometric model. The effect of variation of side rake angle on the resulting forces for different speeds and radii was also investigated. Experimental investigation showed that variation of speed and radius affects the of side rake angle and force relation. The study recommends a combination of larger radius and smaller side rake angles for high speed operations to achieve a good penetration performance and reduced horizontal force. From the analysis made, a radius of about 275 mm was found to be an optimum for a curved implement. On the basis of the results obtained from the soil bin experiments and from the basic design of a conventional mouldboard plough and an ard type plough, a reversible animal drawn plough was designed...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} a numerical and experimental investigation aimed at assessing the performance of a control method to delay boundary layer separation consisting in the introduction in the surface of contoured transverse grooves, i. e. of small cavities with an appropriate shape orientated transverse to the incoming flow. The shape of the grooves and their depth - which must be significantly smaller than the thickness of the incoming boundary layer - Are chosen so that the flow recirculations present within the grooves are steady and stable. This passive control strategy is applied to an axisymmetric bluff body with various rear <b>boat</b> <b>tails,</b> which are characterized by different degrees of flow separation. Variational multiscale large eddy simulations and wind tunnel tests are carried out. The Reynolds number, for both experiments and simulations, is Re = uâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆eD/Î½ = 9. 6 Ã 9 ̆ 7 104; due to the different incoming flow turbulence level, the boundary layer conditions before the <b>boat</b> <b>tails</b> are fully developed turbulent in the experiments and transitional in the simulations. In all cases, the introduction of one single axisymmetric groove in the lateral surface of the <b>boat</b> <b>tails</b> produces significant delay of the boundary layer separation, with consequent reduction of the pressure drag. Nonetheless, the wake dynamical structure remains qualitatively similar to the one typical of a blunt-based axisymmetric body, with quantitative variations that are consistent with the reduction in wake width caused by <b>boat</b> <b>tailing</b> and by the grooves. A few supplementary simulations show that the effect of the grooves is also robust to the variation of the geometrical parameters defining their shape. All the obtained data support the interpretation that the relaxation of the no-slip boundary condition for the flow surrounding the recirculation regions, with an appreciable velocity along their borders, is the physical mechanism responsible for the effectiveness of the present separation control method...|$|R

5000|$|After more {{detailed}} testing results became available, starting in 1944 the cartridge was tweaked {{in order to}} improve its accuracy and penetration. Initially, the <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> had been omitted because the Soviet designers had assumed (incorrectly) that it would only make a difference at long ranges, when the bullet became subsonic, and the accuracy of the intermediate cartridge at these ranges was considered inconsequential. However, further testing showed that the <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> improved accuracy even at shorter ranges, where the bullet was still supersonic. In order to maintain the overall mass of the bullet, after adding the <b>boat</b> <b>tail,</b> the ogival head section of the bullet was lengthened as well, making the bullet more streamlined overall. The maximum radius was now attained at some 15.95 mm from the tip and the overall length of the bullet increased to 26.8 mm. In order to preserve the total length of the cartridge, the case sleeve was shortened to 38.7 mm (and by rounding it is customarily referred to as 7.62×39.) Additionally, the new bullet had a core made of low-carbon steel wrapped in lead. The use of low-carbon (mild) steel was guided mostly by the desire to reuse some industrial equipment that was manufacturing the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge rather than by bullet fragmentation considerations. This bullet was given the acronym [...] "7.62 PS" [...] (76.2 ПС). The [...] "S" [...] initially stood for [...] "surrogate" [...] ( [...] , [...] ), but later the letter was taken to refer to the steel component ( [...] , [...] ) of the core, which accounted for about 50% of the core volume. The 7.62×39 cartridge equipped with the PS bullet finally overcame all objections of the GAU in mid-1947, when it was ordered into series production, and given the index 57-N-231S.|$|R
