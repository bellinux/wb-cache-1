5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch.</b> The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
5|$|In Van Nuys, California, two men {{in their}} early twenties named Blake and Mike (Tyson Turrou and David Faustino) sneak into a house that Blake claims was where the comedy {{television}} series The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> was filmed.

The show ends with a medley of songs sung by the family, Jasper Beardley and Waylon Smithers.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect {{is a man with}} an unusual obsession for The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch.</b> Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, with {{finances}} {{given to}} her by United Artists executive Richard Stewart, Tina returned onstage, giving a round of shows in Las Vegas in a cabaret setting, influenced by the cabaret shows she witnessed while {{a member of the}} Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She took her cabaret act to smaller venues in the United States. Turner earned further income by appearing on shows such as The Hollywood Squares, Donny and Marie, The Sonny & Cher Show and The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Hour. Later in 1977, Turner headlined her first solo concert tour, throughout Australia. In 1978, United Artists released Turner's third solo album, Rough, with distribution both in North America and Europe with EMI.

25|$|The first filmed {{adaptation}} {{was by the}} Encyclopædia Britannica Educational Corporation in 1969; adapted, produced & {{directed by}} Larry Yust and starring James Westerfield, Patrick Campbell, and Barry Williams of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> fame in a small role.|$|E
25|$|Kings Island was nationally {{promoted}} in two well-known sitcoms on ABC. Each filmed an episode on location at the park: The Partridge Family in 1972 and The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> in 1973. The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> {{was produced by}} Paramount Television, a large Taft Broadcasting shareholder. In later years, Kings Island changed ownership several times. Taft sold its theme park division in 1984 for $167.5 million to Kings Entertainment Company (KECO), a company formed by senior executives and general managers of Taft Attractions Group. Three parks – Kings Island, Kings Dominion and Carowinds – {{were involved in the}} sale. Taft invested in KECO to retain one-third interest. Three years later in 1987, American Financial Corporation, led by Carl Lindner, purchased KECO for $150 million. The deal included a contract with KECO to continue managing park operations. In 1989, KECO acquired the business assets of Great America, an amusement park it was managing operations for.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Vilanch co-wrote The Showgirl Must Go On with Midler. The show {{opened at}} Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, {{receiving}} positive reviews.

His acting credits include a Tony-nominated role as the Artful Dodger in the original London and Broadway productions of Oliver! as well as a starring cameo role in a hallmark episode of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> television show and later reprised parody film; Love, American Style; and My Two Dads. Jones is considered one of the great teen idols.|$|E
25|$|On the {{television}} side, in September 1969, ABC launched the Movie of the Week, a weekly showcase aimed at {{capitalizing on the}} growing success of made-for-TV movies since the early 1960s. The Movie of the Week broadcast feature-length dramatic films directed by such talented filmmakers as Aaron Spelling, David Wolper and Steven Spielberg (the latter of whom gained early success through the showcase for his 1971 film Duel) that were produced on an average budget of $400,000–$450,000.

25|$|Mochrie {{remained}} active elsewhere {{during his}} tenure as a Whose Line member. In early 1994, he {{played the role of}} Mike Brady in a musical version of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> directed by fellow Second City member Bruce Pirrie. In the production, Mochrie plays the character as caffeine-fuelled, jittery, and neurotic, an exaggeration of the Mike Brady television character, who often had a coffee in his hand on the show. Shortly before his move to the US version of Whose Line in 1998, Mochrie starred in Supertown Challenge as the host of game shows, which the show spoofed. He also appeared in several episodes of the Canadian improvisational comedy series Improv Heaven and Hell.|$|E
500|$|In {{an episode}} of the 1970s TV series, The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> Alice, the housekeeper, refers to Greg, Peter and Bobby as [...] "Tinker to Evers to Chance" [...] as the boys enter the kitchen after a {{baseball}} game.|$|E
500|$|The {{elaborate}} The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> house set {{featured in}} the episode was built completely by the production crew, according to series co-star Gillian Anderson. She recounts the fact that, due to the original set having been long ago disassembled, people came [...] "from all over Los Angeles" [...] to get their pictures taken on the set. Anderson, who was a fan of popular sitcoms made by Sherwood Schwartz, like Gilligan's Island and The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> called the experience [...] "wild". The scene wherein Fogelman's house turns into an outside field was created via the technique of Chroma Keying. A shot of both The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> house and an outside field were filmed. Then, the actors were filmed against a blue screen. A matte of the scenes was then cut and the scenes were composited against each other. Due {{to the fact that}} the shot was an extended scene, Paul Rabwin later noted that the effects were [...] "a little tricky" [...] to get right; Rabwin noted that the shots' mattes had to cover the [...] "little strands of hair" [...] on Anderson's head, because missing the strands is what [...] "gives [...] away".|$|E
500|$|After {{acquiring}} Desilu Productions in 1967, {{the company}} continued to produce {{series for the}} [...] "big three" [...] broadcast networks. Among them were Here's Lucy, [...] and Mannix for CBS; The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> The Odd Couple and Happy Days for ABC; and (in later years) Family Ties and Cheers for NBC.|$|E
500|$|The episode marked Gilligan's second directorial effort, after season seven's [...] "Je Souhaite". The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> house set {{featured}} in the episode was completely rebuilt. According to Anderson, people came [...] "from all over Los Angeles" [...] to get their pictures taken on the set. In addition, it contained several elaborate effects. [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was the final [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] entry in the series; the series finale, [...] "The Truth" [...] would deal with the series' overarching alien colonization mythology.|$|E
500|$|In March 2007 Mehldau first {{performed}} his piano concerto [...] "The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Variations for Piano and Orchestra", {{with the}} Orchestre national d'Île-de-France at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. Later that decade, Carnegie Hall awarded Mehldau another commission – {{to write the}} song cycle Love Songs for singer Anne Sofie von Otter; they premiered it together in 2009 and recorded the songs the following year. In 2009 Mehldau began a two-year period as curator of London's Wigmore Hall jazz series, which included a performance with von Otter in the second year.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, the Griffin family are shown {{watching}} the syndicated television show The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> with Mike and Carol Brady then appearing in bed with one another. After Lois discovers that Limbaugh will be appearing at a book signing in Quahog, Chris references a previous episode, [...] "FOX-y Lady", in which Limbaugh appeared as a character created by actor Fred Savage, which was subsequently reported on by Lois for Fox News. The episode featured a brief cameo appearance of conservative character Stan Smith from Seth MacFarlane's second show, American Dad!.|$|E
500|$|When Stewie and Brian return home, Lois asks Stewie {{about the}} trip, and Stewie covers up for Brian {{by saying the}} trip was [...] "Smooth sailing through calm seas". Lois leaves and Brian tells Stewie that he is thankful to Stewie for {{covering}} for him, and asks Stewie if there's anything he can do to repay him. At first, it appears that Stewie wishes to make him his servant by providing an example with an episode of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> although {{it turns out that}} Stewie wants Brian to tape that episode for him.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, Pedigree {{focused on}} {{developing}} more Sindy products and neglected advertising and market research, risking Sindy's [...] "girl next door" [...] image becoming old-fashioned. In 1978, Sindy {{was introduced to}} the United States market by Marx Toys. Child star Susan Olsen, who played Cindy Brady on the popular family sitcom The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> was featured in a U.S. produced commercial for the doll. [...] Most of Sindy's accessories and fashions were similar to those sold in the United Kingdom, except for the addition of a friend, Gayle, and a McDonald's-themed Sindy. Marx Toys went into receivership in 1980 and Sindy was withdrawn from the US market.|$|E
500|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{looks through}} various X-Files and discovers one {{about a young}} boy named Anthony Fogelman who possessed psychokinesis. She learns that Fogelman later {{changed his name to}} Oliver Martin. She meets with Dr. John Rietz (John Aylward), a parapsychologist who worked with the young Fogelman. Rietz claims that, despite being {{extremely}} lonely, Martin was not dangerous and that his power faded as he grew up. Reyes makes the connection that Fogelman changed his name to Oliver based on Cousin Oliver from The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch.</b> Scully notes that, in the show, Oliver was portrayed as a [...] "jinx", and the three agents deduce that Fogelman must see himself as one, too.|$|E
500|$|... 1923 – [...] "Charleston" [...] is a jazz {{orchestration}} for the Charleston dance, {{composed by}} James P. Johnson with lyrics by Cecil Mack. Introduced by Elisabeth Welch in the 1923 Broadway musical Runnin' Wild, its success brought the Charleston dance to international popularity. Johnson's original rhythmic accompaniment inspired several later songs, {{many of which}} used the word [...] "Charleston" [...] in the title. The song was played in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life, with James Stewart and Donna Reed, at a dance scene. It was also a featured production number in the 1950 film Tea for Two. It was also featured on an episode of the 1970s sitcom The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Quick and the Deads dismal {{box office}} {{performance}} {{can be attributed}} to competition from Billy Madison, The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> Movie, Just Cause and Heavyweights. Director Sam Raimi later blamed himself and his visual style for the film's failure. [...] "I was very confused after I made that movie. For a number of years I thought, I'm like a dinosaur. I couldn't change with the material." [...] TriStar Pictures also showed The Quick and the Dead as an [...] "out-of-competition" [...] film at the May 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Additionally, Stone was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress, but lost to Angela Bassett in Strange Days. A novelization written by Jack Curtis was published by HarperCollins in September 1995. The Region 1 DVD release came in September 1998.|$|E
500|$|John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{are called}} in to investigate. They {{interview}} Mike, who claims that Blake died after visiting [...] "the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> House". The three speak to the owner, Oliver Martin (Michael Emerson), but upon entering discover that the house looks nothing like the one featured in the teaser. Doggett, feeling something is not right, checks Martin's trashcan and finds asphalt shingles; earlier, on top of Mike's car, Doggett had found {{a piece of a}} shingle. He deduces that Blake was thrown through Martin's roof. Later that night, Mike looks into Martin's house and sees the whole Brady family eating dinner. He storms into the house, only to find that the family has disappeared. Suddenly, he is confronted by Martin, who tells him to leave. Mike refuses, and is thrown through the roof, only to be embedded in the yard.|$|E
500|$|This episode saw The Simpsons surpass The Flintstones for {{the number}} of episodes {{produced}} for an animated series. The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show [...] "fresh" [...] again. The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as [...] "jumping the shark", instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or major plot twist to boost ratings. The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character, when the show has run for too long. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involve children, who have grown up. This was the case in [...] "Oliver" [...] in The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> or [...] "Luke" [...] on Growing Pains. Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this, by attempting to keep The Itchy and Scratchy Show and the Simpson family fresh respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{connection}} between Benedict Arnold and treason continued, into the 20th and 21st centuries. He {{is a member}} of the Jury of the Damned in the novel The Devil and Daniel Webster. On an episode of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> [...] "Everyone Can't Be George Washington", Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play, and is ostracized. On one of The Simpsons Halloween specials, [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV", Arnold is included in a [...] "jury of the damned" [...] – along with other figures like John Wilkes Booth and Richard Nixon – deliberating the ownership of Homer Simpson's soul. Benedict's ghost, along with the ghosts of John Andre and William Demont, are the villains of the episode [...] "The Spirits of '76" [...] in the 1976 cartoon The Scooby-Doo Show. He also appeared in an episode of Fairly Oddparents, in which he briefly poses as George Washington in an effort to convince the Founding Fathers to sign the [...] "Declaration of Surrenderance" [...] to Great Britain.|$|E
500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} video and noted that [...] "the crazy twitchy behavior she exhibited in 'Telephone' returns to much delight, but with a wardrobe that's pure housewife instead of cold-blooded drag-queen murderer." [...] Odell also praised the playsuits in the video, which according to here were [...] "a classier, more mature version of 'tards." [...] In another review, Odell concluded [...] "It {{would be easy to}} credit the look of Beyoncé's new video to Lady Gaga's influence." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video, writing, [...] "The retro-glam outfits, the oversized martini glass, the rolling around on the bed sobbing with eye makeup running down her face... this is our favorite Bey video ever. No one else can make doing household chores (dusting Grammys!) simultaneously look this good and this sad." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised Knowles' [...] "strong look" [...] completed by lumberjack shirt, bandana and denim hotpants in the video further comparing it with Amy Winehouse's. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine described the video as a [...] "Douglas Sirk film through the eyes of David LaChapelle" [...] and noted that several scenes looked like Knowles was being photographed for Vogue magazine on the set of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch.</b> He concluded that [...] "If Beyoncé was lobbying for a temptress role on Mad Men, 'Why Don't You Love Me,'... would make the perfect audition reel." ...|$|E
500|$|As such, the FCC representatives {{start to}} censor any foul {{language}} and inappropriate behavior in Quahog, ruining their times of privacy; for instance, a black [...] "censor's bar" [...] is pulled over Peter's genitals by FCC employees {{as he leaves}} the shower, all expletives are overdubbed with an air horn, and audible farts are banned in public (replaced with a dubbing of Steven Wright punchlines). Everyone in Quahog is angered by this, except for Lois, who approves of the FCC's actions, believing that everyone in Quahog needs a lesson in decency. However, she realizes that the FCC's presence puts her and Peter's sex life to a stop after they prevent her and Peter from having any real sex, even if no one's watching (specifically banning thrusting, tongue-kissing, moaning and any movement whatsoever). Peter angrily blames her, thus causing her to feel guilty for letting this happen. They lobby Congress to have the FCC's rulings reversed. At first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC, but they relent when Peter honorably retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts and any other body parts associating with it, such as the Capitol Building to a breast. The oppression of the FCC is finally gone, Lois congratulates Peter for beating the FCC on its tracks, and the family settles down to watch an uncensored episode of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> that features bathroom jokes.|$|E
500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E
500|$|Roxana Hadadi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for The Washington Post, was extremely negative towards the reality series {{due to its}} absurdity, and commented that the show: [...] "firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut [...] from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable." [...] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: [...] "Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame. But even worseit is downright boring to watch this family live out their tedious lives." [...] John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed {{the reason for the}} family's success by saying that: [...] "the Kardashians' fame is a lot like Möbius strip or an M. C. Escher painting." [...] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch</b> -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: [...] "illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay." [...] Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: [...] "America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for all the world to see." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} largely {{based upon the}} 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is {{mentioned}} in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter {{has to go to}} the bathroom, he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family. A montage of Peter going to the bathroom is shown, while Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Let's Get Loud" [...] plays. When Peter becomes aware that Cleveland's house is being rented by actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, he mentions that he is honored to have dinner with [...] "two of the three Ghostbusters." [...] Chase then replies that he was not in that movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet [...] "two of the Three Amigos," [...] a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd. After dinner, Stewie is seen drawing and coloring Sebastian the crab, a character from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian {{if they want to be}} [...] "spies like us", Stewie asks if they can be [...] "spies like them" [...] and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the [...] "Awesomest Year of the 80's" [...] prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song [...] "(Keep Feeling) Fascination." [...] Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if [...] "Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here." [...] There is a cutaway to The <b>Brady</b> <b>Bunch,</b> in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise.|$|E
