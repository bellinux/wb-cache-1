50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's steam {{locomotive}} class D5 (formerly Class G, pre-1895) comprised eighteen lightweight 4-4-0 locomotives for light duty, maintenance-of-way and <b>branch-line</b> <b>service,</b> constructed at the railroad's own Altoona Works during 1870-1873.|$|E
50|$|While {{interest}} in self-propelled cars did exist before the late 1910s {{in the form}} of the electric trolley and streetcar as well as a few other examples, the better portion of doodlebug usage in the United States can be traced to this time period. Electro-Motive, then {{in the form of}} the Electro-Motive Corporation as the General Motors purchase had not yet occurred, began the large scale production of self-propelled railcars using bodies manufactured by Pullman or the St. Louis Car Company. By the 1920s the gas-electric car had become one of the main providers of <b>branch-line</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
50|$|This was {{the only}} type of Garratt {{locomotive}} to operate on the New South Wales Government Railways. Designed to a light axle load of only 16 LT, they were intended for hauling feeder <b>branch-line</b> <b>services</b> to the main lines where heavier main-line locomotives could continue with the load.|$|R
50|$|Following privatisation, Wales & Borders {{continued}} to use the fleet of Class 150 units on <b>branch-line</b> <b>services</b> {{as well as on}} the commuter services around Cardiff known as the Valley Lines and the Vale of Glamorgan Line. They have also been used on the Borderlands Line between Bidston (Merseyside) and Wrexham and on the Conwy Valley Line, when a single car Class 153 does not provide sufficient capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Passenger {{services}} ceased {{operation in}} 1975, {{during a period}} of widespread closure of New South Wales <b>branch-line</b> passenger <b>services,</b> leaving the line at that time as a seasonal wheat line. The line was completely closed in 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The second batch, {{numbered}} 142015-142027, {{was delivered}} {{for use in}} the West Country. These units, named [...] "Skippers", went straight to Plymouth Laira depot for use on <b>branch-line</b> <b>services</b> in Devon and Cornwall, although their success on these duties was hindered by their lack of bogies. Their long wheelbase caused heavy flange wear when they were negotiating the tight curves of the West Country branch lines, as well as producing loud screeching sounds. Adhesion problems were also encountered by the lightweight 'Skippers' when tackling the gradients of the Gunnislake, St Ives and Looe branches. For a time, consideration was given to fitting sanding equipment and lubricators to the 'Skippers' but this was rejected in favour of transferring the class north to Neville Hill (Leeds) and Newton Heath (Manchester) depots in 1988/89.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{being built}} for <b>branch-line</b> {{stopping}} <b>services,</b> the Class 142s are mainly used on urban commuter services {{in and out}} of cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle and can be seen on longer-distance services of up to three hours including the 1632 Middlesbrough-Carlisle service (nearly 110 miles); they had also been used on services between Blackpool North and Chester via Stockport, which ceased to operate in December 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{railways}} {{were closed}} during the Beeching {{era of the}} early 1960s when <b>branch-line</b> passenger <b>services</b> suffered widespread disruption, leaving the town without a link to central Nottingham and nearby Mansfield. The railway tracks were re-opened to passengers in the 1990s {{as part of the}} Robin Hood Line, providing links to other North Nottinghamshire towns and to Nottingham where a transport interchange allows transfer to the trams of Nottingham Express Transit system.|$|R
5000|$|Construction was {{underway}} prior to 1891 {{with the line}} opening on 3 October 1892 and its main purpose was for the transport of wheat. Railway ballast was also carried along this line for use on the NSW rail network out of the 'Hurricane Hill' quarry siding. Passenger services ceased in 1975, {{a time when the}} widespread closure of country <b>branch-line</b> passenger <b>services</b> occurred. [...] The section from Corowa to Brocklesby was decommissioned in January 1989; the last train (An XPT set known as 'The Federation Flyer') ran on that section on Australia Day 1988. The section from Brocklesby to Culcairn was decommissioned in December 1991.|$|R
