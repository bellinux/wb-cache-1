[...] Babe has got away with many a manipulative scheme over the years, but her treatment of lovely Les and Pam is just one step too far. Because we are very much Team Coker over here, we'd like to see Aunt Babe brought down a peg or two. And soon." ...|$|E

A Government {{official}} told AFP that [...] "Myanmar will convey its condolences over the demise of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il" [...] adding [...] "e do not know much about his successor, his son. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> things can change in his term, especially their economic policy. The misunderstanding {{with the international community}} over the relationship between Myanmar and North Korea lately has been removed".|$|E
2500|$|Frick {{announced}} on April 30, 1892 {{that he would}} bargain for 29 more days. If no contract was reached, Carnegie Steel would cease to recognize the union. Carnegie formally approved Frick's tactics on May 4. [...] Then [...] Frick offered a slightly better wage scale and advised the Superintendent to tell the workers, [...] "We do not care whether a man belongs to a union or not, nor do we wish to interfere. He may belong to as many unions or organizations as he chooses, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> our employees at Homestead Steel Works would fare much better working under the system in vogue at Edgar Thomson and Duquesne." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The censor, the Lord Chamberlain, {{hastened to}} see the show, and demanded changes. After an {{uncertain}} start, the revue was a huge success; the song [...] "We don't want to lose you, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> you ought to go", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser. Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matinée attended by Queen Alexandra. It {{was the first of}} many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film début, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.|$|E

60|$|Hendry {{said that}} this was only reasonable, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> could <b>think</b> of no subject at the moment, so we only stared at Tammas, and waited.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tis {{not that}} we have unforetold [...] The drop behind; We feel the new must oust the old [...] In every kind; <b>But</b> yet <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> must <b>we,</b> must WE, [...] Too, drop behind? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{of course}} was joking. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> did <b>think</b> the {{marriage}} would come off last June, and as we were in Paris in April the order was given. Don't you tell anybody about that." ...|$|R

6000|$|Madame de Cintre {{looked at}} him a moment. [...] "What can she have said to you? She is an {{excellent}} creature, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> her rather dismal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I can {{understand}}, lad. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> must <b>think</b> of something," [...] {{and he sat}} for {{a minute}} or two in silence. Then he said suddenly, [...] "Do you understand the management of a boat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The tracks {{show that}} they went up the hill. Most likely they will have gone to Toungoo, if they have gone to any town at all; <b>but</b> indeed, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> they have taken the prisoners to get a reward for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, Signore. This {{happens to}} some of us daily; <b>but</b> then <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it wiser to swim to the boat than to sink. Old Antonio had an arm in youth to carry him from the quay to the Lido." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly, exactly; we {{all feel}} that. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that you,--if I were to say take too much upon yourself, I should say, perhaps, more than we mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's nothin' we {{can trace}} 'ome to 'im {{in so many}} words, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> he might 'ave saved us the font business. Now, in regard to that votin' business--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle George," [...] said Rollo, [...] "we {{have found}} {{out that there are}} a good many {{excellent}} hotels in Glasgow, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we had better go to the Queen's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here comes your man," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to a little boat which was approaching us. [...] "We told him we'd look out for you, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> didn't <b>think</b> you'd come smashing into us like this." ...|$|R

5000|$|James Reynolds, RSPB Head of Media and Communications said: [...] "We've been simply felling {{trees and}} trying to create dead wood {{habitats}} in that way before, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>think</b> it allowed the process to get going quickly enough" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's like us all,' said Byrne whimsically. 'We're all penned {{out on a}} wet evening, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> if only {{we could}} get where someone else is, it would be deliciously cosy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not often,' he said, 'Martin, that {{my daughters}} and I desert our quiet home {{to pursue the}} giddy round of pleasures that {{revolves}} abroad. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of doing so to-day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he doesn't," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Halleck. [...] "It {{has been}} a great cross to his father and me. He is a good boy; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> the truth is in our church!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> must <b>think</b> of {{something}}, Adolphe--think, man, think--and you, Pierre, think; if {{you were}} in a sinking ship, and you wanted something which would hide you from the eyes of people a hundred yards away, what would you take?" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{there are}} two planes of being and {{consciousness}} and two modes of relation and of function. We will call the lower plane the sensual, the upper the spiritual. The terms may be unwise, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> can <b>think</b> of no other.|$|R
50|$|Personally <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that Raddon’s {{support of}} the {{campaign}} was wrongheaded and donating to the campaign, {{given the nature of}} his job, was naive <b>but</b> <b>we</b> also <b>think</b> that the real issue is how his personal views affected or didn’t affect the films that he chose for the festival. In fact, by all accounts it’s been the very model of inclusion and open-mindedness under his stewardship.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} they reached the drawing-room, he had {{recovered}} himself so as to come forward in a very suitable, simple manner, and Mary said, at once, 'Louis, thank you; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it would be better not--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (3) Shelley (1) The World's Great Age from Hellas; we {{are both}} dead on. After that you have, of course, The West Wind thing. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> (1) would maybe be enough; {{no more than two}} any way.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{expect to}} work for him, yes. But nothing has been settled as yet," [...] {{answered}} Nappy. [...] "He has offered us thirty dollars a week, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we can get more than that elsewhere," [...] he added loftily.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, mother, Abraham {{may have}} been a holy person, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> should <b>think</b> him a mean old thing nowadays, almost as mean as Sarah. You know they were most of them mean, so what is the use of pretending they were not?" ...|$|R
