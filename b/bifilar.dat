50|$|A <b>bifilar</b> coil is an {{electromagnetic}} coil that contains two closely spaced, parallel windings.

5000|$|When {{used in a}} {{switching}} transformer, one winding of the <b>bifilar</b> coil {{is used as a}} {{means of}} removing the energy stored in the stray magnetic flux which fails to link the primary coil to the secondary coil of the transformer. Because of their proximity, the wires of the <b>bifilar</b> coil both [...] "see" [...] the same stray magnetic flux. One wire is clamped to ground usually by a diode so that when the other [...] "primary" [...] wire of the <b>bifilar</b> coil no longer has a voltage applied across it by the switching transistor, the stray magnetic flux generates a current in the clamping coil with the primary side voltage appearing across it, causing an equal voltage to appear across the primary winding. If this clamping coil was not used, the stray magnetic flux would attempt to force a current to flow through the primary wire. Since the primary wire is switched off and the switching transistor is in a high resistance state, the high voltage which would appear on the semiconductor switching transistor would exceed its electrical breakdown or even damage it.|$|E

5000|$|Ayrton-Perry winding {{is a type}} of <b>bifilar</b> {{winding pattern}} used in winding wire on forms to make {{electronic}} components.

50|$|<b>Bifilar</b> coil - a coil wound {{with two}} parallel, closely spaced strands. If AC {{currents}} are passed through {{it in the}} same direction, the magnetic fluxes will add, but if equal currents in opposite directions pass through the windings the opposite fluxes will cancel, resulting in zero flux in the core. So no voltage will be induced in a third winding on the core. These are used in instruments and in devices like Ground Fault Interrupters. They are also used in low inductance wirewound resistors for use at RF frequencies.|$|E

5000|$|A {{different}} type of <b>bifilar</b> coil is used in some relay windings and transformers used for a switched-mode power supply to suppress back-emf. In this case, the two wire coils are closely spaced and wound in parallel but are electrically isolated from each other. The primary coil is driven to operate the relay, and the secondary coil is short-circuited inside the case. When the current through the primary is interrupted, as happens when the relay is switched off, most of the magnetic energy is intercepted by the secondary coil which converts it to heat in its internal resistance. This {{is only one of}} several methods of absorbing the energy from the primary coil before it can damage the device (usually a vulnerable semiconductor) that drives the relay. The main disadvantage of this method is that it greatly increases the switching time of the relay.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{examples}} of this system were the front-wheel drive conversions of horse-drawn cabs by Louis Antoine Krieger in Paris in the 1890s. The Krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with {{a second set of}} parallel windings (<b>bifilar</b> coil) for regenerative braking. In England, the Raworth system of [...] "regenerative control" [...] was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s, since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by A. Raworth of Leeds in some detail. These included tramway systems at Devonport (1903), Rawtenstall, Birmingham, Crystal Palace-Croydon (1906), and many others. Slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients, the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers. Following a serious accident at Rawtenstall, an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911; the regenerative braking system was reintroduced 20 years later.|$|E

The design of antenna system of the radio {{telescope is}} a critical issue because of the demand of wide bandwidth, high gain, directional beam, and circular polarization. Metsähovi radio observatory has proposed a project named Metsähovi compact array to build four radio telescopes {{in order to create}} new research platform in different areas, such as radio astronomy, solar research, and space physics. In this master thesis work, a wide band feed for the reflector antenna of the proposed radio telescope is analyzed and designed. Initially several solutions are studied and analyzed. Based on these studies, a two arm conical log spiral antenna (CLSA) is designed and constructed in CST. At first, a theoretical model of CLSA is developed. Further, the design equations are reformulated to simulate the model in CST. The simulation results shows good agreement with the theoretical model. Moreover, the antenna is also simulated with the <b>bifilar</b> lines to have an practical feeding system of the antenna. In this case the results shows poor performance due to the significant radiation coming out from the <b>bifilar</b> lines which is overlapping with the antenna radiation. To avoid this radiation, a hollow metal is introduced which covers the <b>bifilar</b> lines to block the radiation coming out from the <b>bifilar</b> lines. The antenna performance with <b>bifilar</b> lines satisfies most of the requirements that has set up for this work. Besides, a mechanical construction of the antenna is presented to protect the antenna from the outside environment...|$|E
