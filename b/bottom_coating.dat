40|$|Abstract. To obtain high-entropy alloys (HEAS) coating with {{excellent}} properties on Q 235 steel, {{a kind of}} HEAS powders was designed. The HEAS coating was prepared uniformly on Q 235 steel by laser cladding. By means of OM, XRD and microhardness tester, the microstructure and properties of the high-entropy alloy layer were investigated. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} phases in the high-entropy alloy coating is mainly MoFeCrTiW with simple BCC, whose lattice parameter is a- 3. 1256 Å. The microstructure in the coating is mainly cellular crystal, on which dispersion precipitates exist. And in the near bottom of the coating, there is few precipitates, in the middle part of coating, the precipitates are larger than that of <b>bottom</b> <b>coating,</b> while in near top of coating, dispersion precipitates become largest. The maximum microhardness value of coating reaches 800 HV 0. 98...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexible}} knitted polyester fabric {{was used}} as a base material and a three-layer composite coating was applied to the structure material by using ferrite,silicon carbide,and graphite absorbing materials,and the composites were prepared with different coating thickness. The influences of the thickness of the bottom layer,the middle layer,and the surface layer coating on permittivity's the real part,the imaginary part and loss tangent were discussed. The results show that the dielectric properties of the composite material are sound at low frequencies. The thickness of the coating has a clear influence on the permittivity's real part,the imaginary part and the loss tangent of the composite material. When the thickness of the <b>bottom</b> <b>coating</b> layer is 0. 5 mm,the thickness of the middle coating layer is 0. 3 mm,and the thickness of the surface coating layer is 0. 3 mm,the permittivity's real part,imaginary part,and loss tangent of the ferrite/silicon carbide/graphite coating composite material reaches the maximum value...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of coating layer characteristics on the dynamic permeability and printing of ink-jet paper, coating was prepared by the precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) and white latex used as <b>bottom</b> <b>coating</b> (recipe label:A,B),and coating formula was made by silica (SiO 2) and polyvinyl alcohol used as surface coating (recipe label:a,b,c). Then paper were coated respectively on single bottom, single surface and multilayer. Then the dynamic permeability and printing of ink-jet paper were analyzed systematically. The results showed that whether single layer or multilayer, the values of Ct, Ci were minimum when the ration of pigment and adhesive was 70 : 30, because the hole diameter of the coating layer was smallest, and the absorption was strongest, so the dynamic permeability was best, {{and the ability of}} ink absorption was best, color density and tone reproducibility were best. It concluded that when the proportion of SiO 2 and PVA was 70 : 30, the dynamic permeability and printing ability of ink-jet paper were relative better...|$|E

40|$|Due to a {{manufacturing}} issue {{within the company}} the {{lack of knowledge of}} a key material is highlighted. Research into the material is conducted under seal testing and mechanical properties. The material is multilayered, with aluminium foil as its core plus is top coated and has a sealant layer as its <b>bottom</b> <b>coating.</b> Background literary review commences with a chronological assessment of packaging down through the ages and culminates with details on multilayered materials, concentrating on the type of material being researched. A test plan details the research requirements. Seal testing consists of burst and peel testing of the material in its final package configuration and utilises two blister package sizes. A test on the variation of the actual burst tester itself is also undertaken. The mechanical properties include basic measurement analysis, tensile testing and puncture resistance. These tests are conducted where appropriate on two versions of the multilayered material whose only difference is the thickness of the aluminium foil. All results are analysed using a mixture of statistical as well as graphical techniques. Discussion on the results includes the statistics and leads to a number of conclusions on what effects seal strength, which blister produces the easier peel and where cost savings can be made with the current configuration. The conclusions also highlight further work that may lead to future cost savings by changing to different configurations...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} the {{combined}} nanocomposite coatings (Ti-N-Si /WC-Co-Cr and Ti-N-Si/ (Cr 3 C 2 Ni) 75 -(NiCr) 25) of 160 - 320 μm thickness were produced using two deposition techniques: the cumulative-detonation and the vacuum-arc deposition with the high-frequency discharge. This gives the possibility (using the combined coatings) to restore the size of worn areas of the tools and demonstrate the high corrosion and wear resistance, to increase the hardness, modulus of elasticity, and plasticity index. Composition of the top coating varied from Ti = 60 at. %, N = 30 at. %, and Si = 10 at. % to Ti = 75 at. %, N = 20 at. %, and Si = 5 at. %. In the first series of coatings the following phases were obtained: (Ti;Si) and TiN in thin top coating and WC and W 2 C in thick <b>bottom</b> <b>coating.</b> The second series gives (Ti;Si) N and TiN in top coating; Cr 3 Ni 2 and pure Cr in bottom coating; and small amount of Ti 19 O 17 in the transition region between thin and thick coatings. For the first series the grain size achieved 25 nm at the hardness of 38 GPa. For the second series the grain size was 15 nm at the hardness of 42 GРa ± 4 GPa. It is shown that the corrosion resistance in salt solution and acid media increases with the wear decrease {{as a result of}} the cylinder friction over the surface of combined coating...|$|E

50|$|Trefonas {{has also}} been a leader in the {{development}} of <b>Bottom</b> Antireflective <b>Coating</b> (BARC) and Developable <b>Bottom</b> Antireflective <b>Coating</b> (DBARC) Technology. BARC and DBARC technology minimize the reflection of light from the substrate when developing the photomask. Light that is used to develop the photomask can reflect back from the substrate and compromise feature contrast. Controlling interference from reflected light results in the etching of a sharper line with less variability. DBARC uses anti-reflective coatings on the substrate that can be removed from the substrate as the novolak resin is dissolved off after photoimaging.|$|R
