500|$|Manson {{confirmed}} {{during his}} {{appearance at the}} 2010 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in April that the band had recorded 13 songs, and also {{expressed an interest in}} releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – guitarist for Twiggy's side-project Goon Moon – joined the band in July, and in October Twiggy described the upcoming album as being [...] "almost done", saying: [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal".|$|E
500|$|Another {{cultural}} reference {{appeared in}} a scene when Emma hears Leroy (who is actually Grumpy) whistling Whistle While You Work (the song used in the 1937 film version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), indicating its acknowledged ties to Disney, whose subsidiary ABC Studios {{also happens to be}} the production company behind Once Upon a Time, since Disney has allowed them access to their fairy tale characters and properties for use in the series. [...] "They've given us license," [...] Kitsis said. [...] "I could be wrong, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the first time anyone's shown Snow White with a sword, or pregnant." [...] Other Disney references include the blue star candle Emma wishes on, nodding to the scene in the 1940 film version of Pinocchio where Pinocchio wishes on a blue star and his wish is granted by the Blue Fairy (both of whom also make a brief appearance alongside Jiminy Cricket in this episode).|$|E
2500|$|Healthy in Paranoid Times was {{met with}} mixed reviews. It was loved and hated by many critics who either called it the band's best work to date or their weakest. It was also called [...] "their most sonically mature album to date." [...] and their best album since Clumsy by Circle 6 Magazine. At the time, the band praised their own efforts on the album. Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} what we heard in our heads and got on (record). For us this is the most complete record, start to finish. Some of the other records had awesome moments, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> as close as we feel we have gotten to getting a whole record exactly the way we wanted it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon parting with Interscope, Manson said [...] "a {{lot of the}} {{creative}} control on which my hands were tied [...] ", while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album. At the beginning of 2010, Vrenna {{said that they were}} [...] "talking and coming up with concepts" [...] for their upcoming studio album. Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal". That April, Manson expressed interest in releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – bassist for Twiggy and Masters of Reality vocalist Chris Goss' project Goon Moon – joined the band in July. By October, Twiggy described the album as being [...] "almost done", and opined that [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] The following month, it was announced that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over their artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recoups costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution.|$|E

Our only course, so far as I can see, is to wait till nightfall; and then, if these fellows still stick here, get into the path again, and follow it up till we come to some path going the other way. Then it will be a pure {{question}} of luck whether we hit upon the enemy, or not. If we do, of course we must fight till the last, keeping the last shot in our revolvers for ourselves. I have no intention of falling into their hands alive, and going through terrible tortures before I am put to death." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bassist Alex Webster said [...] "I think it's {{turning out}} to be kind of a dark-{{sounding}} album. Which, you know, it's a death metal album, so, of course, it should be kind of dark and eerie sounding anyway, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> one a little more than normal. That was kind of the direction the songwriting went in." ...|$|R

I repeat that I think it possible to put the Catholic Question as it now stands in a light which the most zealous of their supporters in this country cannot but consider as fair, while {{the result would be}} that the Question should not be granted at all under such guarantees; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> scarce to be done by inflaming the topic with all mutual virulence of polemical discussion." ...|$|E

The daughter and heiress of old Etienne de Barbérie has left her abode, and we have reason to think that she has been deluded so far as to come hither. Faith and correspondence! Master Seadrift; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> exceeding the compass of even a trader in contraband! I can make allowances for some errors in an account; but women can be exported and imported without duty, and when and where one pleases, and therefore the less necessity for running them out of their old uncle's habitation, in so secret a manner." ...|$|E

[...] "They're going to start some sort of a new illustrated magazine, and they've got me in for their art department. I'm not fit for it; I'd like to run away. Don't you want to advise me a little, Mrs. Leighton?

60|$|The {{problem of}} {{inducing}} the peasants {{to feed the}} towns is one which Russia shares with Central Europe, and from what one hears Russia has been less unsuccessful than some other countries in dealing with this problem. For the Soviet Government, the problem is mainly concentrated in Moscow and Petrograd; the other towns are not very large, and are mostly in the centre of rich agricultural districts. It is true that in the North even the rural population normally depends upon food from more southerly districts; but the northern population is small. It is commonly said {{that the problem of}} feeding Moscow and Petrograd is a transport problem, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only partially true. There is, of course, a grave deficiency of rolling-stock, especially of locomotives in good repair. But Moscow is surrounded by very good land. In the course of a day's motoring in the neighbourhood, I saw enough cows to supply milk to the whole child population of Moscow, although what I had come to see was children's sanatoria, not farms. All kinds of food can be bought in the market at high prices. I travelled over a considerable extent of Russian railways, and saw a fair number of goods trains. For all these reasons, I feel convinced that the share of the transport problem in the food difficulties has been exaggerated. Of course transport plays a larger part in the shortage in Petrograd than in Moscow, because food comes mainly from south of Moscow. In Petrograd, most of the people one sees in the streets show obvious signs of under-feeding. In Moscow, the visible signs are much less frequent, but {{there is no doubt that}} under-feeding, though not actual starvation, is nearly universal.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Roman of Ricky.Org said: [...] "Once Upon a Time {{has dealt}} with LGBT romance before, but never with as much depth as we get here with “Ruby Slippers”. While you could make the {{argument}} that the show should be focusing more on the Hades story at this late stage of the season rather than a one-off story about Ruby's romance with Dorothy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> episode illustrates why not every one-off story has to feel like filler.|$|R

5000|$|The track [...] "Orange Color Queen" [...] is a {{love song}} written for Segall's girlfriend Denée. Upon the album's announcement, Segall noted: [...] "I've written her many songs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> my favorite. I travel {{around the world for}} a living and have {{developed}} a slight fear of flying. She's {{one of the things that}} makes it better for me to travel. Especially when she is with me. She has orange hair, and is my orange color queen. I rarely write songs like this, because it is so easy to sound disingenuous, but I think this one is pretty good." ...|$|E

Bay was introduced by former Republican Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N) and Senate Energy Committee member Martin Heinrich (D-NM). The former Energy Chairman testified, [...] "The job that he is seeking demands somebody just like him," [...] Domenici said. [...] "And obviously I would urge that this Committee support him.

50|$|While not {{inclined}} to openly criticise other artists, Logsdail did, in his memoirs, relate a story concerning Walter Sickert.

In an interview with Seattle Weekly, Onry Ozzborn said: [...] "Of the albums we've done in the past, we've never had a whole project that's straight-ahead hip-hop ... People always say our stuff is dark, weird, bugged-out, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> one will catch people by surprise. Maker's beats in general made us write different.
