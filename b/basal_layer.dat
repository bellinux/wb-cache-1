25|$|Papillomaviruses {{are usually}} {{considered}} as highly host- and tissue-tropic, and {{are thought to}} rarely be transmitted between species. Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the <b>basal</b> <b>layer</b> of the body surface tissues. All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface, typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals, anus, mouth, or airways. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet, and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands, where they may cause warts. Additionally, there are descriptions {{of the presence of}} papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.|$|E

25|$|HPV {{associated}} cancers {{are caused}} by high-risk strains of HPV, mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18. HPV is a small non-enveloped DNA virus of the papillomavirus family. Its genome encodes the early (E) oncoproteins E5, E6 and E7 and the late (L) capsid proteins L1 and L2. The virus gains access to the mucosa through microlesions, where it infects the <b>basal</b> <b>layer</b> of cells, which are still able to proliferate. While the virus does not replicate in these cells, expression of its early genes stimulates proliferation and lateral expansion of the basal cells. As this moves the virus particles into the overlying suprabasal layers, late viral gene expression occurs, enabling replication of the circular viral genome (see figure) and structural proteins. As these are pushed into the most superficial mucosal layers, complete viral particles are assembled and released.|$|E
25|$|The E2 protein {{serves as}} a master {{transcriptional}} regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long control region. The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain. E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral origin of replication. E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as Bromodomain-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes. This tethering to the cell's nuclear matrix ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division. It is thought that E2 {{serves as a}} negative regulator of expression for the oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected <b>basal</b> <b>layer</b> keratinocytes. Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase {{the expression of the}} E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the <b>basal</b> <b>layer,</b> with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E
50|$|Stratified {{epithelium}} {{differs from}} simple epithelium {{in that it}} is multilayered. It is therefore found where body linings have to withstand mechanical or chemical insult such that layers can be abraded and lost without exposing subepithelial layers. Cells flatten as the layers become more apical, though in their most <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> the cells can be squamous, cuboidal or columnar.|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of the "erythroid/brain" type glucose transporter (GLUT 1) {{seems to be a}} feature of "barrier" tissues, at least in humans. Recently, we reported that GLUT 1 is highly expressed in the <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> of either "authentic" human epidermis or human epidermis reconstituted in culture and that its expression seems to be related to keratinocyte differentiation. In this paper we demonstrate that GLUT 1 is selectively expressed in the <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> of either eye conjunctiva epithelia or oral mucosa, reconstituted in culture starting from 1 - 2 mm 2 bioptic specimens of normal human tissue. GLUT 1 mRNA and protein levels are very high in conjunctiva and oral mucosa, 2 - 3 times higher than in epidermis reconstituted in culture. Taking into account its localization at the border of tissues not directly vascularized, but metabolically active, GLUT 1 could {{play an important role in}} controlling the entry of glucose into these firmly guarded tissues...|$|R

500|$|The Cretaceous Seaway {{was already}} {{retreating}} east {{and to the}} south {{by the time the}} locally [...] thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited. Its members represent various stages in this process. The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments. Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its <b>basal</b> <b>layer</b> of coal-rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway. While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and fluvial environments, one member, the Drip Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area. This formation erodes into almost unclimbable cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow-gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone. Shark teeth are found in the lower parts of the formation.|$|E
500|$|The layer {{covering}} the apothecia is about 30μm thick, {{and made of}} blackened (carbonized) cells measuring 5–6μm in diameter. At {{the base of the}} apothecia is carbonized supportive tissue about 5μm thick. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal cells) are unbranched, threadlike (filiform), gradually enlarge to a width of 2.0μm at the tip, and have granular contents. The thin-walled cylindrical to club-shaped asci (spore-bearing cells) are on a short stalk, and measure 70–105 by 8–10μm; each ascus contains eight ascospores. Ascospores, which measure 45–65 by 3.0μm, have a thin but distinct sheath, and lack septa (cross-walls). Pycnidia (which appear before the apothecia mature) are intraepidermal, [...] (having the shape of a double-convex lens) in cross section, 0.1–0.3mm in diameter, and covered with a dark brown layer of cells. The phialides are arranged in a <b>basal</b> <b>layer,</b> and borne on short conidiophores. They are slender and subulate (tapering to a point), lack a collarette, and measure 5–10 by 2–2.5μm. The conidia are colorless, rod-shaped, lack septa, and have dimensions of 4–5 by 1.0μm.|$|E
500|$|The {{prominent}} {{facial features}} include the [...] long black tufts on the ears, two black stripes from the forehead to the nose, the black {{outline of the}} mouth, the distinctive black facial markings, and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth. The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid, probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun's glare. The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages. The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings. The fur, soft, short and dense, grows coarser in the summer. The ground hairs (the <b>basal</b> <b>layer</b> of hair covering the coat) are denser in winter than in summer. The length of the guard hairs (the hair extending above the ground hairs) can be up to [...] long in winter, but shorten to [...] in summer. These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season, typically in October and November. The hindlegs are longer than the forelegs, so that the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.|$|E

40|$|Expression of glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) {{activity is}} high in tongue epithelium, but its exact function is still unknown, it may be related;either to the high proliferation rate of this tissue or to protection against oxidative stress. To elucidate its exact role, we localized quantitatively G 6 PD activity, protein and mRNA using image analysis in tongue epithelium of rat and rabbit, two species with different diets. Distribution patterns of G 6 PD activity were largely similar in rat and rabbit but the activities were twofold lower in rabbit. Activity was {{two to three times}} higher in upper cell layers of epithelium than in <b>basal</b> cell <b>layers,</b> whereas <b>basal</b> <b>layers,</b> where proliferation takes place, contained twice as much G 6 PD protein and 40 % more mRNA than upper layers. Our findings show that G 6 PD is synthetized mainly in <b>basal</b> cell <b>layers</b> of tongue epithelium and that it is posttranslationally activated when cells move to upper layers. Therefore, we conclude that the major function of G 6 PD activity in tongue epithelium is the formation of NADPH for protection against oxidative stress and that diet affects enzyme expression in this tissu...|$|R

2500|$|HPV oral {{infection}} {{precedes the}} development of HPV+OPC. Slight injuries in the mucous membrane serve as an entry gate for HPV, which thus works into the <b>basal</b> <b>layer</b> of the epithelium. [...] People testing positive for HPV type 16 virus (HPV16) oral infection have a 14 times increased risk of developing HPV+OPC. Immunosuppression {{seems to be an}} increased risk factor for HPV+OPC. Individuals with TGF-β1 genetic variations, specially T869C, {{are more likely to have}} HPV16+OPC. TGF-β1 plays an important role in controlling the immune system. In 1993 it was noted that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital cancers had a 4-fold increased risk of tonsillar squamous-cell carcinoma. Although evidence suggests that HPV16 is the main cause of OPC in humans not exposed to smoking and alcohol, the degree to which tobacco and/or alcohol use may contribute to increase the risk of HPV+OPC has not always been clear but it appears that both smoking and HPV infection are independent and additive risk factors for developing OPC. Human herpesvirus-8 infection can potentiate the effects of HPV-16.|$|E
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of adult tissue architecture is largely {{dependent on the}} function of cadherins. E-cadherin is expressed in most epithelia, {{although it may be}} co-expressed with P-cadherin in <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> of stratified epithelia. Adhesive function of cadherins relies on interactions with catenins. Many reports have characterized reduced expression of cadherins and catenins in tumors, including those of the gastrointestinal tract. This study aimed to characterize expression of E- and P-cadherins, and the catenins, in the progression of Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis and Western blotting were performed on paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tissue using antisera to the selected cadherins and catenins. The results of this study have shown inappropriate expression of cadherins and catenins in neoplastic Barrett's mucosa. There was a significant reduction of E-cadherin expression as the Barrett's metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence progressed (P < 0. 01). In contrast, P-cadherin, expressed in <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> of squamous esophagus, was usually absent from Barrett's and dysplasia but was expressed in 17 of 24 carcinomas, especially at the advancing tumor edge. Reduced expression of catenins was also seen, but in some specimens, immunoreactivity was observed in neoplastic nuclei, suggesting mediation of a nuclear function such as transcriptional regulation...|$|R

40|$|Lens epithelium–derived {{growth factor}} (LEDGF) /dense fine {{speckles}} 70 kDa protein (DFS 70) is a transcription cofactor that enhances growth and is overexpressed in various cancers. In the epidermis, LEDGF/DFS 70 localizes to {{the nucleus of}} keratinocytes (KCs) in the <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> and to the cytoplasm of cells in the upper layers. However, the biological and pathological relevance of LEDGF/DFS 70 in the epidermis is virtually unknown. Compared with normal epidermis, we detected strong nuclear staining of LEDGF/DFS 70 in both the spinous and <b>basal</b> <b>layers</b> of the epidermis of psoriatic skin. To investigate the roles of LEDGF/DFS 70 in the epidermis of psoriatic skin, we generated HaCaT cells that constitutively express enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) -LEDGF (EGFP-LEDGF-HaCaT) or EGFP alone (EGFP-HaCaT) as a control. EGFP-LEDGF-HaCaT cells had increased expression of IL- 6, which was attenuated by LEDGF-specific RNA interference and the p 38 -specific inhibitors SB- 239063 and SB- 203580. Furthermore, EGFP-LEDGF-HaCaT cells had increased expression of S 100 A 7 and S 100 A 9 and decreased expression of filaggrin. These findings are compatible with the expression pattern in psoriatic tissues. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that ectopic expression of LEDGF/DFS 70 in KCs could {{be involved in the}} pathology of psoriasis vulgaris...|$|R
40|$|The Murotomisaki Gabbroic Intrusion is a sill-like layered gabbro emplaced in {{sedimentary}} {{strata of}} Tertiary age in southwest Japan. The zoning (including resorption structures) and the compositional variations of plagioclase {{from throughout the}} intrusion were studied, and {{it was found that}} the zoning pattern may be classified into four types, which may well correlated with the hosting rock types, the mode of occurrences and their stratigraphic positions in the intrusion. The plagioclase zoning was successfully decoded, and the sequence of events that took place during the magmatic differentiation was deduced and further interpreted in the context of a stratified <b>basal</b> boundary <b>layer</b> slowly ascending in a solidifying magma body. It was shown that various layered structures – modal layering, podiform gabbroic pegmatites and anorthositic layers – observed in the Murotomisaki Gabbro were formed within the moving <b>basal</b> boundary <b>layer</b> by flushing of H 2 O-rich fluid and fractionated silicate melts from below. By the fluxing of hydrous fluids, plagioclase crystals preferentially dissolved and then melt fraction increased in the <b>basal</b> boundary <b>layer.</b> Under these circumstances, plagioclase-rich fractionated melts diapirically segregated from the crystal pile.

There was strong expression of alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta 1 subunits in the <b>basal</b> cell <b>layer</b> and for all the subunits studied the intensity of the staining decreased as cells moved towards the lumen. The heterodimer alpha v beta 3 was expressed weakly in the basal aspect of the <b>basal</b> cell <b>layer</b> only.
