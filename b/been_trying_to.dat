One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her. Acasta also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch guns on Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E

If this is the case, she wins back her power, but ironically, she destroys the thing she <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> control. The bullet accomplishes exactly what she <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid.|$|R

The fleet rehabilitation {{is part of}} this modernization; in 2009, fire alarms, fire sprinklers, yellow tactile platform edge domes, and cemented-mat {{rubber tiles}} were installed. The rough black tiles on the platform edge mark the location of the doorway of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the right place to board. All faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced.|$|E

Their appeals were dismissed, as was a direct appeal to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped. Vietnamese Buddhists reacted to the incident by contending that Diệm's men were planning to assassinate monks, while Madame Nhu repeated earlier claims that the US government had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> overthrow her brother-in-law.|$|E

Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E

The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.|$|E

Around this time, Shulgin began showing early signs of dementia, mostly severe loss of short-term memory. With progression of the dementia since 2010, his wife Ann Shulgin had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> sell part of their property to raise more money to cover care costs.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonians {{had been}} {{defeated}} in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC which left the Spartans in control of Argos.

The Romans had won the Second Macedonian War and it left them in control of Greek affairs. However, they decided not to occupy Greece but to garrison some cities for five years.

5|$|After Operation Maiglöckchen, the {{division}} shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans {{access to the}} security zone. Since its arrival in the zone {{the division}} had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's Zeleni kadar (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 {{season the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{suspended}} Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|E
