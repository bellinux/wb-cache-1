5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land. Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool {{in the heat of}} the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E
5|$|Squab pie is a mutton {{pie with}} a shortcrust pastry lid. It {{should be made}} {{with at least one}} layer of onions, {{followed}} by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops. The mixture should <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> water, though less than in some pies, covered with pastry and baked in the oven for about two hours.|$|E
5|$|The Griffins {{assigned}} spiritual {{values to}} Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover {{each of these}} in flowers. That way each hill would <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.|$|E
50|$|Law Number XLVII: Two-thirds of the Earth's surface <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> water. The other third <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> {{auditors}} from headquarters.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was of a}} mixed-material construction. The wings were made of a two-beam wooden frame, where the front <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> plywood {{and the rest of}} the wing <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fabric. The box-shaped fuselage had a fabric-covered steel frame. The tail section <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> lightweight metal sheets.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} vestibule and ramp {{of the station}} <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> granite tiles and have suspended ceilings. The entire station was designed in vibrant colors: the platforms <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> colored granite tiles and the walls have panels of circular red mosaic designs set on white tiles. The walls behind the panels <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a light blue mosaic.|$|R
5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts {{on the inside of}} her hull to <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> sheet iron to prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Broome, the maximum wind gust {{recorded}} was 153km/h (95mph), recorded at the Broome aerodrome, as well as recording 163.8mm (6.45in) of rain for the 24hours up to 9 a.m. WST (0100 UTC) on 20 April. Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the African Mahogany trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area which used to <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only banana plantation, almost all crops were completely lost, with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.|$|E
5000|$|Bar Riviera is 44 km {{long and}} has got 9 km of beaches. There {{are more than}} 20 beaches but Bar has got 2 beaches on the lakeside. The most famous beach in Bar is Sutomore beach. It's 1 km long and <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> sand. Canj beach is 1 km long and is a very popular {{location}} for tourists. The beach <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fine sand but the sea bottom <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> round rocky pebbles. Queen's beach is very near Canj {{but it can be}} only approached from sea. Red beach is specific because it <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> read round pebbles and view from it is outstanding. Zukotrlica beach is over 1 km long and it is near the city. It <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> white pebbles and in the background is little beautiful pine forest. Beach Utjeha is also called [...] "Olive Bay" [...] because there are hundreds of olives in the background. It <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> pebbles and <b>is</b> very clear. On the lake there are two beaches: Pjesacac and Murici. They <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> pebbles. The view from there on the Skadar Lake is amazing.|$|R
50|$|Currently, the {{mausoleum}} is under reconstruction. More than 10,000 sq. meters of its territory <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> asphalt and a 4,000,400 linear meter territory <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> colorful sidewalk tiles.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the rainy}} season, the sky <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> clouds and black clouds <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> clouds. In {{the rest of}} the year, the sky is dry with clear or {{slightly}} cloudy clouds ...|$|R
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
50|$|The {{side walls}} of sanctum sanctorim where heavily {{decorated}} with large brass sheets with statutes of gods and goddess, while the roof <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> copper sheets, while the entrances of sanctum sanctorium <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> gold sheets.|$|R
50|$|It {{is made of}} {{a hollow}} wooden trunk covered at both sides with animal skin. The left side <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a thicker skin {{producing}} flat sound whereas the right side <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> thinner skin producing sharper sound.|$|R
50|$|The central {{bridge is}} partly built from Glinica limestone. Other parts are built from concrete. The balustrades with 642 balusters {{are made of}} {{artificial}} concrete. The platform <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> granite blocks laid in 2010. Previously, it <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> asphalt.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} cacti {{fall into}} only two genera, Pereskia and Maihuenia, and are rather different, which means any description of cacti {{as a whole}} must frequently make exceptions for them. Pereskia species superficially resemble other tropical forest trees. When mature, they have woody stems that may <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> bark and long-lasting leaves that provide the main means of photosynthesis. Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above the points of attachment of the sepals and petals), and areoles that produce further leaves. The two species of Maihuenia have small, globe-shaped bodies with prominent leaves at the top.|$|E
5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who {{could not afford to}} maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
50|$|The islands <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> tundra vegetation, shingle and ice. The sea {{around these}} Islands <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fast {{ice in the}} winter and the climate is severe. The {{surrounding}} sea is obstructed by pack ice even in the summer.|$|R
5000|$|Roofs in Scandinavia have {{probably}} <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> birch bark and sod since prehistory. During the Viking and Middle Ages most houses had sod roofs. [...] Churches and other buildings <b>with</b> steeper roofs <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> boards, wood shingles, or lead.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{flanks of}} the San Martin Tuxtla and Santa Marta volcanoes <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> the neo{{tropical}} Sierra de los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest ecoregion, of the Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Biome. The lower portions <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> stunted pastures and grasslands.|$|R
5|$|The spores are broadly , smooth, colorless, amyloid (staining bluish to blue-black when {{treated with}} Melzer's reagent), {{thin-walled}}, and measure 8–9 by 5–6µm. The basidia are 40–60 by 10–12µm, club-shaped, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant, club-shaped, and measure 30–45 by 10–17µm. Their tips {{are covered with}} one or more, knob-like short excrescences that are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 12–21µm wide, cylindrical (but often somewhat inflated), smooth, and contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–7µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth, or can <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or pale brownish, and dextrinoid. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle is parallel, cylindrical, hyaline or brownish, and dextrinoid; it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–8µm wide, and similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 45–88 by 5–8µm, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or brownish, and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8–25µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} cap cuticle, the stem cuticle, the gill flesh, and at the basal septa of the basidia.|$|E
25|$|Many {{treatments}} {{have been}} tried for port-wine stains including freezing, surgery, radiation, and tattooing; port-wine stains can also <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> cosmetics.|$|E
25|$|Many Adena mounds were burial sites. The {{deceased}} {{were often}} cremated {{and placed in}} log tombs, which would <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> dirt, forming {{the basis of a}} conical mound.|$|E

40|$|Four {{patients}} with five wounds {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with three occlusive dressings: DuoDERM, Restore and Comfeel Ulcus; the dressings were left intact for 24 - 48 h. When the dressings were removed, it was found that wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore and Comfeel contained coagulated sanguinous material. Two wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Comfeel and Restore, respectively, <b>were</b> then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM, while one wound previously <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore. Either no clotting occurred under DuoDERM or clots may have resolved. Although these preliminary data suggest that DuoDERM gel may have fibrinolytic properties, more extensive and controlled studies are needed to assess the characteristics of this dressing...|$|R
25|$|I {{have found}} the land good all along, the banks being flooded in some places. The greater part of the banks <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> cypress trees, which are very fine, tall thick, straight.
