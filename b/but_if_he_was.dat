25|$|When {{the monastic}} Elders {{living in the}} desert heard about Simeon, who had chosen a new and strange form of asceticism, they wanted to test him to {{determine}} whether his extreme feats were founded in humility or pride. They decided to order Simeon under obedience to {{come down from the}} pillar. They decided that if he disobeyed, they would forcibly drag him to the ground, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> willing to submit, they were to leave him on his pillar. St Simeon displayed complete obedience and humility, and the monks told him to stay where he was.|$|E
25|$|If a debtor {{were seized}} for debt, he could {{nominate}} as mancipium, or hostage {{to work off}} the debt, his wife, child, or slave. The creditor could only hold a wife or child three years as mancipium. If the mancipium died a natural death while in the creditor's possession, no claim could lie against the latter; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{the cause of death}} by cruelty, he had to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.|$|E

25|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eager {{in his own}} defence he was no less so in that of others. In 1721 {{a drunken}} nobleman reeled on to {{the stage of the}} theatre and {{assaulted}} the manager, Rich, whose life was saved by Quin's prompt armed interference. This resulted in a riot, and thereafter a guard was stationed in all theatres. In 1732 Quin appeared at Covent Garden, returning to Drury Lane from 1734 to 1741, and in 1742 was again at Covent Garden, where he remained until the close of his career. On 14 November 1746 Quin played Horatio and Garrick Lothario to the Calista of Mrs Cibber in Rose's Fair Penitent. The applause of the audience was so great as to disconcert if not actually to alarm the two actors.|$|E
25|$|Majapahit people, men and women, favoured their head. If {{someone was}} touched on his head, {{or if there}} is a {{misunderstanding}} or argument when drunk, they will instantly draw their knives and stab each other. When the one being stabbed was wounded and dead, the murderer will flee and hide for three days, then he will not lose his life. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> caught during the fight, he will instantly stabbed to death (execution by stabbing). The country of Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men on his hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them, and then stabbed the offender in the back where there is a floating rib which resulted in instant death. Judicial executions of this kind were frequent.|$|E
25|$|At any rate, {{the king}} had {{certainly}} adopted a more hostile attitude towards Alexander. In 1428, James travelled into the north of Scotland both to assert his authority in Ross and to bring order to the north. James requested a meeting with Alexander, and in August Alexander travelled in good faith to meet James at Inverness, where James was holding court. James however, in an act typical of his kingship, imprisoned Alexander, his mother Mariota (by whose lineage Alexander claimed Ross) and around fifty of his followers, including his uncle and heir-designate John Mór, in the tower of Inverness Castle. Included among the other prisoners were Alexander's most important Ross allies; men such as Aonghas Dubh MacAoidh, {{the chief of the}} MacKays of Strathnaver, a man who was reputed to have a warband 4000 strong; a prisoner also was Aonghas' son Niall Óg, the husband of the daughter of the head of the Foulis Munro kindred of Easter Ross, one of Ross' most important families. The head of the Munros himself, George Munro, may also have been arrested, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> he was quickly released. William Leslie and John de Ross of Balnagown, two important landowners and kinsmen of Mariota, were also imprisoned, as were the heads of the Wester Ross Lochalsh MacMhathain (Matheson) and the Kintail MacChoinnich (MacKenzie) kindreds. Most of these men, including John Mór, seem to have been released within a short time, although James took a few back to the south with him.|$|E

500|$|Mills' {{management}} style {{was influenced by}} a number of managers he played under, including John Barnwell, Brian Clough, Alan Hinton, Howard Kendall, Brian Little, David Pleat, Russell Slade and Neil Warnock. He learned simplicity from Clough, saying: [...] "He never did complicate anything. Football is a simple game and Cloughie was no coach, he didn't confuse us with sessions straight out of the manual". Like Clough, Mills has been praised for his man management skills and Daren Fulford, his reserve-team manager at Tamworth, said: [...] "If he felt you had made a mistake, he would give you a rollicking <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pleased with you he would always give kind words". Fulford also commented on Mills' thoroughness, saying he wanted information on each players' performances after the reserves played.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 2 September, the mutineers messaged the Chilean {{government}} {{with a more}} [...] "sophisticated" [...] list of twelve demands. Meanwhile, further south, junior members of the navy in the main naval base of Talcahuano joined the mutiny, taking several vessels in the process. Several of these sailed north to join the other rebels, while two cruisers, a few destroyers and submarines remained to guard the base. Other bases joined the now-full-fledged rebellion as well, including the Second Air Group based in Quintero. With so many rebels appearing, it was feared by many that the plethora of unemployed workers would join. The government attempted to solicit aid from the United States {{in the form of}} military intervention or war materiel (including two submarines and bombs capable of penetrating the armor of Almirante Latorre), but they were rebuffed both publicly and privately. Acting Vice President Manuel Trucco now found himself in an undesirable position; he had to defeat the rebels before more units joined and bolstered their forces, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too harsh, there was a risk that the populace would think that his policies were too similar to the former dictator Ibáñez del Campo. Trucco decided on a path of reconciliation. He sent a naval admiral, Edgardo von Schroeders, to negotiate with the mutineers. They met on board Almirante Latorre, where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between sailors angry over their pay versus others with a more political agenda, tried to divide them along these lines and get them to surrender. However, a plea from the approaching southern fleet, asking for them to wait before any possible settlement, sealed the matter for the time being and von Schroders flew back to the capital.|$|E

Well if he was lucky he'd get away with a broken leg <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unlucky the truck behind coming up behind would hit him. But nobody bothered to pick up the bits they were left. You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right... Well you know you don't want him any more. He's fulfilled his job. And that's when Bill Usher [...] said that it had to stop because before long they'd be running out of bloody rebels to sit on the bonnet.|$|E

2500|$|Association with Rhodes. The epithet Rhodios or Rhodian {{indicates}} that Apollonius {{had some kind}} of association with the island of that name. The Lives and the Suda attest to his move there from Alexandria. They differ about whether he died in Rhodes or came back to Alexandria to take up the position of head of the Library. According to Vita A, he was a famous teacher in Rhodes, but it may have confused him with yet another Apollonius (Apollonius the Effeminate) who taught rhetoric there. In fact the epithet [...] "of Rhodes" [...] need not indicate any physical association with the island. It might simply reflect the fact that he once wrote a poem about Rhodes. According to Athenaeus, he was also called the [...] "Naucratite". Some modern scholars doubt that he was ever given that title <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> it may be because he composed a poem about the foundation of Naucratis.|$|E
