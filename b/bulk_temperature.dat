First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates {{from the top}} [...] "skin" [...] of the ocean, approximately the top 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the <b>bulk</b> <b>temperature</b> of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation.

40|$|Abstract: A {{multi-layer}} {{neural network}} (NN) {{was developed to}} analyse experimental boiling data obtained for five engine oils at <b>bulk</b> <b>temperatures</b> ranging from 40 to 150 ◦C and heat fluxes ranging from 30 to 400 kW/m 2. The inputs to the NN were the oil chemical composition (nine elements) along with the wall superheats for different oil <b>bulk</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the NN output was the corresponding heat fluxes. The developed NNmodel predicted boiling curves that are {{in close agreement with}} experimental data (R 2 ≈ 1). The NN was then trained on the experimental data of four of these oils and allowed to predict the boiling behaviour of the fifth. The NN, therefore, demonstrated its ability to predict the boiling characteristics of untested oils, provided their chemical compositions fall within the range of the training data. In addition, for oils with constituents outside the considered range, theNNwas able to predict their boiling characteristics at all <b>bulk</b> <b>temperatures</b> when trained on a sample of experimental measurement. The success of such a technique provides researchers and developers of oils with the thermal performance of oils (based on chemical constituents) without testing or with very limited measurements. This, as a result, has the advantages of saving experimental time and cost of oil testing...|$|R

The analysis, carried out for constant property fluids, considers a hydrodynamically developed laminar flow and neglects longitudinal conduction {{both in the}} fluid and in the plates. The solution for the temperature field involves eigenfunction expansions that can be solved in terms of Whittaker functions using standard symbolic algebra packages, leading to analytical expressions that provide the eigenvalues numerically. It is seen that the approximate solution obtained by retaining the first two modes in the eigenfunction expansion provides an accurate representation for the temperature away from the entrance regions, specially for long {{heat exchangers}}, thereby enabling simplified expressions for the wall and <b>bulk</b> <b>temperatures,</b> local heat-transfer rate, overall heat-transfer coefficient, and outlet <b>bulk</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The agreement between the numerical and theoretical results suggests {{the possibility of using}} the analytical solutions presented herein as benchmark problems for computational heat-transfer codes...|$|R

Avoiding the CHF is an engineering problem in heat transfer applications, such as nuclear reactors, where fuel plates must not be allowed to overheat. DNB may be avoided in practice by increasing the pressure of the fluid, increasing its flow rate, or by utilizing a lower <b>temperature</b> <b>bulk</b> fluid which has a higher CHF.

Due to the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, a bulk gas {{at a much lower}} temperature will still contain some particles at these much higher energies.
