5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> eventually withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform <b>Bill</b> <b>was</b> {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform <b>Bill</b> <b>was</b> brought forward. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{that the}} GNR would divert its Moorgate {{services}} over the City Widened Lines to run via the GN, the Met sought {{to take over}} the GN A <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> presented in 1912–13 to allow this with extensions to join the GN to the inner circle between Moorgate and Liverpool Street and to the Waterloo & City line. The takeover was authorised, but the new railway works were removed from the bill after opposition from City property owners. The following year, a <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> jointly presented by the Met and GNR with amended plans that would have also allowed a connection between the GN and GNR at Finsbury Park. Opposed, this time by the North London Railway, this <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|When {{a motion}} that a <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> taken into {{consideration}} has been carried and no amendment of the <b>Bill</b> <b>is</b> made, the Member-in-Charge may at once move that the <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> passed. If any amendment of the <b>Bill</b> <b>is</b> made, any member may object to any motion being made {{on the same day}} that the <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> passed and such objection shall prevail unless the Speaker allows the motion to be made. Where the objection prevails, a motion that the <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> passed may be brought forward on any future day. No amendments, not being merely verbal shall be made to any Bill after such a motion is moved.|$|R
50|$|In France, ministerial <b>bills</b> <b>are</b> called law {{projects}} and parliament's <b>bills</b> <b>are</b> called law proposals.|$|R
50|$|Where {{a motion}} that a <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> {{circulated}} {{for the purpose}} of eliciting opinion thereon is carried and the <b>Bill</b> <b>is</b> circulated in accordance with that direction and opinions are received thereon, the Member-in-Charge if he wishes to proceed with the Bill thereafter, shall move that the <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> referred to a Select Committee unless the Speaker allows a motion to be made that the <b>Bill</b> <b>be</b> taken into consideration.|$|R

5|$|On October 3, 1945, the <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Congressman Andrew J. May from Kentucky, {{the chairman of the}} House Military Affairs Committee, and in the Senate by Senator Edwin C. Johnson from Colorado, the ranking member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> known as the May-Johnson Bill for its sponsors. May immediately had the bill referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate Military Affairs Committee, the <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> held up by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.|$|E
5|$|The Hunting <b>Bill</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} {{as part of}} Labour’s 2001 general election manifesto pledge to hold a free vote on banning fox hunting and would make it illegal to hunt wild animals in England and Wales with dogs except in limited circumstances. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> passed by the House of Commons on 3 December 2002 but rejected by the House of Lords. It was reintroduced to, and passed by, the House of Commons on 9 September 2004, but was significantly amended by the House of Lords. The House of Commons rejected the amendments on 18 November and the <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> granted Royal Assent later that day {{through the use of}} the Parliament Acts. The Hunting Act was due to come into force on 18 February 2005.|$|E
50|$|Public <b>Bills</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} common type of Bill. In the Parliament's fourth session, 81 of the 86 {{proposed}} <b>Bills</b> <b>were</b> Public <b>Bills.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> a {{proposed}} law under consideration by a legislature. A <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> not law until {{passed by the}} legislature and, in most cases, approved by the executive, Privy Council and monarch by Royal Assent. Once a <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> enacted into law it is called an [...] "act" [...] or [...] "statute".|$|R
5|$|The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{part of a}} large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The <b>Bill</b> <b>was</b> finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{passed by}} the Lower House in October 2011 and the Upper House in November 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Introduction or First Reading. A <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> {{introduced}} or {{read the}} first time when the bill number, the name of the author, and the descriptive title of the <b>bill</b> <b>are</b> read {{on the floor of the}} house. The <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> then sent to the Office of State Publishing. No bill except the Budget <b>Bill</b> may <b>be</b> acted upon until 30 days have passed from the date of its introduction.|$|R

5|$|A <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the House did not vote on it. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade <b>Bill</b> <b>was</b> quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5000|$|Select Committee: The select {{committee}} consists of people {{not only from}} the parliaments, but also the people who could be affected by the <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> passed into law. This is to ensure equity and that the <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> fair for all. If the <b>Bill</b> <b>is</b> in favor, it will proceed to the third reading.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bills</b> <b>are</b> {{numbered}} {{within each}} session. For example, {{in the federal}} House of Commons each session's government <b>bills</b> <b>are</b> numbered from C-2 to C-200, and the numbering returns again to C-2 following a prorogation (<b>Bill</b> C-1 <b>is</b> a pro-forma <b>bill).</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 16, 2011, {{companion}} <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced by}} House and Senate Democrats to repeal DOMA. The <b>bills</b> <b>were</b> named the Respect for Marriage Act (RFMA).|$|R
5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
5|$|Dutton {{was born}} in Russell, Manitoba on July 23, 1897. His father, <b>Bill,</b> <b>was</b> a {{successful}} contractor who helped build Canada's transcontinental railway system, and the younger Dutton often helped his father at his work {{when he was a}} boy. He had at least two elder brothers, and a sister.|$|E
5|$|Her only {{unsuccessful}} <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{a measure}} to tighten the rules under which cigar bars could claim exemptions from Colorado's indoor smoking ban. After being killed in committee, the measure was revived in the Colorado Senate by Democrats, but was again unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|In the British/Westminster system, a <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> {{read the}} first time when it is introduced. This is {{accompanied}} by an order that the <b>bill</b> <b>be</b> printed and considered again. At the second reading the general merits of the <b>bill</b> <b>are</b> considered - it is out of order to criticise a bill at this stage for technical defects in drafting. After the second reading the <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> referred to a committee, which considers the bill line by line proposing amendments. The committee reports to the legislature, at which stage further amendments are proposed. Finally a third reading debate at which the <b>bill</b> as amended <b>is</b> considered in its entirety. In a bicameral legislature the process is repeated in the other house, before the <b>Bill</b> <b>is</b> submitted to the executive for approval.|$|R
5|$|In July 1944, {{before the}} Interim Committee was formed, Bush, Conant and Irvin Stewart had {{produced}} {{a proposal for}} legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted the proposals to the Interim Committee at its meeting on July 9, 1945. Harrison brought in two experienced lawyers, Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up the}} job of drafting the legislation. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, to operate facilities, to conduct research and to regulate all forms of nuclear energy. The Royall-Marbury <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. The <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> forwarded to the President in August. The Interim Committee met again on September 28 to discuss legislative strategy. The Royall-Marbury <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the United States Congress by the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Andrew J. May, and the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, Senator Edwin C. Johnson on October 3. It then became known as the May-Johnson bill.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, former Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon {{signed a}} new foreign {{investment}} law. The draft <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{prepared by the}} Ministry of Commerce and Industry in conjunction with government attorneys. Approved by the Cabinet, it establishes a secure legal framework for foreign investment in Mogadishu {{and elsewhere in the}} country.|$|E
5|$|In November 1912 a <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} {{that included}} a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks. The bill passed as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913, although the advent of World War I prevented work on the extension.|$|E
