40|$|Non-destructive {{evaluation}} {{measurements of}} longitudinal growth strain (LGS) and acoustic wave velocity (A WV) {{were collected on}} 22 -year-old Eucalyptus nitens trees from a plantation thinning trial in Tasmania. A total of 81 trees from five residual stocking treatments including an unthinned control were assessed. LGS was measured at breast height at four aspects per tree. Standing tree-A WV was determined at two opposite aspects per tree. Log-A WV was collected on the 5. 7 m-long bush-logs and on 162 lower and upper 2. 7 m-long sawlogs. Sawlogs from 41 trees with diameter over bark (DBHOB) under 43 cm were <b>back-sawn,</b> and those from 40 trees with DBHOB over 43 cm were quarter-sawn. Wood shrinkage and basic density were measured on 25 x 25 x 40 mm wood blocks cut from wood disks immediately above {{the first and second}} sawlogs of the <b>back-sawn</b> trees at heights of approximately 3 m and 6 m above ground. Three blocks were cut at each height, at radial distances 25...|$|E
40|$|Solid wood {{properties}} {{were measured}} on samples cut from two progeny trials of Eucalyptus globulus: a six-year-old trial of later generation controlled-pollinated progeny; and a 15 -year-old provenance-progeny trial of first generation open-pollinated natural stand collections. Both stands had been grown under fibre-production management without early thinning and pruning. Tree size, stem sweep, and branch score was assessed, {{a subset of}} trees felled (34 age- 6 and 253 age- 15 trees) and 1. 5 -metre-long mini-sawlogs were harvested from a height of two metres. <b>Back-sawn</b> and quarter-sawn boards were cut from the mini sawlogs with portable sawmills. Whilst the sample sizes were relatively small and thus estimates of variances and heritabilities somewhat dubious, we observed apparent exploitable genetic variation in most traits. Growth, branch score and spring in green quarter-sawn boards showed significant between-subrace and probably within-subrace genetic variation. Bark thickness showed only between-subrace variance, and stem sweep showed only within-subrace genetic variation. Wood colour may have a low heritability but only very low additive variance, and cup in backsawn boards appeared {{to have a high}} degree of additive variance but very low heritability. No genetic variation in taper was observed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of pre-treatment techniques to produce high quality <b>back-sawn</b> boards from regrowth messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit), which is very prone to collapse and checking. Saturated urea solution, one percent sodium hydroxide, four percent acetic acid, water, urea formaldehyde resin (UF), and polyvinyl acetate glue (PVA) were used. In Chapter 4, the experiment of chemical soaking pre-treatments showed that soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for up to 15 days caused almost double increase of boards' drying rate. However, this technique and soaking in acetic acid solution caused more collapse and checks. In Chapter 5 and 6, the surface coating experiment confirmed that coating with UF resin did not significantly improve the drying properties of the boards. In contrast, PVA coating prevented surface checking and considerably reduced edge checking and collapse. The check value of these P boards was only a quarter the check value of control boards. In Chapter 6, the pre-treatments trial proved that significant reductions of shrinkage and collapse were achieved mainly by urea soaking for eight weeks (SSW boards). Both tangential and radial shrinkages of S 8 W boards were {{less than half the}} shrinkages of control boards. The collapse free boards of S 8 W were almost double amount of that in control boards. However, this pretreatment caused more surface checks. One-day urea soaking followed by eight weeks close stacking (C treatment) reduced checking. The check free boards of C, W, and P were 38...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop an economically viable method of seasoning <b>back-sawn</b> native Tasmanian eucalypts and to reduce the seasoning time required for these timbers. The theory of unsteady state mass transfer based upon Fick's law of diffusion was used to study the drying process. The diffusion coefficients were measured directly by the diffusion cell method or deduced from a comparison of measured and calculated drying curves. The relationship between shrinkage of wood fibre and moisture concentration was obtained by slowly drying thin strips of wood and regularly measuring deformations. The effects of falling diffusivity and shrinkage with reducing moisture concentration were found to effectively cancel one-another {{in the case of the}} timbers tested during {{this investigation}}. Drying stresses in wood were studied using the theory of elasticity in anisotropic bodies. Airy stress functions were used when solving for stresses. For simplicity, sawn boards were approximated to orthotropic bodies and only boards cut with face-planes parallel/perpendicular to the principle material property directions were studied. Some elastic properties of native Tasmanian eucalypt timbers were measured on small sample populations and found to be similar to those of various North American hardwoods (with similar densities) reported by other authors. The approximate elastic properties of Tasmanian eucalypts were deduced from this comparison. The theories of mass transfer and stress analysis were combined to form a model describing the development of drying stresses. The wood was assumed to be linearly elastic and to be free of the effects of hysteresis and creep. The governing differential equations were solved by numerical methods. The model was used to assess the effectiveness of semi-permeable surface coatings in reducing drying stresses in timber. Tests on timber coated with animal glue (cologen) showed that checking (cracking) in Tasmanian eucalypts brought about by high drying stresses was reduced in severity or completely eliminated, depending upon the thickness of the coating...|$|E
