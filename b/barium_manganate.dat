5000|$|The manganate(VI) ion is a d1 ion and is {{tetrahedral}} with bond {{angles of}} approximately 109.5°. The Mn-O bond lengths in BaMnO4 and K2MnO4 are identical at 1.66 Å. In comparison, the Mn-O bond length in MnO4 2- {{is longer than}} in MnO4− of 1.56 Å and shorter than the Mn-O bond found in MnO2, 1.89 Å. <b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> is isomorphous with BaCrO4 and BaSO4. <b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> can appear as a dark blue or green to black crystals.

5000|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> oxidizes {{a number}} of {{functional}} groups efficiently and selectively: alcohols to carbonyls, diols to lactones, thiols to disulfides, aromatic amines to azo-compounds, hydroquinone to p-benzoquinone, benzylamine to benzaldehyde, etc.. [...] It does not oxidize saturated hydrocarbons, alkenes, unsaturated ketones, and tertiary amines. <b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> is a common substitute for MnO2.

5000|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula BaMnO4. It {{is used as}} an oxidant in organic chemistry. It belongs to a class of compounds known as manganates in which the manganese resides in a +6 oxidation state. Manganate should {{not to be confused}} with permanganate in which contains manganese(VII). <b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> is a powerful oxidant, popular in organic synthesis and can be used in a wide variety of oxidation reactions.|$|E
50|$|Another use for <b>barium</b> <b>manganate</b> {{was as a}} pigment {{for making}} the artist’s color {{manganese}} blue. It is no longer used for that purpose; instead, paint manufacturers substitute a synthetic manganese blue hue.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} is signaled by {{the color}} change from purple, characteristic of permanganate, to the green color of manganate. This reaction also shows that manganate(VII) can serve as an electron acceptor {{in addition to its}} usual role as an oxygen-transfer reagent. <b>Barium</b> <b>manganate,</b> BaMnO4, is generated by the reduction of KMnO4 with iodide in the presence of barium chloride. Just like BaSO4, BaMnO4 exhibits low solubility in virtually all solvents.|$|E

Irradiation at 150 °C in ethanol–acetic acid for 45 min results in dramatic improvements in yield over the corresponding manganese dioxide-mediated method and establishes a rapid route to triarylpyrimidines {{in order to}} investigate their photophysical properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 3 -hydroxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one- 2 -carboxaldehyde {{has been accomplished}} by selectively blocking the enolic hydroxyl group of (alpha) -hydroxy-maltol with p-nitrobenzyl bromide, followed by oxidation of the 2 -hydroxymethyl function with <b>barium</b> <b>manganate</b> to the aldehyde, and finally removal of the p-nitrobenzyl blocking group using a hydrobromic acid-acetic acid solution. 3 -Hydroxy- 4 H-pyran-one- 2 -carboxaldehyde has also been prepared by direct air oxidation, under aqueous basic conditions, of (alpha) -hydroxymaltol using a palladium-on-carbon catalyst. ^ The enolic hydroxyl group of (alpha) -hydroxymaltol has been selectively methylated with dimethyl sulfate in acetone. A study has been conducted in which Jones 2 ̆ 7 reagent, pyridinium dichromate and <b>barium</b> <b>manganate</b> were tested as oxidizing agents in the {{synthesis of}} 3 -methoxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one- 2 -carboxaldehyde from 2 -hydroxymethyl- 3 -methoxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one. <b>Barium</b> <b>manganate</b> {{has proven to be}} the reagent of choice for this transformation. ^ Two carboxylic acid derivatives have been synthesized in this series. 2 -Hydroxymethyl- 3 -benzyloxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one was oxidized directly to 2 -carboxy- 3 -benzyloxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one using an excess of Jones 2 ̆ 7 reagent in acetone. Oxidation of 3 -methoxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one- 2 -carboxaldehyde with silver oxide in aqueous base gave moderate yields of 2 -carboxy- 3 -methoxy- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one. ^ Kojic acid monomethyl ether has been reacted with several p-and m-substituted anilines, having substituents ranging from strong electron donating groups to strong electron withdrawing groups, in refluxing dilute hydrochloric acid, to give the corresponding N-aryl-pyridones in moderate to good yields. Reaction of the pyridones with concentrated hydrochloric acid gave pyridone hydrochloride salts. ^ An alternative method has been developed for the synthesis of 1 -phenyl- 2 -hydroxymethyl- 3 -methoxy- 4 -pyridone and 1 -(p-nitrophenyl) - 2 -hydroxymethyl- 3 -methoxy- 4 -pyridone by reacting kojic acid monomethyl ether with the appropriate aniline hydrochloride in water at reflux temperature for 24 hours.

40|$|Single phase <b>barium</b> <b>manganate</b> nanorods, nanoparticles, nanofibers and microparticles were {{prepared}} using composite hydroxide mediated (CHM) method, hydrothermal (HT) technique, electrospinning (ES) and solid state reaction (SSR) route respectively. Size and uniformity of BaMnO 3 nanorods were optimized against different reaction times and reaction temperatures. BaMnO 3 powders consisting of nanorods {{of an average}} diameter ~ 200 nm and length ~ 1 1. 5 Ã¬m, prepared at reaction temperature 200 Â°C and reaction time 48 hours, were chosen for electrical characterization. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) from 300 400 K and 20 Hz 2 MHz, revealed presence of non-ideal Debye type behaviour in BaMnO 3 samples and was attributed {{to the presence of}} heterogeneity in the sample. The heterogeneity was explained on the basis of â€œbrick layer modelâ€�. In BaMnO 3 nanorods sample, on the basis of extracted capacitance values, two electro-active regions were investigated i. e., dominant grain boundaries and sample-electrode interfaces. No indication from the bulk effect was observed. Experimental results were fitted using equivalent circuit model (RgbQgb) (ReQe). The ac and dc conduction mechanisms in BaMnO 3 pellets can be explained by correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model and Pooleâ€“Frenkel conduction mechanism respectively. While IS analysis of bulk BaMnO 3 sample revealed that different electro-active regions such as grain, grain boundary and sample-electrode interface exist that overlapped with each other in the applied frequency domain. These results were also modelled via a best fit equivalent circuit model (RgCg) (RgbQgb) (ReQe) and the response from different overlapped electro-active regions were separated. The ac conductivity obeys CBH model for bulk BaMnO 3 sample. Uptake of PEGylated BaMnO 3 NPs alone and loaded with photosensitizer (5 -ALA) were examined on Hep 2 c cell lines. It was observed that PEGylated BaMnO 3 NPs loaded with 5 -ALA has higher uptake as compared to 5 -ALA. The high uptake was attributed to large surface area of BaMnO 3 NPs. It was also observed that BaMnO 3 NPs are non-toxic when administrated to Hep 2 c cell lines. BaMnO 3 nanofibers were synthesized for the first time using ES technique. Effect of different polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) concentration on uniformity and homogeneity of nanofibers was investigated...|$|E
