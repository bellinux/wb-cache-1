5|$|Beginning in 1976, Bob Lewis, an {{environmental}} activist in Aspen, organized revegetation efforts on some {{sections of the}} pass near the road that were having serious erosion problems. He realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to address the many issues that remained. The Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was established in 1989. Its first project, coordinated with the Forest Service, CDOT and Pitkin County, was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead.|$|E
25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E
500|$|There are ten {{scheduled}} monuments in Coventry. In the United Kingdom, {{a scheduled}} monument is a [...] "nationally important" [...] archaeological site or historic building {{that has been}} given protection against unauthorised change by being placed on a list (or [...] "schedule") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. Monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. Scheduled monuments—sometimes referred to as scheduled ancient monuments—can also be protected through listed building procedures, and English Heritage considers listed building status to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> of protecting buildings and standing structures.

The pregnancy storyline drew criticism, with Tucker opining that it [...] "nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode" [...] and writing: [...] "there's got to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to ground the series in a serious plot-line that doesn't make you wish the pregnancy plot was all just a non-musical dream sequence."

2500|$|The median is a {{commonly}} used {{measure of the}} properties of a data set in statistics and probability theory. The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the [...] "average") {{is that it is}} not skewed so much by extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a [...] "typical" [...] value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets which vary greatly, a mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values.

(Aside from the difference in dynamic range within the DCT stage, this step is mathematically equivalent to subtracting 2048 from the DC coefficient after performing the transform– which may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to perform the operation on some architectures since it involves performing only one subtraction rather than 64 of them.) ...|$|E

He was exceptionally sharp at this trade, able to follow the written diagrams of the various pieces of furniture to make them precisely. He had his own innovative ideas and even devised a new method of hanging table leaves from their hinges, drawing a new concept that was followed thereafter.|$|E

60|$|For to me {{it seems}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> for people betimes to tell their {{children}} what cursed creatures they are, {{and how they are}} under the wrath of God by reason of original and actual sin; also to tell them the nature of God's wrath, and the duration of the misery; which if they conscientiously do, they would sooner teach their children to pray than they do. The way that men learn to pray, it is by conviction for sin; {{and this is the way}} to make our sweet babes do so too. But the other way, namely, to be busy in teaching children forms of prayer, before they know any thing else, it is the next way to make them cursed hypocrites, and to puff them up with pride. Teach therefore your children to know their wretched state and condition; tell them of hell-fire and their sins, of damnation, and salvation; the way to escape the one, and to enjoy the other, if you know it yourselves, and this will make tears run down your sweet babes' eyes, and hearty groans flow from their hearts; and then also you may tell them to whom they should pray, and through whom they should pray: you may tell them also of God's promises, and his former grace extended to sinners, according to the word.|$|E
