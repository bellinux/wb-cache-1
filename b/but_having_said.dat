5|$|Manning {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant {{for more than a}} quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum of Things, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, <b>but</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Tamarod's first statement, the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy {{announced}} {{its support for}} protest plans. [...] "Let August 14 be the day of rebellion against the ruling gang in Bahrain," [...] the movement said in a statement. The February 14 Youth Coalition also supported the protests and called for civil disobedience for 3 days. The youth group also told participants to avoid clashing with police. Ali Salman, leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans. [...] "We support any peaceful movement, {{at any time and}} from any party. Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands," [...] he added. Al Wefaq however, stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement, blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters. [...] "t {{is going to be a}} peaceful movement <b>but</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that I also expect clashes ... I only pray that there are no victims," [...] said Ali Salman.|$|E
2500|$|I wouldn't say we're {{overwhelming}} favourites but I {{think we}} generally start as favourites against most teams at home. Touring teams often take {{a bit of}} time to adapt to our conditions and I think we saw a bit of that in the way Sri Lanka began the most recent series. The Windies haven't played any one-day cricket for a while and we're in the middle of our season, so I suppose we are the team to beat. <b>But</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that, if they find their feet they're a very good side and we'll have to play very well to win." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the November 1991 death of Freddie Mercury, May chose to deal with his grief by committing himself as fully as possible to work, first by finishing his solo album, Back to the Light, and then touring worldwide to promote it. He frequently remarked in press interviews that this was the only form of self-prescribed therapy he could think of. According to Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott, [...] "It was undoubtedly an enormous and terrible blow to lose someone he was so close to. Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, <b>but</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{really a}} detective novel, {{but it feels}} like one {{sometimes}} – that you should not have romantic intrigue in a detective book. Dorothy L. Sayers, who is queen of the genre said – and then broke her own rule, but said – {{that there is no}} place for romance in a detective story except that it can be useful to camouflage other people's motives. That's true; it is a very useful trick. I've used that on Percy and I've used that to a degree on Tonks in this book, as a red herring. <b>But</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that, I disagree inasmuch as mine are very character-driven books, and it's so important, therefore, that we see these characters fall in love, which is a necessary part of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The aunts {{resented the}} {{children}} {{for the fact that}} they had to sacrifice their young lives to look after them. It was Mona who was troubled the most by having to care for her niece and nephew. [...] "It was very big of her to take on the responsibility, <b>but</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that, I wish people wouldn't do that. I wish people wouldn't be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your 'big' and keep your 'rotten' and get out of my life, because, quite frankly, I would rather have gone to a children's home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same. To this day, I'm still working on the things she did to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{accession}} of James II. to the British throne excited new hopes in all {{orders of}} men. On the accession {{of a new}} prince, the loyal looked to rewards, the rebellious to amnesty. The Catholics exulted in beholding one of their persuasion attain the crown after an interval of two centuries; the Church of England expected the fruits of her unlimited devotion to the royal line; even the sectaries might hope indulgence from a prince whose religion deviated from that established by law as widely as their own. All, therefore, hastened, in sugared addresses, to lament the sun which had set, and hail the beams of that which had arisen. Dryden, among other expectants, chose the more honourable of these themes; and in the [...] "Threnodia Augustalis," [...] at once paid {{a tribute to the}} memory of the deceased monarch, and decently solicited the attention of his successor. But although he had enjoyed personal marks of the favour of Charles, they were of a nature too unsubstantial to demand a deep tone of sorrow. [...] "Little was the muses' hire, and light their gain;" [...] and [...] "the pension of a prince's praise" [...] is stated to have been all their encouragement. Dryden, therefore, by no means sorrowed as if he had no hope; <b>but,</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> all that was decently mournful over the bier of Charles, tuned his lyrics to a sounding close in praise of James.|$|E

60|$|Be {{that as it}} may, I do {{not think}} that any {{unbiased}} traveler will doubt that the best possible selection has been made, presuming always, as we may presume in the discussion, that Montreal could not be selected. I take for granted that the rejection of Montreal was regarded as a sine qua non in the decision. To me it appears grievous that this should have been so. It is a great thing for any country to have a large, leading, world-known city, and I think that the government should combine with the commerce of the country in carrying out this object. But commerce can do a great deal more for government than government can do for commerce. Government has selected Ottawa as the capital of Canada; but commerce has already made Montreal the capital, and Montreal will be the chief city of Canada, let government do what it may to foster the other town. The idea of spiting a town because there has been a row in it {{seems to me to be}} preposterous. The row was not the work of those who have made Montreal rich and respectable. Montreal is more centrical than Ottawa--nay, it is as nearly centrical as any town can be. It is easier to get to Montreal from Toronto than to Ottawa; and if from Toronto, then from all that distant portion of Upper Canada back of Toronto. To all Lower Canada Montreal is, as a matter of course, much easier of access than Ottawa. <b>But</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> so much in favor of Montreal, I will again admit that, putting aside Montreal, the best possible selection has been made.|$|E
