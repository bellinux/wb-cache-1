25|$|Fassbinder {{did little}} to {{discourage}} the personalized nature of the attacks on himself and his work. He seemed to provoke them by his aggressively non-conformist lifestyle, symbolized in his <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket,</b> battered hat, dark glasses and perennial scowl.|$|E
25|$|The man {{was well}} dressed wearing a <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket,</b> blue {{trousers}} (size 50), blue socks, {{a black leather}} belt {{and a pair of}} black shoes (size 44). His clothes were from C, a popular fashion retail store in Europe with most of its stores in Germany and Austria. From the man's appearance it was assumed he was a professional worker. He was a frequent smoker and several surveillance videos show him smoking outside often.|$|E

25|$|For the {{majority}} of his time in 1973, Tyler wears a <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket</b> with jeans or plain trousers and typical shoes of the day, with his collar spread out and no tie, unlike the rest of Hunt's CID.

25|$|Until recently, most sheriff's {{officers}} wore {{a standardized}} uniform (black pants and shirt with dark gray straw Stetson {{hat in the}} summer and a black felt Stetson hat in the winter with a black Class A jacket for the dress uniform and a <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket</b> for the winter) and all patrol vehicles were marked in the same manner (white with red stripes, etc.). Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different vehicle markings, and deputy sheriffs wear different uniforms. Some examples are Ulster County, which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and Warren County, whose deputy sheriffs wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. Dutchess County Deputy Sheriffs wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In Suffolk County, the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California). In New York City, deputy sheriffs wear a uniform very similar to sworn NYPD personnel. Ontario County Sheriff's deputies wear the traditional uniform; black pants, black shirt with brass buttons, and a black stetson.|$|E

500|$|For {{the music}} video, Madonna sported a {{complete}} image makeover.

In the video Madonna played a tomboy, dressed in jeans, a <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket,</b> and a slogan T-shirt with the caption [...] "Italians do it better".

Vanessa Franko from The Press-Enterprise opined that she [...] "dressed like a military-inspired dominatrix" [...] for the performance.

[...] The track is also part of the setlist of the Joanne World Tour (2017-18).

500|$|Daft Punk {{have said}} that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the {{characteristics}} of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. [...] "But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower." [...] When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated [...] "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you." [...] With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket</b> and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear. The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter stated that, [...] "We never like {{to do the same thing}} twice. It's more fun and entertaining for us to do something different, whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality. We're happy to give back to the masses".|$|E
500|$|The {{matching}} lilac jackets, made by McCartney's next-door neighbour in Liverpool {{to be worn}} as stage clothes, {{were soon}} threadbare, as were any other items of clothing, so the group bought cowboy boots, jeans and <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jackets</b> and trousers, from Paul Hundertmark's (Spielbudenplatz 9) and a tailor's shop at Thadenstrasse 6. Lennon said: [...] "We had a bit more money the second time so we bought leather pants ... we looked like four Gene Vincents.|$|R
50|$|The rocker {{subculture}} was {{centred on}} motorcycling, and their appearance reflected that.

The common rocker hairstyle was a pompadour, while their music genre of choice was 1950s rock and roll, played by artists including Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and Bo Diddley.|$|R

500|$|Waters was an {{aspiring}} filmmaker, intent on making [...] "the trashiest motion pictures in cinema history". Many of his friends, a group {{which came to}} be known as [...] "the Dreamlanders" [...] (and who included Divine, Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole), appeared in some of his low-budget productions, filmed on Sunday afternoons. Following the production of his first short film, Hag in a <b>Black</b> <b>Leather</b> <b>Jacket</b> (1964), Waters began production of a second work, Roman Candles (1966). This film was influenced by the pop artist Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls (1966), and consisted of three 8-millimeter movies played simultaneously side by side. Roman Candles was the first film to star Divine, in this instance in drag as a smoking nun. It featured the Dreamlanders modeling shoplifted clothes and performing various unrelated activities. Being both a short film and of an avant-garde nature, Roman Candles never received widespread distribution, instead holding its premier at the annual Mt. Vernon Flower Mart in Baltimore, which had become popular with [...] "elderly dames, young faggots and hustlers, and of course a whole bunch of hippies". Waters went on to screen it at several local venues alongside Kenneth Anger's short film Eaux d'Artifice (1953).|$|E
500|$|... "We R Who We R" [...] was {{performed}} {{for the first}} time on the second season of The X Factor Australia on November 14, 2010. Prior to the performance a minor controversy was sparked when Kesha's male background dancers were seen wearing red armbands that had been supplied locally. Kesha was concerned they could be mistaken for a swastika symbol, so the armbands were removed.

50|$|The {{collapse}} of the USSR in 1991 resulted in the flooding of the consumer market with imported American and European designer clothing, especially blue jeans.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the more flamboyant outfits of his predecessors, the Ninth Doctor wore a nondescript, weathered <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket,</b> V-neck jumper and dark trousers. Eccleston stated that he felt that such definitive [...] "costumes" [...] were passé and that the character's trademark eccentricities should show through his actions and clever dialogue, not through gimmicky costumes. Despite this, there is a running joke about his character that the only piece of clothing he changes is his jumper, even when trying to [...] "blend into" [...] a historical era. The one exception, a photograph of him taken in 1912, wearing period gentleman's clothing, resembles {{the style of the}} Eighth Doctor.|$|E
50|$|Although {{sadomasochism}} {{has been}} practiced for many centuries, the modern gay leather {{scene in the}} United States developed beginning in 1945 when thousands of gay servicemen were given blue discharges from service after World War II {{and came to the}} major port cities of the United States to live in gay ghettos. In 1953, the film The Wild One appeared starring Marlon Brando and the more butch gays began to imitate him by wearing <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jackets,</b> a <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> cap, <b>black</b> <b>leather</b> boots and jeans and, if they could afford it, by also riding motorcycles.
