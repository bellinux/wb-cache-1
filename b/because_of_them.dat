25|$|All {{remaining}} older twin-axle trams were retired on 29 October 1967 {{and thus}} only used SM53, {{with a few}} Gullfisk on morning routes <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> spending the night at Majorstuen. Renovated SM53 started running on the Briskeby Line 1980 and from 18 October 1982 the conductor was removed. Articulated SL79 trams were introduced on 2 April 1984, after which they served most of the departures. From 18 April 1988 evening and Sunday routes from the Briskeby Line terminated at Stortorvet. During the 1990s the line would often be served using SM91 trams. Line 1's eastern end was moved on 2 August 1993 to the Ekeberg Line. Night trams were introduced on 5 February 1994. Line number 1 {{was given to the}} Oslo Metro on 8 April 1995 and the Briskeby Line took number 19.|$|E

25|$|He was {{not there}} long. Even though England was totally safe for him, and {{he had already been}} {{preferred}} by a king who admired him, and had married an English girl, complaining that he was not accepted by the Protestants and could not find advancement <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> he set sail for Rome with his wife. Pope Paul V immediately drew what may have been the correct conclusion and threw him into prison as a spy. However, the good pope changed his mind shortly, perhaps still hoping to reconvert the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and decided accept the matter graciously, placing Thomas in Italy. He used his influence with Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to get Thomas appointed to the professorship of the Pandects at Pisa. The Grand Duke commissioned him also to write a definitive work on the Etruscans.|$|E
25|$|CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, {{who oversaw}} {{a drop of}} 1% in his party's vote share since the 2011 general election, issued a {{statement}} praising democracy for ousting the AKP majority government from power. Despite the CHP claiming that it was <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> that the AKP failed to win a majority, media commentators claimed that the decrease in their vote and seat share showed {{that it was in}} fact the HDP and MHP that had more of an effect on the result. CHP spokesperson Haluk Koç stated that the CHP was now in the most likely position to be included in a coalition, with Kılıçdaroğlu allegedly attempting to form a CHP-MHP minority coalition with outside support from the HDP. Kılıçdaroğlu appeared to have refused to consider a coalition with the AKP. In response to a question of whether he would resign after presiding over a decrease in the CHP vote, Kılıçdaroğlu refused to comment but claimed that he was perfectly happy with the election result. Despite this, the President of the Turkish Bars Association and CHP member Metin Feyzioğlu stated that a convention should be called due to the poor election result. The drop in the CHP's vote share was largely attributed to CHP voters tactically voting for the HDP to increase the chances of them surpassing the 10% parliamentary threshold.|$|E
25|$|At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles {{lost the}} WWE Championship to John Cena. Styles was {{immediately}} {{entered into the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, but SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also promised Styles {{that he would get}} a one-on-one rematch for the title if he did not win the title back at the pay-per-view. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt eliminated both Cena and Styles to win the championship. Cena then immediately invoked his rematch clause, but Styles intervened, stating he should get his first. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, where Wyatt retained. Randy Orton then refused his right as the Royal Rumble winner to face Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33, so Bryan scheduled a 10-man battle royal to determine a new number one-contender. Styles was entered into the battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. The two faced each other in a number one contender's match the following week. Styles pinned Harper, but the referee did not see Harper's foot on the rope. Shane came out and restarted the match, which angered Styles, even though he would defeat Harper once again. At the conclusion of the show, Orton reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania. Bryan and Shane decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. After the show, an angered Styles got into a heated argument backstage with Shane. The following week, an irate Styles said that he was tired of Bryan and Shane. He said <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> {{he did not have a}} match at WrestleMania, but Orton, who committed arson, did. Later backstage, Styles attacked Shane and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured Shane challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania, which Styles accepted. At the end of the following week's episode, Shane called out Styles and the two brawled, which ended with Shane performing a Leap of Faith on Styles through the broadcast table. The following week, the two had a contract signing to make the match official and the two traded barbs.|$|E

[...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E
500|$|The race, the twenty-eighth of a {{total of}} thirty-six in the 2009 season, began at 2:00 p.m. and was {{televised}} live in the United States on ESPN. Around the start of the race, weather conditions were cloudy with the air temperature a moderate chance of rain was forecast. Pastor Dan Schafer began pre-race ceremonies by giving the invocation. Country music group and Show Dog-Universal Music recording artists Trailer Choir performed the national anthem, and Sergeant Major John Jones of the Pennsylvania National Guard gave the command for drivers to start their engines.

500|$|Engel {{stopped on}} the track with {{powertrain}} issues, but after he restarted, he was shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring him to enter the pit lane to repair car damage. Prost overtook di Grassi around the inside at turn four to claim fourth position on lap 12, and Piquet reduced the time deficit to the di Grassi. López forced Sarrazin wide through the fourth turn to take over 18th position on the following lap. Buemi held a 4.5 second advantage over Vergne with Turvey, Prost and di Grassi in close attendance for the third place battle. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on lap 18 when Turvey, Evans and Duval entered the pit lane. Evans was issued a five-second time penalty after he was observed to exceeded the speed limit under full course yellow conditions. The majority of the field followed one lap later and after the pit stops Buemi was in third place. Di Grassi was released {{into the path of}} Piquet, causing the driver to brake in order to avoid colliding with him. Engel lost engine power at his pit stop, triggering his retirement from the race. Mahindra elected to keep their drivers Rosenqvist and Heideld on the track for one further lap which would allow the two drivers to push in the event's closing stages <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> having additional electrical energy available to them.|$|E
500|$|Engel was {{the quickest}} {{driver in the}} fourth group, and {{finished}} ahead of d'Ambrosio and Rosenqvist who struggled for decent pace. Gutiérrez and Adam Carroll were the fourth group's slowest two drivers, and at the group qualifying's conclusion, the lap times set by Abt, Engel, López, Turvey and Vergne were fast enough to enable them progression into the super pole round. Vergne was the first competitor to attempt to record a lap time in super pole; {{he was unable to}} achieve a rhythm and placed fifth. Engel was slower in the track's first sector, but went faster {{in the second part of}} the track by two-tenths of a second to clinch third. López went quicker in the circuit's first two sectors but was unable to go faster in the final sector and was restricted to qualifying fourth. Abt was two-tenths of a second quicker than the previous three drivers in the first sector. Although he lost a small amount of time in the second sector, Abt took provisional pole position with a time of one minute and 2.711 seconds. Turvey lost time while completing his lap and qualified in second. The result would have meant Abt securing his first pole position of the season, the second of his career, and his first since the 2015 Long Beach ePrix, but his car's tyre pressures were found to have been below the mandated minimum pressure of [...] Abt was consequently demoted to 18th. Further grid penalties were applied when Engel and his teammate Sarrazin dropped ten places <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> changing their gearboxes. The application of Abt's penalty meant Turvey secured the first pole position of his career.|$|E
500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

500|$|As the dialogue-integrated [...] "tutorial" [...] in {{the first}} Ace Attorney was well received, the {{inclusion}} of one in Justice for All was considered a [...] "major point". While the first game's tutorial involved Phoenix being helped through his first trial by his mentor Mia and the judge, this {{could not be used}} twice, which led to the idea of giving Phoenix a temporary amnesia from a blow to the head. Takumi included a circus and magic in the game's third episode; he really wanted to do this, as performing magic is a hobby of his. The episode includes two themes that he wanted to explore: the difficulties in forming a cohesive team with different people, and a person who against the odds tries to make something whole. The former was reflected in how the circus members come together at the end, while the latter was reflected in the character Moe. Several different versions of the fourth episode were created, partially <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> running out of memory on the game's cartridge, but also because of the popularity of the character of Miles Edgeworth: Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes, but when they were in full production the development team learned that the character had become popular, which led to Takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and sparingly. Because of this, he created the character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. The character Pearl Fey was originally intended to be a rival character around the same age as Maya, only appearing in the game's second episode; one of the game's designers suggested that it would be more dramatic if she were much younger, so Takumi wrote her as an eight-year-old. As he ended up liking her, he included her in other episodes as well.|$|E
500|$|Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout gave {{a second}} staff opinion rating of three-stars-out-of-five, and wrote that [...] "Come To The Well {{is not an}} {{unbearable}} musical venture, and it’s likely one of their better recent releases.

[...] Davies of Louder Than the Music gave it a three and a half out of five stars, noting that [...] "there is absolutely nothing wrong with this album", which he expects more out of the band, advising that with [...] "a little bit more creativity musically and this could be a really strong album." [...] Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday gave it a four out of five stars, evoking how the album is [...] "filled with songs that both challenge and encourage believers in their walk", and calling it [...] "the best album by Casting Crowns since Lifesong". Bert Gangl of The Phantom Tollbooth gave it a three and a half out of five stars, writing that the album [...] "taken as a whole, the new record, in spite of its intermittent musical tangents – or perhaps <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> – winds up being one of the Crown collective's most cohesive, and impressive, releases to date." [...] Ed Cardinal of Crosswalk.com said the album was [...] "as strong and yet relatively safe as anything it has done before" [...] and praised it as [...] "sure to be among 2011’s most popular and enduring Christian albums". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel praised the album's songwriting and said the album [...] "is a solid effort in the Crowns discography". Barry Westman of Worship Leader praising the album for its [...] "variety in styles adds to the complexity of the album, and keeps the listener wondering what will come next."

[...] Similar criticisms had arisen in Logan County the year before, but the growing success of the revivals had served to drown them out. [...] By 1801, they were growing louder again, led by James Balch and Thomas Craighead. [...] Though the revivals continued to attract crowds, opposition to them was significant enough that one Sunday, McGready was left to preach from the steps of his Red River meeting house, having been locked out by an anti-revivalist church member.|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} many Russian historians liked to disparage the officer corps of the Imperial Russian Army because of the high proportion of Baltic Germans serving as officers, which further reinforces the popular stereotype that the Russians won despite their officers rather than <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Furthermore, the Emperor [...] Alexander I often gave the impression {{at the time that he}} found Russia a place that was not worthy of his ideals, and he cared more about Europe as a whole than about Russia. Alexander's conception of a war to free Europe from Napoleon lacked appeal to many nationalist-minded Russian historians, who preferred to focus on a campaign in defense of the homeland rather than what Lieven called Alexander's rather [...] "murky" [...] mystical ideas about European brotherhood and security. Lieven observed that for every book written in Russia on the campaigns of 1813–1814, there are a hundred books on the campaign of 1812, and that the most recent Russian grand history of the war of 1812–1814 gave 490 pages to the campaign of 1812 and 50 pages to the campaigns of 1813–1814. Lieven noted that Tolstoy ended War and Peace in December 1812, and that many Russian historians have followed Tolstoy in focusing on the campaign of 1812 while ignoring the greater achievements of campaigns of 1813–1814 that ended with the Russians marching into Paris.|$|E
