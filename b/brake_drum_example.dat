5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>drums</b> {{are used}} in modern concert and film music to provide a non-pitched metal sound similar to an anvil. Some are more {{resonant}} than others. To produce the clearest sound, percussionists hang the drum with nylon cord or place it on foam. Other methods include mounting the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> on a snare drum stand. Either way, the percussionist strikes the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> with hammers or sticks of various weight. The <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is also commonly in steelpan ensembles, where it is called [...] "the iron." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Design of new fixture is a {{modified}} {{over the old}} fixture due to some drawback. The old fixture is not suitable for drum having slot on top face. This {{is because of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is seated on fixture ring instead of button so there is no gap maintained. Without sufficient gap it is difficult to machine the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> bore(pilot diameter), as well as <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> surface in single set up to achieve the concentricity. Also current fixture is complicated in design and there is more work in fitting the button to fixture ring. So we designed new lathe fixture over the old fixture. In new modified lathe fixture, pads are provided instead of buttons and it could be suitable for <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> having slot on the top face and other drum also. By trail run this lathe fixture is more comfortable than old fixture. So this fixture can be used in <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> (cargo) manufacturing companies because of its simple design and less cost...|$|R
50|$|Transmission <b>brakes</b> use <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{rather than}} disc brakes, {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance dynamic <b>brake.</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box.|$|R
50|$|It {{is quite}} simple to machine <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> {{if one has}} a slow running lathe (one {{rule of thumb is}} that cast iron should not be {{machined}} faster than fifty feet per minute). Usually it is only necessary to machine away the ridge that forms that makes <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> removal difficult. If the ridge is left on big trouble can occur later especially if the brakes are self-adjusting. In bad cases this ridge can make the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> captive. Most <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> designs provide a way to externally release the self-adjusting mechanism in order to ease drum removal and service.|$|R

50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{generally}} can {{be found}} on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years the needs for heavy duty brakes have been increasing. Since the {{performance}} of a braking system has direct influence on the safety of an automobile, an accurate design of <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is very important at present. The <b>Brake</b> <b>Drum</b> of TATA INDICA car is working well under certain load conditions. The required size of the break drum to be used in newly introduced TATA NANO car, the adoptability of the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> is tested under different load conditions with the help of Finite element analysis. The analysis is carried out using a FEM package, ANSYS 10. The results shown that the size of the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> required for NANO car is smaller than the size that is being used in INDICA car with lesser brake load than the later one...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the <b>brake,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes on the <b>drum</b> allows <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and <b>braking</b> force. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear <b>brakes,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|R

Under such heavy <b>braking,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.|$|R

50|$|Dissatisfaction {{with the}} cast irons then being used for <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> {{prompted}} Walther and his staff to experiment with other materials better suited for the heavier loads and increased speeds of modern trucks. This research program, under Walther’s direct supervision, produced a custom-built material which, {{for the lack of}} a better name, the company designated “Brake Drum Iron”. This stronger, more wear-resistant and thermal-stable <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> iron is a molybdenum alloyed iron, and with a few minor changes in analysis, is the iron still standard for most <b>brake</b> <b>drums</b> today. Until World War II Dayton Steel Foundry was the world’s largest consumer of molybdenum for cast iron.|$|R

40|$|John Thousand of Wolverine Western Corp. put his {{aerospace}} {{group to}} work on an unfamiliar job, designing a <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> using computer design techniques. Computer design involves creation of a mathematical model of a product and analyzing its effectiveness in simulated operation. Technique enables study of performance and structural behavior {{of a number of}} different designs before settling on a final configuration. Wolverine employees attacked a traditional <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> problem, the sudden buildup of heat during fast and repeated braking. Part of <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> not confined tends to change its shape under combination of heat, physical pressure and rotational forces, a condition known as bellmouthing. Since bellmouthing is a major factor in braking effectiveness, a solution of problem would be a major advance in automotive engineering. A former NASA employee, now a Wolverine employee, knew of a series of NASA computer programs ideally suited to confronting bellmouthing. Originally developed as aids to rocket engine nozzle design, it's capable of analyzing problems generated in a rocket engine or automotive <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> by heat, expansion, pressure and rotational forces. Use of these computer programs led to new <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> concept featuring a more durable axle, and heat transfer ribs, or fins, on hub of drum...|$|R
