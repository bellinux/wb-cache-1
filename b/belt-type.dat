50|$|Sorters can be chute-type or <b>belt-type.</b> <b>Belt-type</b> {{machines}} break {{a smaller}} percentage of material (important for nuts) {{and the product}} stays relatively static during the transport process as it moves horizontally on the belt. Whereas in the chute type, material slides on the chute because of gravity, causing collision, friction, and larger vertical movements, thus worsening the ratio of broken material. The belt structure makes the transmission smooth and stable without bouncing of material. Chute type is more common especially for food, as prices are lower, capacities are higher and products can be seen more easily from both sides, which is important when a dehulled grain has hull only at one side. Chute sorters are usually applicable to specific products as the chute is designed with special channels {{for this kind of}} material based on sizes and shapes of the material, for example 5 mm chutes are used for rice, grain and plastic granules. Flat chutes are right for plastic flakes, such as PET, or milk bottle flakes.|$|E

40|$|As the key element, sensor {{networks}} are widely {{investigated by the}} Internet of Things (IoT) community. When massive numbers of devices are well connected, malicious attackers may deliberately propagate fake position information to confuse the ordinary users and lower the network survivability in <b>belt-type</b> situation. However, most existing positioning solutions only focus on the algorithm accuracy and do not consider any security aspects. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive scheme for node localization protection, which aims to improve the energy-efficient, reliability and accuracy. To handle the unbalanced resource consumption, a node deployment mechanism is presented to satisfy the energy balancing strategy in resource-constrained scenarios. According to cooperation localization theory and network connection property, the parameter estimation model is established. To achieve reliable estimations and eliminate large errors, an improved localization algorithm is created based on modified average hop distances. In order to further improve the algorithms, the node positioning accuracy is enhanced by using the steepest descent method. The experimental simulations illustrate the performance of new scheme can meet the previous targets.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a problem on}} introduction of a conception and regularities of “squeezing effect of a rail loaded non centrally by semi-sleepers having L- shaped cross-section” exemplified by <b>belt-type</b> tramway. Its advantages are ensured by doubled non centrally loaded foundations these are semi-sleepers. Semi-sleeper of L -shape cross-section is a lever of L -shape form, transforming a vertical load into horizontal ones and foundation squeezing. Properties of two semi-sleepers being doubled, orientated {{to each other and}} non centrally loaded have been used {{in order to create a}} positive effect. A horizontal force creates squeezing and it is revealed as a component of a vertical load during displacements which functionally depend on foundation squeezing. These dependences demonstrate that strength and deformation properties of earth foundation of vertical direction are used for creation of horizontal properties of sleeper vertical shoulder. The paper studies mechanics pertaining to a squeezing effect of a rail loaded by semi-sleepers having L- shaped cross-section. It has been established that the rail squeezing effect results from squeezing process executed in two mutually perpendicular directions (reduction of cross-sectional area) by load of a rail wheel with spacers if they are set inside of a sleeper-mechanism on an elastic foundation. Methodology for calculation of parameters on the rail reduction effect is considered as a tool for handling of applied problems on <b>belt-type</b> tramways. Results of the proposed rail reduction effect in problem statement for elastic conditions, with unchanged cross-sectional dimension of a rail line and introduction of correction ratio coefficients due to new initial load data have recommended for practical application as reliable values. The paper has revealed a proportional dependence of the rail reduction effect according to strength on the resultant value of reaction pressure, eccentricity difference of the resultant and load and inverse proportion due to distance along vertical line between reduction force vector and connection position of doubled foundations. Rail squeezing force will be increased if we reduce foundation height while having unchanged width and foundation pressure or if we increase an ordinate of the connection arrangement between them while having unchanged foundation height. </p...|$|E

Prior to the joining, the AlN surface was modified by isothermal oxidation or by titanium ion implantation. The effects of the oxidation process temperature were examined within the temperature range from 673 to 1473 K. The surface of the ceramic was modified by titanium ion implantation at various ion doses and various accelerating voltages. The modified ceramic was joined with oxidized copper in a nitrogen atmosphere with about 1. 5 ppm of oxygen, using a <b>belt-type</b> furnace at a temperature of 1323 K. The microstructure and phase changes induced on the surfaces of the joints were examined. The modification yielded a ‘barrier ’ layer (TiN), which ensured a continuous pore-less contact between the materials being joined.

The thermohaline circulation of the Atlantic reverses. The associated changes in ocean heat transport lead to a strong cooling in the North Atlantic and in Europe. Due to the windstress feedback, the mode without North Atlantic deepwater formation is slightly unstable and the system slowly returns to the windstress feedback, the mode without North Atlantic deepwater formation is slightly unstable and the system slowly returns to the conveyor belt overturning mode. The circulation changes leave a strong imprint in geochemical tracers included in the model simulations. Radiocarbon chronologies are strongly affected, showing a rapidly advancing radiocarbon clock when formation of North Atlantic deepwater collapses and a very slowly moving radiocarbon clock when the conveyor-belt overturning starts again. In the deep Atlantic, the changes in the origin of the water masses lead to a rapid increase of the differences in radiocarbon ages relative to the surface waters. #delta# 180 shows a similar time evolution as salinity, but the errors in the reconstruction of salinity from #delta# 180 are typically larger than 1 psu during meltwater input.
