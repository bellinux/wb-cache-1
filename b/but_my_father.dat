25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

Jaffar said: [...] "I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, when I woke up, I started moving away, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> told me to endure, stay and not fear. Then we heard screams and rushed there. For a few seconds he spoke to the security forces, asking them to stay away from women and children, but they shot him in the chest. He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place." ...|$|E

This petition gave a push to the Right to Information movement.|$|E
2500|$|I {{never would}} have gone north of the Arkansas again, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> there [...] sent for me time after time, saying it was the place for my people, and finally I went. No sooner had we got there than there was trouble. I do not want war, and my people do not, but {{although}} we have come back south of the Arkansas, the soldiers follow us and continue fighting, and {{we want you to}} send out and stop these soldiers from coming against us.|$|E
2500|$|A {{native of}} Cluj (Kolozsvár) city in Transylvania, the future writer {{was born to}} ethnic Romanian parents: his father, Aurel Isac, was a lawyer, later noted for {{representing}} the Romanian civil disobedience Memorandum movement, after it was prosecuted by the Hungarian authorities; his mother, Elisabeta-Eliza née Roşescu, was a schoolteacher. As the poet later recalled in a tongue-in-cheek memoir of his childhood: [...] "I was born in Cluj, when the Someş was boiling with blood and my father reaped the flowers of pain [...] I came around when called upon by my mother—and the priest baptized me in Eau de Cologne, or blood, or tears, or holy water—and my godfather wanted {{to give me the}} name Alfred, for he loved Musset, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> gave me the name , since he loved Rousseau." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peter's Confession {{begins as}} a {{dialogue}} between Jesus and his disciples in , [...] and [...] Jesus asks his disciples: But who {{do you say that}} I am? Simon Peter answers him: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. In , Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and states: [...] "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father</b> who is in heaven." [...] In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God, which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.|$|E

[...] He asked me what it was, and I told him it was the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] When my father was ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school.

2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale. He took hold of his beard and advanced, crying out [...] "Give the lie to the Devil!" [...] The Muslims rallied, returned to the fight and climbed the hill. When I saw that the Franks withdrew, pursued by the Muslims, I shouted for joy, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] But the Franks rallied and charged again like the first time and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> rounded on me and said, [...] "Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [...] falls." [...] As he was speaking to me, the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty and wept for joy.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or so I ran away to the front line to kill Germans. <b>But</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again I was caught, and this time I was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
