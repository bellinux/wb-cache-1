25|$|Tryptic (trypticase) soy agar (TSA) is a {{general-purpose}} medium {{produced by}} enzymatic digestion of soybean meal and casein. It is frequently the base medium of other agar types; for example, <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> {{are made by}} enriching TSA plates with blood. TSA plates support growth of many semifastidious bacteria, including some species of Brucella, Corynebacterium, Listeria, Neisseria, and Vibrio.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> (BAPs) contain {{mammalian}} blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at {{a concentration}} of 5–10%. BAPs are enriched, differential media used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show lysis and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include Streptococcus haemolyticus. α-Hemolysis will only cause partial lysis of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and will appear green or brown, due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example {{of this would be}} Streptococcus viridans. γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain meat extract, tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.|$|E
2500|$|The viridans streptococci are a {{large group}} of {{commensal}} bacteria, that are either α-hemolytic, producing a green coloration on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> (hence the name [...] "viridans", from Latin vĭrĭdis, green), or nonhemolytic.

2500|$|S. aureus ( [...] , Greek σταφυλόκοκκος, [...] "grape-cluster berry", Latin aureus, [...] "golden") is a facultative anaerobic, gram-positive coccal (round) {{bacterium}} {{also known}} as [...] "golden staph" [...] and [...] "oro staphira". S. aureus is non-motile and does not form spores. In medical literature, the bacterium {{is often referred to}} as S. aureus, Staph aureus or Staph A.. S. aureus [...] appears as staphylococci (grape-like clusters) when viewed through a microscope, and has large, round, golden-yellow colonies, often with hemolysis, when grown on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates.</b> S. aureus reproduces asexually by binary fission. [...] Complete separation of the daughter cells is mediated by S. aureus autolysin, and in its absence or targeted inhibition, the daughter cells remain attached to one another and appear as clusters.|$|E

50|$|Like other cocci, streptococci are round bacteria. The name {{is derived}} from the Greek meaning pus(pyo)-forming(genes) chain(Strepto) of berries (coccus), because streptococcal cells tend to link in chains of round cells (see image) and a number of infections caused by the bacteria, produce pus. Streptococci are catalase-negative and Gram-positive. S. pyogenes can be cultured on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates.</b> Under ideal conditions, it has an {{incubation}} period of 1 to 3 days.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of {{infection}} an appropriate sample is collected for laboratory identification. Pneumococci are typically gram-positive cocci seen in pairs or chains. When cultured on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> with added optochin antibiotic disk they show alpha-hemolytic colonies and a clear zone of inhibition around the disk indicating sensitivity to the antibiotic. Pneumococci are also bile soluble. Just like other streptococci they are catalase-negative. A Quellung test can identify specific capsular polysaccharides.|$|E
50|$|This is the nonspecific {{killing of}} blood cells by {{metabolic}} by-products of bacteria. This {{can be seen}} on a <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plate,</b> when the <b>blood</b> surrounding the confluent part of your streak turns green, but there is no change around single colonies.

30|$|Culture of TIVAP was {{considered}} as positive if the tip or port reservoir (indoor or outdoor) was positive. Positivity of TIVAP tip culture was defined {{according to the}} same modality across all the microbiological laboratories of participating centers. It was defined on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> by quantitative method after vortexing or sonication (taking into account pathogens present in their inner or outer surfaces) with a cutoff of ≥[*] 1000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL [24 – 26]. Growth of <[*] 1000  CFU/mL from a catheter by quantitative method {{was considered}} as catheter contamination. TIVAP box culture was performed according to each clinical microbiology laboratory-own protocol, such as immersion of the case in broth and then sowing on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> or chocolate plate, needle puncture and aspiration of the case contents then sowing, or swab from outside the case then sowing. In all these techniques, a qualitative culture was performed.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{automated}} {{systems such as}} the systems from MATLAB allow the cells to be counted without having to stain them. This lets the colonies to be reused for other experiments without the risk of killing the microorganisms with stains. However, a disadvantage to these automated systems {{is that it is}} extremely difficult to differentiate between the microorganisms with dust or scratches on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> because both the dust and scratches can create a highly diverse combination of shapes and appearances.|$|E
50|$|In both {{solid and}} liquid media, S. putrefaciens is often {{recognizable}} by its bright pink color. On solid media, the colonies are round, fast-growing, and pink. The organism is also fast-growing in liquid media, and there will give the liquid an overall pink hue. On <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates,</b> the colonies are typically convex and large, with a brown pigment, and cause “greening” of the agar around the colonies. S. putrefaciens are non-lactose fermenters on MacConkey agar. As with all Shewanella, this organism produces hydrogen sulfide on TSI.|$|E
50|$|Aerococcus is a genus in the phylum Firmicutes (Bacteria). The genus {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1953 from samples {{of air and}} dust as a catalase-negative, Gram-positive coccus that grew in small clusters. They were subsequently found in hospital environments and meat-curing brines. It {{has been difficult to}} identify as it resembles alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus on <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plates</b> and is difficult to identify by biochemical means. Sequencing of 16S rRNA has become the gold standard for identification, but other techniques such as MALDI-TOF have also been useful for identifying both the genus and species.|$|E

The pseudo-taxonomic term [...] "Streptococcus viridans" [...] is often used to refer to this group of species, but writers that do not like to use the pseudotaxonomic term (which treats a group of species as if they were one species) prefer the terms viridans streptococci, viridans group streptococci (VGS), or viridans streptococcal species.|$|E
40|$|Taxo ™ P Discs are {{recommended}} {{for use in}} the presumptive identification of pneumococci, and are intended for use with pure cultures. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Taxo P Discs are impregnated with ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride (optochin), a drug used for pneumonia therapy before sulfonamides became available. The growth of pneumococci, but not of other streptococci, is markedly inhibited by this chemical. 1, 2 Pneumococci may, therefore, be differentiated from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci by the formation of a zone of inhibition around a Taxo P disc placed on a <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> <b>plate</b> heavily inoculated with a pure culture suspected to be Streptococcus pneumoniae. 2 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE Taxo paper discs are impregnated with various chemicals as an aid in the rapid differentiation and presumptive identification of microoganisms.
