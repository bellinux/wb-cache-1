5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether <b>black</b> <b>plastic</b> causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E

25|$|The Solar Water Purifier, {{developed}} and manufactured by an Australian company, is a low-maintenance, low operational cost solution that {{is able to}} purify large amounts of water, even seawater, to levels better than human consumption standards set by the World Health Organization. This device works through the processes of evaporation and UV radiation. Light passes through {{the top layer of}} glass to the <b>black</b> <b>plastic</b> layer underneath. Heat from the solar radiation is trapped by the water and by the <b>black</b> <b>plastic.</b> This plastic layer is a series of connected troughs that separate the water as it evaporates and trickles down through the levels. The water is also subjected to UV radiation {{for an extended period of}} time as it moves through the device, which kills many bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In a sunny, equatorial area like much of Africa, this device is capable of purifying up to 45 litres per day from a single array. Additional arrays may be chained together for more capacity.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} {{comparing}} traditional low density <b>black</b> polyethylene <b>plastic</b> mulch (25 μm) with three different starch based biodegradable mulch films (15 μm), on a muskmelon “Lusitano” (Cucumis melo var. inodorus). The mulch film layout and crop plantation, soil temperature and humidity, weeds, canopy spread area, flowering and yield and crop quality were monitored. The field trial was conducted in Azeitada – Almeirim (from April to July 2011) with a completely randomized experimental design with three replications, 25 plants each. The mulch films modalities were: PE (control), BMF 1 (<b>black</b> biodegradable <b>plastic</b> film Mater-Bi®-CF 04 P); BMF 2 (<b>black</b> biodegradable <b>plastic</b> film Mater-Bi®-CF 04 P with recycled material) and BMFV (green biodegradable plastic film Mater-Bi®-CF 04 P). The results showed the adaptability of biodegradable mulch films to climatic conditions and traditional techniques applied, not observing significant differences in fruit quality and production. Regarding the soil water content the BMF 1 showed higher values when compared with BMFV, as well as BMFV compared with PE. The soil temperatures were similar in all the modalities and PE and BMFV had precocious flowering and production. A positive correlation between initial growth (36 DAT) and the soil growing degree-days (temperature 10 ºC) accumulated was obtained, and also between initial growth and final yield...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{were made}} of {{suitable}} methods of producing plastics from furfural and hydrolyzed cornstalks. It was found that hard, <b>black</b> <b>plastics</b> with a pleasing appearance, high impact strength, and satisfactory water resistance can be produced from a mixture of hydrolyzed cornstalks, furfural, aniline and lime. This material absorbed slightly more {{than one percent of}} water in twenty-four hours but it was not discolored, swollen or cracked from the immersion in water. It was estimated that the raw material costs of this plastic would be less than three cents a pound;It was found that hard, <b>black</b> <b>plastics</b> with a pleasing appearance, fairly high impact strength, and satisfactory resistance to water can be produced from a mixture of hydrolyzed oat hulls, furfural, aniline, and lime. This material absorbed more than one percent of water in twenty-four hours, but it was not discolored, swollen or cracked from the immersion in water. The method and extent of hydrolysis is important in determining the properties of the material made from the hydrolyzed hulls. It is believed that the hydrolysis could be carried out in such a manner that considerable quantities of furfural could be recovered from the hulls and still leave a residue suitable for the preparation of cheap plastics. It was estimated that the raw material costs of plastics from oat hulls, without recovery of furfural, would be slightly more than 3. 5 cents per pound;It was found that resins can be produced from combinations of furfural, lignin, and aniline or urea. These resins can be mixed with a suitable filler and molded under eat and pressure to hard, black, materials that have a pleasing appearance. It is believed that the optimum conditions for the preparation of such resins were not found in this study. The materials produced, however, did have moderate strength and satisfactory water resistance;It is believed that the plastics produced from hydrolyzed cornstalks, hydrolyzed oat hulls, or lignin had properties such that they could be produced to compete with some of the plastics now used commercially...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and {{can be as simple as}} a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon <b>black).</b> <b>Plastic</b> shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E

The front end was also cleaned up, with a new bonnet pressing losing the weld lines on top of the wings from the older models, and the doors were given recessed handles and squared-off glass in the top rear corner.

25|$|Electronic {{paper was}} first {{developed}} in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a janus particle composed of negatively charged <b>black</b> <b>plastic</b> {{on one side and}} positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.|$|E

25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or <b>black</b> <b>plastic</b> wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container.
