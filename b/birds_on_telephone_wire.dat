Soon, the small birds start mocking the large one by puffing up their feathers to resemble its plumage and imitating its honk.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{conspicuous}} and gregarious bird and a cooperative breeder, always seen in groups, often lined up <b>on</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>wires.</b> The nest is a cup structure in a bush or tree into which {{four or five}} eggs are laid. Only one female in a group breeds at a given time, with other members providing protection and food.|$|R

It is slightly smaller than the great grey shrike, and has a black forehead and relatively longer wings. This species prefers dry open lowlands, and is often seen <b>on</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R

50|$|The magpie-lark is {{a common}} and very {{widespread}} bird both in urban and rural areas, occupying all parts of Australia except for Tasmania {{and some of the}} inland desert in the far north-west of Western Australia, and appears to have adapted well to the presence of humans. It is also found in southern New Guinea and on the island of Timor. In 1924 it was introduced onto Lord Howe Island which lies 600 km to the east of Australia in the Tasman Sea. It is now widespread on the island. The magpie-lark is a familiar sight around Australia; sitting <b>on</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>wires</b> either singly or in pairs, or patrolling patches of bare ground, especially foreshores or swamps.|$|R
50|$|A {{side effect}} of the move to the self-install model is that the DSL signal can be degraded, {{especially}} if more than 5 voiceband (that is, POTS telephone-like) devices {{are connected to the}} line. Once a line has had DSL enabled, the DSL signal is present <b>on</b> all <b>telephone</b> <b>wiring</b> in the building, causing attenuation and echo. A way to circumvent this is {{to go back to the}} original model, and install one filter upstream from all telephone jacks in the building, except for the jack to which the DSL modem will be connected. Since this requires wiring changes by the customer, and may not work <b>on</b> some household <b>telephone</b> <b>wiring,</b> it is rarely done. It is usually much easier to install filters at each telephone jack that is in use.|$|R

40|$|From its perch <b>on</b> a <b>telephone</b> <b>wire</b> strung over a busy interstate, a kestrel surveys its ever-shrinking domain. Gone are Brushy Grove, Twelve-mile Grove, and Jewel Grove, {{islands of}} trees in the vast prairie that was once DuPage and Will County. They have been {{replaced}} by towns and developments with tree-like names ??? Woodridge, Downers Grove, and Elmhurst. Strings of geese crisscross the sky high above the kestrel, bathed in a golden glow from a low winter sun. The numerous flocks of geese seem to mimic the endless lines of <b>telephone</b> <b>wires</b> stretching across the landscape. Yet they go unnoticed by the ever watchful kestrel. Suddenly the bird moves, swoops, hovers, drops, and grasps a prairie vole within its talons. Life has changed for the kestrel, but it can still be good. As {{in the rest of the}} state, settlement of the DuPage River basin began with the slow emergence of pioneer settlements progressing to self-supporting farm centers. By the mid-twentieth century, however, the similarity stops as the area becomes an almost continuous urban landscape, the result of its proximity to Chicago, one of the largest cities on the earth. Urban development has affected everything from agriculture to archaeology, wildlife to wild areas. Life has changed for humans too, but, like for the kestrel, it can still be good.

2500|$|Because of loop {{disconnect}} dialing, attention {{was devoted to}} making the numbers difficult to dial accidentally by making them involve long sequences of pulses, such as with the UK 999 emergency number. That said, the real reason that [...] "999' was chosen is that the preferred [...] "000" [...] and [...] "111" [...] could not be used: [...] "111" [...] dialing could accidentally take place when phone lines were in too close proximity to each other, and [...] "0" [...] was already in use by the operator. Subscribers, as they were called then, were even given {{instructions on how to}} find the number [...] "9" [...] on the dial in darkened, or smoke-filled, rooms, by locating and placing the first finger in the [...] "0" [...] and the second in the [...] "9", then removing the first when actually dialling. However, in modern times, where repeated sequences of numbers are easily accidentally dialled on mobile phones, this is problematic, as mobile phones will dial an emergency number while the keypad is locked or even without a SIM card. Some people have reported accidentally dialling 112 by loop-disconnect for various technical reasons, including while working <b>on</b> extension <b>telephone</b> <b>wiring,</b> and point to this as a disadvantage of the 112 emergency number, which takes only four {{loop disconnect}}s to activate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-In China {{traditional}} methods of building Modbus remote monitoring system have some drawbacks. They are tightly dependent <b>on</b> <b>telephone</b> lines if <b>wired</b> communication was used; transferring speed is limited when using wireless technology like GPRS; Proprietary interfaces {{make it hard to}} reuse software design and new information island may be formed. So a new architecture for Modbus remote monitoring application was presented by this paper to solve the problems. 3 G Gateway provides Modbus network with Internet accessing capability. Process data can be sent to LAN Gateway through 3 G Gateway. LAN Gateway gets the process data and forward to OPC server. Then remote monitoring applications can read/write data from Ito OPC server easily using standard OPC interfaces. A prototype system was implemented in laboratory. The system is in initial phase now, but it proved the technique feasibility of the architecture. Keywords-Modubs; remote monitoring system; 3 G; ope I...|$|R

5000|$|After unsuccessfully petitioning the Matanuska Telephone Association to {{establish}} a telephone system in Chugiak, the Haiks and six Chugiak families were determined to do it themselves.

In the dead of winter, the families used dogsleds to string wire [...] "up and down the highway between homesteads and made up a system using long and short rings."

40|$|Data {{services}} delivered <b>on</b> <b>telephone</b> {{twisted pair}} <b>wiring</b> can potentially suffer from crosstalk due to data services on other twisted pairs in proximity, limiting the data rate, the maximum loop length and {{the quantity and}} variety of data services that a bundle can support. The crosstalk from other data services couples to the twisted pair in common mode and leaks to differential mode due to imperfect line balance. This thesis uses the common mode signal as a reference to an adaptive wideband crosstalk canceller, {{in an attempt to}} remove or at least lower the effect of crosstalk on the useful differential signal. Simulation results show the potential benefits of using this technique to reduce the level of crosstalk on an ADSL differential signal with crosstalk coming from data services commonly found in the telephone bundles. This technique is not limited to ADSL but can be applied to any technology using twisted pair wiring as its transmission medium...|$|R
