This clay was subjected to thermal loads during an in situ heating experiment (HE-D). After the test, intact samples were retrieved and analysed at laboratory scale. The influence of thermal loads was studied using <b>basic</b> <b>characterisation,</b> microstructural techniques (MIP) and non-destructive techniques (ultrasonic pulses). The retrieved samples were then subjected to wetting and drying paths. The hydraulic effects were tracked using <b>basic</b> <b>characterisation</b> (water content and porosity) and non-destructive techniques (ultrasonic pulses and bender elements). Test results showed a higher sensitivity of stiffness on suction increase for the material less affected by the thermal load (far from heater).

The capacity fade of the graphite electrodes was found to be due to increased electrolyte resistance and contact resistance and to an increased charge transfer resistance.

In addition to the founder and primary shaper of the specific sculptural style of the atelier, Jan Adam Dietz, the idea of the "sculpture workshop of Jezeří" additionally covers further exceptional personalities, who not only acquired in it the basis of their physical craft, but moreover the essential form of their artistic sensitivity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This paper explores a {{foundational}} {{concept for}} {{our understanding of}} sport – the concept of time. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this paper is}} to explain two diff erent concepts of time in sport. METHODS: Our methodology is philosophical, involving both conceptual and phenomenological analysis and the application of the outcomes to sports practice. RESULTS: First, two concepts of time and their role in sport are discussed – time as linear, measurable, homoge-neous and objective; and time as discussed in the philosophy of existence, namely in the work of Martin Heidegger, in which he introduces the concept of “original temporality”. Second, sports are classifi ed into four diff erent groups depending on the role of time in them, and <b>basic</b> <b>characterisations</b> of each are worked out. While within the fi rst three groups the concept of objective time is salient, a suggestion is made regarding the potential of the fourth group, which includes high risk sports, for the realisation of original temporality. CONCLUSIONS: The two concepts of time presented in this paper explain the basis of sport and show its relation-ship to the human experiencing of sport activities. The text shows that the concept of objective time is necessary for the practice of some sports, whilst other sports use it rather in a secondary way, e. g. for the comparison of winners. Original temporality as a basis of human experiencing is present in all sports. While in most of them it is limited by objective time, in some sports (especially in high risk sports) the possibility of the realization of original temporality is opened...|$|R

Biochemical analyses revealed many similarities between the C-terminal domains of GyrA from E. coli and P. falciparum, suggesting that despite its considerably larger size, the malarial protein carries out a similar DNA wrapping function.

40|$|Abstract Background Sarcopenia {{is defined}} as the loss of muscle mass and {{strength}} with age. Although a number of adult influences are recognised, there remains considerable unexplained variation in muscle mass and strength between older individuals. This has focused attention on influences operating earlier in life. Our objective for this study was to identify life course influences on muscle mass and strength in an established birth cohort and develop methodology for collection of muscle tissue suitable to investigate underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Methods One hundred and five men from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS), born between 1931 and 1939 who have historical records of birth weight and weight at one year took part in the Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS). Each participant consented for detailed characterisation of muscle mass, muscle function and aerobic capacity. In addition, a muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis using a Weil-Blakesley conchotome was performed. Data on muscle mass, function and aerobic capacity was collected on all 105 participants.

Further substances were chosen as a model compounds: biocolloids (humic acids, alginate, chitosan, hyaluronate) and synthetic polymer (polystyrenesulfonate).

Therefore, {{the aim of the}} current project was to make well resolved three-dimensional flow measurements of the mixing flow between counter rotating impellers, using Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TPIV). TPIV software was developed, with a novel approach permitting a significant reduction in processing time, and a series of numerical accuracy studies contributing to the fundamental understanding of this new technique. <b>Basic</b> flow <b>characterisation</b> determined the local isotropy, homogeneity and expected Reynolds number scaling. A favourable comparison between planar PIV and TPIV increased confidence in the latter, which was used to assess the dynamics and topology of the dissipation scale structures. In support of previous investigations similar topology, strain rate alignment, scale-invariance, and clustering behaviours are demonstrated. Correlated high enstrophy and dissipation regions occur in the periphery of larger structures, resulting in intermittency. Geometry characterisation indicates a predominance of tube-like structures, which are observed to form from larger ribbon-like structures through unsteady breakdown and vortex roll-up. Significant correlation between intermittent fields of dissipation and enstrophy describe the fine scales effects. These relationships should pave the way for more accurate models, capable of relating small scales and large scales during the prediction of dynamically important quantities.
