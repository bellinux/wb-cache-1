40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections and double shear bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel at elevated temperatures and post-fire condition {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel are mainly based on those of carbon steel, and are applicable for room (ambient) temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperatures. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted connections of cold-formed stainless steel structures at elevated temperatures. The key {{findings of the investigation}} are described in the following paragraphs. A total of 25 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of three different grades of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The stainless steels are austenitic stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1. 4571 (AISI 316 Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1. 4162 (AISI S 32101). Totally 434 tests on bolted connections of stainless steel were performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the nominal strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European codes for stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the material properties at elevated temperatures were used in the design equations for room temperature. It is shown that the nominal strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A total of 78 cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear bolted connections were tested in post-fire condition. The test results were compared with those tested at room temperature. Generally, it is found that the bolted connection strengths in post-fire condition cooling down from 350 and 650 ºC are higher than those tested at room temperature for all three grades of stainless steel. Finite element models for single shear and double shear bolted connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Static analysis technique was used in the numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 450 specimens were performed using the verified finite element models to evaluate the <b>bearing</b> <b>resistances</b> of bolted connections of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. Design equations for <b>bearing</b> <b>resistances</b> of cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear bolted connections were proposed based on both the experimental and numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC. The <b>bearing</b> <b>resistances</b> of bolted connections obtained from the tests and the finite element analyses were compared with the nominal strengths calculated using the current design rules and also compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the <b>bearing</b> <b>resistances</b> of bolted connections at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. The proposed design equations are recommended for bolted connections assembled using cold-formed stainless steels. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The total pullout resistance is contributed from the pullout friction and <b>bearing</b> <b>resistances.</b> The pullout friction resistance is approximated from the soil shear strength and interaction factor, α. The peak and residual interaction factors (α p and α r) are independent of molding water contents tested and are approximately 0. 63 and 0. 46, respectively.

40|$|Bearing reinforcement, {{which is}} {{composed}} of a longitudinal member (steel deformed bar) and transverse (bearing) members (a set of equal angle steel), has been established as an effective earth reinforcement material. The equation for estimating the pullout resistance of this reinforcement in coarse-grained soils has been previously developed. The usage of locally available soils as a backfill is particularly cost effective for construction sites {{where there is a}} lack of available quality materials. The pullout resistance mechanism of the bearing reinforcement embedded in cohesive-frictional soils with various fine contents is presented in this paper. The total pullout resistance is the sum of the pullout friction and <b>bearing</b> <b>resistances.</b> The pullout friction resistance is approximated from soil shear strength and interaction factor a, which is linearly related to fine content. The <b>bearing</b> pullout <b>resistance</b> of a single isolated transverse member can be approximated from the modified punching shear mechanism where the failure plane angle, b is primarily dependent upon fine content. The relationship between b and fine content is expressed by a polynomial function. The b value of p= 2 is suggested for fine contents less than 45 %.

High strain dynamic pile testing (HSDPT) which {{is provided by}} pile driving analyzer (PDA) is a more recent approach for predicting the ABC of piles. In comparison to SLT, PDA test is quick and economical. Implementing feed forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) for solving geotechnical problems hasrecently gained attention mainly due to its ability in finding complex nonlinear relationships among different parameters. In this study, an ANN-based predictive model for estimating ABC of piles and its distribution is proposed.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{contribution to}} the pull-out resistance of grid type of soil reinforcement {{is provided by the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> on the transverse members. A range of equations has been proposed in the literature to estimate this <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, these equations yield highly divergent prediction. Furthermore, these equations suggest that the <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> factor is only the function of soil friction angle but, it is not clarified whether the value of the friction angle should be taken as the peak value or the value at the critical state. Some of the published literature suggests that <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> factor deduced from test results depends on overburden pressure which is contradictory to the conventional equations. In this thesis, an attempt has been made to investigate the pull-out behaviour of a galvanised steel grid reinforcement embedded in silty sand using a combination of large scale laboratory testing and numerical modelling. A number of consolidated drained triaxial compression tests were performed to investigate the stress-strain responses, peak and critical state strength parameters and dilatancy characteristics of the soil. It was found that none of the existing equations can predict the <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> factor accurately. A modified equation for <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> factor is proposed to predict more realistic values in comparison with the test results. The bearing mechanism was numerically investigated using FLAC 2 D. This study incorporates non-linear pre-peak stress-strain behaviour based on the Duncan-Change equations and Mohr-Coulomb failure (with non-associative flow rule) as the yield surface. Two material models were used. The first one, referred to as preliminary model, assumed both the friction and dilation angle had a constant value. The second one, referred to as complete analysis, allowed post-failure strain-softening where the friction and dilation angles reducing from a peak value to the value at critical state. For the complete analysis, the initial horizontal stress was taken into account to investigate the effect of compaction in forming the pull-out test. The analysis results suggested that, the influence of test pressure on <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> factor was negligible if the friction and dilation angle, and lateral earth pressure coefficient were taken to be a constant.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of mechanical energy to electrical energy is done mainly with synchronous generators.

Because of the dominating role of the synchronous generators, {{it is important to}} minimize the power losses for efficient use of natural resources and for the economies of the electric power companies and their customers. For a synchronous machine, power loss means undesired heat production. In electric machines, there are power losses due to windage, friction in <b>bearings,</b> <b>resistance</b> in windings, remagnetization of ferromagnetic materials, and induced voltages in windings, shields and parts that are conductive but ideally should be non-conductive. The subject of this thesis is prediction of end region magnetic leakage fields in synchronous generators and the eddy current power losses they cause. The leakage fields also increase the hysteresis losses in the end regions. Magnetic flux that takes paths such that eddy current power losses increase in end regions of synchronous generators is considered to be leakage flux. Although {{only a small fraction of}} the total magnetic flux is end region leakage flux, it can cause hot spots, discoloration and reduce the service life of the insulation on the core laminations. If unattended, damaged insulation could lead to electric contact and eddy currents induced by the main flux between the outermost laminations. That gives further heating and deterioration of the insulation of laminations deeper into the core. In a severe case, the core can melt locally, cause a cavity, buckling and a short circuit of the main conductors. The whole stator may have to be replaced. However, the end region leakage flux primarily causes heating close to the main stator conductors which makes the damage possible to discover by visual inspection before it has become irrepairable...|$|R

In the conventional pullout test wherein the clamping system is outside the pullout box, the deformation and movement of hexagonal wire mesh known as necking phenomenon occurred simultaneously during the pullout process. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the large pullout test was modified to install the clamping system inside the pullout box hereinafter called “in-soil pullout test”. The total pullout resistance of hexagonal wire mesh reinforcement consists of two components, namely: friction and <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance.</b> An elastic-perfectly plastic model was used to simulate the friction resistance and relative displacement relation of hexagonal wire mesh while a hyperbolic model was applied to simulate the passive <b>bearing</b> <b>resistance</b> of the individual bearing member.

A typical values for high strength steels are: ultimate-to-yield strength ratio fu/fy = 1, 05, uniform strain εu = 0, 05 and elongation after fracture εfr = 15 %. The problem is that inelastic behaviour is hidden in numerous nominally elastic resistances checks of steel structures and therefore sufficient local ductility has to be assured. The focus is set on structural elements with holes subjected to tension and to tension splices with bolts in shear. Local ductility in terms of plastic deformations has to be sufficient in order to assure bolthole elongation, so the loading transfers through all bolts.

The statistical analysis was substantiated by additional test results on net cross-section failure of high strength steel members available in literature.
