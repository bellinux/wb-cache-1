5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press.

The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community.
