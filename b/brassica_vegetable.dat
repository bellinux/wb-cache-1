40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a {{combination}} of the need for rotational crops and an increased desire for biofuel production created interest in planting Brassica napus (canola). However, questions were raised arisen over the potential damage canola production could have on the preexisting <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> seed industry. To address these concerns three studies were conducted to: 1.) Determine the potential of gene flow and hybridization via pollen from Brassica napus to related <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> crops; 2.) Evaluate whether transgenes will be detectable in harvested <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> seed; 3.) Evaluate the potential for volunteer canola to become a contaminant in the <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> seed crops. Crossing experiments were conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2009 using Brassica rapa or Brassica oleracea inbred line receptor plants placed within conventional B. napus fields. Once seed set occurred on the receptor plants, each was harvested individually and the seed germinated in a growth chamber. Flow cytometry, morphological and molecular analyses were performed on the seedlings. Hybridization between B. napus and B. rapa inbreds was 74 % in 2007, 89 % in 2008, and 15 % in 2009. However, no hybridization occurred between B. napus and the B. oleracea inbred lines. Experiments were conducted using transgenic B. napus and the previously mentioned vegetable species, to quantify outcrossing rates in a greenhouse environment. Transgenes were detectable in both germinable and non-germinable seed produced on non-transgenic plants. Following B. napus harvest at the field sites, shattered canola seed was collected from both windrow and non-windrow locations. Approximately 30 days after the shatter samples were taken, canola seedling recruitment counts were made in quadrats placed immediately adjacent to the location of the seed shatter samples. Results of this volunteer assessment indicated differences in seed shatter between fields and windrow vs. non-windrow locations, but seedling recruitment only differed by fields. These studies indicate that canola, if grown in the Willamette Valley, has the potential to hybridize with related <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> species grown for seed. However, when managed properly, canola volunteer persistence is unlikely to be an issue within fields in the monocot crop rotations used in the Willamette Valley...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that the {{estrogen}} metabolite 16 a-hydroxyestrone acts as a breast tumor promoter. The alternative product of estrogen metabolism, 2 -hydroxyestrone, does not exhibit estrogenic properties in breast tissue, and lower values of the ratio 2 -hydroxyestrone: 16 a-hydroxyestrone (2 : 16) in urine may be an endocrine biomarker for greater breast cancer risk. Vegetables of the Brassica genus, such as broccoli, contain a phytochemical, which may shift estrogen metabolism and increase the 2 : 16 ratio. Adding 500 g/day of broccoli to a standard diet shifts 2 : 16 values upward in humans; however, it is unknown as to whether healthy women are able to consume a sufficient quantity of Brassica to affect breast cancer risk through this mechanism. In this study, 34 healthy postmenopausal women participated in an intensive intervention designed to facilitate the addition of Brassica to the daily diet. The diet was measured by repeated 24 -h recall, and estrogen metabolites were measured by enzyme immunoassay in 24 -h urine samples. In a crude analysis, there was a nonsignificant increase in the urinary 2 : 16 ratio associated with greater Brassica consumption. With adjustment for other dietary parameters, <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption was associated with a statistically significant increase in 2 : 16 values, such that for each 10 -g/day increase in Brassica consumption, there was an increase in the 2 : 16 ratio of 0. 08 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 02 – 0. 15). To the extent that the 2 : 16 ratio, as measured in urine, is associated with breast cancer risk, future research should consider <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption as a potentially effective and acceptable dietary strategy to prevent breast cancer...|$|E

40|$|Many {{research}} {{findings in the}} area of food and health cannot be simply disseminated and implemented to have a direct impact on health promotion of the society. There is an inter-dependency between various types of researches to be considered prior to community outreach. On the other hand, population health is likely to benefit from a food supply of healthier food products, based on their contents of nutrients and health promoting compounds. Many factors should be considered before justifying that a specific food can promote health. Meanwhile, researchers may not comprehend the real needs and capacity of the society to built a well integrated research design. The incomprehensive diffusion of {{research findings}} to the society could lead to a very limited, if any, practical application of the knowledge. This paper discusses the integration and expected dissemination of research to the society by using the glucosinolates content in <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> as a case study. <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables,</b> e. g. cabbages, broccoli, and cauliflower, have been widely investigated for their beneficial effects on human health, especially since <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> contain glucosinolates. Previous studies reported an inverse association of <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> consumption and the risk of certain cancers. However, this could not simply be translated into a health claim that increased <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> consumption will reduce the risk of cancer. There are many factors that could affect the glucosinolates content and bioavailability after harvesting the vegetables, e. g. processing and preparation methods. Various processing methods, such as heat treatment and fermentation, considerably decreased the glucosinolates content. In order to preserve the content of glucosinolates, certain measures must be proposed, based on the understanding of the mechanism of glucosinolate degradation during any treatments. These measures must be integrated into practice in order to give a beneficial impact on population health within the community...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the epidemiological data concerning the cancer-preventive effect of <b>brassica</b> <b>vegetables,</b> including cabbage, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. The protective effect of brassicas against cancer may be due to their relatively high content of glucosinolates. Certain hydrolysis products of glucosinolates have shown anticarcinogenic properties. The results of 7 cohort studies and 87 case control studies on the association between brassica consumption and cancer risk are summarized. The cohort studies showed inverse associations between the consumption of cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli and risk of lung cancer; between the consumption of brassicas and risk of stomach cancer; between broccoli consumption and risk of all cancers taken together; and between brassica consumption and the occurrence of second primary cancers. Of the case-control studies, 67 % showed an inverse association between consumption of total brassira vegetables and risk of cancer at various sites. For cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, these percentages were 70, 56, 67, and 29 %, respectively. Although the measured effects might have been distorted by various types of bias, it is concluded that a high consumption of <b>brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> is associated with a decreased risk of cancer.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which <b>brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> might decrease the risk of cancer are reviewed in this paper. Brassicas, including all types of cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, may be protective against cancer due to their relatively high glucosinolate content. Glucosinolates are usually broken down through hydrolysis catalyzed by myrosinase, an enzyme that is released from damaged plant cells. Some of the hydrolysis products, viz. indoles and isothiocyanates, are able to influence phase 1 and phase 2 biotransformation enzyme activities, thereby possibly influencing several processes related to chemical carcinogenesis, e. g, the metabolism, DNA-binding and mutagenic activity of promutagens. A reducing effect on tumor formation {{has been shown in}} rats and mice. The anticarcinogenic action of isothiocyanates and indoles depends upon many factors, such as the test system, the target tissue, the type of carcinogen challenge and the anticarcinogenic compound, their dosage, as well as the timing of the treatment. Most evidence concerning anticarcinogenic effects of glucosinolate hydrolysis products and <b>brassica</b> <b>vegetables</b> has come from studies in animals.

Biological control still focuses almost exclusively on a few species of hymenopteran parasitoids. Although these can be remarkably effective, insecticides continue to form the basis of management; their inappropriate use disrupts parasitoids and has resulted in field resistance to all available products. Improved ecological understanding and the availability of a series of highly effective selective insecticides throughout the 1990 s provided the basis for sustainable and economically viable integrated pest management (IPM) approaches.

Since 1970 s glucosinolates and their breakdown products, have been widely studied by their beneficial and prejudicial biological effects on human and animal nutrition. They have also {{been found to be}} partly responsible for the characteristic flavor of <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables.</b> In recent years, considerable {{attention has been paid to}} cancer prevention by means of natural products. The cancer-protective properties of Brassica intake are mediated through glucosinolates. Isothyocianate and indole products formed from glucosinolates may regulate cancer cell development by regulating target enzymes, controlling apoptosis and blocking the cell cycle. Nevertheless, variation in content of both glucosinolates and their bioactive hydrolysis products depends on both genetics and the environment, including crop management practices, harvest and storage, processing and meal preparation. Here, we review the significance of glucosinolates as source of bioactive isothiocyanates for human nutrition and health and the influence of environmental conditions and processing mechanisms on the content of glucosinolate concentration in <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Currently, this area is only partially understood. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which the environment and processing affect glucosinolates content of <b>Brassica</b> <b>vegetables.</b> This will allow us to know the genetic control of these variables, what will result in the development of high quality Brassica products with a health-promoting activity.
