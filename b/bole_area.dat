40|$|PosterWithin the {{framework}} of a Eu funded geological mapping program in Ghana, hand field magnetic susceptibility measurements have been performed to allow petrographical comparison between similar outcrop facies. This method allowed identifying varying lithologies of similar facies in north-western Ghana (<b>Bole</b> <b>area).</b> It completed geological observations, petrographical and geochemical analyses to facilitate geological mapping. Another experiment was tested on a more weathered area in the southwestern zone of Bogoso marked by a more tropical climate. Susceptibility measurements revealed only the level of weathering. We therefore replaced such method by applying hand field susceptibility measurements on collected soil samples for soil geochemistry. Around 3000 measurements were done on a 0. 5 ° square map. Magnetic susceptibility signal was therefore used as a proxy for mapping and showed more consistency with radiometric images rather than aeromagnetic images. This method revealed a good agreement with petrographical, even though on weathered rocks, field observations.

40|$|The E-W {{trending}} Tianshan range links Tarim and Junggar blocks. Its geodynamic {{development is}} clarified {{in the eastern}} Tianshan; new correlations with the western Tianshan and the continental nature of Junggar plate are documented. The eastern Tianshan resulted from a double stage Paleozoic northward accretion. A Middle Devonian suture zone runs in South Tianshan, north of Tarim passive margin, including Silurian flyschs, nappes of ophiolitic mélanges, dated as Silurian to Early-Midle Devonian, and ophiolitic bodies with a sole of amphibolites-granulites. The kinematic criteria yielded by metasedimentary greenschists indicate a northward thrusting prior to the Carboniferous intrusions. The Central Tianshan unit is composed of Ordovician island-arc volcanic rocks and a Silurian flych deposited on the Proterozoic substratum and Cambrian carbonates, and intruded by Carboniferous granites. Kinematic criteria indicate north-verging thrusting and folding, sealed by the unconformity of Lower Carboniferous conglomerates and limestones. North Tianshan is an Upper Devonian-Carboniferous continent-based island arc made of calc-alkaline basaltic and andesitic volcanics and volcaniclastics. It was affected during Late Carboniferous by northward thrusting and folding of thin-skinned tectonics style, sealed by the Middle Permian unconformity. The geodynamic evolution implies two stages. Firstly, after a southward oceanic subduction beneath the Ordovician Central Tianshan arc, the closure of South Tianshan back-arc basin led to the accretion of Tarim plate to the arc. Secondly, the continent-based North Tianshan volcanic arc built by southward subduction of the Junggar paleo-ocean collided during Late Carboniferous time with Junggar. The whole area was affected by two stages of post-collision strike-slip shearing. In the western Tianshan, new data suggest the following conclusions. The so-called "Yili block", between Yining and Narat, is actually the western extension of the North Tianshan Carboniferous island arc, diplaced by a huge late strike-slip motion, and not an independant plate nor the extension of Central Tianshan Ordovician-Silurian island arc, which is in fact located {{to the south of}} it.

The following hypotheses were tested with these data: 1) stand density regime {{has a significant}} effect on stem form; and 2) crown size controls the response of stand density regime to stem form. The five stand density regimes corresponded to five different growing-stock levels (GSLs) defined by <b>bole</b> surface <b>area.</b> A variable exponent taper model was fit to the data from each individual tree and the resulting parameters were treated as indices of stem form for comparisons among density regimes. MANOVA performed on these parameters estimates confirmed statistically significant differences in stem form both between the two lowest levels-of-growing stock and between these two treatments and all three regimes with higher levels of growing stock. The individual tree parameter estimates were also tested {{in the context of a}} seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) analysis. The two stem profile parameter estimates were closely related to diameter! height ratio and crown ratio, respectively.

40|$|Despite the {{commercial}} importance and widespread management of {{eastern white pine}} {Pinus strobus L.) in the Northeast, surprisingly {{little is known about}} the effects of thinning on even-aged stand development. To address this, patterns of leaf <b>area,</b> <b>bole</b> form, volume growth, and growth efficiency- defined as volume increment per unit leaf area- were examined over a 17 -year period within a thinning study in central Maine designed to compare the conventional B-line and low density thinning regimes. At the tree-level, many of the effects of thinning were as expected. Heavier, low density thinning resulted in significantly larger and deeper crowns with greater leaf area than equivalent trees in both the B-line and unthinned control treatments. These changes explained higher rates of diameter and volume growth. Thinning did not alter growth efficiency per se. but larger trees had slightly (but significantly) lower growth efficiency than smaller trees. Reconstruction of bole taper- quantified as Girard form class-showed that, surprisingly, B-line thinning produced more tapered butt-logs (first 5 -meter) than low density thinning, resulting from a thinning-induced growth response at breast height but not at the top of the butt-log.

40|$|Inventory-prediction {{equations}} describing snowpack {{water content}} as functions of readily available or easily obtained inventory variables were developed {{for use in}} the ponderosa pine type in Arizona. Although empirical in nature, these equations include parameters assumed to index interception of precipitation inputs, obstruction of direct beam solar radiation, and re-radiation from trees onto the snowpack. Primary consideration was given to forest cover variables in synthesizing the inventory-prediction equations I because currently proposed water improvement programs designed to increase water yield derived from snow consist essentially of vegetative manipulations. Additional independent variables evaluated include potential direct beam solar radiation, elevation, soil, and precipitation inputs. All of the inventory-prediction equations describing a particular snowpack condition were not statistically equivalent in terms of the standard error of estimate or the coefficient of determination. Equations including basal area, <b>bole</b> <b>area</b> I volume, and height-index as expressions of forest cover density were generally better than equations with point density, sum of diameters, and number of trees. Inventory-prediction equations developed to describe snowpack dynamics throughout the accumulation period showed similar statistical form, except as possibly attributable to different precipitation inputs. Equations for characterizing residual snowpacks during spring runoff were statistically weak, possibly because factors other than those considered in this study control the runoff process. The inventory-prediction equations were developed to estimate the mean snowpack water content on a basin, and to describe the trade-off, or the rate of exchange, between snowpack water content and forest-site variables on a decision-making unit. The equations do not necessarily predict changes in recoverable water yield resulting from the implementation of a land management system, however. Nonbiotic characteristics of the land, L e., topographic features, geologic formations, and soil. properties, could conceivably control water yield to the extent that changes predicted by the inventory-prediction equations could be masked. Because of limitations in predicting potential changes in recoverable water yield, it was assumed that a land management system that maximizes snowpack water content on site would also provide the maximum potential for increasing recoverable water yield derived from snow. Management guidelines designed to allow snowpack water content to be maximized on site can be formulated {{within the framework of the}} inventory-prediction equations, multiple use management constraints, and forest-based product benefits and costs. Management guidelines indicate that the greatest gain in snowpack water content on site would be realized on decision-making units where the greatest reduction in forest cover density could be prescribed. However, a timber production constraint may limit the array of management possibilities. This constraint was defined as 35 to 40 square feet of basal area or 1, 050 to 1, 175 cubic feet of volume per acre, depending upon the existing growth percent and the intermingling of tree volumes and size classes. The potential increase in snowpack water content on site will be determined by the magnitude of the reduction in forest cover density and how close management re-direction can approach the timber production constraint. The proportion of the snowpack water content on site converted to recoverable water yield is dependent upon the runoff efficiency...|$|E
40|$|In the {{research}} scope of forest stand self-thinning, the analysis reveals a broad picture {{in which the}} - 3 / 2 rule takes a definite and special place. The application of the simple geometrical model to the Douglas-fir and Scots pine data suggests that {{the slope of the}} self-thinning curve will not remain constant during the course of growth and self-thinning of a single forest stand. Most probable, at the initial stages of stand growth the slope will be less than - 3 / 2 and at old ages of the stand the slope will be higher than - 3 / 2. Inevitably, a time will come when the slope is exactly equals - 3 / 2. In other words, the slope - 3 / 2 is an obligatory state in the course of self-thinning of a forest stand. At the very time of - 3 / 2 slope two particular features coincide with it. One is that the total <b>bole</b> surface <b>area</b> remains constant. The length of the constancy stage would probably vary with species, initial stand densities, their spatial arrangements, conditions of growth, and other specific factors. Another feature of the time is that a geometric similarity in the growth of the forest stand takes place, which is not in a contradiction with the - 3 / 2 rule as it had been formulated by its authors. To put it shortly, the slope - 3 / 2 : i) is a very specific and obligatory state in the process of forest stand growth and ii) is not an asymptote but rather a transitional point (span) in the time of growth. These two assertions may be called a transitional status of the - 3 / 2 rule. The geometric model of a forest stand (Gavrikov, 2014) has proved to be rather helpful at analyzing of real forest stand structure and dynamics. Despite of its extreme simplicity (it uses cones as representations of trees) the model looks like having enough similarity with real even-aged forests since the model's predictions are often reasonably close to measured values of power exponents.

The organic layer and mineral soil from four layers (0 - 5, 5 - 15, 15 - 30, and 30 + cm), were collected beneath juniper trees of five size classes, and one area devoid of juniper on five replicated sites. Samples were taken at five distances (0 to 4 canopy radii) from tree <b>boles</b> into intercanopy <b>areas.</b> The organic layer and mineral soil were analyzed for organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and total sulfur (S); mineral soil was analyzed for exchangeable calcium (Caex), magnesium (Mgex) and potassium (Kex). Mass of the organic layer and amounts of organic layer nutrients increased with juniper size, and were higher under canopies than in intercanopy and no juniper areas. Concentrations of organic layer N, P, and S declined with distance from tree boles. Tree size, distance and soil layer interacted to affect concentrations of soil Corg, Kex, Caex and Mgex. Concentrations of soil N and S increased with tree size. Amounts of soil nutrients, except Corg, were not significantly influenced by tree size, but amounts of all soil nutrients, except S and Caex, were greater under juniper trees than intercanopy areas.

40|$|Invasion {{of western}} juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) into big {{sagebrush}} (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) communities of eastern Oregon implies redistribution of nutrients among ecosystem components, with management implications as stands mature. To assess these effects, we measured biomass and nutrients in juniper trees of five size classes ranging in average age from 36 to 161 yr, and in understory vegetation. Understory was measured at 0. 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 canopy radii from the <b>bole</b> and in <b>areas</b> devoid of juniper ("no juniper"). Tree size and distance from boles {{had no effect}} on biomass or concentrations and amounts of nutrients in understory vegetation. Above-ground tree biomass increased with maturity from 18. 4 kg for size class 1 to 741. 4 g for class 5. Biomass accumulated rapidly (22. 3 kg/tree/yr) between classes 2 and 3. Foliage comprised 41 % of tree biomass in class 1 trees, but decreased to 15 % for class 5 trees. Concomitantly, percentage of tree biomass in boles and live branches increased from 29 to 47 %. From class 1 to class 5, amounts of nutrients increased as follows: nitrogen (N) from 89 to 2117 kg/tree; phosphorus (P) from 12 to 283 g/tree; and sulfur (S) from 10 to 294 g/tree. In open systems (intercanopy and "no juniper" areas), soil contained 89. 9 to 99. 8 % of the organic carbon (Corg), N, P, and S of entire systems. For tree systems (areas occupied by juniper canopies), Corg, N, and S in aboveground biomass increased with increasing tree maturity, while P did not change. For the most mature trees, proportions of total system N, S and P allocated to the organic layer and trees was 30, 78, and 5 %, respectively. Considering the N and S limited nature of these sites, a conservative harvest management approach that emphasizes retention of organic layers and tree foliage appears prudentTiedemann and Klemmedson "Biomass and nutrient distribution and system nutrient budget for western juniper in central Oregon.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 When {{trees from}} 16 populations of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco. var. menziesii) were grown at ten {{geographically}} diverse locations for seven years, those from a Vancouver Island source {{were among the}} top three for height growth on nine of the ten plantations (Rowe and Ching, 1974). In contrast, growth of a west central Oregon source consistently ranked only poor or fair in comparison to other sources. Although each population was planted with the others at its home site, seldom did it grow better there {{than most of the}} introduced populations. I hypothesized that observed differences in growth among Douglas-fir populations were due to inherent differences in stomatal behavior and/or allocation of growth resources. I also hypothesized that definition of seasonal contrasts between field environments would help identify periods of environmental stress which would, in turn, help determine the factors most important in limiting productivity on different sites. I attempted to link studies of genetics, physiology and land classification together to provide a better biological foundation for improving forest productivity. I observed moisture stress, stomatal aperture, leaf resistance, cambial and leader growth for four populations of Douglas-fir at a Coast Range, Willamette Valley and Cascade Mountain plantation. Climatic factors including radiation, humidity, rainfall, soil and air temperature were recorded at each location for the 1971 growing season. Stomatal behavior for the four populations at the three locations was similar. In the spring before soils had warmed, stomata were partly closed at night and nearly wide open during the day. In early summer, stomata were wide open day and night. Later, as drought stress increased, stomata were closed at night, and partly closed during the day. After fall rains, stomata were again open day and night. Leaf conductance at the peak of drought was variable during the day, suggesting cyclic opening and closing of stomata, The southern source appeared to have higher conductance during the day although this trend could not be confirmed by statistical test. Except for unusually high values in the spring, plant moisture stress followed the expected daily and seasonal pattern. There were characteristic differences between locations but all populations were similar at a given area. A simulation of photosynthesis was developed around a model which predicted daily CO 2 fixation per square decimeter of foliage. Functions were included to reduce potential photosynthesis under conditions of high moisture stress, cold soils, and frost. Predicted photosynthesis for three areas revealed major differences in seasonal activity and yearly potential [...] The simulation was useful in defining seasonal contributions to total production, and the effect of drought and cold stress. It also provided an index to site productivity. At the dry interior Coast Range site, 31 percent of predicted CO 2 uptake occurred in the dormant season, while at the Cascade site, less than 10 percent accumulated in the same period. Almost 60 percent of growing season photosynthetic potential was not realized due to moisture stress in the interior Coast Range. At a Willamette Valley site on deep soils, less than 40 percent of growing season potential was lost because of moisture stress. The photosynthesis index, along with indexes of moisture stress and temperature, helped define more clearly the environmental restrictions on forest productivity at different sites. These methods should be useful in matching the biological potential of seed sources to suitable forest environments. Although there were accumulated differences in size of individuals from certain sources, cambial and leader growth of 311 populations were similar for the 1971 growing season. This was true for actual growth and when growth increment was normalized for initial tree size or needle mass, Partitioning of biomass into needles, branches and <b>bole</b> differed by <b>area,</b> but not by population. Trees at the Coast Range site had more needle mass per unit bole volume and grew more per unit leaf area than those in the mountain plantation. The large differences in growth between areas were interpretable through the physiological indexes which were generated from environment 3 l observations at each site. Analysis of growth indicated that size differences among populations were either diminishing or remaining consistent, Variations in height which prompted this study were attributed to distinctive behavior effective during establishment. Allocation of carbohydrates, photosynthetic efficiency, hormone balance, or stomatal control may be involved in explaining contrasts in early growth. Future efforts to explain genetic differences in growth of co 3 st 3 l Douglas-fir should concentrate on times when individual trees are under environmental or competitive stress...|$|R
