5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorder</b> found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorder</b> that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

40|$|Background. People with <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders</b> {{may develop}} severe {{arthritis}} due to joint hemorrhages. Exercise {{is recommended for}} people with <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders,</b> but guidelines are vague and few studies document efficacy. In this study, 65 % of people with <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders</b> surveyed reported participating in minimal exercise, and 50 % indicated a fear of exercise-induced bleeding, pain, or physical impairment.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a professionally designed, individualized, supervised exercise program for people with <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders.</b> Design. A single-group, pretest-posttest clinical design was used. Methods. Thirty-three patients (3 female, 30 male; 7 – 57 years of age) with mild to severe <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders</b> were enrolled in the study. Twelve patients had co-existing illnesses, including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, diabetes, fibromyalgia, neurofibro-matosis, osteopenia, osteogenesis imperfecta, or cancer.

40|$|The {{best known}} and most common <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders</b> are Haemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), Haemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) and von Willebrand Disease. However, these do not {{represent}} all <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders.</b> There are {{a large number of}} rarer <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders</b> both of coagulation factors and of platelets. This publication deals with nine disorders affecting coagulation factors I, II, V, VII, X, XI and XIII, in addition to two disorders affecting platelets. Generally the prevalence of these rarer bleedings disorders varies from 1 : 100, 000 (Factor XI deficiency) to 1 : 3 million (Factor XIII deficiency). The prevelance of many of these rare <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorders</b> is higher in Ireland. The reasons for this are not clear, but a small gene pool of large family sizes in the past may be contributory factors.

5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorder</b> in the royal family was hereditary.

25|$|The contact {{activation}} pathway {{begins with}} {{formation of the}} primary complex on collagen by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein, and FXII (Hageman factor). Prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the tenase complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor role that the contact activation pathway has in initiating clot formation can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} patients with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and prekallikrein do not have a <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorder.</b> Instead, contact activation system seems to be more involved in inflammation, and innate immunity. Despite this, interference with the pathway may confer protection against thrombosis without a significant bleeding risk.|$|E

2500|$|In 1924, a 5-year-old {{girl who}} lived on the Finnish Åland Islands was brought to Deaconess Hospital in Berlin, Germany, where she was seen by Dr. Erik von Willebrand. He {{ultimately}} assessed 66 members of her family and reported in 1926 that this was a previously undescribed <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorder</b> that differed from hemophilia. [...] Dr von Willebrand recognized the autosomal inheritance pattern, and noted that the bleeding symptoms were greater in children and in women of childbearing age. [...] Thus, he stated that patients with this syndrome had (1) mucocutaneous bleeding, (2) normal clotting time, (3) autosomal inheritance rather than being linked to the X chromosome, and (4) prolonged bleeding times by the Duke method (ear lobe bleeding time). He subsequently found that blood transfusions were useful not only to correct the anemia, but also to control bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} named {{coagulation}} factors that interact {{in a complex}} way to form blood clots, as discussed in the article on coagulation.

Antibodies to Factor VIII can also inactivate the Factor VII and precipitate bleeding that {{is very difficult to}} control. [...] This is a rare condition that is most likely to occur in older patients and in those with autoimmune diseases. [...] von Willebrand disease is another common <b>bleeding</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is caused by a deficiency of or abnormal function of the [...] "von Willebrand" [...] factor, which is involved in platelet activation.
