The four non-commercial frictional materials were fabricated with various percentages of phenolic <b>binder</b> <b>resin</b> (15 and 20 vol. %) and reinforced with steel fibers (15 and 20 vol. %) using hot press molding methods. Tribo tests were carried out using a small-scale tribo-tester of pad-on-disc type. Friction coefficient and wear of non-commercial and commercial brake pads were measured against each counterdisc (GCI and DGCI) and compared. Then, the friction and wear characteristic are discussed by comparing the experimental results obtained for each kind of cast iron. The results showed that maximum friction coefficient (0. 4 – 0. 5) of brake pad was attained at 2. 22 MPa applied pressure and 2. 1 m/s sliding speed when the frictional brake pad materials were tested against DGCI disc rotor. Meanwhile, similar wear rates for all frictional brake pad materials were sustained at higher applied pressure and sliding speed when tested against either type of rotor discs (GCI and DGCI). The results on the other hand, indicated that non-commercial materials NF 1 and NF 4, gave better wear resistance compared to other frictional pad materials.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to advance the field of lightweight and soft ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) inserts used in ballistic resistant-body armor, through the evaluation of chemical and physical degradation, and provide critical insight into the mechanisms involved. These inserts are comprised of non-woven UHMWPE fibers, foil-matrix low density polyethylene (LDPE), and a <b>binder</b> <b>resin.</b> Degradation of these components can be initiated by mechanical stress induced by routine use of the armor, thermal exposure due to storage and wear, and exposure to humidity and oxygen. Degradation of this system may include C-C and C-H bond ruptures resulting in C-centered radicals, thermo-oxidative reactions, as well as changes {{in the degree of}} crystallinity and the crystalline morphology of the UHMWPE fibers. This is the first comprehensive study on degraded UHMWPE-fibers extracted from body armor that have been subjected to accelerated aging. Previous studies have only focused on oxygen uptake and changes in the tensile strength of virgin UHMWPE fibers as markers of degradation. This work extends beyond oxygen uptake, to examine changes in the topography, the degree of crystallinity, and the crystal phases of UHMWPE fibers. Mechanical stress was found to be the main cause of kink band formation in UHMWPE fibers. Additionally, oxidation products and molecular oxygen were found to be at higher concentrations in the kink bands compared {{to other parts of the}} fiber. This suggests a synergistic effect between mechanical stress induced kink bands and oxidative degradation. The degree of crystallinity of the fibers did not change significantly, however morphological changes of the crystalline phases and changes in the orientation of the crystals were observed. Finally, this study investigates, for the first time, the degradation of the binder material that retains the fibers together in the laminates. The <b>binder</b> <b>resin</b> used in the laminates was identified to be a copolymer of polystyrene and polyisoprene, which undergoes oxidative degradation accompanied by a decrease in the weight-average molecular weight...|$|E
40|$|Solvent-borne {{thermally}} cured coil-coating resins contain {{large amounts}} of volatile organic solvents {{in order to obtain}} suitable flow for film application. This work describes how the expensive and environmental hazardous volatile organic solvent content of a solvent-borne thermally cured polyester/melamine coil-coating system can be reduced by introduction of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as reactive diluents and modification of the polyester <b>binder</b> <b>resin.</b> The evaluated reactive diluents, two rape seed methyl esters (RMEs), two linseed oil methyl esters (LMEs), and a tall oil methyl ester (TOME) have been evaluated both in a fully formulated clear-coat system and via model studies. Viscosity measurements of wet paint mixtures showed that formulations with hyperbranched polyester binder hold lower viscosity than conventional polyester binder resins and that FAME works as a diluent. Fully formulated clear-coats were cured under simulated industrial coil-coating cure conditions and in a convection oven at lower temperatures respectively. FAME increases the mobility of the system enhancing the film formation process. Free-standing clear-coat films were analyzed with Raman, carbon- 14 dating, extraction, dynamic mechanical analysis, and visual observation. Incorporation of FAME could not be confirmed by Raman analysis. However, carbon- 14 dating indicated the presence of FAME that could not be extracted from the films. The mechanical properties of the films were also affected by the addition of FAMEs, oven temperature, choice of co-solvent, and flash-off period. Conventional film characterization tests on substrate supported coatings indicated that <b>binder</b> <b>resin</b> structure and cure conditions affect the final film properties. Model studies were performed to clarify how FAME can chemically react through transesterification with the hydroxyl-groups of the polyester. The transesterification reaction between different FAMEs and primary alcohols with and without tertiary hydrogen was monitored with 1 H-NMR and real time IR. Evaporation and side reactions, e. g. alkene reactions, are competing factors to the transesterification reaction. The study showed that fatty acid structure, reaction time, and temperature affect the transesterification conversion, degree of side reactions, and choice of catalyst. A pigmented fully formulated polyester/melamine formulation with a reactive diluent was cured at full scale in an industrial coil-coating production facility. Evaluation of the final film properties showed that the coating fulfills the specification of conventional polyester/melamine coil-coating systems. QC 2010081...|$|E
40|$|The term {{organic coating}} {{encompasses}} conventional paints, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, water-emulsion and solution finishes, nonaqueous dispersions (organosols), plastisols and powder coatings. The following definitions {{have been used}} commonly, although they {{have not always been}} strictly applied. Paint is a suspension of finely divided pigment particles in a liquid composed of a <b>binder</b> (<b>resin)</b> and a volatile solvent, sometimes with additives to impart special characteristies. The volatile solvent evaporates from the diying fim after application, while the binder holds the pigment in the diy fim, causing it to adhere to the substrate.

Lacquer is defined as a coating that dries priariy by evaporation rather than by oxidation or polymerition.

30|$|Emulsion resins {{are widely}} used in wood-based {{materials}} for indoor furnishings. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the ability of a material to retard flame arises from the interactions between four major components: i.e., <b>binder</b> <b>resin</b> (BR); carbonizing substrate (CS); foam-producing substance (FPS); and dehydrating agent (DA). Fire performance as influenced by wetting and drying cycle (WDC) treatment has not yet been reported. This study aimed to compare the fire performance of materials coated with EVAc (ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer) and PVAc (polyvinyl acetate copolymer) emulsion resins of differing BR/CS ratios, subjected to investigation by cone calorimeter. Intumescent formulation significantly enhanced the fire retardancy of painted plywood by exhibiting lower peak heat release rates (PHRR) and longer time to reach peak release rates. Additionally, lower BR content in the fire retardant systems further enhanced flame retardancy. The fire retardancy decreases with increasing the WDC treatment, caused by the weight loss of the coating materials. Infrared (FT-IR) analysis demonstrated that lower BR content extends the survival duration of the phosphorcarbonaceous structure of chars. The findings in this study enhance the state-of-the-art understanding of the effect of the intumescent.|$|E
