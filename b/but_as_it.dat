5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was {{once part of}} a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous.

5|$|Meksi did {{not live}} to see the 1827 {{publication}} of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty.

5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Selendis is the {{executor}} of the Protoss military {{following the}} reunification of the race. The character is introduced in the novel Twilight and in the Wings of Liberty campaign, where she is played by Cree Summer. Selendis is fiercely loyal to her race's ideals and completely dedicated to her responsibilities. A protégée of Artanis, she considers the dark templar {{to be a threat}} to her heritage but is willing to work beside them. Selendis is particularly eager to reclaim Aiur from the Zerg. Shortly after Artanis cleanses Shakuras of Zerg, Selendis takes part in an expedition to rescue three stranded heroes from Aiur; however, the mission was sabotaged by Ulrezaj, who kills two of the trapped warriors. During this time, Selendis became aware of other Protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was not believed possible to save them, their existence is kept secret. Later, Selendis commands the defenses of the dark templar archives on Ehlna against attack by Zerg and Ulrezaj, resulting in Ulrezaj's defeat.|$|E

5|$|The Brill Tramway, {{also known}} as the Quainton Tramway, Wotton Tramway, Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and Metropolitan Railway Brill Branch, was a six-mile (10km) rail line in the Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire, England. It was privately built in 1871 by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham as a horse tram line to {{transport}} goods between his lands around Wotton House and the national railway network. Lobbying from residents of the nearby town of Brill led to the line's extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought for the line, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been designed and built with horses in mind, services were very slow; trains travelled at an average speed of only 4miles per hour (6.4km/h).|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for the league to enter the American market was discussed in 1987 when operators of the defunct United States Football League approached the CFL about merging the two leagues. The league showed little interest at the time, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> continued its decline, the CFL reevaluated its position. In 1992, the CFL {{announced that it would}} expand into the United States. The Sacramento Gold Miners joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup. The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 (with one team folding), but the initiative failed in most markets, and by 1996, the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada.|$|E

Curving southeastward, Althea re-emerged over open waters between Maryborough and Double Island Point on 26 December and began to intensify once again. At 00:00 UTC on 28 December, the cyclone reached a third peak with 10-minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> turned more toward the south, increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures weakened the cyclone.

5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications {{in the hope of}} finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E

5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E
5|$|As {{the threat}} of a German naval attack had been removed by the {{destruction}} of the East Asia Squadron, Australia was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades. Australia was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the Strait of Magellan during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915—Australia is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed. Temporary repairs were made, and Australia departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the ship—the former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary Eleonora Woermann—to stop and be captured. As Australia could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and Eleonora Woermann was too slow {{to keep pace with the}} battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E
