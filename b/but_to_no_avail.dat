5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's opposition to the European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E

All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested {{to the government and}} its military planners, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E

60|$|Halting {{only for}} the brief instant that was {{required}} to wrench my sword from the carcass of my late antagonist, I sprang across the chamber to the blank wall beyond, through which the thern had attempted to pass.

50|$|Bridgeports lookouts later spied {{what looked}} like a {{submarine}} periscope some 2000 yd distant on the starboard bow. Putting on full right rudder, the ship commenced firing with her starboard battery while four subchasers hurried to the spot. She fired 22 rounds, <b>but</b> apparently <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Bridgeport and her consorts reached Brest shortly afterward.|$|R
5|$|Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda {{had their}} bans {{cancelled}} early. Żmuda and Młynarczyk returned in the 1–0 home win over East Germany on 2 May 1981, and Boniek was reinstated four months later. The players' recall was {{partly due to}} the efforts of Kulesza's replacement, Antoni Piechniczek, to secure their return. According to Majchrzak, Boniek and Żmuda apologised for their actions before the General Committee for Physical Culture and Sport of the Polish People's Republic, the PZPN's governing body, but kept this from Terlecki, who appealed to have his ban lifted several times, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2000 CECAFA Cup was the 24th {{edition of}} the {{football}} tournament, which involves teams from Southern and Central Africa. The matches were played in Uganda, a decision which Tanzania protested, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Tanzania were also banned from international football by FIFA, the world football governing body. The matches were played from 18 November to 2 December 2000. Prior to the tournament, Djibouti withdrew due to monetary difficulties, but re-entered. Sudan and Zanzibar also withdrew, but stayed out. The reasoning behind their withdrawal was unknown.|$|E
5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived.

60|$|The Mosula woman kneeled behind her, while Schneider paced up {{and down}} before the door, {{threatening}} and pleading and promising, <b>but</b> all <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Presently from the deck above came a shout of warning and a shot.

5|$|At {{a special}} session of {{government}} held on 30 August 1944 in Pavelić's villa, guarded by armed men, Lorković and Vokić were accused of conspiracy against the Poglavnik and Croatia's German ally.

After the trial, he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside Vokić, Farolfi, Ljudevit Tomašić and others, although Košturić later escaped. Lorković was executed at the end of April 1945.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail,</b> as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|De Gray also faced {{resistance}} from the northern Irish. In 1212 he led a campaign against Áed Méith, in the promotion of which he constructed castles at Cáer Uisce, Belleek, and Clones, bases for raids against the Ua Néill territory in the north. A naval campaign was also launched, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> De Gray suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} Cormac O'Melaghlin in 1212 at Fircal, Offaly, and left Ireland the following year. He continued to hold the office of governor for a time, but by July 1213 he had been replaced by Henry de Loundres, the Archbishop of Dublin. One of de Gray's final acts as justiciar was to take a force of Irish knights to England to help repel a threatened invasion by the French king Philip II.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{deposition}} of Emperor Charles the Fat in 887, He tried to install his kinsman Guy II, Duke of Spoleto, {{on the throne}} and even crowned him at Langres (888), <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> avail: Odo was crowned at Paris.

5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under {{instruction}} from their manager José Pastoriza, began {{to sit back}} in their own half inviting Liverpool to attack them. Their plan worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball. The second half saw Liverpool continue to attack the Independiente goal, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Midfielders John Wark and Mølby {{tried to find a}} way through the Independiente defence was equal to their efforts. Wark's efforts trying to engineer an equalising goal resulted in him being substituted for Ronnie Whelan in the 76th minute, due to fatigue.|$|E
60|$|The {{knowledge}} {{that she had}} been grossly deceived by her conductor at last had the effect of arousing the girl to a sense of her danger. Something must be wrong. Something was decidedly wrong, and fear crept into her heart. She pounded on the glass windows with all her strength, and shouted as loudly as she could, <b>but</b> all <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1949 {{the team}} moved again, <b>to</b> Louisville, Kentucky, <b>but</b> it was <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail</b> and the Louisville Buckeyes {{returned}} to Cleveland {{for the first}} two months of the 1950 season before disbanding.|$|R
5000|$|The term Puppen {{has been}} used before. Even the Emperor’s own wife Augusta Viktoria (1858-1921), had {{reportedly}} been unhappy about it and had tried to persuade him not {{to go ahead with}} it, <b>but</b> all <b>to</b> <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> Just one woman has been depicted, Elisabeth of Bavaria ("Schöne Else" [...] or beautiful Beth) praying on her knees before her husband. The lack of women was already noted by the contemporaries.|$|R
