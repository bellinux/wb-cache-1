500|$|More severe {{forms of}} hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{lead to a}} worsening level of consciousness, from lethargy to somnolence and eventually coma. In the intermediate stages, a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is observed (asterixis, [...] "liver flap" [...] due to its flapping character); this disappears as the somnolence worsens. There is disorientation and amnesia, and uninhibited behaviour may occur. In the third stage, neurological examination may reveal clonus and positive <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign.</b> Coma and seizures represent the most advanced stage; cerebral oedema (swelling of the brain tissue) leads to death.|$|E
2500|$|If fibres of the corticospinal tracts are damaged {{anywhere}} {{along their}} course from the cerebral cortex {{to the lower}} end of the spinal cord, this will give rise to an upper motor neuron syndrome. A few days after the injury to the upper motor neurons, a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears, including spasticity, hyperactive reflexes, a loss of the ability to perform fine movements, and an extensor plantar response known as the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign.</b> Symptoms generally occur alongside other sensory problems. Causes of damage may include masses such as strokes, subdural hemorrhage, abscesses and tumours, [...] inflammation such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis, and trauma to the spinal cord, including from slipped discs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> is present, {{where the}} big toe is raised (extended) rather than curled {{downwards}} (flexed) upon appropriate stimulation of the sole of the foot. The presence of the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> is an abnormal response in adulthood. Normally, during the plantar reflex, it causes plantar flexion and the adduction of the toes. In Babinski's sign, there is dorsiflexion of the big toe and abduction of the other toes. Physiologically, it is normally present in infants from birth to 12 months. The presence of the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> after 12 months is {{the sign of a}} non-specific upper motor neuron lesion.|$|E
5000|$|Extensor: the hallux dorsiflexes, and {{the other}} toes fan out; this is <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign,</b> which {{indicates}} damage to the central nervous system.|$|R
50|$|Hoffmann's reflex {{is often}} erroneously called 'the <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign</b> {{of the upper}} limb'. However the two {{reflexes}} are quite different, {{and should not be}} equated with each other.|$|R
40|$|Atypical Friedreich's ataxia was {{diagnosed}} by DNA-analysis in 4 patients, 2 men aged 70 and 67 and 2 women aged 32 and 37, who had features that included an onset of ataxia {{after the age}} of 25, retained tendon reflexes or hyperreflexia, absence of <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign,</b> and/or a slowly progressive course. Friedreich's ataxia is the most frequent autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. Classical characteristics of the disease are a progressive cerebellar ataxia with an onset before the age of 25, loss of lower extremity tendon reflexes, and bilateral <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign.</b> However, DNA-diagnostic testing based upon the detection of expanded GAA-repeats in the X 25 -gene, has shown that the clinical spectrum is broader than was previously assumed...|$|R

50|$|The {{plantar reflex}} is a reflex {{elicited}} when {{the sole of}} the foot is stimulated with a blunt instrument. The reflex can take one of two forms. In normal adults, the plantar reflex causes a downward response of the hallux (flexion). An upward response (extension) of the hallux is known as the Babinski response or <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign,</b> named after the neurologist Joseph Babinski. The presence of the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> can identify disease of the spinal cord and brain in adults, and also exists as a primitive reflex in infants.|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} (males, black, ages 37, 40 and 57) {{attended a}} university clinic with a progressive paraparesis of obscure origin. One patient who referred disease duration {{of more than}} 16 years, showed diminished deep reflexes, bilateral <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign,</b> diminished sensation of vibration, abnormal bladder function and back pain. The other two patients (with one and six years of disease duration) complained of weakness in one leg, increased deep reflexes and back pain. <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign</b> and bladder disturbance were also present in the patient with six years of disease. Blood samples tested by an enzyme immune assay and a discriminatory Western blot were positive for HTLV-I. The familial analysis of one patient showed a possible pattern of sexual and vertical transmission of the virus.

40|$|Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive spinocerebellar degenerative disease characterized by hyperexpansion of GAA triplets in Frataxin gene. The hallmark of this disorder is ataxic gait, areflexia, <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign</b> and positive Romberg test.

5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (<b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign)</b> in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Jules François Félix Babinski (Józef Julian Franciszek Feliks Babiński; 17 November 1857 - 29 October 1932) was a French {{neurologist}} of Polish descent.

50|$|Examination reveals {{decreased}} {{muscle tone}} of the extremities and depression of tendon reflexes. Pupillary reaction to light may be sluggish, but the corneal reflexes are preserved.

50|$|An initial {{diagnosis}} of PMA {{could turn out}} to be slowly progressive ALS many years later, sometimes even decades after the initial diagnosis.

50|$|Charles Gilbert Chaddock {{was born}} in 1861 in Jonesville, Michigan. He {{qualified}} in medicine in 1885, and worked at the North Michigan Asylum in Traverse City. He spent a year studying in Europe in 1888. He became Professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Marion-Sims College of St. Louis University. He returned to Europe in 1897, spending {{most of the time}} as assistant to Joseph Babinski. On his return to the United States in 1899 he introduced American physicians to <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign,</b> later publishing a translation of Babinski's work.|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} difference between Hoffmann's reflex and the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> are their mechanism of reflex. Hoffman's reflex is a deep tendon reflex (spindle fibre) with a monosynaptic reflex pathway in Rexed lamina IX of the spinal cord. On the other hand, the plantar reflex is not a deep tendon reflex, and its pathway is both more complicated and not fully understood.|$|E
50|$|The Hoffmann's reflex is {{sometimes}} {{described as the}} upper limb equivalent of the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> because both indicate upper motor neuron dysfunction. Mechanistically, they differ significantly; the finger flexor reflex is a simple monosynaptic spinal reflex involving the flexor digitorum profundus that is normally fully inhibited by upper motor neurons. The pathway producing the plantar response is more complicated, and is not monosynaptic.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> can {{indicate}} upper {{motor neuron}} lesion constituting {{damage to the}} corticospinal tract. Occasionally, a pathological plantar reflex is {{the first and only}} indication of a serious disease process and a clearly abnormal plantar reflex often prompts detailed neurological investigations, including CT scanning of the brain or MRI of the spine, as well as lumbar puncture for the study of cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
25|$|Over time, people {{experience}} increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign</b> also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|R

Toe flexors are innervated by the tibial nerve. Toe extensors (extensor hallicus longus, extensor digitorum longus) are innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. Loss of normal adult descending pyramidal control of the reflex arc to suppress extensor withdrawal results in the upgoing toes in the plantar reflex known as <b>Babinski's</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{positive}} <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> {{is considered}} a pathological sign of upper motor neuron disease except for infants, in whom it is normal. Whereas, a positive Hoffmann's sign can be present in an entirely normal patient. A positive Hoffman's sign in the normal patients is more commonly found in those who are naturally hyper-reflexive (e.g. 3+ reflexes). A positive Hoffmann's sign is a worrisome finding of a disease process if its presence is asymmetrical, or has an acute onset.|$|E

Bilateral spastic paresis may develop and pressure, vibration and touch sense are diminished. A positive <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign</b> may be seen. Prolonged deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to irreversible nervous system damage.

50|$|Any upper {{motor neuron}} lesion, {{also known as}} {{pyramidal}} insufficiency, occurs in the neural pathway above the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Such lesions can arise {{as a result of}} stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or other acquired brain injury. The resulting changes in muscle performance that can be wide and varied are described overall as upper motor neuron syndrome. Symptoms can include muscle weakness, decreased motor control including a loss of the ability to perform fine movements, increased vigor (and decreased threshold) of spinal reflexes including spasticity, clonus (involuntary, successive cycles of contraction/relaxation of a muscle), and an extensor plantar response known as the <b>Babinski</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
