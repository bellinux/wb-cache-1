25|$|In general PDZ domains bind {{to a short}} {{region of}} the C-terminus of other {{specific}} proteins. These short regions bind to the PDZ domain by beta sheet augmentation. This means that the beta sheet in the PDZ domain is extended {{by the addition of}} a further <b>beta</b> <b>strand</b> from the tail of the binding partner protein.|$|E
25|$|Cystatin C is a non-glycosylated, basic protein (isoelectric {{point at}} pH 9.3). The crystal {{structure}} of cystatin C {{is characterized by}} a short alpha helix and a long alpha helix which lies across a large antiparallel, five-stranded beta sheet. Like other type 2 cystatins, it has two disulfide bonds. Around 50% of the molecules carry a hydroxylated proline. Cystatin C forms dimers (molecule pairs) by exchanging subdomains; in the paired state, each half is made up of the long alpha helix and one <b>beta</b> <b>strand</b> of one partner, and four beta strands of the other partner.|$|E
25|$|The Chou–Fasman {{method is}} an {{empirical}} technique for {{the prediction of}} secondary structures in proteins, originally developed in the 1970s by Peter Y. Chou and Gerald D. Fasman. The method is based on analyses of the relative frequencies of each amino acid in alpha helices, beta sheets, and turns based on known protein structures solved with X-ray crystallography. From these frequencies a set of probability parameters were derived for the appearance of each amino acid in each secondary structure type, and these parameters are used to predict {{the probability that a}} given sequence of amino acids would form a helix, a <b>beta</b> <b>strand,</b> or a turn in a protein. The method is at most about 50–60% accurate in identifying correct secondary structures, which is significantly less accurate than the modern machine learning–based techniques.|$|E

2500|$|The SH3-type barrel {{tertiary}} {{structure of the}} LSm fold is formed by the strongly bent (about 120°) β2, β3 and β4 strands, with the barrel structure closed by the β5 strand. [...] Emphasizing the {{tertiary structure}}, each bent <b>beta</b> <b>strand</b> {{can be described as}} two shorter beta strands. [...] The LSm fold can be viewed as an eight-strand anti-parallel beta sandwich, with five strands in one plane and three strands in a parallel plane with about a 45° pitch angle between the two halves of the beta sandwich. [...] The short (two to four turns) N-terminal alpha helix occurs at one edge of the beta sandwich. [...] This alpha helix and the beta strands can be labeled (from the N-terminus to the C-terminus) α, β1, β2a, β2b, β3a, β3b, β4a, β4b, β5 where the a and b refer to either the two halves of a bent strand in the five-strand description, or to the individual strands in the eight-strand description. [...] Each strand (in the eight-strand description) is formed from five amino acid residues. Including the bends and loops between the strands, and the alpha helix, about 60 amino acid residues contribute to the LSm fold, but this varies between homologs due to variation in inter-strand loops, the alpha helix, and even the lengths of β3b and β4a strands.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{oligomerization}} of PA63, {{molecules of}} EF and/or LF rapidly and simultaneously bind to the PA prechannel. This binding occurs because after removing the PA20 domain, a large hydrophobic surface is uncovered on domain 1 of PA63. Domain 1 provides a large surface that the {{interacts with the}} N-terminus of EF and LF, which is almost completely homologous for the first ~36 residues and similar in tertiary structure for the first ~250 residues. Studies on the binding region of LF and EF demonstrated that a large surface area contacts with domain 1 of two adjacent PA63 molecules when in the heptamer conformation. This large binding area explains why previous studies could only bind up to three molecules on a PA63 heptamer. The co-crystal structure of the PA octamer in complex with N-terminal LF revealed that the binding interaction is, in fact, two discontinuous sites. One site, termed the C-terminal subsite, resembles a classic [...] "hot-spot" [...] with predicted salt-bridges and electrostatic interactions. The other site, termed the alpha-clamp subsite, is a deep cleft that nonspecifically binds the N-terminal alpha helix and short <b>beta</b> <b>strand</b> of LF, guiding the N-terminus of the substrate towards the PA prechannel lumen. In this manner, the alpha clamp aids in protein translocation, nonspecifically binding and subsequently unfolding secondary structure as it unfurls from the substrate. The LF/EF binding site is now being utilized for delivery of therapeutics via fusion proteins.|$|E
