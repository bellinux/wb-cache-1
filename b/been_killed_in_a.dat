5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene.

As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
