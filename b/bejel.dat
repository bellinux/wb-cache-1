5000|$|<b>Bejel</b> {{is mainly}} found in arid {{countries}} of the eastern Mediterranean region and in West Africa, where it is known as sahel. (Sahel disease, which should be distinguished from [...] "Sahel", the geographical band between the Northern Sahara and Southern Sudan.) ...|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} clinical, {{but as with}} yaws and <b>bejel,</b> {{serological}} tests for syphilis, such as rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and TPHA, will be positive, and the spirochetes {{can be seen on}} dark field microscopy of samples taken from the early papules.|$|E
50|$|These {{tests are}} more {{specific}} for syphilis than non-treponemal tests and, {{in the presence}} of a positive test, more likely indicate active infection.

50|$|<b>Bejel</b> usually {{begins in}} {{childhood}} {{as a small}} mucous patch, often on {{the interior of the}} mouth, followed by the appearance of raised, eroding lesions on the limbs and trunk.

50|$|The {{subspecies}} causing yaws, pinta, and <b>bejel,</b> {{which often}} cause lesions {{on the skin}} and mucous membranes {{as well as on}} soft tissue and bone, are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from T. p. pallidum (syphilis); however, their transmission is not venereal in nature and the course of each disease is significantly different.|$|E
50|$|Treponema pallidum is a spirochaete {{bacterium}} with subspecies {{that cause}} treponemal {{diseases such as}} syphilis, <b>bejel,</b> pinta, and yaws. They are helically coiled microorganisms that are usually 6-15 µm long and 0.1-0.2 µm wide. The treponemes have a cytoplasmic and an outer membrane. Using light microscopy, treponemes are visible only by using dark field illumination. They are Gram negative, but some regard them as too thin to be Gram stained.|$|E

50|$|The global {{prevalence}} {{of this disease}} and the other endemic treponematoses, <b>bejel</b> and pinta, was reduced by the Global Control of Treponematoses (TCP) programme between 1952 and 1964 from about 50 to 150 million cases to about 2.5 million (a 95 percent reduction). Following the cessation of this program yaws surveillance and treatment {{became a part of}} primary health systems of the affected countries. However incomplete eradication led to a resurgence of yaws in the 1970s with the largest number of case found in the Western Africa region.|$|E
50|$|Yaws {{is spread}} by {{direct contact with}} the fluid from a lesion of an {{infected}} person. The contact is usually of a non-sexual nature. The disease is most common among children, who spread it by playing together. Other related treponemal diseases are <b>bejel</b> (Treponema pallidum endemicum), pinta (Treponema pallidum carateum), and syphilis (Treponema pallidum pallidum). Yaws is often diagnosed by the appearance of the lesions. Blood antibody tests may be useful but cannot separate previous from current infections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most accurate method of diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Treponema pallidum {{subspecies}} pallidum is a spiral-shaped, Gram-negative, highly mobile bacterium. Three {{other human}} diseases {{are caused by}} related Treponema pallidum subspecies, including yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum) and <b>bejel</b> (subspecies endemicum). Unlike subtype pallidum, they do not cause neurological disease. Humans are the only known natural reservoir for subspecies pallidum. It is unable to survive {{more than a few}} days without a host. This is due to its small genome (1.14 Mbp) failing to encode the metabolic pathways necessary to make most of its macronutrients. It has a slow doubling time of greater than 30 hours.|$|E
50|$|Pinta, {{the least}} severe of treponemal infections being {{limited to the}} skin, {{is thought to be}} {{transmitted}} by skin-to-skin contact (similar to <b>bejel</b> and yaws), and after an incubation period of two to three weeks, produces a raised papule, which enlarges and becomes hyperkeratotic (scaly/flaky). Lesions are usually present in the exposed surface of arms and legs. Local lymph nodes might be enlarged. Three to 9 months later, further thickened and flat lesions (pintids) appear all over the body. These generally resolve, but a proportion of people with pinta will go on to develop late-stage disease, characterised by widespread pigmentary change with a mixture of hyperpigmentation and depigmentation which can be disfiguring.|$|E
50|$|Yaws is a rarely fatal {{but highly}} disfiguring disease {{caused by the}} spiral-shaped {{bacterium}} (spirochete) Treponema pallidum pertenue, a relative of the syphilis bacteria Treponema pallidum pallidum, spread through skin to skin contact with infectious lesions. The global prevalence of this disease and the other endemic treponematoses, <b>bejel</b> and pinta, was reduced by the Global Control of Treponematoses (TCP) programme between 1952 and 1964 from about 50 million cases to about 2.5 million (a 95% reduction). However, following the cessation of this program these diseases remained at a low prevalence in parts of Asia, Africa and the Americas with sporadic outbreaks. According to a 2012 official WHO roadmap, the elimination should be achievable by 2020. Yaws is currently targeted by the South-East Asian Regional Office of the WHO for elimination from the remaining endemic countries in this region (India, Indonesia and East Timor) by 2010, and so far, this appears to have met with some success, since no cases have been seen in India since 2004. The discovery that oral antibiotic azithromycin can be used instead of the previous standard, injected penicillin, was tested on Lihir Island from 2013-2014; a single oral dose of the macrolide antibiotic reduced disease prevalance from 2.4% to 0.3% at 12 months. The campaign was in an early stage in 2013, still gathering data on disease incidence and planning initial large-scale treatment campaigns in Cameroon, Ghana, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.|$|E

40|$|Background: T. pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) is the causative {{agent of}} <b>bejel</b> (also known as endemic syphilis).

40|$|AbstractPathogenic uncultivable treponemes, {{similar to}} syphilis-causing Treponema pallidum {{subspecies}} pallidum, include T. pallidum ssp. pertenue, T. pallidum ssp. endemicum and Treponema carateum, which cause yaws, <b>bejel</b> and pinta, respectively.

Genome comparisons between pallidum and non-pallidum treponemes revealed genes with potential involvement in human infectivity, whereas comparisons between pallidum and pertenue treponemes identified genes possibly involved in the high invasivity of syphilis treponemes. Genetic variability within syphilis strains is considered as the basis of syphilis molecular epidemiology with potential to detect more virulent strains, whereas genetic variability within a single strain is related to its ability to elude the immune system of the host. Genome analyses also shed light on treponemal evolution and on chromosomal targets for molecular diagnostics of treponemal infections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Improved {{understanding}} of the differential diagnosis of endemic treponematoses is needed to inform clinical practice and to ensure the best outcome for a new global initiative for the eradication of yaws, <b>bejel,</b> and pinta. Traditionally, the human treponematoses have been differentiated based upon their clinical manifesta-tions and epidemiologic characteristics because the etiologic agents are indistinguishable in the laboratory. Serological tests are still considered standard laboratory methods for the diagnosis of endemic treponematoses and new rapid point-of-care treponemal tests have become available which are extremely useful in low-resource settings. In the past ten years, {{there has been an}} increasing effort to apply polymerase chain reaction to treponematoses and whole genome fingerprinting tech-niques have identified genetic signatures that can differentiate the existing treponemal strains; however, definitive diagnosis is also hampered by widespread unavailability of molecular diagnostics.

40|$|MEN {{are being}} {{returned}} to the United States in increasing numbers from regions {{where they have been}} exposed to tropical diseases, hitherto largely unfamiliar to most physicians in this quarter of the world.

A description of such phenomena as they occur in tropical diseases may be of aid in diagnosis and in their differentia-tion from the better known diseases of joints as seen in temperate climates. Arthritis is well known as a complication of a few tropical diseases and may occur, though less commonly, in many others. In the former group are bacillary dysentery, fungus infections such as coccidioidomycosis and Madura foot, filariasis and undulant fever.

40|$|Background Pathogenic uncultivable treponemes {{comprise}} {{human and}} animal pathogens including agents of syphilis, yaws, <b>bejel,</b> pinta, and venereal spirochetosis in rabbits and hares. A set of 10 treponemal genome sequences including those of 4 Treponema pallidum ssp. palli-dum (TPA) strains (Nichols, DAL- 1, Mexico A, SS 14), 4 T. p. ssp. pertenue (TPE) strains (CDC- 2, Gauthier, Samoa D, Fribourg-Blanc), 1 T. p. ssp. endemicum (TEN) strain (Bosnia A) and one strain (Cuniculi A) of Treponema paraluisleporidarum ecovar Cuniculus (TPLC) were examined {{with respect to the}} presence of nucleotide intrastrain heterogeneous sites.

40|$|Bacteria of {{the species}} Treponema pallidum are causative agents of venereal {{syphilis}} (Treponema pallidum pallidum), <b>Bejel</b> (T. p. endemicum), and yaws (T. p. pertenue) in humans.

To examine the evolutionary relatedness of these treponemes to those responsible for diseases in humans and for previously documented infections in baboons (Papio papio), we conducted a hybridization capture experiment to enrich Treponema pallidum DNA from samples collected from symptomatic individuals. This approach allowed us to sequence the full genomes of Treponema pallidum strains infecting sooty mangabeys (n[*]=[*] 2) and green monkeys (n[*]=[*] 4). Phylogenomic analyses revealed that all Treponema pallidum strains infecting non-human primates are most {{closely related to the}} sub-species T. p. pertenue.

The star-like phylogenetic branching pattern of the T. p. pertenue clade, with short basal branches receiving low statistical support, suggests a rapid initial radiation across humans and non-human primates.

40|$|Syphilis is {{the best}} known treponemal {{infection}} and the disease has {{captured the attention of}} well-known physicians and the imaginations of writers and artists. In contrast, the nonvenereal treponemal infections (yaws, <b>bejel,</b> and pinta) have been endemic in remote regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America, and are thus less well-known in western culture. However, these endemic treponematoses were so prevalent that, between 1952 and 1964, the World Health Organization (WHO) undertook a massive eradication campaign in which over 300 million people in Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific islands, and the Middle East were examined and, 50 million were treated with penicillin [1]. It is estimated that the burden of disease was reduced by 95 %. In the mid 1980 s, the Fogarty International Center and WHO sponsored a series of regional meetings to gather information about the status of the endemic treponematoses [2 – 4]. Numerous foci of infection were identified in Africa, Asia, and South America, and the recommendation was made to focus new efforts on control, with the goal of elimination. The HIV epidemic intervened and the attention of the global health community was appropriately diverted to AIDS, thus interrupting the momentum for elimination of the treponematoses. Since that time, because of little to no surveillance in many areas, the current magnitude of the diseases is unknown, although foci of yaws and endemic syphilis have periodically been reported.

More than 100 million additional children are at risk to these disabling and disfiguring infections which destroy tissue and bone. In the 1950 's and 1960 's, through concerted efforts and leadership of UNICEF and WHO, more than 50 million individuals in 46 countries were cured and the diseases were brought under control or even eliminated from large parts of the world. Despite this success, endemic foci remained and {{in the last ten years}} there has been an alarming resurgence of the endemic treponematoses, in particular in parts of West and Central-Africa. Endemic treponematoses control is based on treatment with single-dose penicillin of the entire treponemal reservoir, and of all clinical cases and their contacts presumed to be incubating the disease. No instances of penicillin-resistance have been documented to date and these infections should be eliminated while the organisms still remain sensitive to penicillin. An endemic treponematoses control programme must be fully integrated into the primary health care system. The persistence of endemic treponematoses in an area is an indicator of failing effectiveness of primary health care. From recent consultations with Member States, WHO Collaborating Centres and expert groups, a consensus regarding the fundamental components of endemic treponematoses control has emerged. Effective disease control requires coordinated and complementary activities by WHO and Member States. The interruption of disease transmission is a feasible and realistic objective for renewed control programmes...|$|E
