5|$|Etty died in 1849, and {{his work}} enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him {{declined}} over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen <b>below</b> <b>their</b> original levels. Following his death, nude paintings went out of fashion very rapidly in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The last {{portion of}} the report dealt with {{eliminating}} the debt by utilizing a sinking fund that would retire {{five percent of the}} debt annually until it was paid off. Due to the bonds being traded well <b>below</b> <b>their</b> face value, the purchases would benefit the government as the securities rose in price.|$|E

5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of corporate}} enterprises became {{common in the}} 11th century. Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names <b>below</b> <b>their</b> creations.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{promotion}} it received, upon release the game only reached #18 in the Dengeki charts with initial sales of 14,000 units. Its sales continued {{to fall and}} within three weeks the game {{had dropped out of}} the Dengeki Top 50. By the end of the year, Nine had sold just over 30,000. According to Atlus, the game's sales {{by the end of the}} 2002-2003 fiscal year had reached 45,000 units: this fell <b>below</b> <b>their</b> planned sales number of 67,000 units. In May, Atlus announced that the development costs and poor sales of Xbox games, including Nine, had resulted in a financial loss for that year.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, {{until his death}} in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen <b>below</b> <b>their</b> original prices.|$|E

5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, <b>below)</b> <b>their</b> squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm. He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen <b>below</b> <b>their</b> original prices.|$|E
5|$|Paid {{promotion}} largely {{followed this}} pattern, as the HDZ and the SDP were two dominant parties {{in that field}} as well. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted in its report that the largest parties reported their advertising spending <b>below</b> <b>their</b> actual value, and the largest proportion of expenditure was for television ads. Election silence is in force {{on the day of}} the elections and the previous day, ending at 7 in the evening as polling stations close and exit polls may be published after that time.|$|E

5|$|Paris {{is a city}} {{of books}} and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent <b>below</b> <b>their</b> publisher's cover price.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of water-based and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as {{various types of}} fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae. Field work on Narrabeen Lakes showed that Pacific blue-eyes spent time near the surface looking for dead flying insects, consuming anything <b>below</b> <b>their</b> mouth gape size. This varied from around 2.5 to 3.5mm, and was proportional {{to the length of}} the fish. The Pacific blue-eye forages using vision, and the turbidity of the water affects its ability to find food.|$|E
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell <b>below</b> <b>their</b> parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, {{and more than a}} million {{families}} bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33â€“55 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold <b>below</b> <b>their</b> market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets <b>below</b> <b>their</b> prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E
5|$|They were {{designed}} to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives, the Merchant Navy class, to permit use on {{a wider variety of}} routes, including in the south-west of England and the Kent coast. They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently far <b>below</b> <b>their</b> capabilities. A total of 110locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Three of Burne-Jones's studio assistants, John Melhuish Strudwick, T.M. Rooke and Charles Fairfax Murray, {{went on to}} {{successful}} painting careers. Murray later became an important collector and respected art dealer. Between 1903 and 1907 he sold a great many works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, at far <b>below</b> <b>their</b> market worth. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery now has the largest collection of works by Burne-Jones in the world, including the massive watercolour Star of Bethlehem, commissioned for the Gallery in 1897. The paintings are believed by some to have influenced the young J. R. R. Tolkien, then growing up in Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|While Australian Naval Reserve {{personnel}} {{are assigned to}} permanent units, {{most members of the}} Army Reserve and Air Force Reserve are members of reserve units. Most of the RAAF's reserve units are not intended to be deployed, and reserve {{personnel are}} generally attached to regular air force units during their periods of active service. The Army Reserve is organised into permanent combat and support units, though most are currently manned at levels well <b>below</b> <b>their</b> authorised strengths and are not capable of deploying as formed units. There have been long-running debates over whether the Army Reserve and its structure remain relevant to modern warfare.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits {{of his friends}} and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen <b>below</b> <b>their</b> original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
