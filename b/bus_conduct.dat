40|$|Contemporary {{research}} on travel-time use challenges {{the notion that}} travel-time is wasted, but is it always a positive experience? Previous {{studies have suggested that}} engaging in activity during travel-time increases the utility of a journey, and thus regaining and maintaining control over time on-the-move is hypothesised to {{have a positive effect on}} the passenger experience through a sense that the time has gained value. The results presented here challenge this finding in the specific context of bus travel. To explore travel-time use in relation to the bus passenger experience, this paper draws upon data from a mixed-methods approach: online Facebook discussions, focus groups, and a survey of 840 <b>bus</b> passengers <b>conducted</b> in Bristol, UK. Despite travel-time activity on the bus being an integral part of many journeys, a consistent association with improvements in journey experience and service perception is challenged. The personalisation and privatisation of travel space through activities – from reading to listening to iPods – may be purposively sought to disengage from the bus community, however, such technology use and disengagement may be symptomatic of uncomfortable experiences such as boredom and stress, as opposed to a creator of positive utility or distinct experience of enjoyment. Furthermore, disengagement can negatively impact upon the sociality of the bus space. It is suggested that wider factors are of more primary significance than travel-time activity in forming perceptions and experiences. The conclusions will consider the implications for transport policy and bus operations...|$|R

50|$|A single bus {{consists}} of a wire pair with 70-85 Ω impedance at 1 MHz. Where a circular connector is used, its center pin {{is used for the}} high (positive) Manchester bi-phase signal. Transmitters and receivers couple to the bus via isolation transformers, and stub connections branch off using a pair of isolation resistors and, optionally, a coupling transformer. This reduces the impact of a short circuit and ensures that the <b>bus</b> does not <b>conduct</b> current through the aircraft. A Manchester code is used to present both clock and data on the same wire pair and to eliminate any DC component in the signal (which cannot pass the transformers). The bit rate is 1.0 megabit per second (1 bit per μs). The combined accuracy and long-term stability of the bit rate is only specified to be within ±0.1%; the short-term clock stability must be within ±0.01%. The peak-to-peak output voltage of a transmitter is 18-27 V.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ability to}} obtain {{accurate}} predictions of bus arrival {{time on a}} real time basis is vital to both bus operations control and passenger information systems. Several studies have been devoted to this arrival time prediction problem in many countries; however, few resulted in completely satisfactory algorithms. This paper presents an effective method {{that can be used}} to predict the expected bus arrival time at individual bus stops along a service route. This method is a hybrid scheme that combines a neural network (NN) that infers decision rules from historical data with Kalman filter (KF) that fuses prediction calculations with current GPS measurements. The proposed algorithm relies on real-time location data and takes into account historical travel times as well as temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions. A case study on a real <b>bus</b> route is <b>conducted</b> to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the system is capable of achieving satisfactory performance and accuracy in predicting bus arrival times for Egyptian environments...|$|R

40|$|Transfer is a {{fundamental}} component of transit journey that expands the spatial coverage of transit service to satisfy increasingly diversifying travel needs. Despite the benefits that transfers can offer, transferring a transit service or mode is generally perceived as a burden to the whole transit journey experience. The conventional approach of reflecting the inconvenience of transfer has been through integrating the additional time and cost incurred during transfer, or transfer penalty that encapsulates subjective and physiological factors in the mode choice model {{in the form of}} generalised transfer costs. This study builds upon the hypothesis that transit users will have a preference for the direction of travel towards their transfer point. A total of 11, 409 single-transfer bus journeys were derived from Brisbane’s go card dataset. Each journey’s origin, transfer, and destination points were projected to a standardised two-dimensional Euclidean space by applying translation, rotation and compression/dilation transformation. As next, the grid-based hierarchical clustering was used to divide the Euclidean space into 150 cells to quantify the “preference” for transfer direction and position {{based on the number of}} transfer points in each cell. Majority of <b>bus</b> journeys <b>conducted</b> have made a transfer either near the origin or destination. Less number of transit journeys are realised if one is required to make a transfer that is deviated far from the straight line connecting the origin and destination. The straight line between origin and destination could be considered as the private vehicle path perceived by travellers. The deviation from the straight line may imply the impedance of transfer, which is likely to reduce the attractiveness of transit option. Findings from this study present a new approach to explain the transfer and associated travel behaviours...|$|R

Calculation of fuel consumption and fuel costs for these three different <b>bus</b> technologies was <b>conducted</b> for road network of the Republic of Serbia. Three scenarios were considered. The first scenario includes bus traffic volume carried {{out on the road}} network in 2014.

Obtained results show that in intercity bus service the greatest influence on the fuel consumption of buses has operating speed of the bus, followed by terrain type on which buses operate. The impact of other factors (international roughness index, fluctuation of traffic volume by 20 %, and correction factors of fuel consumption) is less pronounced. In various operating conditions the fuel cost savings per 100 km of compressed natural gas buses compared to diesel buses are in the range of € 8. 84 - 12. 16.
