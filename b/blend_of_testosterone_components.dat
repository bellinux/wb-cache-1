40|$|Effect <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> on immunocompetence, {{parasite}} load, and metabolism in {{the common}} wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) A. Oppliger, M. S. Giorgi, A. Conelli, M. Nembrini, and H. B. John-Alder Abstract: Testosterone can benefit individual fitness by increasing ornament colour, aggressiveness, and sperm quality, {{but it can also}} impose both metabolic and immunological costs. However, evidence that testosterone causes immuno-suppression in freely living populations is scant. We studied the effects <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> on one <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the im-mune system (i. e., the cell-mediated response to phytohaemagglutinin), parasite load, and metabolic rate {{in the common}} wall lizard, Podarcis muralis (Laurenti, 1768). For analyses of immunocompetence and parasitism, male lizards were implanted {{at the end of the}} breeding season with either empty or testosterone implants and were returned to their site of capture for 5 – 6 weeks before recapture. For analyses of the effects <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> on metabolic rate, male lizards were captured and implanted before hibernation and were held in the laboratory for 1 week prior to calorimetry. Exper-imental treatment with testosterone decreased the cell-mediated response to the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin and increased mean metabolic rate. No effects <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> on the number of ectoparasites, hemoparasites, and resting metabolic rate could be detected. These results are discussed in the framework of the immunocompetence handicap hy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} {{was to assess the}} pro-spective association <b>of</b> serum <b>testosterone</b> and dehydroepiandro-sterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels with incident metabolic syndrome (MetS) in men. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Data were obtained from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), a population-based prospective cohort of adults aged 20 – 79 years. Analyses were conducted in 1, 004 men without baseline MetS defined by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Testosterone and DHEAS were categorized by age-specific quartiles and Poisson regression models with rela-tive risks (RRs) and 95 % CIs were estimated. RESULTS—After a median follow-up time of 5. 0 years, 480 men (47. 8 %) developed MetS.

40|$|Sustanon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anabolic androgenic drugs to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength. This drug is a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> four esterized <b>testosterone</b> derivatives: Testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone isocaproate and testosterone decanoate. Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Sustanon on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. Sustanon significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by Sustanon administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds. This study indicates that Sustanon can induce avian skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that this is correlated with increased numbers of SCs and myonuclei...|$|R

25|$|Two of the {{immediate}} metabolites <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> 5α-DHT and estradiol, are biologically important and can be formed both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues. Approximately 5 to 7% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is converted by 5α-reductase into 5α-DHT, with circulating levels of 5α-DHT about 10% <b>of</b> those <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> and approximately 0.3% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is converted into estradiol by aromatase. 5α-Reductase is highly expressed in the male reproductive organs (including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymides), skin, hair follicles, and brain and aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue, bone, and the brain. As much as 90% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is converted into 5α-DHT in so-called androgenic tissues with high 5α-reductase expression, and due to the several-fold greater potency of 5α-DHT as an AR agonist relative to testosterone, {{it has been estimated}} that the effects <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> are potentiated 2- to 3-fold in such tissues.|$|R

50|$|Currently used androgens {{for male}} hormone {{replacement}} therapy are typically injectable or skin delivery formulations <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> or testosterone esters. Injectable forms <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> esters (such as testosterone enanthate, propionate, or cypionate) produce undesirable fluctuations in testosterone blood levels, with overly high levels shortly after injection and overly low afterward. Skin patches do provide a better blood level profile <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> but skin irritation and daily application still limit their usefulness.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{suggested}} that levels <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> {{are related to the}} type of relationship in which one is involved.

Moreover, the sex differences in serum concentrations <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> in neonatal rodents together with the detectable levels <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> in female neonates may suggest that androgenization is a dose-dependent phenomenon.

50|$|Another {{reason for}} this {{difference}} {{may be due to}} differences in levels <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> between men and women.
