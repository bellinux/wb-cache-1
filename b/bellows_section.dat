2500|$|The {{problem in}} the igniter fuel lines was not {{detected}} during ground testing because a stainless steel mesh covering [...] the fuel line became saturated with liquid air due to the extreme cold of the liquid hydrogen flowing through it. The liquid air damped a vibration mode that became evident when tests were conducted in a vacuum after the Apollo 6 flight. This was also a simple fix, involving replacing the flexible <b>bellows</b> <b>section</b> where the break occurred with a loop of stainless steel pipe. The S-IVB used the same J-2 engine design as the S-II {{and so it was}} decided that an igniter line problem had also stopped the third stage from reigniting in Earth orbit. [...] Ground testing confirmed that the slight underperformance seen in the first S-IVB burn was consistent with damage to the igniter line.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-twentieth century, some {{handrail}} designs {{consisted of}} a rubber bellows, with rings of smooth metal cladding called [...] "bracelets" [...] between each coil. This gave the handrail a rigid yet flexible feel. Additionally, each <b>bellows</b> <b>section</b> {{was no more than}} a few feet long, so if part of the handrail was damaged, only the bad segment needed to be replaced. These forms of handrail have largely been replaced with fabric-and-rubber railings.|$|E

40|$|Pressure drop {{experiments}} in highly turbulent He II flow were performed in flow loops driven by either a centrifugal pump or a single-stroke bellows pump. Pressure drops in straight tubing, coiled tubing, <b>bellows</b> <b>sections,</b> valves and Venturi flow meters were measured over {{a range of}} flow rates and temperatures. Our pressure drop data are in general agreement with classical fluid correlations when the He II normal component viscosity is used in calculating the Reynolds number. Cavitation and, in some cases, metastable superheating were observed in pressure drop measurements with Venturis in both centrifugal and bellows pump flow circuits...|$|R
40|$|Metallic bellows are {{commonly}} used as segments of propellant feedlines for rocket-propelled vehicles to accommodate temperature-induced length variations, manufacturing tolerances, and gimbaling of the engines. These <b>bellows</b> <b>sections</b> deform radially and change volume when internal pressure varies, and the magnitude of such deformation {{is much higher than}} that for the straight, cylindrical segments of the line. The greater flexibility, or lesser stiffness, of the bellows, decreases the frequency of acoustic oscillations in the line. These acoustic oscillations are {{a major factor in the}} so-called POGO phenomena which have plagued most of the larger liquid rocket-propelled vehicles for many years. A method is developed to calculate the change in volume of a bellows due to a change in internal pressure. Results of an experiment are also presented along with a test-analysis comparison. The computer code is included...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} line {{is one of}} the important components of any cryogenic system needed to transport the cryogenic fluid from one location to another. Towards our efforts to develop a long rigid-type {{transfer line}} for liquid nitrogen (LN 2) to transfer this fluid from a 5000 litre capacity vertical storage tank to the Helium liquefier (Linde Model 1610) located at a distance of nearly 50 m, we designed and fabricated several units of straight section transfer lines of length 6. 5 m and they were integrated to make the long length transfer line. Each unit was fabricated with 0. 5 inch dia. copper inner tube supported by spacers within 2 inch dia. PVC outer tube. Each section was foam insulated after the necessary instrumentation for temperature measurements. The individual sub units were integrated together with a small <b>bellow</b> <b>section</b> in between to take care of thermal contraction during use. We present here the analytical and experimental studies of the cool down and mass flow characteristics of a single foam insulated unit. These experimental studies are representative results of the performances of the long length rigid foam insulated transfer line...|$|R
40|$|The four argon spill trough bellows were {{leak tested}} with helium {{during the week}} of March 12, 1990. Three passed without incident, but the fourth was found to have a leak in the weld at one of the ring/clamps. The hole was {{approximately}} 1 / 32 -inch in diameter (a likely result of a welding burn through) and located on an inflexible portion of the bellows, the ring/clamp. Frank Juravic, who conducted the tests, suggested using grey structural epoxy to plug the leak. The epoxy is metallic with some inherent flexibility. The epoxy was applied and the bellows retested {{in the same manner as}} before. The repair was a success as the bellows proved to be leaktight. The bellows were then put in their original shipping crates and placed in storage at Lab C. Included in this report is the manufacturer's spec sheets on the bellows, a copy of the Quality Control Report form and a sketch of the test setup with an explanation of the procedure. On the bellows data sheet entitled 'Analysis of Stress in Bellows', the analysis output is obtained through a theoretical bellows program that uses quadratic equations to approximate characteristic curves for such data as axial, lateral and angular movement and spring rates. The program is best suited for bellows with a wall thickness of at least 0. 015 -inch and an operating pressure significantly above atmospheric. Thus EJS Inc. warned that the output data would not be very accurate in some instances. The data given on the EJS Inc. sketch sheet should be taken as accurate, though, for it was taken from the actual bellows delivered. The 72 -inch length includes the 64. 64 -inch of <b>bellows</b> <b>section,</b> the (3) 1 / 2 -inch ring/clamps and the (2) 1 - 1 / 2 -inch end bands. The remainder of the discrepancy is accounted for by a 2. 75 -inch factory elongation of the bellows from the original free length. The 40 -inch compression capability includes the 2. 75 -inch of factory elongation, the program determined 31. 9 -inch of compression from free length and 5. 35 -inch of elastic compression of the bellows convolutions due to such a thin bellows wall. EJS Inc. ran a single (16 - 3 / 16 -inch) <b>bellows</b> <b>section</b> through a 10 -inch compression stroke for 1000 cycles with no sign of rupture or plastic deformation...|$|E
40|$|A {{majority}} of the liquid-fueled rocket vehicles developed {{in the past have}} been plagued by an instability known as POGO. The POGO phenomenon involves dynamics of the vehicle structure, dynamics of the propellant in the feedline, and the engine dynamic transfer function. Each of these three items must be accurately known in order to determine stability. Metallic bellows are commonly used as segments of propellant feedlines for rocket-propelled vehicles to accommodate temperature-induced length variations, manufacturing tolerances, and gimbaling of the engines. These bellows sections deform radially and change volume when internal pressure varies, and the magnitude of such deformation is much higher than that for the straight, cylindrical segments of the line. The greater flexibility of the bellows decreases the frequency of acoustic oscillations in the line. Calculating elastic stiffness is difficult due to the radial deformation of a <b>bellows</b> <b>section.</b> SHELL was developed specifically to calculate changes in volume of a bellows due to changes in internal pressure. Input to the program consists of tables describing the material, the geometry of the convolutions and loading. The output gives displacements and volume change {{that can be used for}} POGO or waterhammer analysis. SHELL is written in standard FORTRAN 77. This program was originally developed on a Univac 1100 series computer and has been successfully implemented on IBM 370 series computers running MVS and DEC VAX series computers running VMS. The main memory requirement for running SHELL under VMS is 116 K. The program source code, IBM JCL for compiling and running SHELL, and sample input are provided with the program. SHELL is available on a 9 -track 1600 BPI ASCII CARD IMAGE magnetic tape. This program was developed in 1989. IBM is a trademark of International Business Machines Corporation.

40|$|For use in {{hard space}} suits and the like, a joint between the torso {{covering}} {{and the upper}} arm covering (i. e., shoulder) or between the torso covering and upper leg covering (i. e., hip) is disclosed. Each joint has an outer covering and a inner covering. The outer covering has plural perferably truncated toroidal sections decreasing in size proceeding outwardly. In one embodiment at each joint there are two bearings, the first larger than the second. The outer race of the larger bearing {{is attached to the}} outer edge of the smaller end of each section and the inner race of the larger bearing is attached to the end wall. The inner race of the smaller bearing is attached to the end wall. The outer race of the smaller bearing is attached to the larger end of the next section. Each bearing hask appropriate seals. Between each section is a rubber ring for the comfort of the wearer. Such rubber rings have radial flanges attached to the inner races of two adjacent bearings. Matching semicircular grooves are formed in the abutting overlapping surfaces. Bellows-like inner walls are also provided for each section fixed at one end to an inner cylindrical flange and, at the opposite end, to an end wall. Each outer section may rotate 360 deg relative to the next outer <b>section,</b> whereas the <b>bellows</b> <b>sections</b> do not rotate, but rather expand or contract locally as the rigid sections rotate relative to each other...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDuring the {{breeding}} season, male koalas produce ‘bellow’ vocalisations that are characterised by a continuous series of inhalation and exhalation sections, and an extremely low fundamental frequency (the main acoustic correlate of perceived pitch) [1]. Remarkably, {{the fundamental frequency}} (F 0) of <b>bellow</b> inhalation <b>sections</b> averages 27. 1 Hz (range: 9. 8 – 61. 5 Hz [1]), which is 20 times lower than would be expected for an animal weighing 8 kg [2] and more typical of an animal {{the size of an}} elephant (Supplemental figure S 1 A). Here, we demonstrate that koalas use a novel vocal organ to produce their unusually low-pitched mating calls...|$|R
