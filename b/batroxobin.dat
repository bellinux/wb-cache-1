50|$|After the cDNA {{nucleotide}} sequence of <b>batroxobin</b> from Bothrops moojeni was determined back in 1986, a research {{group from the}} Kyoto Sangyo university successfully expressed the cDNA for <b>batroxobin</b> in E. Coli in 1990. The recognition sequence for thrombin was used to obtain mature <b>batroxobin.</b> The fusion protein which was obtained was insoluble and was easily purified. After cleaving the fusion protein, the recombinant <b>batroxobin</b> could be isolated by electrophoresis {{and it was then}} successfully refolded to produce biologically active <b>batroxobin.</b> This study showed {{that it was possible to}} produce <b>batroxobin</b> using micro-organisms, a method which was more promising than isolating the enzyme from extracted snake venom. In 2004, a research group from Korea produced <b>batroxobin</b> by expressing it in the yeast species Pichia pastoris. This recombinant enzyme had a molecular weight of 33 kDa and included the carbohydrate structure. This method of expressing it in Pichia pastoris turned out to be more effective, as the produced enzyme showed cleaving activity which was more specific than thrombin in some cases and was more specific than non-recombinant <b>batroxobin.</b> Therefore, synthesis using Pichia pastoris seems promising for producing high quality recombinant <b>batroxobin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{long-term}} effects of <b>batroxobin</b> are tested on rats and Macaca mulatta. The subjects received an injection of <b>batroxobin</b> once a day for 30 consecutive days. In rats the <b>batroxobin</b> had pharmacological and toxicological effects on the hematology system and liver. There was a decrease of fibrinogen. The effects were reversible. In Macaca mulatta, the fibrinogen concentration was significantly decreased and the decrease was dose-dependent. There was a local inflammatory reaction in the injection sites of the animals. After 15 days there were antibodies to <b>batroxobin</b> detected. The conclusion was that <b>batroxobin</b> has pharmacological and toxicological effects on the hematology system of Macaca mulatta and the effects are reversible.|$|E
50|$|At {{low dose}} the <b>batroxobin</b> {{significantly}} shortened bleeding times and clotting times in mice and rats. So a low dose of <b>batroxobin</b> {{acts as a}} coagulant. Furthermore, <b>batroxobin</b> didn’t affect the prothrombin time, thrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time, but did lower the fibrinogen levels and released fibrinopeptide A in blood. In rabbits injection of <b>batroxobin</b> lead to a decrease in blood loss in liver wounds and shortened the bleeding time, coagulation time, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and thrombin time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Batroxobin</b> is {{a protein}} of the serine {{protease}} family. <b>Batroxobin</b> {{is closely related}} in physiological function and molecular size to thrombin. Five subspecies for the Brazilian lancehead snake (Bothrops atrox) are found. <b>Batroxobin</b> obtained from certain subspecies exhibits the hemostatic efficacy, whereas the protein obtained from other subspecies exhibits the cleavage of fibrinogen. Some of the forms have hemostatic efficacy as main effect, where the other forms have degradation of fibrinogen as main effect. <b>Batroxobin</b> that is naturally extracted from the snake venom is mainly obtained from the snake Bothrops moojeni. But the concentration is low {{and it is difficult}} to purify the protein. Often the product remains polluted, this makes it harder to use for clinical purposes. Theoretically, the molecular weight of <b>batroxobin</b> should be around 25.5 kDa. Often, isolated <b>batroxobin</b> is heavier, around 33 kDa. The higher molecular weight is caused by a glycosylation modification during the secretion. The differences in weight result from different possible purification procedures, which can remove different sugar(chains) from the enzyme. Because the <b>batroxobin</b> isolated from venom is highly irregular in quality, it is now more often synthesized in organisms using Bothrops moojeni cDNA.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} and working mechanism of <b>batroxobin</b> {{extracted from the}} Bothrops moojeni have been thoroughly studied. It {{should be noted that}} various subspecies exist and the working mechanisms of each <b>batroxobin</b> differ. As such, the structure of Bothrops moojeni <b>batroxobin</b> is further elucidated. The structure of <b>batroxobin</b> has been studied by various research groups throughout the years. These studies have mostly been performed by biologically synthesizing <b>batroxobin</b> from Bothrops moojeni cDNA, and analyzing this product and using homology models based on other proteases, such as thrombin and trypsin, among others. One of the earlier studies from 1986 showed that the molecular weight is 25.503 kDa, 32.312 kDa with the carbohydrate, and it consists of 231 amino acids. The amino acid sequence exhibited significant homology with other known mammalian serine proteases, such as trypsin, thrombin, and most notably pancreatic kallikrein. It was therefore concluded that it is indeed a member of the serine protease family. Based on the homology, the disulfide bridges were identified and the structure was elucidated further. A later molecular modelling study from 1998 used the homology between glandular kallikrein from the mouse and <b>batroxobin,</b> which is about 40%, to propose a 3D structure for biologically active <b>batroxobin.</b> To date no definite 3D structure has been proposed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Batroxobin</b> is {{excreted}} by the liver, {{kidney and}} spleen. The excretion of <b>batroxobin</b> {{can be detected}} by small metabolite molecules in the urine. With use of the immunoassay only 0.2 - 1.9% of the dose was detected in the urine. The amount of radioactivity of 125I-batroxobin was 69% in rats and 73% in dogs within 48 hours. So <b>batroxobin</b> is mainly excreted through the kidneys in its degraded form. So it isn’t detectable with an immunoassay.|$|E
50|$|To {{look at the}} {{integrity}} of <b>batroxobin</b> you can use SDS-PAGE gel analysis on 4 to 15% polyacrylamide gradient gels in a non-reducing environment. The protein was seen on the gel as a single band with molecular weight of 32,000 Da. To be sure this was <b>batroxobin,</b> the amino acid sequence was analyzed afterwards. The protein suspected to be <b>batroxobin</b> was resolved by SDS- PAGE and the band was moved to a PVDF membrane, where it was identified by Ponceau Red staining. The band was then submitted for amino acid sequence analysis. Also a SDS-PAGE analysis was done with batroxobin-treated fibrinogen. This showed bands on the gel that referred to Aα-, Bβ-, and γ-chains, indicating {{that there were no}} contaminating proteases in the <b>batroxobin</b> preparation (data not shown). To know for sure the fibrinogen was cleaved by <b>batroxobin</b> in Aα-, Bβ-, and γ-chains, these bands were compared with fibrinogen cleaved by thrombin which produces FpA and or FpB. The quantity FpA and FpB is measured by HPLC using synthetic FpA (Bachem) and FpB (LifeTein) as internal standards. To be sure FpA and FpB are measured, mass spectrometry was used. As expected, <b>batroxobin</b> only released FpA from fibrinogen, whereas thrombin released both FpA and FpB.|$|E
50|$|The {{medicine}} Defibrase ©is {{the trade}} name given to <b>batroxobin</b> and is {{isolated from the}} venom of Bothrops moojeni. It functions as an defibrinogenating agent and is used for patients with thrombosis. The <b>batroxobin</b> from the snake Bothrops atrox is patented as Reptilase and used as a hemostatic drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Batroxobin,</b> {{also known}} as reptilase, is a snake venom {{produced}} by Bothrops atrox and Bothrops moojeni, venomous species of pit viper found east of the Andes in South America. It is a hemotoxin which acts as a serine protease closely related to thrombin, and {{has been the subject}} of many medical studies as a replacement of thrombin. Different enzymes, isolated from different species of Bothrops, have been called <b>batroxobin,</b> but unless stated otherwise, this article covers the <b>batroxobin</b> produced by B. moojeni, as this is the most studied variety.|$|E
50|$|Bothrops atrox was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus as early as 1758, but <b>batroxobin,</b> the active compound in its venom, was first described only in 1954 by H. Bruck and G. Salem. In the years following, this first description of <b>batroxobin</b> was shown to have several uses in surgery. Because of the increasing interest in the properties of <b>batroxobin,</b> several studies on its hemostatic effect and coagulation have been published. More recently, in 1979, a German study showed the uses of <b>batroxobin</b> (reptilase clot retraction test) as a replacement test for the more commonly used thrombin time. Because the enzyme is unaffected by heparin, it is mostly used when heparin is present in blood. Recent studies emphasize more on improving its uses in surgery, mostly spinal surgery, and the uses as serine protease.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: The {{differences}} between thrombin and <b>batroxobin</b> in binding fibrinogen ...|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} earlier, <b>batroxobin</b> is {{an enzyme}} {{which has a}} serine protease activity on its substrate, fibrinogen. A serine protease cleaves a protein at {{the position of a}} serine, to degenerate a protein. <b>Batroxobin</b> is comparable to the enzyme thrombin, which is also a serine protease for fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is an important protein for hemostasis, because it plays a critical role in platelet aggregation and fibrin clot formation. Normally when one is wounded, thrombin cleaves the fibrinogen, which forms clots. As a result, the wound is ‘closed’ by these clots and recovery of the epithelial cells of the skin can take place. This is the natural process necessary for tissue repair. The venom <b>batroxobin</b> also induces clots, but does this with or without tissue damage. This is because <b>batroxobin</b> isn’t inhibited by specific cofactors like thrombin is. These clots can block a vein and hinder blood flow.|$|E
50|$|Normally {{the venom}} is {{directly}} {{injected into the}} bloodstream by the snake. In the experiments performed they also used intravenous injection of <b>batroxobin.</b> They used a total dose of 2 BU/kg (in dogs also 0.2 BU/kg) given {{during a time of}} 30 minutes, three times a day. In the graph below you can see the plasma concentrations of <b>batroxobin</b> after administration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Batroxobin,</b> a toxin from a snake venom, clots {{platelet-rich plasma}} without {{affecting}} platelet functions (lyses fibrinogen).|$|E
50|$|<b>Batroxobin</b> {{could be}} used as a medical {{adhesive}} against bleeding injuries. A study was done, where researchers aimed to examine the effects of batroxobin-containing adhesive for hemostasis. The fibrinogen conversion ability of <b>batroxobin</b> was evaluated by a fibrinogen clotting assay and a whole blood clotting assay. Both results proved that <b>batroxobin</b> containing adhesive forms blood clots. Higher concentrations of <b>batroxobin</b> more rapidly induced hemostasis. Another study has tested the effects of 2 units of <b>batroxobin</b> on perioperative blood loss and coagulation in patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), while undergoing a hip replacement. This is done by giving 240 patients LMWH, 12 hours previously to the hip operation. These patients were randomly divided into a testing group (120 patients) and a control group (120 patients). The testing group and the control group received 2 units of <b>batroxobin</b> and 50 mg mannitol respectively 10 minutes before incision. There is tested on perioperative blood loss, postoperative 24 drainage and blood routine test, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen. The study showed that the perioperative blood loss in the test group was 422,64 mL, which is less than the 667,67 mL blood loss of the control group. Red blood cell, hemoglobin and red blood cell volume and platelet were decreasing after the operation in both groups, but not significant different between the two groups. Also were there no drug-related adverse effects found in both groups, nor were there differences found in hospitalization between the two groups. The study concludes that 2 units of <b>batroxobin</b> could reduce the perioperative blood loss in patients getting a hip replacement operation with LMWH. There has also been studies done to examine the effects of <b>batroxobin</b> with continuous transcranial doppler monitoring in patients with acute cerebral stroke. The aim was to find out whether the effect of continuous transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring could be increased by the use of <b>batroxobin</b> on patients suffering from an acute cerebral stroke beyond the thrombolytic time window. In this study 90 patients were analyzed within twelve hours of the beginning of the symptoms. The patient were divided into a target and a control group which respectively got <b>batroxobin</b> with and without one hour of continuous TCD monitoring. Clinical sereneness of the strokes were based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Barthel index (BI), Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia score (TIBI), the incidence of advancing stroke, and the recurrence of cerebral infarction. The target group showed a significant better NIHSS score 57 days after the treatment, when compared with the control group. Also the incidence of advancing stroke one week afterwards and the incidence of stroke iteration after three months were significantly reduced in the target group. Safety of TCD monitoring in the clinical use for the groups was confirmed because no significant difference between the groups of the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage had shown one week after the use of TCD monitoring. The study concludes that the use of <b>batroxobin</b> combined with continuous TCD monitoring reduced the chance of advancing stroke and stroke recurrence after the treatment.|$|E
50|$|All {{the species}} responded {{differently}} to <b>batroxobin</b> exposure. This means that {{their ability to}} metabolize this protease is not the same. They all have their own half-lifes. The half-life in dogs are the highest 3.9 h and 5.8 h. In rabbit and mouse the half-life values were very low, 0.3 h and 0.4 h respectively. Because <b>batroxobin</b> is an enzyme, it is degraded by a protease, and cleaved in smaller unfunctional parts.|$|E
50|$|Fibrinogen is a dimeric glycoprotein, which {{contains}} {{two pairs of}} Aα-, Bβ- peptide chains and y- chains. There are two isoforms of this fibrinogen, one with two yA-chains (yA/yA) and one with a yA-chain and a y’-chain (yA,y’) When fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin, it releases fibrinopeptide A or B. Thrombin acts on two exosites to fibrinogen. Exosite 1 mediates the binding of thrombin to the Aα- and Bβ-chains, and exosite 2 causes an interaction with a second fibrinogen molecule at the C-terminus of the y’-chain. Consequently, when thrombin binds a yA/yA fibinogen only exosite 1 is occupied, and when it binds yA/y’ both exosites are bound tightly. So fibrinogen yA/y’ is a competitor to yA/yA, which decrease the amount of clotting. yA/y’ binds with a factor 20-fold greater than yA/yA. There are also clotting inhibitors like antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, which prevent clotting when it isn’t necessary. In contrast, <b>batroxobin</b> isn’t inhibited by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II. <b>Batroxobin</b> also has a high Kd value for binding both forms yA/yA and yA/y’. The bindings sites of <b>batroxobin</b> and thrombin partially overlap, {{but there are some}} differences. The fibrin-bound <b>batroxobin</b> retains catalytic activity and is a more potent stimulus for fibrin aggregation than fibrin-bound thrombin. This is probably due to the more lipophilic character of exosite 1, that binds fibrinogen more tightly. Fibrinogen is the sole substrate for <b>batroxobin,</b> whereas thrombin has multiple substrates. This is probably due to the Natrium-binding pocket that thrombin contains.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>batroxobin</b> from {{different}} species are slightly different. There {{will be an}} overview of two different snakes, Bothrops atrox and Bothrops moojeni. When injected with <b>batroxobin</b> there will be major symptoms affecting the hemostatic system. <b>Batroxobin</b> from Bothrops atrox mediates the formation of fibrin I. This then renders the blood more prone to coagulation. An overdose will lead to excessive blood-clotting, which can result in bleeding due to damage to blood vessels or even thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The clots can also cause secondary organ damage, such as renal damage or intracerebral hemorrhage. If the dose is high enough this will eventually lead to death. In the case of <b>batroxobin</b> from the Bothrops moojeni also formation of fibrin I is mediated, however {{there is also a}} release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This results in a rapid degradation of fibrin I and a lowered fibrinogen concentration. Which leads to a reduction of blood viscosity and blood coagulability. The blood is thinner and there is an increased tendency to bleed and to leak blood. Hypovolemic shock could occur. This shock can cause organs to stop working and eventually lead to death.|$|E
50|$|The {{thrombin}} time compares {{the rate of}} clot formation {{to that of a}} sample of normal pooled plasma. Thrombin is added to the samples of plasma. If the time it takes for the plasma to clot is prolonged, a quantitative (fibrinogen deficiency) or qualitative (dysfunctional fibrinogen) defect is present. In blood samples containing heparin, a substance derived from snake venom called <b>batroxobin</b> (formerly reptilase) is used instead of thrombin. <b>Batroxobin</b> has a similar action to thrombin but unlike thrombin it is not inhibited by heparin.|$|E
50|$|All {{the species}} showed a large Vd (Volume of Distribution). The {{value of the}} plasma in animals was around 50ml/kg on average. In dogs and monkeys {{the value of the}} Vd was very low {{compared}} to other species, namely 1.5 times the value of plasma in other animals. So the <b>batroxobin</b> is distributed mainly through veins and little is taken up by tissues. In the other species this value was around four times higher. This might be because <b>batroxobin</b> is more easily taken up by the reticuloendotherial system in those species.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{values for}} {{thrombin}} time are 12 to 14 seconds. If <b>batroxobin</b> is used, the {{time should be}} between 15 and 20 seconds. Thrombin time can be prolonged by heparin, fibrin degradation products, and fibrinogen deficiency or abnormality.|$|E
50|$|Toxicokinetic {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on various animal species, namely dogs, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats and monkeys. The research was performed by using immunoassays to obtain the plasma and urinary levels of <b>batroxobin.</b> They also measured the levels of fibrinogen.|$|E
50|$|An {{overdose}} of <b>batroxobin</b> will {{eventually lead to}} death, due to hemostatic effects. No lethal- or safe dose has been determined in humans yet. The safe dose for rats is 3.0 KU/kg and for Macaca mulatta 1.5 KU/kg. The lethal dose has only been studied in mice and is 712.5548 ± 191.4479 KU/kg.|$|E
50|$|Their venom {{consists}} {{mostly of}} hemotoxin, a toxic protein {{that affects the}} circulatory and nervous system; it destroys red blood cells, and sometimes loss of memory occurs. They are much feared because their venom is particularly lethal and fast acting. Presently, treatment is usually possible if the victim receives medical attention soon enough. Commonly, bites from this snake cause symptoms including nausea, blackouts, and paralysis. In almost all cases, temporary and sometimes permanent loss of local or 'short term' memory were reported. Extended hospital stays, as well as weight loss of up to 15 pounds, have also been reported. Venom yield averages 124 mg, {{although it may be}} as much as 342 mg. The enzyme reptilase (<b>batroxobin),</b> derived from this snake's venom, is used in modern medical laboratories to measure fibrinogen levels and blood coagulation capability. The test {{is considered to be a}} replacement for thrombin time, and is used when heparin is present in the sample. The enzyme is unaffected by heparin.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA thrombin-like enzyme of Bothrops atrox moojeni venom, <b>batroxobin,</b> {{specifically}} cleaves fibrinogen α chain, {{resulting in}} the formation of non-crosslinked fibrin clots.

The recombinant <b>batroxobin</b> had an apparent molecular weight of 33 kDa by SDS–PAGE analysis and biochemical activities similar to those of native <b>batroxobin.</b> The purified recombinant protein strongly converted fibrinogen into fibrin clot in vitro, and shortened bleeding time and whole blood coagulation time in vivo.

40|$|A new {{congenital}} dysfibrinogenemia, designated fibrinogen Petoskey, {{which was}} traced through {{four generations of}} a Michigan family, was found to exhibit an abnormally slow rate of release of fibrino-peptide A upon treatment with thrombin and <b>batroxobin.</b> <b>Batroxobin</b> only partially hydrolyzed and polymerized the fibrinogen from affected individuals, suggesting that these patients had both normal and abnormal fibrinogen in their circulation and that <b>batroxobin</b> was not capable of releasing fibrinopeptide A from the abnormal fibrinogen. Polymerization of fibrin monomers from fibrinogen Petoskey and plasmin mediated digestion of fibrinogen Petoskey were normal.

MethodForty cases of OME (45 ears) were randomly selected to receive intratympanic administration of Dexamethasone at 5 mg/ml (Group 1 or G 1), <b>Batroxobin</b> at 1 BU/ml (Group 2 or G 2) or <b>Batroxobin</b> at 2 BU/ml (Group 3 or G 3). Pre– and post–treatment changes in clinical symptoms, the Air conduction Hearing Threshold (AHT) in pure tone audiometry and average AHT over 0. 25 to 2 kHz were compared. ResultsData from 31 cases (33 ears) were available for analysis. AHTs among three groups were similar prior to treatment (P> 0. 05). The rate of normal hearing following treatment in G 3 was 70 % or 7 / 10, higher than in G 1 (41. 7 % or 5 / 12) and G 2 (54. 5 % or 6 / 11) (P < 0. 05). The rate of improvement following treatment was 81. 8 % or 9 / 11 and 80. 0 % or 8 / 10 in G 2 and G 3, respectively, higher than that in G 1 (50. 0 % or 6 / 12) (P < 0. 05). ConclusionsTherapeutic effects of intratympanic injection of <b>Batroxobin</b> on OME is superior to traditionally used Dexamethasone. In addition, higher concentration of <b>Batroxobin</b> appears to be superior to lower concentrations.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{clinical}} use of autologous platelet concentrates (also known as platelet-rich plasma) {{on the field}} of regenerative therapy, in the last decade {{has been the subject of}} several studies especially in equine medicine and surgery. The objectives of this study was: 1) to describe and compare the cellular population in whole blood, lower fraction (A) and upper fraction (B) of platelet concentrates, 2) to measure and compare the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1) concentration in plasma and both platelet concentrates after be activated with calcium gluconate or <b>batroxobin</b> plus calcium gluconate and, 3) to determine correlations between cell counts in platelet concentrates and concentrations of TGF-β 1. Blood samples were taken from 16 dogs for complete blood count, plasma collection and platelet concentrates preparation. The platelet concentrates (PC) were arbitrarily divided into two fractions, specifically, PC-A (lower fraction) and PC-B (upper fraction). The Platelet concentrates were analyzed by hemogram. After activated with calcium gluconate or <b>batroxobin</b> plus calcium gluconate, TGF-β 1 concentration was determined in supernatants of platelet concentrates and plasma. Results There were differences statistically significant (P[*] 1 concentration between whole blood, plasma and both platelet concentrates. A significant correlation was found between the number of platelets in both platelet concentrates and TGF-β 1 concentration. Platelet collection efficiency was 46. 34 % and 28. 16 % for PC-A and PC-B, respectively. TGF-β 1 concentration efficiency for PC activated with calcium gluconate was 47. 75 % and 31. 77 %, for PC-A and PC-B, respectively. PC activated with <b>batroxobin</b> plus CG showed 46. 87 % and 32. 24 % for PC-A and PC-B, respectively.

40|$|<b>Batroxobin,</b> a thrombin-like enzyme from Bothrops atrox moojeni venom, is {{associated}} with the reduction of fibrinogen levels in plasma and the enhancement of anticoagulation and fibrinolysis. In this study, 15 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) achieved successful limb salvage after the administration of <b>batroxobin.</b> We found that the levels of CD 34 þ, CD 31 þ, CD 34 þ/CD 31 þ, and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherinþ) cells had increased in the peripheral blood of patients at 7 days and 14 days after treatment. At 0 day, 7 days, and 14 days, the percentages of CD 34 þ cells, which are assumed to be hemato-poietic stem cells, are 0. 39 %+ 0. 43 %, 0. 71 %+ 0. 50 %, and 1. 11 %+ 0. 66 %, respectively. The levels of CD 34 þ cells at 14 days are significantly higher than the levels on the first day (P. 004).

Methods: After inducing hepatic artery injury, 8 dogs in each group underwent 915 [*]MHz microwave percutaneous coagulation therapy and 8 dogs were injected with <b>batroxobin</b> and α-cyanoacrylate. Results: The hemostatic effects of 915 [*]MHz microwave were better than drug injection, and the amount of bleeding was significantly lower (p <  0. 05). Pathological examination showed that vessel wall necrosis were greater. Conclusion: Contrast ultrasound guided 915 MHz microwave percutaneous coagulation treatment has potent hemostatic effects in the repair of in vivo hepatic artery injury...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{of human}} alpha-thrombin to fibrin was studied in a {{purified}} system at pH 7. 35, I 0. 08 and 37 degrees C. Binding experiments with active thrombin resulted in fibrin clots of variable quality, {{depending on the}} thrombin concentration: opaque gels composed of 'coarse' network were produced at low thrombin concentrations, while increasing concentrations of thrombin led to more translucent 'fine' gels. Scatchard analysis showed a non-linear dependence of thrombin binding to fibrin, suggesting the existence in fibrin(ogen) of multiple classes of binding sites for thrombin. Binding of catalytic-site-inhibited thrombin was investigated in clots of defined quality produced with three different concentrations of a thrombin-like enzyme, <b>batroxobin</b> (EC 3. 4. 21. 29). Straight lines of different slopes were established by Scatchard analysis of binding data at each fixed <b>batroxobin</b> concentration. These results favour a model according to which binding affinity for thrombin depends on the thickness of fibrin bundles. Labelled active-site-inactivated thrombin incorporated in batroxobin-induced clots was only sparingly released during incubation for 24 h {{in the presence of}} a 200 -fold excess of unlabelled thrombin, indicating that thrombin binding to fibrin is not reversible and that Scatchard analysis is not appropriate for quantification of binding parameters. Irreversible binding of thrombin appears to reflect trapping of thrombin molecules within fibrin fibres. The amount of trapped thrombin depends on the quality of the fibrin fibres, which in turn is determined by the concentration of the clotting enzyme...|$|E
