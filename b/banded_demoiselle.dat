50|$|It is {{a poorly}} drained wet {{woodland}} and fen site which is skirted by the Frays River. The main trees are alder and crack willow in the wetter areas, and elsewhere oak and ash with a shrub layer of hazel. In winter wildfowl are visible and in spring many flower species. Invertebrates include red cardinal beetles, <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselles</b> and the rare and protected Desmoulin's whorl snail.

50|$|Females lay up to 300 eggs {{at a time}} on {{emergent}} or floating plants, {{often on}} water-crowfoot. Like the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> they often submerge to do so. The eggs hatch after around 14 days. Again, like the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> the larva is stick-like with long legs and develops {{over a period of}} two years in submerged vegetation, plant debris or roots. They usually overwinter in mud or slime.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} species of breeding dragonfly and damselfly including the broad-bodied chaser, common darter and <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Species seen include Water Vole, Water Shrew, <b>Banded</b> <b>Demoiselle,</b> Dragon fly, Common Blue, Essex Skipper, Purple Hairstreak, White Admiral, Emperor Moth, Rosy Footman, Elephant Hawk-moth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx splendens) is {{a species}} of {{damselfly}} belonging to the family Calopterygidae. It is often found along slow-flowing streams and rivers. It is a Eurasian species occurring from the Atlantic coast eastwards to Lake Baikal and northwestern China.|$|E
50|$|The River Nene {{runs through}} this site, {{which also has}} large areas of open water and grassland. There are nationally {{important}} numbers of goosanders, wigeons and gadwalls in winter, and <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> damselflies nest on nettles along the river bank.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are much}} more {{sensitive}} to changes in habitat than the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> especially to temperature fluctuations. Already {{after a few days}} deprivation increases mortality rapidly, and after again prevail acceptable oxygen conditions, it is still too long after, birth defects and an increased mortality rate among affected animals. This is mainly because they absorb the oxygen from the water inefficient. Was able to detect in experiments that even larvae of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> who had been removed completely Tracheenkiemenblätter, under normal circumstances are still less sensitive to fluctuations in the oxygen supply. The inefficiency of oxygen uptake is balanced by the choice of habitat, since both increased flow and cooler water absorption capacity.|$|E
50|$|Newtown Green {{consists}} of open areas of green space for informal recreation and organised sports. Mature trees form {{the perimeter of}} the site and the Aylesford Stream runs along the edge. Ruddy darter, <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> blue-tailed damselfly and common blue damselfly have been recorded at the site.|$|E
50|$|Calopteryx syriaca is {{a species}} of {{damselfly}} in the family Calopterygidae known commonly as the Syrian demoiselle. It is native to the southern Levant, where it is known from Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria. This is sometimes {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (C. splendens).|$|E
50|$|The western {{demoiselle}} or yellow-tailed demoiselle (Calopteryx xanthostoma) is {{a species}} of damselfly belonging to the family Calopterygidae. It replaces the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (C. splendens) in southern France and the Iberian Peninsula, and is sometimes considered a subspecies of that species (hybrids frequently occur in areas where they overlap).|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> is a Eurasian species, and {{is present}} {{throughout}} Eurasia from the Atlantic coast to Lake Baikal and north-western China. It occurs in Taganay and Zyuratkul National Parks of Russia. It {{can be found}} at Fruška Gora in Serbia. It is found throughout the British Isles, except for the Scottish Highlands.|$|E
50|$|The south facing {{aspect of}} the garden allows {{for a wide variety}} of plantings, and this, {{combined}} with the riverside, attract a notable variety of wildlife. Notable birds include blackcaps, mute swans, kingfishers, goosanders and in summer, sand martins, whilst teal often over-winter here. There are also a great many insects, including the rare club-tailed dragonfly, <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> damselflies and white-legged damselflies, plus a range of butterflies, hoverflies and crickets.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Banded</b> <b>Demoiselle,</b> one of {{the largest}} and most {{colourful}} of the damselflies, has long been known from the Cuerden Valley Park. For many years this was thought to be its only Lancashire locality. However, during the late 1990s a considerable expansion of its range took place. The insect reached Savick Brook, west of Preston, in 1997 and, by 1999, was well established there. In 1998, it was recorded on the Lancaster Canal north of Preston and also on the Leeds-Liverpool canal at Withnell Fold.|$|E
50|$|Seven Acres Country Park {{is made up}} of ten {{kinds of}} habitat, {{including}} heathland, acid grassland, open water and broad-leaved woodland. Seven Acres Country Park is home to many kinds of wildlife. There are over 70 kinds of bird, including kingfisher, dipper, sparrowhawk, kestrel, song thrush, bullfinch, grey heron and blackcap. There are at least 18 kinds of butterfly, including painted lady, red admiral, holly blue, brimstone, speckled wood, small copper and wall brown. There are at least ten types of dragonfly, including broad bodied chaser, <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> brown hawker and migrant hawker.|$|E
50|$|The larvae live in {{the streams}} {{mentioned}} before and are mainly dependent on the water plants. The larvae need the stems and leaves, especially in areas with stronger currents to hold on. Hence it is extremely rare to find them in barren locations, flat expiring banks, or areas with a smooth stone floor. They also live in small natural lakes or ponds characteristic for limestones bedrock. They live in quieter areas between alluvial leaves or on exposed roots of the vegetation. They {{can be found on}} submerged plants such as waterweed (Elodea sp.), floods for water crowfoot (Ranunculus fluitans) or other plants, submerged from a few centimetres to several decimetres.Compared with the larvae of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> the larvae of the blue-wing demoiselle prefer quieter areas of the water, since slower flow causes a more effective absorption of oxygen under water. Only in very rare cases the larvae are present in stagnant water. The substrate of the river has only a very minor importance, because the larvae reside mainly in the vegetation.An important factor for the occurrence of blue-wing demoiselles is the oxygen in the water. The larvae is much more sensitive to oxygen deficiency than the larvae of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> hence it needs a sufficient oxygen saturation of the water. Waters with high levels of sediment and sludge, which is consumed by bacterial decomposition of oxygen are, accordingly not as a habitat for the larvae. This sensitivity qualifies it in water chemistry as a bioindicator for the assessment of water quality. Thus they will be an indication of value in the saprobic assigned of 1.9, which represents a low to moderately polluted waters type (β-mesosaprob) and a water quality class from I to II does.Another key factor for the occurrence of the larvae of the blue-wing demoiselle is the temperature of the water. This species prefers unlike the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> mainly the cooler and shadier areas of the water. The optimal temperature is a summer average 13 to 18 °C. At temperatures above 22 °C were often injuries of larvae observed and also a reduced hatch ability of eggs. The main reason is the oxygen content under higher temperatures. Individual populations may get used to permanently higher temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of the {{beautiful}} demoiselle develop over 10 to 12 stages, each of which takes place between a molt. The body length is variable and highly dependent on environmental conditions. The final stage (F-0-stage) larvae are 3.5 to 4.6 millimeters and weigh about 4 milligrams, slightly below the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle.</b> Apart from the larvae of the demoiselles are difficult to distinguish from each other, the apparent differences lie mainly in the bristles and {{the severity of the}} tracheal gills on their abdomen. Compared to other damselflies demoiselles larvae fall immediately on the other hand, due to their much shorter mean gill lamella.|$|E
50|$|Aylesford Green is an {{attractive}} area for informal recreation. The site {{has a variety of}} habitats including a wide margin of long vegetation by the Aylesford Stream that forms an important habitat for invertebrates. A small wooded area dominated by ash and alder borders Boys Hall Road. Wood mice have been recorded in this area and long-tailed tits are often seen perching in ash trees, particularly in winter. Pollarded willows by the Aylesford Stream provide {{an attractive}} area adjacent to Bentley Road. The site is linked to South Willesborough by a pedestrian bridge over High Speed 1 onto Newtown Road. <b>Banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> and common blue damselfly have been recorded at the site.|$|E
50|$|Bowen's Field is an {{informal}} recreation area, {{adjacent to the}} Great Stour. It is thought that this site {{was one of the}} last areas to be farmed in Ashford, it belonged to a local livestock trader called Mr Sidney Herbert Bowen,died 1971 and he is commemorated on a plaque at the entrance to the site from Victoria Park. This area was also adjacent to the town’s lido (outdoor swimming pool) which was built in 1867 and was at the time the largest in Britain. The site is now a flood storage area consisting of damp grassland, with a large pond where <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> blue-tailed damselfly, azure damselfly, smooth newt, and common frog have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Part of the moor {{has been}} {{designated}} as a nature reserve, covering 261 acre, which is managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust.

The reserve provides habitat for many varieties of birds, which includes millions of starlings between November and January, along with osprey and bittern. Otters and <b>Banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> are among other species which have made their home on the moor. A large bird hide, reached via a raised boardwalk, has been erected. Westhay Moor is also notified {{as part of the}} Somerset Levels and Moors Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive and as a Ramsar Site, and a National Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} and hindwings {{are similar}} in appearance and are membranous, being strengthened and supported by longitudinal veins that are linked by many cross-veins and that are filled with haemolymph. Species markers include quadrangular markings on the wings known as the pterostigma or stigma, and in almost all species, there is a nodus near the leading edge. The thorax houses the flight muscles. Many damselflies (e.g. Lestidae, Platycnemidae, Coenagrionidae) have clear wings, but some (Calopterygidae, Euphaeidae) have coloured wings, whether uniformly suffused with colour or boldly marked with a coloured patch. In species such as the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> Calopteryx splendens the males have both a darker green body and large dark violet-blue patches on all four wings, which flicker conspicuously in their aerial courtship dances; the females have pale translucent greenish wings.|$|E
50|$|The larval {{development}} of the Blue-winged demoiselle takes into Middle Eastern waters, usually between six and nine weeks, mainly due to the preference of cooler waters, it is usually somewhat longer {{than that of the}} <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle.</b> At the end of larval development, it comes to winter and the development until the following year with the metamorphosis to the imago completed (univoltine development). The cooler water is a breeding, the greater the proportion of larvae that pass through the two winter periods and therefore a {{development of}} nearly two years (semivoltine development). Studies have shown that this might modify the relationship between univoltine and semivoltinen larvae within a body of water and clear {{in the course of the}} river and increase the water temperature moves toward univoltiner larvae.|$|E
5000|$|The habitat {{that the}} adults occupy, {{corresponds}} to the nearby larval habitat. Unlike the adults of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> you meet those of the beautiful demoiselle but also in forest clearings, but very rarely {{on the banks of}} larger ponds. As resting places, the animals need trees and shrubs, often resting on high herbaceous plants such as the large nettle ( [...] Urtica Dioica [...] ).The breeding habitats are similar to the Larval habitat, these are cool, shady water-courses largely with a more or less strong current and near-natural vegetation and bank structure. This is mostly meadow and pasture streams in the area, they rarely pass through the forest. A distinct riparian vegetation also plays a role as a windbreak. Due to their broad wings the beautiful demoiselle can be blown away by the wind more easily than other species of dragonflies.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the beautiful demoiselle covers all of Europe {{with the exception of}} the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands and Iceland. In the north it extends to the Arctic polar sea, and thus much further north than that of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle.</b> On the North African Mediterranean coast, its southern populations in Morocco and Algeria can be found.The northern boundary in Asia following the 13-°C July isotherm, it is therefore not in the areas where the average temperature in summer below 13 °C falls, otherwise they are met with in temperate and cool regions in the entire continent with the exception of deserts and the mountains of. The eastern subspecies of C. v. japonica found on the Japanese islands is under debate as to whether it is a separate species.The beautiful demoiselle is mostly found in lowland locations. Regular findings come from areas up to a maximum height of 980 m above sea level. Occasionally they may be found up to 1,200 meters in altitude, such as in the Alps.|$|E
5000|$|Harris {{published}} his The Aurelian or {{natural history of}} English insects in 1766. In 1780 he followed this up with the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle,</b> Calopteryx splendens, {{and was the first}} English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species. Reviewing his artwork, the odonatologists Albert Orr and Matti Hämäläinen comment that his drawing of a 'large brown' (Aeshna grandis, top left of image) was [...] "superb", while the [...] "perfectly natural colours of the eyes indicate that Harris had examined living individuals of these aeshnids and either coloured the printed copper plates himself or supervised the colourists." [...] However, they consider the larva on the same plate far less good, [...] "a very stiff dorso-lateral view of an aeshnid larva with mask extended. No attempt has been made to depict the eyes, antennae or hinge on the mask or labial palps, all inconceivable omissions for anartist of Harris' talent had he actually examined a specimen", and they suggest he copied it from August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof.|$|E
5000|$|The eggs, {{in which}} the embryos develop, are on average about 1.2 {{millimeters}} long and have a spindle-shaped structure with approximately 0.2 millimeters wide. At the pointed end are, as with other demoiselles also a hole structure ( [...] Mikropylenapparat [...] ) with four holes to enable penetration of the sperm of the male. In addition, the egg of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> at the front end a funnel-like appendix unknown object, which projects at the inserted egg outwardly from the plant stem. The color of the egg changes from a bright yellow when freshly laid eggs on a yellow-brown to reddish brown when older egg.Within the egg takes place, the embryonic development of the dragonfly. For {{the first time this}} has been described for the blue-winged demoiselle 1869, but it represented the first description of the embryonic development of an insect at all. From outside the progression of the development by a slight change in length as well as by changing the shape is recognizable. It bulges on {{the upper part of the}} egg slightly, while the lower part deforms concave. The development itself can be divided into three sections:the early development, when it forms after fertilization of the ovum by dividing the basic shape of bodyDefinitely the development with the final formation of the body shape until they hatch from the eggthe larval development of the hatched larva up to the formation of the winged imagoThe embryo in the egg can last between 20 days and one month.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> {{is also in}} the blue wing-demoiselle a {{pronounced}} territorial behavior of sexually mature males. These days occupy territories that they defend against other males. The defense consists mostly in threatening gestures. For this they spread their wings and put them on display so clearly visible, there is also Drohflügen and in rare cases to air combat between rival males. Optimal areas correspond to the optimal nesting places for the females and are characterized by a normally increased flow and a suitable oviposition substrate in the potential breeding sites from. The size of the spots and their distance apart is the density of the population dependent as well as the occurrences of the water and may be between several meters and a few decimetres. Males who do not occupy spots can keep themselves in the vegetation on the shore and try to mate with fly to females or to fill vacant spots. Especially when only a few males are present, the territorial defense is very aggressive, with a higher number of competing male aggression but decreases significantly.The males sit in their areas mostly in exposed places in the vegetation, which extends over the water, sometimes on vegetation or rocks cushions amid the waters. This seat is waiting {{at the same time the}} center of the district they do their gaze primarily on the aquatic center and will show a behavior that is referred to as [...] "wingclapping" [...] and in which the wings beat quickly down and slowly lifted. It is believed that it is mainly used for communication, it also supports the ventilation in the thorax and accordingly probably also plays a role in thermoregulation of the animals ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Learning {{and other}} forms of {{phenotypic}} plasticity have been suggested to enhance population divergence. Mate preferences can develop by learning, and species recognition might not be entirely genetic. We present data on female mate preferences of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx splendens) that suggest a role for learning in population divergence and species recognition. Populations of this species are either allopatric or sympatric with a phenotypically similar congener (C. virgo). These two species differ mainly in the amount of wing melanisation in males, and wing patches thus mediate sexual isolation. In sympatry, sexually experienced females discriminate against large melanin wing patches in heterospecific males. In contrast, in allopatric populations within the same geographic region, females show positive ("open-ended") preferences for such large wing patches. Virgin C. splendens females do not discriminate against heterospecific males. Moreover, physical exposure experiments of such virgin females to con- or hetero specific males significantly influences their subsequent mate preferences. Species recognition is thus not entirely genetic and it is partly influenced by interactions with mates. Learning causes pronounced population divergence in mate preferences between these weakly genetically differentiated populations, and results in a highly divergent pattern of species recognition at a small geographic scale...|$|E
40|$|Co-occurrence of {{closely related}} species can cause {{behavioral}} interference in mating and increase hybridization risk. Theoretically, this {{could lead to the}} evolution of more species-specific mate preferences and sexual signaling traits. Alternatively, females can learn to reject heterospecific males, to avoid male sexual interference from {{closely related species}}. Such learned mate discrimination could also affect conspecific mate preferences if females generalize from between species differences to prefer more species-specific mating signals. Female damselflies of the <b>banded</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx splendens) learn to reject heterospecific males of the beautiful demoiselle (C. virgo) through direct premating interactions. These two species co-occur in a geographic mosaic of sympatric and microallopatric populations. Whereas C. virgo males have fully melanized wings, male C. splendens wings are partly melanized. We show that C. splendens females in sympatry with C. virgo prefer smaller male wing patches in conspecific males after learning to reject heterospecific males. In contrast, allopatric C. splendens females with experimentally induced experience with C. virgo males did not discriminate against larger male wing patches. Wing patch size might indicate conspecific male quality in allopatry. Co-occurrence with C. virgo therefore causes females to prefer conspecific male traits that are more species specific, contributing to population divergence and geographic variation in female mate preferences...|$|E
