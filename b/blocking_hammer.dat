50|$|Basing {{their new}} line of weapons on the basic Charter Arms design, the new company has made a few {{improvements}} {{such as the use}} of a one-piece barrel and front sight. The one-piece barrels of the new models are machined with eight grooves instead of six for higher velocity, flatter trajectory and better accuracy. The new models feature a completely <b>blocked</b> <b>hammer</b> system so that the gun cannot fire unless the trigger is held in full rear position.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} the Model 15 has been {{produced}} with several barrel lengths, with 4" [...] (standard) and 2" [...] (1964-1988) being the most common. In 1972 S&W released a stainless steel version as the Model 67. In 1997 the hammer and internal lockworks were modified from an on-the-hammer firing pin / internal <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> to a floating firing pin / MIM flat hammer, and kept the <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> that, unlike a transfer bar safety design, moves up with the trigger pull. The hammer hits a transfer bar, transferring the strike to the firing pin, while the <b>block</b> in a <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> system moves down with the trigger pull, unblocking the hammer from the firing pin, allowing the hammer to strike the firing pin. These two safety systems work oppositely, but achieve the same goal of only allowing the gun to fire when the trigger is pulled all the way.|$|R

50|$|The pistol has a decocker, {{being the}} only safety device available. In addition, an {{automatic}} safety lock is also mounted on the firing pin. This <b>blocks</b> the <b>hammer</b> {{to prevent it from}} firing, being available only when the trigger is properly pushed.|$|R
25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} <b>blocks,</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>blocks,</b> or transfer bars) that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge. If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the {{gun in the holster}} to help prevent its accidental loss.|$|R

5000|$|Single-action revolvers have no {{external}} safeties, {{and they}} usually have no internal safeties, such as a <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> or transfer bar, to render them drop-safe.

Real antiques are in this category; modern non-exact replicas may have internal <b>hammer</b> <b>blocks.</b> Carrying such firearms with a loaded chamber under the hammer, rather than with the hammer left down on an empty chamber, is not safe.|$|R

50|$|A decocker or manual {{decocking}} lever {{allows the}} hammer {{to be dropped}} on a live cartridge without risk of discharging it, usually by <b>blocking</b> the <b>hammer</b> or retracting or covering the firing pin before releasing the sear.

5000|$|Fullers have {{a variety}} of uses beyond bladesmithing. They are often used for [...] "drawing out" [...] steel, which {{consists}} of <b>hammering</b> a short <b>block</b> into a long bar. The fullers will often be used to notch the block or bar. If the fullers are longer than the block is wide, they will tend to elongate the block rather than raise bulges from the surface. After notching, the <b>block</b> is <b>hammered</b> smooth, elongating it further, and this process is repeated until the bar becomes the correct length and thickness. Fullers are also used for many other shaping processes in blacksmithing, from making hinges and latches to plow parts and horseshoes.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} PP (Polizeipistole) {{was released}} in 1929. It was designed for police use and was used by police forces in Europe in the 1930s and later. The semi-automatic pistol operated using a simple blowback action. The PP was designed with several safety features, some of them innovative, including an automatic <b>hammer</b> <b>block,</b> a combination safety/decocker and a loaded chamber indicator.|$|R
50|$|Most {{double-action}} revolvers have no external safety devices; {{a sufficiently}} firm trigger pull will always result in firing. The heavy trigger pull required to cock and then fire the firearm usually prevents accidental discharges due to dropping or mishandling the gun. Most modern double-action revolvers have an internal safety, either a <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> or a transfer bar, that positively prevents firing without the trigger being pulled.|$|R

When the composite <b>block</b> was <b>hammered</b> or rolled to make it thinner, the two metals were reduced in thickness at similar rates. Using this method, Boulsover {{was able to make}} sheets of metal which had a thin layer of silver on the top surface and a thick layer of copper underneath. When this new material was used to make buttons, they looked and behaved like silver buttons but were a fraction of the cost.|$|R

The monastery also has many valuable sacred relics left by eminent monks after their deaths. Examples are for instance when Thinley Norbu lama died in 1995, a mark was left on his skull in the image Vajrapani. In 1997 when Triwa Lobsang lama died, an image of Arya Tara was left on his heart.|$|R
50|$|The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech {{design with}} {{improved}} Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up {{is similar to}} the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs {{on the top of the}} barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin <b>block,</b> and <b>hammer</b> safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it {{is similar to the}} SIG P22X series of pistols. The double-action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low.|$|R
5000|$|Similar in {{concept to}} a revolver, the P-32 has no manual safety, relying {{instead on the}} long {{double-action}} trigger pull and an internal <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> to provide safe operation. [...] The pistol meets SAAMI guidelines, and will not fire if dropped. The P-32 has passed extensive SAAMI drop-testing at the H. P. White labs, as well as drop tests to military specifications. The trigger must physically be pulled for the gun to fire.|$|R
5|$|Work on the {{foundations}} for the lighthouse continued until 30 September. A total of 296 charges were used to remove 2,000tons of rock and Stevenson believed that the rock was so hard that the effort involved was four times that required for boring Aberdeenshire granite. The work went well {{but by the end}} of the second season, no blocks had yet been laid. However, between April 1839 and June 1840 4,300 blocks had been fashioned, the stone donated by the Duke of Argyll from quarries on Mull. The roughly hewn rock was taken to Hynish where the <b>blocks</b> were <b>hammered</b> and chiselled into shape. The largest weighed over 2.5tons, the smallest 0.75tons and the precision required meant that a single block could take 320 man hours to complete.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> {{is similar}} to a firing pin block. It is a latch, block or other {{obstruction}} built into the action and normally positioned to prevent the hammer contacting the cartridge primer or firing pin when at rest. Similar to the firing pin block, the obstruction to the hammer's travel is removed as a consequence of pulling the trigger. This allows the hammer to contact the primer or firing pin only when the trigger is pulled.|$|R
25|$|The Bodeo was {{considered}} simple and robust. Due to the revolver being {{produced by a}} multitude of manufacturers, {{the quality of the}} weapon varied greatly. Frames were made {{from a wide variety of}} materials ranging from brass to brazed copper plates. The gate was connected to the hammer with the barrel screwed into the frame. Ejection was achieved by the rod normally housed in the hollow axis pin. The <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> was designed to prevent firing unless the trigger was fully cocked.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Ranger Manufacturing of Gadsden, Alabama was {{licensed}} to manufacture the PPK and PPK/S; this version was distributed by Interarms of Alexandria, Virginia. This license was eventually canceled. Starting in 2002, Smith & Wesson (S&W) began manufacturing the PPK and PPK/S under license until 2017 when Walther began producing them again at their new US manufacturing plant in Fort Smith, Arkansas. In February 2009, S&W issued a recall for PPKs it manufactured for a {{defect in the}} <b>hammer</b> <b>block</b> safety.|$|R
25|$|Hot {{shoes are}} placed in water to cool them off. The farrier then nails the shoes on, by driving the nails into the hoof wall at the white line of the hoof. The nails are shaped {{in such a way}} that they bend outward as they are driven in, {{avoiding}} the sensitive inner part of the foot, so they emerge on the sides of the hoof. When the nail has been completely driven, the farrier cuts off the sharp points and uses a clincher (a form of tongs made especially for this purpose) or a clinching <b>block</b> with <b>hammer</b> to bend the rest of the nail so it is almost flush with the hoof wall. This prevents the nail from getting caught on anything, and also helps to hold the nail, and therefore the shoe, in place.|$|R
2500|$|The Great Pyramid {{consists}} of an estimated 2.3million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest granite stones in the pyramid, found in the [...] "King's" [...] chamber, weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan, more than [...] away. Traditionally, ancient Egyptians cut stone <b>blocks</b> by <b>hammering</b> into them wooden wedges, which were then soaked with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid. It is estimated that 5.5million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite (imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar {{were used in the}} construction of the Great Pyramid.|$|R
