5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973.

He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement {{that he would not be}} sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

The resulting mystery surrounding the group led to speculation in the underground press. Music from Big Pink received excellent reviews, and the album influenced many well-known musicians of the period.|$|E

A handful of subjects were interviewed twice: Bill Curry (1966 Green Bay Packers and 1970 Baltimore Colts), Joe Greene (1974 and 1978 Pittsburgh Steelers), Eli Manning and Tom Coughlin, (2007 and 2011 New York Giants), Ray Lewis (2000 and 2012 Baltimore Ravens), and Peyton Manning (2006 Indianapolis Colts and 2015 Denver Broncos).

No one from Corwood Industries is represented on screen, but the label did suggest several people to <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>for</b> the movie, including music critics Phil Milstein and Gary Pig Gold, and Katy Vine. Corwood's recommendation of Vine for the documentary is seen as essentially endorsing the contents and confirming {{the authenticity of the}} Texas Monthly interview.
