5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in <b>bowfin</b> is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In <b>bowfin</b> neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the <b>bowfin</b> to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the <b>bowfin</b> to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The <b>bowfin</b> has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the <b>bowfin</b> to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bowfin</b> with {{liver cancer}} and with fatal leukemia have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. <b>Bowfin</b> eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval <b>bowfin</b> do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation {{by means of an}} adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male <b>bowfin.</b> <b>Bowfin</b> aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male <b>bowfin</b> who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E

50|$|Calamopleurus is an extinct genus of <b>bowfins,</b> {{comprising}} three species: C. cylindricus and C. mawsoni from Brazil and C. africanus from Africa.|$|R
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of <b>bowfin</b> is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the <b>bowfin</b> gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E

5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the <b>bowfin</b> {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, <b>Bowfin</b> are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a <b>bowfin</b> has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the <b>bowfin</b> to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
50|$|Holostei {{share with}} other non-teleost ray-finned fish {{a mixture of}} {{characteristics}} of teleosts and sharks. In comparison with the other group of non-teleost ray-finned fish, the chondrosteans, the Holostei are closer to the teleosts and further from sharks: the pair of spiracles found in sharks and chondrosteans is reduced in holosteans to a remnant structure: in gars, the spiracles do not even open to the outside; the skeleton is lightly ossified: {{a thin layer of}} bone covers a mostly cartilaginous skeleton in the <b>bowfins.</b> In gars, the tail is still heterocercal but less so than in the chondrosteans. <b>Bowfins</b> have many-rayed dorsal fins and can breathe air like the bichirs.|$|R
50|$|Acanthodii or acanthodians (sometimes called spiny sharks) is a paraphyletic {{class of}} extinct teleostome fish, sharing {{features}} with both bony fish and cartilaginous fish. In form they resembled sharks, but their epidermis {{was covered with}} tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteans (gars, <b>bowfins).</b> They represent several independent phylogenetic branch of fishes leading to the still-extant Chondrichthyes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} other {{vertebrates}} are known alongside Tingmiatornis from the locality on Axel Heiberg Island, including champsosaurs that measured 2.4 m in length; fish including gar, <b>bowfins,</b> members of the extinct Vidalamiinae, and indeterminate teleosts; turtles, including Aurorachelys, Borealochelys, indeterminate eucryptodires, and indeterminate trionychids; and juvenile elasmosaurs, known from teeth. During the Turonian, the area {{would have been a}} large, freshwater to brackish bay situated at approximately 71° paleolatitude.|$|R
5|$|<b>Bowfin</b> reach sexually {{maturity}} at two {{to three}} years of age. They can live ten to twelve years in the wild, and 30 years in captivity. Females are longer-lived than males.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bowfin</b> is an {{actinopterygii}} {{which means}} that the pectoral girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the <b>bowfin</b> has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle.The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for <b>bowfin.</b> Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaur Provincial Park {{preserves}} {{an extraordinarily}} {{diverse group of}} freshwater vertebrates. Fish include sharks, rays (such as the durophage Myledaphus), paddlefish, <b>bowfins,</b> gars, and teleosts. Amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and the extinct albanerpetontids. Reptiles include lizards (such as the large monitor Palaeosaniwa), {{a wide range of}} turtles, crocodilians, and the fish-eating Champsosaurus. Mammal fossils from the park are relatively rare and consist of isolated teeth, fragmentary jaws with teeth, and tooth fragments from mouse-sized and shrew-sized animals. They include representatives of placental, marsupial, and multituberculate mammals.|$|R
50|$|The Mountain State's water habitat holds 24 {{families}} of fish, including mudminnows, trout, trout-perches, killifish, livebearers, silversides, sticklebacks, sculpins, Temperate basses, sunfish, perches, drums, lampreys, sturgeons, paddlefish, gars, <b>bowfins,</b> mooneyes, freshwater eels, herrings, minnows, carp, suckers, freshwater catfish, and pikes. The three hybrid sport fish are the Hybrid Striped Bass (Morone chrysops x M. saxatilis), Hybrid Saugeye (Stizostedion canadense x S. vitreum) and Hybrid Tiger Musky (Esox lucius x E. masquinony). With {{the exception of}} {{a small portion of the}} New River in Virginia, the candy darter is found exclusively in West Virginia.|$|R
50|$|This habitat, {{which had}} a mean {{temperature}} of approximately 14°C, {{would have been an}} ideal nesting ground for Tingmiatornis, although no eggs or nests have been found at the locality to date. The <b>bowfins</b> that swam in the surrounding water, which likely measured 30 - 60 cm in length, may have competed with Tingmiatornis for smaller fish, if the latter was a diving bird. Tingmiatornis may also have fished at night, much like the modern Western grebe; at this latitude, it would have experienced approximately two months of continuous darkness per year.|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} the <b>bowfin</b> {{is made of}} two layers of skull, the dermatocranium and the chondrocranium. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The <b>bowfin</b> skull {{is made up of}} 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of 3 bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the vomer. The teeth are on two bones, the premaxillae and the maxillae. Another three bones make up the lower jaw the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the skull is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra scapular, the post temporal, and the opercular. The {{entirety}} of the skull is attached to the girdle through another set of bones.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and <b>bowfin.</b> Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate <b>bowfin.</b> Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertebrate}} fossils in the Florissant {{are predominantly}} small fragments of incomplete bones. There {{have been a}} few described species of vertebrates, mostly fish, but also birds and mammals.The fish discovered at the site include <b>bowfins,</b> suckers, catfishes, and pirate perches. Most of these were bottom dwellers, except the perches, and many were tolerant of poor water conditions. Most of the fish have been found in the same shale layers versus other shale layers. This could indicate that there were more tolerable times for fish populations over the history of the lake than other times.|$|R
2500|$|Spiny sharks, class Acanthodii, are extinct fishes {{that share}} {{features}} with both bony and cartilaginous fishes, though ultimately {{more closely related}} to and ancestral to the latter. Despite being called [...] "spiny sharks", acanthodians predate sharks, though they gave rise to them. They evolved in the sea {{at the beginning of the}} Silurian Period, some 50 million years before the first sharks appeared. Eventually competition from bony fishes proved too much, and the spiny sharks died out in Permian times about 250 Ma. In form they resembled sharks, but their epidermis was covered with tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteans (gars, <b>bowfins).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stomach {{contents}} of 46 individual banded pygmy sunfish (26 {{of which were}} spawning adults) collected at Mound, Louisiana, were examined for food identification. The main food identified included insect larvae (mostly from the family Chironomidae), small crustaceans, and snail eggs. The crustaceans and snail eggs combined constituted {{the majority of the}} content. Next in quantity were insect larvae. Minute amounts of algal spores were ingested by these fish. These algae were most likely taken in accidentally with other prey in the presence of algal blooms. Lastly, no other fish species or banded pygmy sunfish larvae were found in the stomach contents. [...] The banded pygmy sunfish lives in rather eutrophic conditions such as swamps and ponds. They are able to live in sedimentation levels that make oxygen availability less than 0.5 mg/L of water. Very few fish species can survive in this hypoxic condition. The only other notable fish that affect E. zonatum are live-bearers (Poeciliidae), the grass pickerel (Esox americanus), and <b>bowfins</b> (Amia calva). [...] The <b>bowfins</b> are known to be occasional predators on the pygmy sunfish family. Occasionally, the grass pickerel and live-bearers are competitors for food with the pygmy sunfish. Other than fish, water snakes and fish-eating birds are known to be enemies. Water beetles and Ondonta nymphs are known to be competitors for insect larvae. [...] Wetland habitat is important for spawning habitat, but it is also an important habitat for food and protection. It provides dense plant matter (especially Ceratophyllum) for cover against predators and as a laying area of snail eggs. This habitat is also excellent as a source for insect eggs and larvae. Thus, the human development of wetland habitat not only affects Elassomatidae, but several other species of fish and insects, as well.|$|R
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the <b>bowfin</b> and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, <b>bowfin</b> and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and <b>bowfin</b> have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E
500|$|The teleosts {{were first}} {{recognised}} {{as a distinct}} group by the German ichthyologist Johannes Peter Müller in 1844. The name is from Greek teleios, [...] "complete" [...] + osteon, [...] "bone". Müller based this classification on certain soft tissue characteristics, which {{would prove to be}} problematic, as it did {{not take into account the}} distinguishing features of fossil teleosts. In 1966, Greenwood et al. provided a more solid classification. The oldest teleost fossils date back to the late Triassic, evolving from fish related to the <b>bowfins</b> in the clade Holostei. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic they diversified, and as a result, 96 percent of all known fish species are teleosts. The cladogram shows the relationship of the teleosts to other bony fish, and to the terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) that evolved from a related group of fish. Approximate dates are from Near et al., 2012.|$|R
5|$|The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as {{vertebrate}} fossils, {{including those}} of dinosaurs, are quite common.

40|$|Among osteichthyans, basal actinopterygian fishes (e. g. {{paddlefish}} and <b>bowfins)</b> have paired fins {{with three}} endoskeletal components (pro-, meso- and metapterygia) articulating with polybasal shoulder girdles, while sarcopterygian fishes (lungfish, coelacanths and relatives) have paired fins with one endoskeletal component (metapterygium) articulating with monobasal shoulder girdles. In the fin–limb transition, {{the origin of}} the sarcopterygian paired fins triggered new possibilities of fin articulation and movement, and established the proximal segments (stylopod and zeugopod) of the presumptive tetrapod limb. Several authors have stated that the monobasal paired fins in sarcopterygians evolved from a primitive polybasal condition. However, the fossil record has been silent on whether and when the inferred transition took place. Here we describe three-dimensionally preserved shoulder girdles of two stem sarcopterygians (Psarolepis and Achoania) from the Lower Devonian of Yunnan, which demonstrate that stem sarcopterygians have polybasal pectoral fin articulation as in basal actinopterygians. This finding provides a phylogenetic and temporal constraint for studying {{the origin of the}} stylopod, which must have originated within the stem sarcopterygian lineage through the loss of the propterygium and mesopterygium...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{corticosteroid}} {{concentrations were}} measured in 14 {{species of fish}} immediately after they were electrofished from reservoirs on the Alabama River and after they had been transported for 2 h. There was no corticosteroid response in spotted gars Lepisosteus oculatus. <b>Bowfins</b> Amia calva, longnose gars Lepisosteus osseus, and freshwater drums Aplodinotus grunniens had only small corticosteroid increases (14 - 39 ng/mL) during transportation. Corticosteroids increased by intermediate amounts (59 - 184 ng/mL) during transportation in blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus, paddlefish Polyodon spathula, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, river carpsuckers Carpiodes carpio, white bass Morone chrysops, striped bass Morone saxatilis, and crappies Pomoxis sp. The greatest increases were 223 ng/mL in gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and 286 ng/mL in common carp Cyprinus carpio. Spotted and longnose gars, largemouth bass, and common carp also were held in tanks for about 2 months at 21 ░C and then stressed by confinement in a dip net for 30 min.

A fair number of mammals lived in this region, which included several genera of multituberculates, cladotherians, marsupials, and placental insectivores. The mammals are more primitive than those that lived in the area that is now the Kaiparowits Formation. Trace fossils are relatively abundant in the Wahweap Formation, and suggest the presence of crocodylomorphs, as well as ornithischian and theropod dinosaurs. In 2010, a unique trace fossil was discovered that suggests a predator-prey relationship between dinosaurs and primitive mammals. The trace fossil includes at least two fossilized mammalian den complexes, as well as associated digging grooves presumably caused by a maniraptoran dinosaur. The proximity indicates a case of probable active predation of the burrow inhabitants by the animals that made the claw marks. Invertebrate activity in this formation ranged from fossilized insect burrows in petrified logs to various mollusks, large crabs, and a wide diversity of gastropods and ostracods.|$|R
