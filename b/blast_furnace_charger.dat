40|$|The modem, highly {{competitive}} business of producing low cost, premium quality iron via the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> route requires precise process control and {{a thorough understanding}} of the key operational variables. Much of the understanding of the factors influencing the process can only be obtained from measuring and testing on each individual furnace. This is particularly the case with regard to the raw materials charging system, as local factors including raw material specification and specific equipment design greatly influence the process. When BHP Steel Flat Products Division embarked on the massive project of adding a new <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> to the Port Kembla Steelworks a decision was made to ensure the plant would begin operations only after it was thoroughly understood. In keeping with this approach, a significant program of testing was undertaken on the new No. 6 <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> <b>charging</b> system. This thesis details the work done, the results gained and the application of the information on the now operating plant. As the ultimate purpose of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>charging</b> system is to enable the raw materials to be placed inside the furnace accurately and consistently in a predictable and controlled way, the aim of the test work undertaken on the charging system was to build the understanding necessary to allow the plant to be set up to achieve the desired burden distribution on the stockline. The testing covered the raw materials handling system from the point where the material is first diverted to No. 6 <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> {{all the way to the}} inside of the furnace on the burden surface. The information was used to characterise individual pieces of equipment and the systems which together are the <b>charging</b> system. The <b>furnace</b> operation since the original blow-in in June 1996 has been remarkably smooth, with the furnace reaching the uprating targets comfortably. The excellent progress made during the uprating and the consequent stable operation is significantly attributable to the extensive work done as part of the charging system design and commissioning to understand and control raw material size segregation...|$|R

40|$|This {{feasibility}} study {{has indicated that}} of the approximately 120, 000 tons of steel available to be recycled from used oil filters (UOF's), a maximum <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>charge</b> of 2 % of the burden may be anticipated for short term use of a few months. The oil contained in the most readily processed UOF's being properly hot drained and crushed is approximately 12 % to 14 % by weight. This oil will be pyrolized {{at a rate of}} 98 % resulting in additional fuel gas of 68 % and a condensable hydrocarbon fraction of 30 %, with the remaining 2 % resulting as carbon being added into the burden. Based upon the writer's collected information and assessment, {{there appears to be no}} operational problems relating to the recycling of UOF's to the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> One steel plant in the US has been routinely charging UOF's at about 100 tons to 200 tons per month for many years.

5000|$|To process taconite, the ore {{is ground}} into a fine powder, the {{magnetite}} {{is separated from}} the gangue by strong magnets, and the powdered iron concentrate is combined with a binder such as bentonite clay and limestone as a flux. As a last step, it is rolled into pellets about one centimeter in diameter that contain approximately 65% iron. The pellets are fired {{at a very high}} temperatures to harden them and make them durable. This is to ensure that the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>charge</b> remains porous enough to allow heated gas to pass through and react with the pelletized ore. Firing the pellet oxidizes the magnetite (Fe3O4) to hematite (Fe2O3), an exothermic reaction that reduces the cost of pelletizing the concentrate. E. W. Davis of the University of Minnesota Mines Experiment Station is credited with developing the pelletizing process. Since the commercial development of this process in the Lake Superior region in the 1950s, the term [...] "taconite" [...] has been used globally to refer to iron ores amenable to upgrading by similar processes.|$|R
30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed coal charge in air tight coke ovens. The coal charge mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the coke is pushed from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (dry quenching). This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> (coke rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>charge</b> materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large capacity <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|R
25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer converter at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> was <b>charged</b> into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.|$|R

Through KSZ- 03 ore comprehensive metallurgical properties tester and drum {{devices such as}} low temperature for pellets in index for performance test, to determine the low tem-perature reduction degradation and the influence factors {{of the degree of}} pulverization. Results show that when the gas conditions remain stable, and improve the low temperature pulverization experiment of reduction gas flow, degree of pellets reduction degradation also increased signifi-cantly; When the reduction temperature reaches 500 ℃, low temperature pulverization phenome-non is the most serious, and temperature higher than 500 ℃ and below 500 ℃ will reduce the de-gree of pulverization. Pellets has qualities of uniform granularity, high strength, low powder content, high iron grade and good reducibility, so it can help to increase production, save the coke, improve ironmaking technical economic indicators and raise revenue [Liu Wenquan, 2006][Ye Kuangwu, 2007].

40|$|When using 100 % self-fluxed pellets in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> burden, top <b>charged</b> fluxes, {{especially}} the BOF-slag, may cause irregularities in operation. The major reason has been theoretically {{attributed to the}} problematic slag formation in the furnace. As the melting of pellets {{is the first step}} of the slag formation process, the softening and melting properties of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets with and without addition of fluxes are studied experimentally. The results show that the softening and melting properties of the two types of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets are quite suitable for <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> operation. Contrarily, the melting-down characteristics of BOF-slag are variable and harmful to the slag formation under a reducing atmosphere. Adding 5 % BOF-slag to the self-fluxed pellets can considerably worsen the softening and melting properties of pellets. It can either increase the softening and melting temperature interval substantially or cause the precipitation of solid phases, mainly di-calcium silicates, in the slag. It is quite likely that the resulting slag will therefore become very viscous, even entirely blocking the melting down of the pellets up to a temperature 1 520 °C.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the iron}} making industry, the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> is <b>charged</b> with coke and ore (metallic) {{particles}} {{by means of}} an inclined chute rotating about its vertical axis. For each rotation, the particles fall on the sloping burden and form a circular ring. Charging of this metallic ore burden over the layer of coke causes a portion of the coke layer to get dislodged from its original position. This phenomenon is known as coke collapse. We have studied these phenomena in a quasi two dimensional rectangular bin on a smaller scale. In-order to get the desired density difference between the pouring media, stainless-steel balls (representing the ore) and glass- beads (representing the coke) are used as the model granular materials. The parameters varied in the experiments are the volume of pouring and the size of particles (steel balls). Varying quantities of these particles are poured into the experimental unit and the resulting pattern thus formed is then captured using a Nikon-DX camera. The images are analyzed using computer code to determine the position of each particle (steel ball and glass bead). The results presented here are in terms of concentration of steel balls by making bins of 5 x 5 mm in size. The interface (stock line) between the steel balls and the glass beads has been analyzed separately and plotted for all data sets.
