REACHER {{is a tool}} that derives {{the conditions under which}} each program block in a Pascal program, procedure or function may be executed (i. e., the reachability conditions for each subprocedure, subfunction and <b>begin-end</b> <b>block).</b> The tool shall accept compilable Pascal program source code and shall produce both an annotated listing and an augmented control flow graph. REACHER is {{one of a series of}} four tools that work in an integrated fashion to analyze Pascal programs to determine the failure regions associated with identified faults in the programs. The augmented control flow graph produced by REACHER will used as input by the programs FALTER and SPACER, and shall be customized for such usage. The annotated source listing provides includes a correspondence between Pascal statements and control flow graph nodes. The users may access REACHER, FALTER and SPACER through a screen-oriented user interface called VIEWER.

Some of its features in-clude syntax highlighting, various methods for automatic insertion of text (such as the <b>begin-end</b> <b>blocks</b> in environments and automatic labels for sec-tion commands), lookup of labels and cite keys based on partial matches, {{as well as}} tools for dealing with large projects. TextMate is designed with the user in mind, so {{it is easy to}} customize it to your needs. During its short lifetime (about two and a half years) it has gained many supporters and has become a very popular text editor for the Mac OS X platform, and especially among LATEX users, as {{can be seen from the}} exponential growth in the number of users, and the large number of LATEX related questions on the TextMate mailing list. In addition to this article, the first authorâ€™s weblog can be used as a starting point for learning more about using TextMate for LATEX...|$|R
