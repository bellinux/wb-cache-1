25|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} coccobacillus, non mobile with no spores. It is a {{facultative anaerobic}} organism that can infect humans via the oriental rat flea. It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and <b>bubonic</b> <b>plagues.</b> All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|R
5|$|Monica Bellucci as the Mirror Queen, a beautiful, evil queen who {{experimented with}} black magic before {{being struck by}} the <b>Bubonic</b> <b>plague,</b> her spell giving her eternal life but not the eternal youth she had expected.

5|$|Most historians {{state that}} Deusdedit {{died of the}} plague that was {{prevalent}} in England at the time. Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions {{the outbreak of the}} plague, the historian J. R. Maddicott asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly. Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was probably <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague.</b> Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{still more}} {{resonant}} {{aspect of his}} legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia. A devastating outbreak of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> in the early 540s {{marked the end of}} an age of splendour.|$|E
500|$|Deusner {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 7 out of 10, complimenting the release by adding that, [...] "Madonna is an ideal {{candidate}} for the tribute album treatment, having already inspired several {{in the past but}} none [...] quite as sturdy or as much fun as Through the Wilderness". However he felt that few of the songs were [...] "uninspired", like Drag's version of [...] "Oh Father" [...] and <b>Bubonic</b> <b>Plague's</b> rendition of Who's That Girl. Jon Caramanica from Spin also gave a positive review, saying that the album captures [...] "Madonna's vivacious side, but [...] desperate too". He particularly commended [...] "Crazy for You", saying that [...] "the last 30 seconds of [...] chilling—frontwoman Ariana Delawari and her traditional Afghan backing accelerate feverishly, breaking the sweat Madonna never quite did, or could".|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} of the island {{is believed to have}} varied from 40,000 to 60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and <b>bubonic</b> <b>plagues</b> adversely affected the population several times. There were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804. The first census was carried out in 1703 and revealed that the population was then 50,358. After the destructive volcanic eruptions of the Laki volcano during 1783–1784, the population reached a low of about 40,000. Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century—from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14years old or younger. With a fertility rate of 2.1, Iceland is one of only a few European countries with a birth rate sufficient for long-term population growth (see table on the left).|$|R

5|$|Seven years later, in 542, {{a devastating}} {{outbreak}} of <b>Bubonic</b> <b>Plague,</b> {{known as the}} Plague of Justinian and second only {{to that of the}} 14th century, laid siege to the world, killing tens of millions. As ruler of the Empire, Justinian, and members of his court, were physically unaffected by famine. However, the Imperial Court did prove susceptible to plague, with Justinian himself contracting, but surviving, the pestilence.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bubonic</b> <b>Plague</b> struck Gaza {{again in}} 1839 and the city, lacking {{political}} and economic stability, went {{into a state of}} stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza whilst the city was still recovering from the effects of the plague.|$|E
5|$|The {{aristocracy}} shunned the City {{and lived}} {{either in the}} countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End), the site of Charles II's court at Whitehall. Wealthy people preferred to live at a convenient distance from the traffic-clogged, polluted, unhealthy City, especially after it {{was hit by a}} devastating outbreak of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> in the Plague Year of 1665.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bubonic</b> and septicemic <b>plague</b> is {{generally}} spread by flea bites or handling an infected animal. The pneumonitic form {{is generally}} spread between {{people through the}} air via infectious droplets. Diagnosis is typically by finding the bacterium in fluid from a lymph node, blood, or sputum.|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} specific for Yersinia pestis V antigen and F 1 antigen, administered singly or in combination, protected mice in {{models of}} <b>bubonic</b> and pneumonic <b>plague.</b> Antibodies showed synergy when administered prophylactically {{and as a}} therapy 48 h postinfection. Monoclonal antibodies therefore have potential {{as a treatment for}} plague...|$|R
5|$|Because fleas carry plague, {{they have}} seen service as a {{biological}} weapon. During World War II, the Japanese army dropped fleas infested with Y. pestis in China. The <b>bubonic</b> and septicaemic <b>plagues</b> are the most probable form of the plague that would spread {{as a result of}} a bioterrorism attack that used fleas as a vector.|$|R
5|$|The {{prolonged}} and escalating ByzantineSassanid {{wars of the}} 6th and 7th {{centuries and}} the recurring outbreaks of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> (Plague of Justinian) left both empires exhausted and vulnerable {{in the face of}} the sudden emergence and expansion of the Arabs. The last of these wars ended with victory for the Byzantines: Emperor Heraclius regained all lost territories, and restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in 629.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{report issued}} {{jointly by the}} Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> in humans {{resulting}} from the ingestion of raw camel liver. Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. Yersinia pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's corral.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he was probably not regularly at home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the <b>Bubonic</b> <b>Plague).</b> He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died before age 10.|$|E
40|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) {{is a type}} of bacterium. It is {{believed}} to have been responsible for plagues of the early 1300 s. More accurately, it is a Gram-negative rod-shaped coccobacillus. It is a facultative anaerobe that can infect humans and other animals. Human Y. pestis infection takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and <b>bubonic</b> <b>plagues.</b> All three forms are widely believed to have been responsible for a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including the Justinianic Plague of the sixth century and the Black Death that accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353. It has now been shown conclusively that these plagues originated in rodent populations in China. More recently, Y. pestis has gained attention as a possible biological warfare agent and the CDC has classified it as a category A pathogen requiring preparation for a possible terrorist attack. Every year, thousands of cases of plague are still reported to the World Health Organization, although, with proper treatment, the prognosis for victims is now much better. A five- to six-fold increase in cases occurred in Asia during the time of the Vietnam war, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. Plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals. In the United States of America, animals such as the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered black-footed ferret are under threat from the disease...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bubonic</b> plague: <b>Plague</b> is {{a disease}} caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium. Rodents are the normal host of plague, and the disease is {{transmitted}} to humans by flea bites and occasionally by aerosol {{in the form of}} pneumonic plague. The disease has a history of use in biological warfare dating back many centuries, and is considered a threat due to its ease of culture and ability to remain in circulation among local rodents {{for a long period of}} time. The weaponized threat comes mainly in the form of pneumonic plague (infection by inhalation) It was the disease that caused the Black Death in Medieval Europe.|$|R
50|$|Sylvatic plague is an {{infectious}} bacterial disease {{caused by the}} bacterium Yersinia pestis that primarily affects rodents such as prairie dogs. It is the same bacterium that causes <b>bubonic</b> and pneumonic <b>plague</b> in humans. Sylvatic, or sylvan, means 'occurring in wildlife,' and refers specifically to the form of plague in rural wildlife. Urban plague refers to the form in urban wildlife.|$|R
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} {{the abandonment of}} villages from the <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> of 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore {{municipality}} {{was established}} in 1888 and the city was divided into eight wards. In 1897 an outbreak of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague</b> killed {{nearly half of the}} population of the city. With the establishment of the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB) in 1903, Mysore became one of the first cities in Asia to undertake planned development of the city. Public demonstrations and meetings were held there during the Quit India movement and other phases of the Indian independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{began with}} an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were {{reported}} missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague.</b> He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed up the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; the number who died remains disputed, ranging {{from a low of}} 30 to a high of 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.|$|E
50|$|Like {{some other}} forms of gram-negative sepsis, septicemic plague can cause disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation, and is almost always fatal when untreated (the mortality rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent). However, it only occurs in a minority of cases of Yersinia infection, so that fewer than 5,000 people a year acquire the disease. It is the rarest of the three plague varieties; the other forms are <b>bubonic</b> and pneumonic <b>plague.</b>|$|R
50|$|Urban plague is an {{infectious}} disease among rodent species {{that live in}} close association with humans in urban areas. It {{is caused by the}} bacterium Yersinia pestis which is the same bacterium that causes <b>bubonic</b> and pneumonic <b>plague</b> in humans. Plague was first introduced into the United States in 1900 by rat-infested steamships that had sailed from affected areas, mostly from Asia. Urban plague spread from urban rats to rural rodent species, especially among prairie dogs in the western United States.|$|R
50|$|The 1994 plague in India was an {{outbreak}} of <b>bubonic</b> and pneumonic <b>plague</b> in south-central and southwestern India from 26 August to 18 October 1994. 693 suspected cases and 56 deaths were reported from the five affected Indian {{states as well as}} the Union Territory of New Delhi. These cases were from Maharashtra (488 cases), Gujarat (77 cases), Karnataka (46 cases), Uttar Pradesh (10 cases), Madhya Pradesh (4 cases) and New Delhi (68 cases). There are no reports of cases being imported to other countries.|$|R
5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague.</b> Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E
5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague,</b> it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for <b>bubonic</b> <b>plague,</b> and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E

50|$|The ongoing {{outbreak}} of plague in Madagascar in 2014 started on 31 August. On {{that day the}} first case, a male from Soamahamanina village in Tsiroanomandidy, was identified. The patient died on 3 September. The outbreak {{is in the form}} of <b>bubonic</b> and pneumonic <b>plague.</b> As of 16 November 2014, a total of 119 cases have been confirmed, including 40 deaths. Two percent of reported cases are of the pneumonic form. As of 21 November, in the capital Antananarivo there have been two confirmed cases, including one death.|$|R
50|$|A severe threat {{with the}} {{potential}} to facilitate the rapid spread of plague in Madagascar is the large numbers of rats in the country's prisons. If fleas carrying the bacteria Yersinia pestis were to infect these rats, they would inevitably infect prisoners, prison guards and visitors, which in turn would threaten the health of the general population. Humans bitten by an infected flea normally develop a <b>bubonic</b> form of <b>plague,</b> which can be successfully treated with antibiotics. If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonic plague, which can result in death 24 hours after infection.|$|R
