25|$|Titus Quinctius Capitolinus <b>Barbatus</b> (513 BC - after 423 BC) was a Roman statesman {{and general}} {{who served as}} consul six times. Titus Quinctius {{was a member of}} the gens Quinctia, one of the oldest patrician {{families}} in Rome.|$|E
25|$|Bearded seal Erignathus <b>barbatus</b> (maklak sg makliik dual makliit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, maklag in Cup'ig) is {{the best-known}} {{species of the}} seals living in the all Eskimo (Yupik and Inuit) regions. For Yup'ik hunters, bearded seals were the seal of choice. Bearded seals were widely {{considered}} the best seal for meat. The blubber was rendered into oil.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} marine mammals {{can be seen}} in the park’s area: ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus <b>barbatus)</b> live there in large numbers, and from time to time a walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), common seal (harbour seal, Phoca vitulina), a beluga (Delphinapterus leucas), a narwhal (Monodon monoceros), or a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) may appear in Wager Bay.|$|E
25|$|Mating is {{perennial}} and species-specific between subspecies {{of the red}} harvester ant. Males distinguish reproductive {{females of}} their species from females of other species using pheromones. This {{occurs as a result}} of sexually stimulating pheromones secreted from the poison glands of reproductive P. <b>barbatus</b> females. These pheromones are perfectly detected by males of the species upon physical contact, resulting in the stimulation of sexual behavior.|$|E
25|$|Within nonreproductive P. <b>barbatus</b> worker ants, {{five major}} tasks are performed: foraging, {{maintenance}} of the nest, defense, midden work, and convening. Roles are not constant and chemical interactions determine when certain ants engage in certain activities. As such, these tasks are relatively fluid and cannot be understood as separate processes. The transition in behavior on behalf of one group triggers behavioral transitions in other groups of worker ants.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} P. <b>barbatus</b> caste {{is responsible}} for the formation of new colonies. A single queen ant establishes every colony. Large numbers of winged male ants and virgin queen ants fly to mating aggregation sites following midsummer monsoon rains. To found a successful colony, P. <b>barbatus</b> queens must mate with males from two separate lineages. One lineage results in ants that become the workers of the colony. These are the ants responsible for the nonreproductive tasks of the colony. The other lineage produces reproductive female ants. After mating with the male ants at the aggregation site, the queen flies away to establish a new colony. Upon arriving at her new nest site, the queen loses her wings and builds a nest in the soil. The entrance into the nest is then sealed off to lay her eggs in safety. With this, the colony is born. Over the course of the following six to eight weeks, the primary brood of nonreproductive worker ants emerges and begins to forage and build the colony.|$|E
25|$|Costus curvibracteatus is a {{tropical}} rhizomatous perennial native to Costa Rica and Panama. A {{member of the}} spiral ginger family of plants, its common name is orange tulip ginger. It is also {{sometimes referred to as}} spiral ginger; however, this common name is better associated with Costus <b>barbatus,</b> a more widely cultivated and very similar species. Despite the name and its relation to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), the rhizomes of the orange tulip ginger are not edible.|$|E
25|$|Bearded seal Erignathus <b>barbatus</b> (maklak sg makliik dual makliit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, maklag in Cup'ig) is {{the best-known}} {{species of the}} seals living in the all Eskimo (Yupik and Inuit) regions. For Yup'ik hunters, bearded seals were the seal of choice. Bearded seals were widely {{considered}} the best seal for meat. The blubber was rendered into oil and the hide used {{for a variety of}} items, including boot soles, rope, mats, and rifle cases.|$|E
25|$|Within {{reproductive}} aggregations of P. <b>barbatus</b> ants, strong male competition exists. Males {{engage in}} communal mating displays to attract females. Male ants attempt {{to mate with}} any female they encounter, but females resist copulation from the males. Consequently, the communal mating displays heavily favor reproduction with larger or more persistent males which are able to overpower the females and successfully copulate. The male ants copulate {{for as long as}} possible, likely to restrict access to the female from other males to ensure their sperm survives to reproduce.|$|E
25|$|In P. <b>barbatus,</b> {{reproductive}} and nonreproductive {{tasks are}} divided into a caste system, as discussed above. Some individuals are specialized for reproductive function, while other ants are responsible for nonreproductive roles such as defense, caring for the brood, and foraging for food. The system of division of labor naturally arises {{in conjunction with the}} formation of the group, rather than as a secondary adaptation; otherwise solitary queen harvest ants placed in forced association had division of labor arise in groups that lack an evolutionary history of such social arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Pogonomyrmex <b>barbatus</b> is {{a species}} of {{harvester}} ant from the genus Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include red ant and red harvester ant. These large (5– to 7-mm) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the Southwestern United States. Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 m deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.|$|E
25|$|Many {{inscriptions}} {{and ancient}} fragments {{may be seen}} built into the old houses. In 1903 {{the foundations of the}} Temple of Isis were discovered close to the Arch of Trajan, and many fragments of fine sculptures in both the Egyptian and the Greco-Roman style belonging to it were found. They had apparently been used as the foundation of a portion of the city wall, reconstructed in 663 under the fear of an attack by the Byzantine emperor Constans II, the temple having been destroyed by order of the bishop, St <b>Barbatus,</b> to provide the necessary material (A. Meomartini, 0. Marucchi and L. Savignoni in Notizie degli Scavi, 1904, 107 sqq.).|$|E
25|$|The tomb {{was founded}} {{around the turn}} of the 3rd century BC, after the opening of the Via Appia in 312 BC, {{probably}} by the then head of the family, Lucius Cornelius Scipio <b>Barbatus,</b> consul in 298 BC. He was the earliest known occupant after his death around 280 BC. His sarcophagus was the only one to survive intact - it is now on show at the Vatican Museums, re-united with its original inscription. According to Coarelli, the capacity of 30 burial places was reached, and the main body of the complex was essentially complete, by the middle 2nd century BC, but new burials continued at long intervals until the 1st century AD. During that time the tomb was a landmark in ancient Rome.|$|E
25|$|Messalina was the {{daughter}} of Domitia Lepida the Younger and her first cousin Marcus Valerius Messalla <b>Barbatus.</b> Her mother was the youngest child of the consul Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus and Antonia Major. Her mother's brother, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, had been the first husband of the future Empress Agrippina the Younger and the biological father of the future Emperor Nero, making Nero Messalina's first cousin despite a seventeen-year age difference. Messalina's grandmothers Claudia Marcella and Antonia Major were half sisters. Claudia Marcella, Messalina's paternal grandmother, was {{the daughter}} of Augustus' sister Octavia the Younger by her marriage to Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor. Antonia Major, Messalina's maternal grandmother, was the elder daughter of Octavia by her marriage to Mark Antony, and was Claudius' maternal aunt. There was, therefore, a large amount of inbreeding in the family.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} in 1614 did not alter or further publicize the tomb. He must have resealed it, hid the entrance and kept its location a secret, for whatever reasons, as it disappeared from public knowledge and was lost again, despite publication of the inscription. In 1780 the then owners of the vineyard, the brothers Sassi, who apparently {{had no idea it}} was there, broke into the tomb again during remodelling of their wine cellar. They opened it to the leading scholars of the day. Someone, perhaps them, fragmented the slabs covering the loculi, with the obvious intent of accessing the contents, being careful to preserve the inscriptions. If the act is to be attributed to the Sassi, and if the motive of treasure-hunting is to be imputed to them, they found no treasure. What they did find they turned over to the Vatican under Pope Pius VI, including the gold signet ring taken off the finger bone of <b>Barbatus.</b> Apparently some masonry was placed in the tomb with an obscure intent.|$|E
500|$|By November, a {{specimen}} of the exotic South American Catasetum orchid Hooker {{had given to}} Darwin had shown its [...] "truly marvellous" [...] mechanism, by which it shot out a pollinium at any insect touching {{a part of the}} flower [...] "with sticky gland always foremost". This plant had astonished botanists in 1836 when Robert Hermann Schomburgk stated that he had seen one plant growing three distinct flowers which usually grew separately and had wrongly been categorised as three distinct genera, namely Catasetum tridentatum, Monachanthus viridis, and Myanthus <b>barbatus.</b> John Lindley had remarked that [...] "such cases shake to the foundation all our ideas of the stability of genera and species." [...] One of Darwin's correspondents told of delight at growing a beautiful specimen of Myanthus <b>barbatus</b> imported from Demerara, then dismay when the plant flowered the next year as a simple Catasetum.|$|E

Between 1990 and 1992, Sakimoto worked on over 20 different video games for several different companies such as Toshiba EMI, Artec, and Data East. It was during this time that he composed his first solo score, for 1990's Bubble Ghost.|$|E
500|$|The Egyptian vulture {{was first}} {{formally}} {{described by the}} Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Vultur [...] percnopterus. The current genus Neophron contains only a single species. A few prehistoric species from the Neogene period in North America placed in the genus Neophrontops (the name meaning [...] "looks like Neophron") {{are believed to have}} been very similar to these vultures in lifestyle, but the genetic relationships are unclear. The genus Neophron is considered to represent the oldest branch within the evolutionary tree of vultures. Along with its nearest evolutionary relative, the lammergeier (Gypaetus <b>barbatus),</b> they are sometimes placed in a separate subfamily, the Gypaetinae.|$|E
500|$|The {{polar bear}} {{is the most}} {{carnivorous}} species of bear, and its diet primarily consists of ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus <b>barbatus)</b> seals. Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water. The polar bear's most common hunting method is still-hunting: The bear locates a seal breathing hole using its sense of smell, and crouches nearby for a seal to appear. When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice. The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice. Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within , and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within [...] of the seal and then suddenly rushes to attack. A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow. They may also feed on fish.|$|E
2500|$|Interspecies {{competition}} {{exists between}} harvester ant populations, presenting challenges to successful foraging. One {{example of this}} is the competition for access to seed resources between the Novomessor cockerelli and Pogonomyrmex <b>barbatus</b> species of harvester ants. Novomessor cockerelli ants engage in interference competition against Pogonomyrmex <b>barbatus</b> colonies by [...] "plugging" [...] entrances to the nest with sand and small rocks. This delays activity of P. <b>barbatus</b> for one to three hours, shifting the onset of foraging until later in the day when the temperature is substantially higher. This reduces productivity in two ways; firstly, the ants are delayed and consequently have less time to forage; secondly, high soil temperatures prematurely drive harvest ants back into their nests, shortening the range of possible foraging. Research indicated that the affected P. <b>barbatus</b> populations did not take efforts to compensate for the interference in their activities, such as by inducing higher rates of foraging. As such, nest plugging by rival species impedes the overall productivity of worker ants in the species Pogonomyrmex <b>barbatus.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to Livy, the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio <b>Barbatus</b> was {{assigned}} Etruria {{and his colleague}} Gnaeus Fulvius Maximus Centumalus was given the Samnites. <b>Barbatus</b> was engaged in a battle near Volterrae (in northern Etruria) which was interrupted by sunset. The Etruscans retreated during the night. <b>Barbatus</b> marched to the Faliscan district and laid Etruscan territory north of the River Tiber to waste. Gnaeus Fulvius won in Samnium and seized Bovianum, and Aufidena. However, an epitaph on the sarcophagus of Cornelius Scipio says that he ‘was consul, censor and aedile ...... He captured Taurasia and Cisauna in Samnium; he subdued all Lucania and brought back hostages.’ Cornell says that the original inscription was erased and replaced by the extant one probably around 200 BC, and notes that this [...] "was the period when the first histories of Rome were being written, {{which is not a}} coincidence.".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{submission}} of Lucania and the bringing back of hostages, Livy {{said that the}} Lucanians were willing to give hostages as a pledge of good faith. Cornell remarks that [...] "he intimation of that the Lucanians’ submission {{was the result of}} military action {{is a good example of}} how events could be improved in the telling." [...] Forsythe points out that Livy noted that in 296 BC the Romans suppressed plebeian disturbances in Lucania on the behest of the Lucanian aristocracy. He argues that this suggests divisions in Lucania over the alliance with Rome and that, if this was also the case in 298 BC, <b>Barbatus</b> might have gone to Lucania to quell any possible local resistance to the alliance as well as to prevent Samnite raids and to collect the agreed hostages. Forsythe also notes that Barbatus’ campaign in Etruria could be explained in three ways: 1) it could be fictive; 2) <b>Barbatus</b> could have campaigned in both Samnium and Etruria; 3) <b>Barbatus</b> participated in the campaigns linked to the front which led to the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC, and that this may have included operations in Etruria in that year, but it might have been attributed by later historians to his consulship in 298 BC. As for the claim that <b>Barbatus</b> subdued all of Lucania, Forsythe suggests that this is [...] "perhaps part truth and part a Roman aristocratic exaggeration." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was the son}} of Lucius Quinctius and {{grandson}} of Lucius Quinctius.

[...] His son, who bore the same name, Titus Quinctius Capitolinus <b>Barbatus,</b> was elected consul in 421 BC and was possibly the military tribune with consular power in 405 BC.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to having <b>Barbatus</b> fighting in Samnium the inscription records him as taking Taurasia (probably in the Tammaro valley in the modern province of Benevento) and Cisauna (unknown location), rather than Bovianum and Aufidena. There is the further complication by the Fasti Triumphales (a record of Roman triumphal celebrations), recording Gnaeus Fulvius’ triumphs against both the Samnites and the Etruscans. Forsythe {{points out that the}} consulship is the only public office <b>Barbatus</b> is mentioned as having held which gave him command of a legion. Modern historians have proposed various alternative scenarios wherein {{one or both of the}} consuls campaigned against both the Samnites and Etruscans, but without satisfactory conclusions. Cornell says that such an assumption could reconcile the sources, but [...] "if so, neither Livy nor the inscription would emerge with much credit. Once again the evidence seems to show that there was a great deal of confusion in the tradition about the distribution of consular commands in the Samnite Wars, and that many different versions proliferated in the Late Republic."

2500|$|Only {{the general}} {{direction}} of the tomb along the Via Appia to the south was known from the written sources. The question of whether it was inside or outside the city caused some confusion, apparently without realization that the city had expanded to include it. The tomb was rediscovered in 1614 in a vineyard, broken into (the term [...] "excavated" [...] in the modern sense does not apply), two sarcophagi were found, the inscription (titulus) of L. Cornelius, son of <b>Barbatus,</b> consul 259, was broken out and was sold. It changed hands many times before rejoining the collection; meanwhile, it was published by Giacomo Sirmondo in 1617 in [...] "Antiquae inscriptionis, qua L.

2500|$|Mating {{occurs at}} {{reproductive}} aggregation sites. Secretions from the mandibular glands of males initially mark these sites. The secretions attract females, {{as well as}} additional males, resulting in strong male competition for mates. The system of mating within P. <b>barbatus</b> [...] is comparable to lek behavior performed by many vertebrate species. The male ants congregate and collectively give off a pheromone that attracts reproductive females. The more males present to give off the pheromone, the stronger the attraction for the females. Although this practice strongly favors certain males and leaves many others without mates, the congregation of males attracts more females on the whole as opposed to pheromone release {{on behalf of a}} solitary male. Consequently, it is more desirable for the less attractive males to remain in the lek than to attempt to attract females on their own.|$|E
2500|$|The 30 resting places {{approximately}} {{correspond to}} the number of Scipiones who lived between the beginning of the 3rd and the middle of 2nd century BC, according to Coarelli. There are two types of sarcophagi - [...] "monolithic" [...] (i.e.; carved from a single block of tufa) and [...] "constructed." [...] The latter type, which is in the majority, is an arched recess sunk into the wall in which the deceased was placed, and the opening covered by an inscribed slab with the letters painted red. English writers typically called these recesses [...] "loculi". The recesses stand where they were, but the slabs have been moved to the Vatican. The monolithic sarcophagus of <b>Barbatus</b> {{was at the end of}} a corridor, in line with what once may have been a window, now the main entrance. The other sarcophagi of both types were added later as further shafts and rooms were sunk for the purpose.|$|E
