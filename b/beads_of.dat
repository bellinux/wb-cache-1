5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. <b>Beads</b> <b>of</b> sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E

50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> a tire {{to the wheel}} of a vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when the tire is inflated, the tire pressure pushes the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire against the inside of the wheel rim so that the tire stays on the wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R

5000|$|An {{internal}} beadlock is {{very much}} like an inner tube within the tire that pushes the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire tight against the wheel. The internal beadlock is inflated via its own valve stem. The side of the beadlock closest to the tread, the [...] "case", has a layer of thick fabric, generally polyester, which keeps the beadlock from inflating too far up into the tire. This forces the sides into the tire which compresses the <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> the tire against the wheel.|$|R

When the necklace is received, the initiated must bow over a bathtub and have his/her head washed by the olo orichá. The elekes serves as the sacred banners for the Orichás and act {{as a sign of}} the Orichá's presence and protection; however, it must never be worn during a woman's menstruation period, nor during sex, nor when bathing.|$|E
25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarity}} of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests {{that one could}} have inspired the other, as {{there is some evidence}} of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the {{similarity of}} the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.|$|E

25|$|A {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} plastic {{pollution in the}} marine ecosystem {{is the use of}} microplastics. Microplastics are little <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.|$|E
25|$|The Yayoi {{period is}} marked by {{specific}} centers specializing in magatama and the widespread trade of magatama. The period {{is marked by}} the formation of power centers {{that came to be}} individual states. The development of weapons increased in this period to protect increasingly developed rice fields and fishing rights. Trade greatly increased in this period, as did the specialization of production of certain items, including magatama. Magatama producing areas exchanged their product with other products, specifically rice, leading to the widespread distribution of magatama across Japan. Magatama were commonly used to create necklaces and bracelets worn on the wrists or ankles. The necklace was typically constructed of jadeite magatama separated by cylindrical bored-holed pieces of jasper. Small <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> dark-blue glass are also not uncommon on the necklace. The bracelet was typically also used shells from the coastal areas of Shikoku and the Inland Sea, wood, and bronze. In this period the use of the mirror, sword, and jewels as status symbols for village, and later regional leaders of all kinds, emerged in the Yayoi period, and point to the origin of the mirror, sword, and magatama as the Imperial Regalia of Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Mehrgarh Period II (5500 BCE–4800 BCE) and Merhgarh Period III (4800 BCE–3500 BCE) were ceramic Neolithic, using pottery, {{and later}} chalcolithic. Period II is at site MR4 and Period III is at MR2. Much {{evidence}} of manufacturing activity {{has been found}} and more advanced techniques were used. Glazed faience beads were produced and terracotta figurines became more detailed. Figurines of females were decorated with paint and had diverse hairstyles and ornaments. Two flexed burials were found in Period II with a red ochre cover on the body. The amount of burial goods decreased over time, becoming limited to ornaments and with more goods left with burials of females. The first button seals were produced from terracotta and bone and had geometric designs. Technologies included stone and copper drills, updraft kilns, large pit kilns and copper melting crucibles. There is further evidence of long-distance trade in Period II: important {{as an indication of}} this is the discovery of several <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> lapis lazuli, once again from Badakshan. Mehrgarh Periods II and III are also contemporaneous with an expansion of the settled populations of the borderlands at the western edge of South Asia, including the establishment of settlements like Rana Ghundai, Sheri Khan Tarakai, Sarai Kala, Jalilpur and Ghaligai.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The purpose <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> & boxing <b>of</b> an {{impression}} is {{to obtain an}} accurate cast with proper border & base thickness for fabrication <b>of</b> restorations. <b>Beading</b> is {{the protection of the}} formed border thickness of the final impressions & Boxing of {{an impression}} is building up vertical walls around it. Aim: The purpose of this hybrid technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> and boxing is to produce a smooth & aesthetically acceptable cast with accurate border thickness using a simple procedure. Materials & Methods: In this hybrid technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> and boxing an impression, a uniform layer of modeling wax was applied over the <b>beading</b> <b>of</b> a plaster-pumice mixture around an impression; after that, boxing & pouring of an impression was done to retrieve a cast. Results: Casts obtained by hybrid technique was more accurate in border thickness & more aesthetic in comparison to the cast obtained by wax technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> & boxing. Conclusion: <b>Beading</b> and boxing <b>of</b> an impression is done to protect the formed border thickness of an impression, regulate the height & size of the cast, avoid undue trimming of the cast and to eliminate distortion associated with slumping of the gypsum material when an impression is inverted. This hybrid technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> and boxing eliminates the need for applying separating media over the <b>beading</b> <b>of</b> a plaster-pumice mixture and by this technique retrieval of the cast from the impression is very easy and quick. The resulted cast will be very neat and clean with accurate thickness of the borders and base of the cast. This technique is suitable for impressions made from almost any type of impression material...|$|R
