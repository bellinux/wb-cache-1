40|$|Extruded {{snacks and}} <b>breadsticks</b> were {{formulated}} with increasing levels of brewer’s spent grain (BSG). The phenolic content increased by 4 and 7 fold with BSG addition in extrudates (40 g/ 100 g) and in <b>breadsticks</b> (35 g/ 100 g), respectively. Consequently, antioxidant capacity (DPPH, FRAP) also increased despite a recorded loss of phenolic compounds in extruded snacks. Arabinoxylans content increased up to 20 and 25 g of BSG addition / 100 g of formulated extruded snacks and <b>breadsticks,</b> respectively. Further addition of BSG {{did not improve}} the content of arabinoxylans due to the possible formation of polysaccharide-protein complexes. Medium GI <b>breadsticks</b> were obtained with 35 g of BSG incorporation / 100 g formulation. Phenolic content, arabinoxylans content and antioxidant capacity increased in the final products with BSG addition while the glycaemic response decreased. BSG can be incorporated as an ingredient {{in the formulation of}} extruded snacks and <b>breadsticks</b> generating products richer in antioxidants and fibre and with low GI...|$|R

40|$|Solina is {{a common}} wheat variety {{cultivated}} in mountain areas of central Italy (mainly in the Abruzzo region) because it is adapted to sustainable agriculture carried out in marginal areas with cold climates; therefore Solina-based products are of interest for consumers, territorial sustainment, and biodiversity conservation. Even though Solina is locally used for bread-making, due to its unique flavour, the poor gluten {{quantity and quality of}} its flours do not permit to produce high quality products. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of Solina flour to make <b>breadsticks</b> since, usually, low strength flours are used for this type of products. The low bread-making quality of Solina does not permit to use standard process parameters suitable for commercial wheat for its mixing process. Mixing parameters such as mixing speed-rate, oil, and water addition before mixing were thus modulated by using an experimental design in order to optimize the mixing process. The doughs were eventually leavened and baked to obtain <b>breadsticks.</b> Commercial wheat flour used for <b>breadsticks</b> production was used for making <b>breadsticks</b> used as control. Baked <b>breadsticks</b> were analysed for their volume increase after leavening and baking, moisture, colour, texture and sensory properties. Solina <b>breadsticks</b> resulted more friable, crunchy and grain-flavoured than commercial common wheat used for <b>breadsticks</b> production. Moreover, high oil percentages and medium speed-rate were necessary in order to optimize these peculiar characteristics even though oil addition masked the typical grain-flavour of Solina flour. The use of water contents lower than the optimal hydration level enhanced the brown colour and the biscuit-like flavour of <b>breadsticks</b> even if these conditions reduced their crunchiness and friability [...] This study confirms that the optimization of process parameters could permit to obtain high quality products even by using flours with low gluten content and quality provided that the qualitative characteristics of prime materials and the final product are known...|$|R

Ten formulations of <b>breadsticks</b> were processed by varying concentrations of seaweed (X 1 = 5 to 15 % of overall flour concentration) and white flour (X 2 = 10 to 30 % of overall flour concentration) using a central composite design. The remaining flour concentrations were comprised of wholemeal flour. Predicted models {{were found to be}} significant (P 0. 05) between the seaweed <b>breadsticks</b> and the control which shows that such fiber-rich seaweed bakery products are acceptable to consumers and have potential of increasing seaweed consumption among non-seaweed consumers...|$|R
