40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} tool wear and geometry response when machinability tests were applied under milling operations on the Super Austenitic Stainless Steel alloy AL- 6 XN. Eight milling trials were executed under two cutting speeds, two feed rates, and two depths of cuts. Cutting edge profile measurements were performed to reveal response of cutting edge geometry to the cutting parameters and wear. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to inspect the cutting edges. Results showed the presence of various types of wear such as adhesion wear and abrasion wear on the tool rake and flank faces. Adhesion wear represents {{the formation of the}} <b>built-up</b> <b>edge,</b> crater wear, and chipping, whereas abrasion wear represents flank wear. The commonly formed wear was crater wear. Therefore, the optimum tool life among the executed cutting trails was identified according to minimum length and depth of the crater wear.

40|$|In this paper, {{machining}} aeronautical {{aluminum alloy}} AA 2024 -T 351 in dry conditions was investigated. Cutting forces, chip segmentation, and <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> formation were analyzed. Machining tests {{revealed that the}} chip formation process depends on cutting conditions and tool geometry. So continuous and segmented chips are generated. Under some cutting conditions, <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> formation occurs. A predictive machining theory, based on a finite elements method (FEM), was applied to reproduce and explain these phenomena. Thermomechanical behaviors of the work material and the tool-work material interface were considered.

It was shown that the feed force is well reproduced by the ALE-FE (arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian finite element) formulation and highly underestimated by the lagrangian finite element (LAG-FE) one. While, the periodic localized shear band, leading to a chip segmentation, is well reproduced with the Lagrangian FE formulation. It was found that the chip segmentation can be correlated to the cutting force evolution using the defined chip segmentation intensity parameter.

However it islimited due to the hard metrological detectability of the area of action. Modern sourcesfor high energetic synchrotron radiation and new detectors enable in situ diffractionexperiments during the cutting process within a very small gauge volume. In the present study the method of in situ diffraction with high-energy synchrotronX-radiation {{was used for the}} first time for a comprehensive study of the chip formationprocess during orthogonal cutting experiments. Information about the microstructuraldevelopment in terms of local microstrains, domain sizes, stacking fault probabilitiesand preferred crystal orientations as well as the spatially resolved stress states withinthe chip formation zone have been obtained from diffraction data. For the workpiecesteel C 45 E with bcc structure and the fcc aluminium alloy AlCuMg 1 the influenceof the cutting parameters were studied through a variation of the undeformed chipthickness, the cutting edge radius and the rake angle. On the basis of the results frombrass alloys CuZn 10, CuZn 37 and CuZn 40 the influence of the stacking fault energyand the influence of a second phase have been investigated for various rake angles. A significant dependence of the maximum stresses on the rake angles was observed. The maximum stresses increase upon a decreasing rake angle. In contrast, the maximumstresses do not show a significant dependence on the undeformed chip thicknessand the cutting edge radius. However, a significant dependence of the stress gradientswas observed. Stronger stress gradients can be observed with smaller undeformedchip thickness, smaller cutting edge radius and higher rake angles. During chip formationa strong decrease in domain sizes and an increase in microstrains can be observedwhich proves a strong strain hardening within the chip. The microstructural gradients show identical behaviour as the macroscopic stresses,exhibiting a clear relation between the microstructural development and the evolvingstress state. A further strain hardening was proven within the observed <b>built-up</b> <b>edges,</b> due to thedecrease in domain sizes and an increase in microstrains. The strain hardening resultsin an increase in the von Mises stresses and the hydrostatic stresses. For the first time, the results of a cutting simulation could be compared to experimentaldata. It was concluded that the appearing differences between experiment andsimulation are mainly addressed to the disregard of the strong microstructural developmentand the resulting strain hardening of the material. Using the shear angle relationof OPITZ and HUCKS it could be shown that the experimental data on the stress statesin the chip formation zone can be used to verify and extend existing chip formationmodels.

When the radiated power is increased {{owing to the}} injected impurities, we observe a strong reduction of the plasma temperature at the plasma boundary. At the same time, the particle transport out of the confined volume decreases, accordingly the neutral flux back into the plasma decreases. In discharges, where the density is increased by strong gas fuelling and the energy confinement degrades, we observe a <b>built-up</b> of <b>edge</b> density and neutral pressure owing to a higher recycling coefficient. In contrast, with moderate gas fuelling the edge density and neutral pressure remain low. While the seeded impurities cause a substantial dilution at the plasma edge, the plasma core is much less affected, leading to hollow impurity concentration profiles.

An analysis of the experimental plasma profiles with respect to stability against the ion temperature gradient driven mode (ITG mode) shows that the ITG mode is substantially reduced during the confinement improvement and that it re- appears if the density is increased and a subsequent confinement roll-over occurs with too a strong gas fuelling.

40|$|Flood cooling is {{primarily}} used to cool and lubricate {{the cutting tool}} and workpiece interface during a machining process. But the adverse health effects caused {{by the use of}} flood coolants are drawing manufacturers' attention to develop methods for controlling occupational exposure to cutting fluids. Microlubrication serves as an alternative to flood cooling by reducing the volume of cutting fluid used in the machining process. Microlubrication minimizes the exposure of metal working fluids to the machining operators leading to an economical, safer and healthy workplace environment. In this dissertation, a vegetable based lubricant is used to conduct mist, microstructure and wear analyses during end milling AISI 1018 steel using microlubrication. A two-flute solid carbide cutting tool was used with varying cutting speed and feed rate levels with a constant depth of cut. A full factorial experiment with Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted and regression models were generated along with parameter optimization for the flank wear, aerosol mass concentration and the aerosol particle size. MANOVA indicated that the speed and feed variables main effects are significant, but the interaction of (speed*feed) was not significant at 95 % confidence level. The model was able to predict 69. 44 %, 68. 06 % and 42. 90 % of the variation in the data for both the flank wear side 1 and 2 and aerosol mass concentration, respectively. An adequate signal-to-noise precision ratio more than 4 was obtained for the models, indicating adequate signal to use the model as a predictor for both the flank wear sides and aerosol mass concentration. The highest average mass concentration of 8. 32 mg/m 3 was realized using cutting speed of 80 Surface feet per minute (SFM) and a feed rate of 0. 003 Inches per tooth (IPT). The lowest average mass concentration of 5. 91 mg/m 3 was realized using treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT. The cutting performance under microlubrication is five times better in terms of tool life and two times better in terms of materials removal volume under low cutting speed and feed rate combination as compared to high cutting speed and feed rate combination. Abrasion was the dominant wear mechanism for all the cutting tools under consideration. Other than abrasion, sliding adhesive wear of the workpiece materials was also observed. The scanning electron microscope investigation of the used cutting tools revealed micro-fatigue cracks, welded micro-chips and unusual <b>built-up</b> <b>edges</b> on the cutting tools flank and rake side. Higher tool life was observed in the lowest cutting speed and feed rate combination. Transmission electron microscopy analysis at failure for the treatment 120 SFM and 0. 005 IPT helped to quantify the dislocation densities. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) identified 4 to 8 µm grain size growth on the machined surface due to residual stresses that are the driving force for the grain boundaries motion to reduce its overall energy resulting in the slight grain growth. EBSD also showed that (001) textured ferrite grains before machining exhibited randomly orientated grains after machining. The study shows that with a proper selection of the cutting parameters, it is possible to obtain higher tool life in end milling under microlubrication. But more scientific studies are needed to lower the mass concentration of the aerosol particles, below the recommended value of 5 mg/m 3 established by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn-situ strain {{measurements}} {{with high}} energy synchrotron radiation during orthogonal cutting of AISI 1045 were carried out. Thereby {{it was possible}} to determine the stress state in the chip formation zone during the cutting process. As such, observations regarding the formation of built-up edges during the cutting process have been made. The formation of a <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> on the cutting tool is a common phenomenon during cutting of mild steel and other ductile materials, in particular at low cutting speeds. This may result in increased tool wear and a decrease in the resulting surface quality. By analyzing the chip roots of the in-situ experiments, {{it was possible to}} determine the geometry of the built-up edges on tools with a rake angle of γ =  0 ° and cutting edge radii of rβ =  30  μm and rβ =  60  μm.

50|$|By {{the time}} Ryman began working, older artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and Philip Guston had already reduced {{painting}} to its essences. In 1955 Ryman began {{what he considers}} his earliest professional work, a largely monochrome painting titled Orange Painting (1955-59). In the late 1960s he created his Classico series of compositions consisting of multi-panel paintings on {{a specific type of}} paper called Classico. For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking tape, painted the sheets with a shiny white acrylic paint, removed the tape when the sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. The <b>built-up</b> paint <b>edge</b> tracing the outline of masking tape and the ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, the configuration of tape traces, and the painted shape. Just as the Classico works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called Surface Veil works from 1970 were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were painted. Some of the 12-foot square paintings from the series were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen. In each of these works the pigment appears to form a membrane over the support due to the differing degrees of opacity and translucence in the white paint juxtaposed with areas where less of it has been applied, leaving the fabric exposed. These disruptions in the painting’s skin often mark the literal pauses between the artist’s working sessions.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a cold {{radiating}} plasma boundary has been proposed as a solution {{of the problem of}} power exhaust in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. In the tokamak TEXTOR the injection of impurities (neon, silicon or argon) leads to the formation of a radiating plasma boundary where up to 90 % of the input power can be distributed to large wall areas, thereby strongly reducing the convective heat flux density onto the plasma facing components. At high plasma densities the impurity seeding leads to a transition to an improved confinement state, termed the Radiative Improved Mode (RI-mode). This operational scenario combines high density and high confinement with power exhaust by radiation under quasi-stationary discharge conditions. The plasma density can be further increased by external gas fuelling, while the high confinement is maintained, if the gas is fuelled at a moderate rate. In contrast, strong gas fuelling leads to a confinement degradation back to the normal L-mode level. We have used plasma diagnostics based on optical methods to characterise particle, energy and neutral transport at the plasma boundary. When the radiated power is increased owing to the injected impurities, we observe a strong reduction of the plasma temperature at the plasma boundary. At the same time, the particle transport out of the confined volume decreases, accordingly the neutral flux back into the plasma decreases. In discharges, where the density is increased by strong gas fuelling and the energy confinement degrades, we observe a <b>built-up</b> of <b>edge</b> density and neutral pressure owing to a higher recycling coefficient. In contrast, with moderate gas fuelling the edge density and neutral pressure remain low. While the seeded impurities cause a substantial dilution at the plasma edge, the plasma core is much less affected, leading to hollow impurity concentration profiles. Operation at the highest densities is favourable with respect to the release of impurities at the edge as well as with respect to the resulting impurity content in the plasma bulk. The most prominent change of transport in the plasma core is a steepening of background density profile while the temperature in the core can be maintained or even slightly increased. The global energy confinement is strongly correlated with the density peaking. An analysis of the experimental plasma profiles with respect to stability against the ion temperature gradient driven mode (ITG mode) shows that the ITG mode is substantially reduced during the confinement improvement and that it reappears if the density is increased and a subsequent confinement roll-over occurs with too a strong gas fuelling. The dynamics of both the confinement improvement and of the degradation is initiated at the plasma edge. The resulting changes in the plasma core amplify the initial trigger. Consequently, we observe a non-linear interplay between edge and core which allows for a self-organisation of the plasma and a bifurcation between two rather different states. The transition and the changes of the plasma profiles can be described in agreement with the experimental findings by a transport model based on the ITC mode and the dissipative trapped electron (DTE-) mode, which is connected to a strong anomalous particle pinch. This inward pinch leads to the steepening of the density profile once the ITG mode growth is reduced by the impurities. During the confinement degradation with strong gas injection increased edge transport leads to a reduction of the impurity content in the core below the level needed for the ITC suppression...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the end of}} the Second World War in 1945, Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s {{built-up}} area stretched mainly along both sides of the thoroughfare, Landesstraße 350, west of the Ohmbach. From the village’s north end (280 m above sea level) to the former ﬁre station at the crossing of Landesstraßen 350 and 352 in the south (269 m above sea level), the village has a length of more than 1.75 km, and if the distance to {{the way out of the}} village at the Bockhof is counted, this rises to more than 2.5 km. Until the mid 20th century, Herschweiler-Pettersheim was a typical linear village (by some deﬁnitions, a “thorpe”), and one of the longest villages in the Kusel district. As early as then, however, the side dales branching off the Ohmbach to the west were already settled up to about 200 m in, the Kerb valley in “die Hohl”, the “Gigum” in the Geilbach valley and the old Ducal road (Herzogstraße) in the Ehrsbach valley, which in feudal times led from Schloss Pettersheim over the heights towards the Oster valley to Zweibrücken. East of the Ohmbach, the {{built-up area}} reached thinly up the old Konker Straße (“Konken Road”). Good conditions for building houses and commercial buildings together with springs were found there in a sheltered location at the dale’s edge, which was rich in groundwater, on both sides of the old road link through to today’s Kreisstraße 20 towards Wahnwegen. Sewer-laying work about 1980 unearthed a layered log road about one metre deep under the roadway that had been used as a link between the residential areas “in der Hohl” and “Im Eck” in Herschweiler’s old village core across the wet and marshy Ohmbach valley ﬂoor. There was even expansion not far from Schloss Pettersheim on a road link across the dale linking two roads running through the heights. This link led to a Waldecke (“forest corner”) on the Hühnerkopf, and then onwards to the Roman road east of Wahnwegen. In this part of the village, formerly known as Walleck, and nowadays as Wallheck (both derived from Waldecke), with its houses set at odd angles to each other and its maze of lanes, one can still make out the original layout of the place despite all the conversions and modernization. The agricultural homesteads on the Bockhof were built at a U-shaped valley, the “Kirschen-Grund” (“Cherry Ground”), which ends here, and on today’s Landesstraße 352. After the Second World War with its great loss of male inhabitants (67 had fallen in the war and 29 had gone missing from a village of 1,100 inhabitants; in the First World War, 24 had fallen), the economic downturn, the Allied occupation and currency depreciation came a time of general, lively building activity once the Wirtschaftswunder had begun and the prisoners of war had come home (the last one came home in 1950). Thus, the parts of the village had fully grown together and also grown in breadth. Parallel to Hauptstraße (“Main Street”) after the war, a linking roadway within the municipality, later known as Kirchenstraße (“Church Street”), was built up as far as the location of the Evangelical church. The church itself was built in 1953 and 1954 at an exposed spot east of the Ohmbach in the highest part of the village core. Moreover, a new building zone ﬁlled in the gap between Bockhof and Pettersheim. On the riverside ﬂats in 1973, the company Chalou GmbH built a clothing factory. Gaps on Bockhofstraße were also ﬁlled. A new building zone called Buchrech opened east of the church as the beginning of a new residential neighbourhood along a second street running parallel to Hauptstraße, at mid-slope up the Hühnerkopf’s west ﬂank. Yet another new building zone called “Am Hühnerrech” reaching to Seitersstraße, followed, which has since 2003 been growing to the east into the countryside. For urban growth, this is a very questionable development both because of the spillover into residential land, the demographic development and the high land consumption on the one hand and because of the threatening degradation of the village core on the other. The people who originally lived on the village thoroughfare move away from the core and settle towards the edge of the village in a pleasant neighbourhood, just as happens in other villages, leaving the houses along the thoroughfare empty and unused. In 2003, six houses in the Upper Village (Oberdorf) alone stood empty. Further houses will follow owing to the population’s age structure. An older, empty pair of semi-detached houses next door to the inn “Zum Hirschen” were torn down in 2003. Even in the village centre, a former big department store that had sold clothing and food had to give way to today’s village square. Despite stagnating and declining population growth, the <b>built-up</b> area’s outer <b>edge,</b> and the village’s street, watermain and sewer networks are all being expanded, which could have major consequences for later generations. For this reason, renewal of the inner village might be more important than opening new building zones on former meadows. As early as the time between 1960 and 1980, many houses in Herschweiler-Pettersheim had ﬂoors added and thereby were made more suitable to the demand for more living space. Even the graveyard laid out in the Geilbach valley in 1839 has had to be repeatedly expanded. Since the sporting ground built in 1928 in the “Wallheck” also served the municipality as a fairground in the years after the war, a new one was built specially for the village’s sport club in the years 1955-1957 in the “Wallhecksdell”. A new clubhouse with changing cubicles and a room for business was dedicated in 1967. Work on a new grass playing ﬁeld was begun in 1975. Owing to improper grading, the project met with great and long-lasting problems with landslides, such that the grass playing ﬁeld could only be dedicated in 1984. The masses of earth that had slid down the slope, which had even shoved the forest ﬂoor, complete with trees, ahead of them, had to be removed to the edge of the village.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of metal cutting in a vacuum and {{of the influence of}} atmospheric gases and lubricating vapours is described. A lathe equipped with a vacuum chamber is used with a calibrated tool-bar. Experiments have been conducted with mild steel, copper, and aluminium. Oxygen is shown to have a strong influence on the cutting of mild steel, and it is suggested that this is attributable to the reduction of adhesion between tool and chip, especially to the limitation {{of the size of the}} <b>built-up</b> <b>edge.</b> The cutting force is thereby greatly diminished. Copper and aluminium do not show <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> formation, and it is found that the cutting force in vacuum does not differ greatly from that in air. This is explained on the supposition that a relatively strong adsorbed oxygen layer on the free chip surface impedes dislocation movement at the shear plane, and counteracts the effect of reduced adhesion at the tool face. The results suggest that the cutting force for aluminium at low speeds with 18 " rake tool is actually slightly higher in air than in vacuum. This explanation is supported by high-temperature cutting results on copper and a test with degassed and oxygen-saturated cutting fluid...|$|E

The formation of <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> (BUE) and adhesive layer on the tool rake face degrades on the one hand, the shape and efficiency of cutting tool and on the other hand, the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the finished product. This paper describes tool wear mechanisms in dry machining of a usual aluminium–copper alloy (2024) with an uncoated cemented carbide tool (WC–Co). Orthogonal cutting tests were performed using an instrumented planer machine. The morphology of chips, cutting forces and contact lengths were analyzed for several cutting conditions. The tool–chip interface temperature and the average pressure were calculated by conducting calibration–cutting experiments in conjunction with FEM simulations. This allowed to define the contact parameters associated with different cutting conditions on the tool rake face.

Such special material combinations and, therefore, processing conditions {{are common in}} the automotive sector, where the load-oriented material use induces a significant reduction of fuel consumption. The machining of such a material combination comes along with several challenges including notch wear on the main cutting edge {{as a result of}} the arc-sprayed cylinder walls or a <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> formation on the main cutting edge because of the aluminum. Promising approaches by means of an internally and externally cooled cutting insert are presented in this paper and compared to common external cooling...|$|E
40|$|Current {{practice}} when nitriding {{high speed}} steel (HSS) cutting tools is to avoid embrittlement of the cutting edge by limiting {{the depth of the}} diffusion zone. This is accomplished by reducing the nitriding time and temperature and eliminating any compound layer formation. However, in many applications there is an argument for generating a compound layer with beneficial tribological properties. In this investigation, results are presented of a metallographic, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of nitrided HSS surface layers generated using active screen plasma nitriding and reactive vapour deposition using cathodic arc. These results are discussed in the context HSS cutting tool performance when machining under <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the morphology of <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> (BUE) formation under {{wet and dry}} conditions with low and high cutting speeds. The workpiece materials and cutting tools selected for this work were aluminium alloy and canela carbide inserts graded PM 25. The cutting tools underwent turning operation machining tests and their performance was evaluated by the flank wear and observation of the tool wear area. The machining tests were conducted at different spindle speeds and feed rates while the cut depth was kept constant. The analysis showed that formation of the BUE was dominant at low cutting speeds in dry conditions, but in wet conditions at high cutting speeds, a better performance was exhibited in terms of wear analysis...|$|E
40|$|For many metal alloys, {{the process}} of metal cutting is {{accompanied}} by extensive plastic deformation and fracture. To study this process, quick stop sectional samples of hypoeutectic Al-Cu alloy chip formation, either as convention-ally cast alloy or as “semi solid metal ” are used. The type of chip formation is classifi ed according to crack formation mechanism and propagation. During cutting, in all specimens used, quasi-continuous chips with <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> (BUE) are obtained. The formation of BUE is undesirable since it is a highly deformed body with a semi stable top which periodically breaks away giving rise to poor workpiece surface quality.

40|$|The article {{contains}} a literature review, experimental results, and a Finite Element Model (FEM) composition. Orthogonal turning tests were executed {{in the range of}} cutting speeds and feed rate, after every test chip was collected. Further investigation was done using FE model validation and experimentation, which uses results of the experimental zone in which the <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> did not form and the cutting itself is of even plastic deformation. The essence of this research is that the adequacy of the composed FE model to the real physical process should conform not only to the evaluation of cutting forces, but also to the evaluation of chip form, that is, segmentation frequency.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 257 - 278). Micromilling is a cost-e ective method of fabricating miniaturized components with complex, three-dimensional features made from di cult-to-cut materials. Microcutting tools {{are exposed to}} harsh conditions during machining of such materials, which leads to short tool life and thus a ects {{the economics of the}} process. The aim of this thesis is to develop a systematic approach to the design and fabrication of high-precision micro-cutting tools. Machining characteristics of three di erent di cult-to-cut materials–stainless steel, titanium alloy, and silicon–have been investigated using experimental techniques. The results reveal the importance of interaction between tool micro geometry and work material mechanical properties. This observation leads to the development of tailored micro-end mills which are designed and fabricated based on the requirements of the specific machining task. This study also examines in detail <b>built-up</b> <b>edge,</b> an important but usually overlooked issue in micromachining of ductile materials, which a ects the process forces, tool wear, and tool deflections. The protective e ect of <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> has been exploited by creating micro-dimples on the tool surface using electrical discharge machining. Its positive influence on tool performance has been demonstrated. As for the micromachining of silicon, the flow of cut material around the cutting edge is paramount in tool design. A novel tool design for machining of silicon has been proposed and its e ectiveness has been validated through experiments. It has been shown that the selection of proper process parameters together with tailored tool design may increase the productivity of micromachining and improve surface quality and dimensional accuracy of micro-scale parts. by Samad Nadimi Bavil Oliaei.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{difficulties}} of shaping of internal treads with the required accuracy in aluminium alloys {{caused by a}} <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> were studied in this paper. A new design of deforming-cutting taps which allows the increase of the accuracy of internal threads was proposed. The difference of the new design from the existing ones is that each land of tap has both deforming and cutting teeth. An operation principle of the proposed tap {{is based on the}} preliminary plastic deformation with the following cutting of the workpiece material. In order to compare the proposed tap with existing designs of deforming and cutting taps, the comparative experimental study was carried out. The results of this experiment have shown that utilization of the proposed tap can essentially increase the quality of internal threads and prevent BUE formation...|$|E

A good surface quality can enhance corrosion resistance and fatigue behavior throughout product life cycle. Magnesium alloys have gained {{in the recent years}} a larger use due to an excellent ratio between mechanical strength and weight. Cooling conditions are particularly important when machining magnesium. The chips are flammable and highly reactive with water based fluids. Higher temperature favors also the formation of <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> and worsens surface quality. The present paper analyses the influence of cooling conditions and cutting parameters on surface roughness of the parts made of magnesium alloy. Using design of experiments technique, a series of experiments were organized and based on that a connection between surface quality and cutting conditions was established...|$|E

High {{deformation}} hardening, low thermal conductivity, high <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> {{tendency of}} {{austenitic stainless steels}} were the main factors that make their machinablity difficult. For determination of the suitable cutting parameters in machining austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 by PcBN cutting tools, the samples which were prepared {{to be used in}} the experiment, 300 mm in length and 60 mm in diameter, were dry machined in a numerical control lathe. During experiments, dry turning parameters, such as feed rate, cutting speed and cut depth were investigated. The suitable cutting speed and feed rate were determined according to workpieces surface roughness, cutting tools flank wear. Finally, cutting speed of 180 to 200 m/min, feed rate of 0. 05 to 0. 06 mm/rev and cut depth of 0. 10 mm gave the satisfied results...|$|E

The cutting fluids and workpiece materials in this report {{are the same as}} in the 1 st report except the cast iron. The results obtained are as follows. 1. In such a low cutting speed as V= 10 m/min, the magnitude of surface roughness is a very large value. It is found that that the surface roughness also decreases with cutting fluids when the type of chip approaches the flow type and a less <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> occus. The effect of the mineral oil base is greater than water and water base. 2. The fluctuation of cutting force and surface finish are in the close relation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTool wear {{concept has}} been usually related {{with the loss}} of tool material. Currently, it must not involve only this way, since wear {{includes}} all the changes of the tool properties -geometrical and physicochemical- which modify the initial cutting conditions. Therefore, tool geometrical alterations can also include material addition. Transfer of cutting material to cutting tool during machining process of aluminium alloys, is strongly related with the secondary or indirect adhesion wear mechanisms, in form of layer (Built-Up Layer, BUL) onto the tool rake face and/or bulk (<b>Built-Up</b> <b>Edge,</b> BUE) located on the cutting edge. High resolution tridimensional models from tested cutting tools have been obtained with Focus-Variation Microscopy (FVM) techniques. Adhesion wear parameters have been defined in the FVM images and they have allowed evaluating the wear effects on WC-Co cutting tools in the dry turning of UNS-A 92024 -T 3 alloy...|$|E

Tool wear as the main cause of surface roughness was also investigated. ANN was trained through experimental data obtained on the basis of full factorial design of experiments. Various influential machining parameters were taken into consideration. It was illustrated that a multilayer perceptron neural network could efficiently model the surface roughness as the response of the network, with an error less than ten percent. The performance of the trained network was verified by further experiments. The results of UAT were compared with the results of conventional turning experiments carried out with similar machining parameters except for the vibration amplitude whence considerable reduction was observed in the <b>built-up</b> <b>edge</b> and the surface roughness...|$|E
