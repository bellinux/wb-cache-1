During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E

She comes into the care of Willow Ufgood, a kind farmer and conjurer who hopes to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> sorcerer; his wife Kiaya and his {{children}} {{fall in love with}} the baby immediately, and Willow too soon grows to love her as one of his own. During a town festival, the village is attacked by a Nockmaar hound which is quickly killed by the village warriors. The High Aldwin, the village sorcerer, learns about the baby and selects Willow, due to his devotion to the child, to accompany a party of volunteers returning the baby to the Daikini (human) people. At a crossroads, they find a human warrior named Madmartigan trapped in a crow's cage. The rest of the party want to give the baby to Madmartigan and go home immediately, but Willow and his friend Meegosh refuse, so the others leave.

Having <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> estate agent and believing that the area then known as Spring Tank would be a prime setting for a new town, Ellsbury contacted Tower about purchasing the site. Tower hired Ellsbury as his land agent for this area, offering him a 5% commission on all land sold to incoming farmers, and a pass for unlimited travel on the Northern Pacific. Ellsbury, a former artist for Harper's Weekly and Leslie's Illustrated Magazine, turned real estate agent, {{was typical of the}} land speculators who moved to the west.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} all Orcs were {{dependent}} on the Dark Lord in various ways: after their leader was defeated, the Orcs were confused and dismayed, and easily scattered by their enemies. In the millennia after Morgoth's defeat and banishment from Arda, they were without a leader, and degenerated to small, quarrelsome tribes hiding in the Misty Mountains. Only when Sauron returned to power did they begin to reclaim some of their old standing. The same happened after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men: only when Sauron returned as the Necromancer of Mirkwood did the Orcs <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> danger for Middle-earth again.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{dream is}} to one day <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> lady, to have her own prince, and {{to be friends with}} {{everyone}} she knows. Meanwhile, she is a fairly ordinary little girl; she likes the colour pink and red, pudding, pancakes, and rabbits. Her favorite school subject is drawing, while her least favorites are language classes. Her least favorite food is listed in the manga as carrots, just like Usagi, but they both eat them in the anime. Chibiusa hates taking care of the house and is afraid of such things as thunder and lightning, ghosts, vampires, dentists, and needles. She also likes to collect things with rabbits on them, and belongs to the Gardening Committee at school. She is very short when she first appears, but grows slightly taller as she gets older.|$|E

25|$|In the 1972 season, Davourlis scored 15 {{goals and}} Panachaiki {{finished}} sixth. The best was {{still to come}} though. After an amazing 1973 season in which he scored again 15 goals, including a hat trick in Toumba Stadium against championship contender PAOK, he achieved with Panachaiki something that no other Greek countryside club ever had done at the time: participation in a European competition, for instance the 1974 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Davourlis' performances and leadership were still very good but rumors related to his transfer affected him considerably. Panachaiki proved to be unable to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> threat to the local powerhouses and finished once again sixth. At {{the end of a}} season during which he scored 11 times in the Championship and once in the UEFA Cup, Davourlis was transferred to Olympiacos. The transfer fee was 9.25 million Drachmas, the highest in Greek football history at the time.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E
500|$|The plot of {{the film}} {{involves}} an old wood-carver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio. The puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy, who informs him that he can <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> boy if he proves himself to be [...] "brave, truthful, and unselfish". Pinocchio's efforts to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> boy involve encounters {{with a host of}} unsavory characters. The film was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia, William Cottrell, Otto Englander, Erdman Penner, Joseph Sabo, Ted Sears, and Webb Smith from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts. Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water. The film was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7, 1940.|$|E

Dorothy, having been reunited with her aunt and uncle, and feeling that she is not ready to leave Kansas to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> star, rejects, but Aunt Em says that she wants her to go with the Muppets on their Star Hunt, much to her even bigger surprise.

500|$|Rumors quickly {{surfaced}} that Francis {{had died}} after being inoculated, and so, Franklin {{wrote in the}} Pennsylvania Gazette, on December 30, that [...] " [...] intended to get [...] inoculated {{as soon as he}} should have recovered sufficient strength from a flux with which he had been long afflicted," [...] and that the boy [...] "received the distemper in the common way of infection." [...] However, the choice of having his son inoculated was a difficult one for Franklin, as Francis could die either way. Inoculation would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> choice only if there was a high chance of smallpox being contracted naturally. In this case, the choice of having Francis inoculated was justified, even with its 2% mortality rate.|$|E
500|$|Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea {{began to}} create their own music after finding {{inspiration}} in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt. The three formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled [...] "Out in L.A.", and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once. [...] The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while [...] "jamming" [...] with Irons, and was not meant to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music. Following the group's first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band's name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

500|$|The wind farm, which {{stretches}} across nearly [...] of open moorland between Edenfield, Rawtenstall and Rochdale, {{was officially}} opened on 25September 2008. {{and was at}} that time the largest onshore wind farm in England.As of 26August 2008, 21 of 26turbines had been commissioned and 4,000MW·h of electricity had been exported to the National Grid.

500|$|Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} film four stars out of five, saying [...] "Perhaps the biggest {{compliment}} you could pay the film, {{apart from that}} it’s by and large hysterically funny, {{is that it is}} unmistakably film-like, with a smoothly arcing plot and gross-out moments staged with the verve and ceremony of an action-movie set-piece." [...] In The Guardian, Mike McCahill gave the film three stars. He found fault in its treatment of female characters, saying [...] "Some of the abundant thought channelled into knob gags could have been diverted towards developing the boys' female counterparts beyond harpies and lust objects". Unlike Collin, he found The Inbetweeners 2 to resemble a television show more than a film: [...] "as with the first film, number 2 never quite shakes its resemblance to primetime E4, complete with ad-ready fadeouts and Walkabout interiors...couldn't the vehicles transporting them to the wider world display slightly more ambition?". Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, summing it up as [...] "The Fannytastic Four leave us on a poo-flecked, piss-soaked, sun-burned high that more than overcomes its familiar flaws to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> contender for the year’s funniest film. Four star wankers".|$|E
