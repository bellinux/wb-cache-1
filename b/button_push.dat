In the manual adjustment, we can move the cursor roughly by an eye, then move {{it a little more}} by the mouse onto the GUI button.

30|$|The {{results also}} show a bias in speed {{perception}} of looming sounds {{that occurs in}} the absence of distance-related tasks. Although listeners may sometimes use changes in distance to estimate speed, there is also good evidence for the direct detection of auditory speed (Carlile & Best, 2002; Freeman et al., 2014; Locke, Leung, & Carlile, 2016; Warren, Zielinski, Green, Rauschecker, & Griffiths, 2002). It is notable that speed estimates in all but the slowest stimulus condition were generally less than the actual speed of the stimuli. Recent psychophysical work has also shown an underestimation of auditory speed in a circular pattern around the head (Senna, Parise, & Ernst, 2015). However, the current finding is likely the result of a well-documented difficulty in applying metric labels accurately to speed stimuli rather than a true perceptual underestimation of the speed of approach (Recarte et al., 2000; Recarte & Nunes, 1996; Triggs & Berenyi, 1982). For example, previous research using the same stimuli required participants to execute a <b>button</b> <b>push</b> when a looming sound source arrived and participants significantly underestimated arrival time indicating a perceived speed that was faster than actual (Neuhoff et al., 2014, 2012; Riskind et al., 2014). Because “labeling” the speed of looming sounds is typically not a priority in a natural environment, the primary concern here was to examine relative differences between conditions rather than absolute estimates of speed. Moreover, participants show better accuracy with a motor response than a verbal response in judging looming stimuli (Neuhoff, 2001).|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of {{conscious}} sedation with propofol on long latency components of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) in 10 normal volunteers (aged 21 - 41 yr) receiving propofol 75 ng kg" 1 min~ 1 i. v. We {{examined the effects of}} propofol on ERP amplitudes and latencies, and their relationship to delayed recognition perform-ance using a verbal memory test, a selective attention task (button pushing) and serum concen-trations of propofol. During infusion of propofol, subjects were mildly sedated, oriented and readily responsive to verbal commands. ERP were recorded from monopolar Fz, Cz and P 2 electrodes. We used a standard paradigm requiring selective attention to randomly occurring stimuli associated with a task (<b>button</b> <b>push).</b> The peak-to-peak amplitudes and latencies of the N 2 and P 3 waves were obtained before and during infusion, and 15, 100 and 170 min after infusion. Propofol produced a 70 % decrease in the amplitude of P 3 (P < 0. 0001) from baseline and a 50 % increase in reaction time. The differential response to target compared with non-target stimuli was maintained during infusion for both N 2 and P 3. Memory performance correlated more strongly with changes in P 3 amplitude (r = 0. 59) than with serum propofol concentrations (r = — 0. 07), although this correlation with memory did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 08). We conclude that P 3 amplitude was profoundly af-fected by propofol given in sedative concentrations. (Br. J. Anaesth. 1995; 74 : 674 - 680...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} advent of multi-microphone recording, sound {{engineers}} have wrestled with the colouration of sound by phasing issues. For some this was an anathema; for others this colouration was a crucial ingredient of the finished product. Traditionally, delicate microphone placement was essential, with subtle movements and tilts allowing the producer/engineer to determine when a sound was “in phase” based on perception alone. More recently, DAW’s have allowed us to view multiple waveforms and manually nudge them into coherence with visual feedback now supporting the aural, although still a manual process. Building upon technology first developed for the author’s paper, “Killing Spillage”, presented at ARP 2006 in Edinburgh, this paper will present an algorithm that allows automatic correction of phase via a unique Max/MSP patch operating on multiple audio components simultaneously. With a single <b>button</b> <b>push,</b> the producer can now hear a stereo recording with maximum coherence and thus make an artistic judgement as to whether the “ideal” is ideal, or better to pursue naturally occurring phase colouration in preference. The patch allows zoning in to spatially separated sound sources, eg tuning drum kit overheads to phase lock with the snare drum or hi-hat microphone and subsequently optimising other components of the array to concur. In addition, the patch allows retrospective “manual re-positioning” of microphones through a number of user controlled sample-accurate delay lines that emulate the proximity of a given microphone to its target sound source to afford the producer the desired degree of non-ideal phase colouration if preferred. Audio examples will be played to demonstrate the patch’s effect on professionally recorded drum kits, orchestras with spot mics and others. Limiting factors, contexts, applications and future developments will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{auditory}} {{system is}} capable of extrapolating repetitious patterns from the acoustic environment to form prediction models, which specify the most likely characteristics of subsequent sounds. When an encountered sound deviates from expectation, an auditory evoked potential (the mismatch negativity, or MMN) is elicited. Building on the studies of Todd et al.,(2011; 2013), this thesis employed the multi-timescale sequence to reveal a bias that distorts the impact of local sound statistics on MMN amplitude. By presenting alternating patterns of sound where a high probability repetition is interrupted by a rare physical deviant either rapidly (every 0. 8 minutes) or slowly (every 2. 4 minutes), MMN amplitude was shown to be modulated by more than {{the size of the}} deviation and confidence or stability in the model. This thesis through a series of studies shows instead that MMN amplitude is modulated by a strong first-impression bias that outweighs transition statistics, as a larger MMN is evident to sounds first encountered as a deviant in the slow compared to rapidly changing sequences, but no difference is evident for the sound first encountered as a standard. The thesis explored this bias over two parts, Part 1 explores stimulus salience (defined by experimentally-equated behavioural salience and natural salience) and Part 2 explored the mechanisms by which the bias manifests. Part 1 is comprised of two studies. Study 1 presented two short/long tones at equal probability within a go-stimulus detection task prior to the multi-timescale sequence. Participants were divided into groups and instructed to respond to the shorter tone with a <b>button</b> <b>push</b> or the longer tone with a <b>button</b> <b>push.</b> The MMN results within the multi-timescale sequence showed the bias was initially abolished but eventually developed for the go-stimulus assigned. This demonstrates the long-term impact of prior learning on deviance detection, and that even when prior importance/equivalence is learned, the bias ultimately returns. Study 2 presented participants with two phonemic /a/ and /i/ sounds within the multi-timescale sequence. The results indicated that the first-impression responsiveness bias reflected in MMN amplitude to pure tones was replicated in phonemic sound presentations. Taken together, the results of Part 1 suggest that a sounds exposure, order or role (at first-impression) biases future responsiveness, outweighing local sound statistics and modulating MMN amplitude well beyond the limits of sensory memory. Part 2 is comprised of three chapters and explored the mechanisms of the bias and how it relates to second-order learning. Study 3 explored how MMN amplitude changes as a function of role stability within sequences of the multi-timescale structure by re-analysing the data of Todd et al., (2013). Comparison between MMN amplitude size at transition points in the sequence (first-half; immediately after change in role) versus later in a block (second-half; when roles are established) revealed a processing bias at transition points only, with this difference dissipating {{over the course of the}} entire block (no interaction or effect in second-half data). Further, the results indicated that the difference in tone processing is reactivated each time a new block starts. The results expose a bias consistent with high confidence in predictions when subsequent sequence blocks match initial statistics but low confidence for blocks containing those contrary to that first encountered. Study 4 and Study 5 showed similar first-half data trends in re-analyses of Study 1 and Study 2 respectively. Subsequently, Study 6 and Study 7 was designed to test if a processing bias could be attributed to assumptions about the tone roles (predictable versus unpredictable) in the first encountered context, weighted by the stability of that context. Study 6 showed that this bias is initially prevented if there is no 1 : 1 mapping between sound attributes and roles, but it returns once the auditory system determines which properties provide the highest predictive value. Study 7 showed that confidence in this bias drops if assumptions about the temporal stability of the pattern are violated. Both Study 6 and Study 7 provide evidence that the auditory system extrapolates patterns on multiple timescales to adjust response to prediction-errors, but profoundly distorts transition-statistics due to assumptions formed on the basis of first-impressions...|$|E

40|$|Stronger harm minimisation {{measures}} are needed, mainly aimed at 2 ̆ 7 pokies 2 ̆ 7, including lowering {{the intensity of}} play and the capacity for gamblers to set spending limits on themselves, according to this report. Gamblers in Australia spend (lose) over 18 billion per year including nearly 12 billion on poker machines.

The Commission also found problem gamblers 2 ̆ 7 share of total spending on pokies ranged around 40 per cent. The Commission has drawn from experiences in Australia and overseas to craft proposals that help reduce the social costs of gambling without unduly impacting on its recreational value. Key proposals are directed at: •    reducing the amounts that people can lose (currently up to 1200 per hour) through lower limits on bets per <b>button</b> <b>push</b> and on how much money can be fed into machines •    giving people the choice to set limits on how much time and money they spend on gambling, through a universal 2 ̆ 7 pre commitment 2 ̆ 7 system harnessed to improved technologies.

40|$|Many {{studies of}} the {{reaction}} time (RT) expressed this index as the interval between the time of signal detection {{and the beginning of}} motor response. Reaction time is widely used in various fields of science and practice: RT assessment is an important component of health science, developmental physiology, sports medicine and can increase the thoroughness of health and clinical examinations (Bernstein, 1967; Collins et al., 2003; Henneberg et al., 2001; Kolb & Whishaw, 1995; Lovell et al., 2001; Makdissi et al., 2001; Schendel & Robertson, 2002; Warden et al., 2001). It is clear that impaired RT has functional relevance given that a rapid RT is necessary for injury avoidance and good professional skill performances. Reaction time assessment is an important component in sports medicine, especially for identification of brain concussion (Broglio & Guskiewicz, 2009; Collie et al., 2006; Collins et al., 2003). There are 2 main tests that are useful to measure reaction time. The <b>button</b> <b>push</b> reaction time test measures how quickly a participant may click (push) a button. and the fingertip visuomotor test is a procedure for conducting a reaction time test using a ruler. Advantages of computerized measurement of RT are: 1) that stimulus presentation duration is carefully controlled, 2) the period between stimuli may be easily randomized, and 3) that the time of response is easily measured (Eckner et al., 2010). Despite the advantages of computerized neuropsychological testing, it has a limited role in practice especially on the playing field (Eckner et al., 2010). Reaction time assessment tools on a computer require specialized software and specific research skills that may limit its usage. The cost of computerized testing, at $ 669 to $ 677 per person, makes them unaffordable for many low profile athletes (Grindel, 2006). It is obvious that the fingertip visuomotor field reaction time test is a very important method that is broadly used in athletic training clinics (Eckner et al., 2009; Eckner et al., 2010; Eckner & et al., 2011 a,b,c). Despite of broad usage of fingertip visuomotor tests measuring RT there is little available information comparing the computerized and fingertip visuomotor methods of determining RT. In other words, the existing literature doesn’t answer the question; is the simple reaction time, tested using the simplified fingertip visuomotor method compatible with the results from the computerized methods in the same individual. We also did not find a clear answer to the question how compatible is fingertip visuomotor method selectively for the dominant and nondominant hands. The purpose of our {{study was to determine the}} individual compatibility of the simplified fingertip visuomotor method of measuring simple RT selectively for the dominant and nondominant hands of untrained healthy young people of high school age...|$|E
