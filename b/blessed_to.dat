5|$|Mandodari is queen consort of Ravana, the Rakshasa(demon) king of Lanka. The Hindu epics {{describe}} her as beautiful, pious and righteous. Mandodari is daughter of Mayasura, the King of Asuras(demons) and apsara(celestial nymph) Hema. Some tales narrate how an apsara called Madhura was cursed {{to become a}} frog and imprisoned in a well for 12 years, after which regains her beauty or a frog, <b>blessed</b> <b>to</b> a beautiful maiden; in both cases, she is adopted by Mayasura as his daughter Mandodari. Ravana comes {{to the house of}} Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari and then marries her. Mandodari bears him three sons: Meghanada(Indrajit), Atikaya and Akshayakumara. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also mother of Rama's wife Sita, who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the Ramayana. Different versions of Ramayana record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they humiliate her, while disturbing a sacrifice by Ravana, while others narrate how they destroy her chastity, which protects Ravana's life. Hanuman tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana. After Ravana's death, Vibhishana—Ravana's younger brother who joins forces with Rama and is responsible for Ravana's death—marries Mandodari on the advice of Rama. In some versions, Mandodari curses Sita that Rama would abandon her.|$|E
