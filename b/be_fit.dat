5|$|In a January 2011 {{interview}} with GQ he announced {{he is working}} on releasing his own range of vitamins and supplements. He wrote an autobiographical fitness book, Train Like an Action Hero: <b>Be</b> <b>Fit</b> Forever, published in Sweden (by Bonnier Fakta) on 9 August 2011, offering tips he learned over the years to work out in various situations (with a busy schedule and a lot of traveling). On 9 September 2014, Lundgren published Dolph Lundgren: Train Like an Action Hero: <b>Be</b> <b>Fit</b> Forever, a book which contains a detailed account of his earlier life and troubles. He cites a better quality of life as having inspired him to maintain his physical fitness.|$|E
5|$|At the Rome Masters, Murray retired {{due to a}} hip injury {{during his}} second round match against Marcel Granollers on his 26th birthday. Murray had just battled back to tie the match at one set all after winning the second set on a tiebreak. This left Murray with only eleven days to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> {{for the start of}} the French Open.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Bolt set {{the indoor}} 100m {{world record in}} Warsaw {{with a time of}} 9.98 seconds. This was his sole {{individual}} outing of the 2014 season. Soon afterwards he ended his season early in order to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> for the 2015 season. In Bolt's absence, Justin Gatlin had dominated the sprints, holding the year's fastest times, including seven of the top ten 100m runs that season.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} A4s, Bittern <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with side {{valances}} {{and a single}} chimney from new. The valances were removed during an overhaul 22 September - 14 November 1941. Her double chimney with a Kylchap double blastpipe <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> on 6 September 1957. AWS (Automatic Warning System) <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> 13 December 1958. Bittern <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a full width bogie dust shield in 1950. The speed indicator <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> 6 September 1960.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type <b>were</b> {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> with pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a Fischer bow collector, 378 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with an ASEA pantograph, 379 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 <b>were</b> all <b>fitted</b> {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 {{had their}} pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams <b>were</b> <b>fitted</b> with pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R

5|$|The hull of {{the ship}} was steel, and the {{woodwork}} teak, {{so that she would}} <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> for tropical environments. She was outfitted with six quick firing guns, six three pounder guns, and four five barreled guns. The ship's internal spaces had electric lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{success of}} the Ottoman Army's operations during the Battle of Katia demonstrated the attacking strength and determination of Kress von Kressenstein's force in 1916, and their efficient implementation of appropriate tactics, particularly timing and false intelligence. This success was underpinned by the Ottoman infantry's ability to make the gruelling march across the Sinai Peninsula and <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> enough to then launch attacks with force and determination.|$|E

5|$|Everton {{spent the}} week before the match in the spa town of Buxton, and {{travelled}} to Dorking {{on the eve of the}} match. Manchester City spent the week in Bushey. Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was troubled by a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to Seydlitz had proved difficult to repair—Scheer was unwilling {{to embark on a}} major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On May 22, the Wilhelmshaven dockyard reported the ship to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> for duty, but tests carried out that night showed that the broadside torpedo flat that had been damaged by the mine was still not watertight, and there were still leaks in the fore and aft transverse bulkheads. Further repairs were necessary, and so the operation was postponed another week, by which time the Wilhelmshaven dockyard assured Scheer that the ship would be ready. At noon on 28 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Bent scored {{his first}} {{international}} goal in England's 3–1 away win over Switzerland after appearing {{as a substitute}} for Jermain Defoe in a Euro 2012 qualifier on 7 September 2010. Then-England manager Fabio Capello stated he had been impressed with the improvement in Bent's all-round game since his World Cup omission and selected him in the starting 11 for England's friendly with Denmark, where he scored a tap-in from a Theo Walcott cross. Bent retained his place for England's Euro 2012 qualifier with Wales to make his first competitive international start on 26 March 2011. In scoring England's second goal, he took his tally to three goals in his last three matches. Bent recovered from injury in time but was left out of the final 23-man squad for Euro 2012 as then-England manager Roy Hodgson felt Bent would not <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> enough to appear at the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E
5|$|The initial squad was {{selected}} for the British team on 14 July; however, the final team was not confirmed until {{the outcome of a}} courtcase involving Dwain Chambers. Under the rules of the BOA, Chambers had been banned from future Games after testing positive for the steroid THG in 2003. His appeal to overturn that ban, {{on the grounds that it}} was an unfair restraint of trade, failed and he was omitted from the squad. The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly Sotherton, as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey, Paula Radcliffe, Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers. Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> for the Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh. She eventually proved fit enough to start the race but struggled to finish in 23rd position.|$|E

5|$|When the {{campaign}} {{came to an}} end, the battalion returned to Salisbury. Guest then travelled to England and sought a commission, joining the South Lancashire Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant in September 1916. He was later promoted to Captain. He went with his battalion to France where they were posted to the 59th Division, then in the line. The sector they occupied was not very active, but shelling and sniping from both sides were carried out fairly regularly. It {{was not long before}} Guest was wounded, and then he fell victim to an irritating and persistent skin complaint which was common in the trenches and did not respond to treatment. He was evacuated to England and after a brief period in hospital was sent to the Imperial Hydro at St Annes, where he was told that he would not <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> to return to his unit for six months.|$|E
5|$|As the 1975–76 league champions, {{the club}} entered the 1976–77 European Cup. They {{defeated}} Crusaders of Northern Ireland and Trabzonspor of Turkey {{to reach the}} quarter-finals, where they faced the runners-up from the previous season, Saint-Étienne. The French team won the first leg 1–0. The second leg at Anfield began well for Liverpool when Keegan scored {{in the first two}} minutes. Saint-Étienne equalised to make the score 2–1 on aggregate in their favour. Kennedy scored for Liverpool, but the away goals rule meant they still needed another goal to win the tie. With six minutes remaining, David Fairclough was brought on to replace John Toshack; he immediately scored in front of the Kop, ensuring a 3–2 aggregate victory for Liverpool. In the semi-finals, they defeated FC Zürich of Switzerland 6–1 on aggregate to reach the final, where they met their opponents from the 1973 UEFA Cup Final, Borussia Mönchengladbach. The final was held in Rome, four days after the club had lost the 1977 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Before the match, Paisley announced that striker Toshack would <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> to start. However, he was not named in the matchday squad. This change upset the Germans' game plan and allowed Keegan to torment his marker, Berti Vogts. Liverpool won 3–1 to become European champions for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} AH-64D Block III, in 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to {{represent}} its increased capabilities. The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAVs), full IFR capability, and improved landing gear. New composite rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity. Deliveries began in November 2011. Full-rate production was approved on 24 October 2012, with 634 AH-64Ds to be upgraded to AH-64E standard and production of 56 new-build AH-64Es to start in 2019/20. Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self-diagnostic abilities. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. The E model is to <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> for maritime operations. The Army has {{expressed a desire to}} add extended-range fuel tanks to the AH-64E to further increase range and endurance. AH-64Es are to have the L-3 Communications MUM-TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts, communicating on C, D, L, and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs. Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data-links.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, he had made the wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would <b>be</b> <b>fit</b> enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E
