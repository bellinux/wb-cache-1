An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E

[...] Later, in 1860, in his writings about the Sinaiticus discovery, Tischendorf wrote a narrative about the monastery and the manuscript that spanned from 1844 to 1859. He wrote that in 1844, during his first visit to the Saint Catherine's Monastery, he saw some leaves of parchment in a waste-basket. They were [...] "rubbish which was to <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>burning</b> it in the ovens of the monastery", although this is firmly denied by the Monastery.

He retrieved from the basket 129 leaves in Greek which he identified as coming from a manuscript of the Septuagint. He asked if he might keep them, but at this point the attitude of the monks changed. They realized how valuable these old leaves were, and Tischendorf was permitted to take only one-third of the whole, i.e. 43 leaves. These leaves contained portions of 1 Chronicles, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, and Esther. After his return they were deposited in the Leipzig University Library, where they remain. In 1846 Tischendorf published their contents, naming them the 'Codex Friderico-Augustanus' (in honor of Frederick Augustus and keeping secret the source of the leaves). Other portions of the same codex remained in the monastery, containing all of Isaiah and 1 and 4 Maccabees.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmerican foulbrood (AFB) is {{a severe}} {{bacterial}} disease that affects larvae of honey bees (Apis mellifera). The causative agent of AFB is the spore-forming bacteria Paenibacillus larvae.

Nowadays, antibiotics are legally banned in several countries, and the affected colonies have to <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>burning</b> the hives. Therefore, the development of alternative methods for the control and prevention of AFB is necessary. In this context, different natural strategies based on the application of essential oils, plant extracts, propolis, royal jelly, nonconventional natural molecules, bacteria, and bacteriocines, have been studied in vitro and in vivo for the prevention and control of P. larvae. The experimental data achieved from these studies are reviewed and discussed in the present review, which intend to be a starting point for future research in the field...|$|E

40|$|At {{the present}} {{a big part}} of polymer waste <b>is</b> <b>destroyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>burning</b> or stored on a {{disposal}} site. Because of the formation of humantoxic compounds oxidative processes of partial refuse disposal are controversial. Alternatively polymer products may be converted to valuable oil products by hydrogenation cracking. The catalytic hydrogenation cracking of used polymers in the presence of methanol as reacting solvent is examined. Hydrogen is supplied in situ by partial decomposition of methanol in the reaction zone. In the presence of methanol polyethene, polypropene, polystyrene, polyurethane, polycarbonate and polyethylene terephthalate are converted to oils by catalytic hydrogenation. Hydrogenation was run as a laboratory-scale test in an autoclave. The use of methanol for hydrogen supply in the reaction zone is a competitive method for the realization of hydrogenation processes, particularly if by the choice of optimal reaction parameters the reaction of the reaction products (carbon monoxide and water) to hydrogen and carbon dioxoide is accelerated.

50|$|Similar paths {{appear to}} have been {{followed}} by Polynesian settlers in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, who within 500 years of their arrival around 1100 AD turned substantial areas from forest into scrub and fern and in the process caused the elimination of numerous species of birds and animals (Kirch and Hunt 1997). In the restricted environments of the Pacific islands, including Fiji and Hawaii, early extensive erosion and change of vegetation is presumed to have been caused by shifting cultivation on slopes. Soils washed from slopes were deposited in valley bottoms as a rich, swampy alluvium. These new environments were then exploited to develop intensive, irrigated fields. The change from shifting cultivation to intensive irrigated fields occurred in association with a rapid growth in population and the development of elaborate and highly stratified chiefdoms (Kirch 1984). In the larger, temperate latitude, islands of New Zealand the presumed course of events took a different path. There the stimulus for population growth was the hunting of large birds to extinction, during which time forests in drier areas <b>were</b> <b>destroyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>burning,</b> followed the development of intensive agriculture in favorable environments, based mainly on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and a reliance on the gathering of two main wild plant species in less favorable environments. These changes, as in the smaller islands, were accompanied by population growth, the competition for the occupation of the best environments, complexity in social organization, and endemic warfare (Anderson 1997).|$|R
40|$|Degradation of soil as a {{consequence}} of land use poses a threat to sustainable agriculture in South Africa, resulting in the need for a soil protection strategy and policy. Development of such a strategy and policy require cognisance of the extent and impact of soil degradation processes. One of the identified processes is the decline of soil organic matter, which also plays a central role in soil health or quality. The spatial variability of organic matter and the impact of grazing and burning under rangeland stock production are addressed in this first part of the review. Data from uncoordinated studies showed that South African soils have low organic matter levels. About 58 % of soils contain less than 0. 5 % organic carbon and only 4 % contain more than 2 % organic carbon. Furthermore, there are large differences in organic matter content within and between soil forms, depending on climatic conditions, vegetative cover, topographical position and soil texture. A countrywide baseline study to quantify organic matter contents within and between soil forms is suggested for future reference. Degradation of rangeland because of overgrazing has resulted in significant losses of soil organic matter, mainly as a result of lower biomass production. The use of fire in rangeland management decreases soil organic matter because litter <b>is</b> <b>destroyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>burning.</b> Maintaining or increasing organic matter levels in degraded rangeland soils by preventing overgrazing and restricting burning could contribute to the restoration of degraded rangelands. This restoration is of the utmost importance because stock farming uses the majority of land in South Africa...|$|R
