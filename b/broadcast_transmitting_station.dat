25|$|Westcountry Television, another {{independent}} company, replaced Television South West at 00:00 GMT on 1 January 1993. The first programme {{aired on}} the channel was a video welcoming viewers to Westcountry and promising {{higher levels of}} regional commitment. Later, Westcountry was purchased by Carlton Television, {{and it is now}} simply part of the ITV Network. However, since that original commitment to regional programming in 1993 (and approximately 16 hours of regional programmes per week), in 2007 this had been reduced to less than seven hours per week. There is no longer any mention of Westcountry on the ITV network in Cornwall, except for a vague verbal mention before a local programme is shown. Despite this, Westcountry Television has remained committed to Cornwall since launch, and have two small news studios in the county at Truro and Penzance. There is also a five-minute opt-out, <b>broadcast</b> from Redruth <b>transmitting</b> <b>station</b> of news stories specific {{to the west of the}} ITV Westcountry region (there are three others, based in Barnstaple, Plymouth and Exeter.) It does mean though that those viewers in the east of the county receive news aimed at Plymouth City and the South Hams areas, as the Caradon Hill <b>transmitting</b> <b>station</b> covers Plymouth and Mid and South Devon as well as east Cornwall.|$|R
5000|$|Individual {{broadcast}} {{television stations}} in the U.S. transmit on either VHF channels 2 through 13 or UHF channels 14 through 51. During the era of analog television, <b>broadcast</b> <b>stations</b> <b>transmitted</b> on a single universal channel; however due to the technical complexities of the present digital television standard, most <b>stations</b> now <b>transmit</b> physically on an RF channel (or [...] "minor channel") that is mapped to a virtual channel (or [...] "major channel"), which - with some exceptions - typically differs from their physical allocation and corresponds to the station's former analog channel. The UHF band originally spanned from channels 14 to 83, though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has twice rescinded the high-end portions of the band from television broadcasting use for emergency and other telecommunications purposes in 1983 (when channels 70 to 83 were removed) and 2009 (when channels 52 to 69 were removed by mandate {{at the completion of}} the transition from analog to digital television).|$|R

50|$|In the mid-to-late 1970s, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) {{implemented}} {{a rule that}} a cable system must carry a broadcast television station {{at no cost to}} the broadcaster so long as the transmitter emitted an equivalent isotropically radiated power of at least 5 watts. This CRTC rule may have changed over the years, but in principle, a <b>broadcast</b> television <b>station</b> <b>transmitting</b> at 1 kW EIRP must be carried. The status of terrestrial digital only channels with respect to the must-carry requirement is untested as, unlike the U.S., some television stations in Canada did not operate digital signals until the August 2011 and the digital broadcasters that were active prior to then were merely high definition simulcasts of those stations' existing analog signals in major centres such as Toronto and Vancouver with no additional digital subchannels offered due to broadcasters opting not to carry any due to CRTC rules that require subchannels to be licensed separately.|$|R
