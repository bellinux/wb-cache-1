40|$|Artisanal {{fisheries}} in Uruguay involve {{directly or indirectly}} more than 5000 people and constitute {{the main source of}} income in several coastal communities. However, and despite its economic and environmental importance, this activity is poorly documented. As such, this scarcity of information constrains the understanding and effective management of artisanal fisheries. This study aims to characterize different strategies of marine artisanal fisheries on the Uruguayan Atlantic coast and describe the spatial distribution of fishing effort. Based on a Principal Components Analysis we identified four fishing strategies targeting different species (mainly whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furniert, narrownose smooth-hound shark Mustelus spp., angel shark Squatina spp. and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>codling</b> Urophycis brasiliensis), exhibiting different seasonal patterns and fishing gear usage. Finally, the above outlined strategies showed differences in spatial utilization of the fishing area. Our results provide a spatially explicit framework for the management of Uruguayan marine artisanal fisheries...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of deep-water fisheries off Brazil is reviewed from biological, eco-nomic, and political perspectives. This {{process has been}} centered in the southeastem and southern sectors of the Brazilian coast (19 °- 34 °S) and was motivated by the overfishing of the main coastal resources and a government-induced vessel-chartering program. Shelf break (100 - 250 m) operations by national hook-and-line and trawl vessels intensified in the 1990 s. Around 2000 - 2001, however, foreign-chartered longliners, gillnetters, potters, and trawlers started to operate in Brazilian waters, leading the occupation of the upper slope (250 - 500 m), mostly targeting monkfish (Lophyus gastrophysus), the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>codling</b> (Urophycis mystacea), the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), the Argentine short-fin squid (Illex argentinus), the red crab (Chaceon notialis), and the royal crab (Chaceon ramosae). Between 2004 and 2007, chartered trawlers established a valuable fishery on deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae), heavily exploiting the lower slope (500 - 1000 m). Total catches of deep-water resources varied annually from 5, 756 ton in 2000 {{to a maximum of}} 19, 923 ton in 2002, decreasing to nearly 11, 000 ton in 2006. Despite intensive data collection, the availability of timely stock assessments, and a formal participatory process for the discussion of management plans, deep-water stocks are already considered to be overexploited due to limitations of governance. ...|$|E
