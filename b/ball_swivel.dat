50|$|Monopods {{are often}} {{equipped}} with a <b>ball</b> <b>swivel,</b> allowing some freedom to pan and tilt the camera while the monopod remains relatively stationary.|$|E
5000|$|Walking sticks or [...] "trekking poles" [...] {{exist that}} have a 1/4"-20 {{threaded}} stud {{on the top of}} the handle, usually covered by a cap when not in use, allowing them to double as a camera monopod. The user would usually need to carry a <b>ball</b> <b>swivel</b> adapter separately and mount it as needed.|$|E
50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A <b>ball</b> <b>swivel</b> with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|E

40|$|The use, design, and {{fabrication}} {{feasibility of}} scanning the laser beam by swiveling the outside mirror with a <b>ball</b> joint <b>swivel</b> system is examined {{along with the}} applicability of graphite reinforced epoxy material {{for the construction of}} reflective optics. It is indicated that (1) the cost of graphite-epoxy will be more than that of many other materials due to the amount of special tooling required; (2) the weight advantage of graphite-epoxy over beryllium is minimal; the <b>ball</b> joint <b>swivel</b> system is accurate enough to perform the scanning function; and that the ball joint will result in a simpler and more cost effective scanning mechanism...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} tow a trailer behind a motorcycle, {{one of the}} {{following}} coupling combinations or mechanisms is needed: a <b>ball</b> and socket, <b>swivel</b> adapter, or pivot ball hitch and coupler.|$|R
50|$|The {{figure is}} an anthropomorphized bear with an {{extremely}} simplified form and a pot belly. Each plastic figure features nine parts (widely {{referred to as}} tools in the toy industry): head, torso, hips, arms, hands, and legs; These nine tools allow eight points of articulation: swivel head, <b>swivel</b> waist, <b>ball</b> joint arms, <b>swivel</b> wrists, and <b>ball</b> joint legs.|$|R
40|$|Double-swivel toggle {{mechanism}} releases large, heavy objects reliably. Double-swiveling {{action of}} mechanism ensures it clears restraining pins upon release. Pins retain toggle and its load. If pin fails to withdraw at designated time for releasing payload, toggle swivels about its upper <b>ball,</b> and ring <b>swivels</b> about lower <b>ball</b> so ring flange clears failed pin. Double-swivel action ensures disengagement even it two pins fail to withdraw...|$|R
5000|$|As {{explained}} {{above in}} [...] "Ball and socket", {{the movement in}} the coupler and ball combination is limited to mostly horizontal movement and tilting slightly. Therefore, this type of coupling is best suited for three-wheeled motorcycles and four-wheeled vehicles. In contrast, as pivot <b>ball</b> hitches and <b>swivel</b> adapters do allow the appreciable lean necessary to keep all the trailer wheels on the ground while turning, these devices are the better option for towing trailers behind a two-wheeled motorcycle.|$|R
25|$|After the 210 convicts {{were all}} disembarked a fire was {{discovered}} {{on the ship}} at 4.30 pm on 20 May 1814. It was later thought that the fire was caused by candle snuff being dropped on oakum when an officer and boy had entered the hold. It soon {{became apparent that the}} fire could not be fought and so Three Bees was cut loose from her moorings and the other ships in the cove maneuvered to avoid the ship. At 5.30 pm the first gun exploded on board and a <b>swivel</b> <b>ball</b> smashed into the parlour of the house of Captain Piper, hitting only a writing table. The ship drifted onto Bennelong Point and shortly after her magazine exploded. Three Bees was a total loss.|$|R
