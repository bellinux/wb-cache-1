For this purpose modern process industries are increasingly relying on intelligent and adaptive control strategies. On one hand intelligent control strategies try to imitate human way of thinking and decision making using artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques such as fuzzy logic whereas {{on the other hand}} adaptive mechanism ensures adjusting of the controller parameters. A self-organized fuzzy logic controller (SOFLC) is intelligent in nature and adapts its performance to meet the figure of merit.

5000|$|A rare but {{interesting}} mechanical escapement is John Harrison's grasshopper escapement {{invented in}} 1722. In this escapement, the pendulum {{is driven by}} two hinged arms (pallets). As the pendulum swings, {{the end of one}} arm catches on the escape wheel and drives it slightly backwards; this releases the other arm which moves out of the way to allow the escape wheel to pass. When the pendulum swings back again, the other arm catches the wheel, pushes it back and releases the first arm and so on. The grasshopper escapement has been used in very few clocks since Harrison's time. Grasshopper escapements made by Harrison in the 18th century are still operating. Most escapements wear far more quickly, and waste far more energy. The lack of friction is the basis of its accuracy. It's used in the Burgess Clock B that Guinness World Records cited in 2015 as the most accurate open-air mechanical clock, deviating [...] of a second during 100 days.

40|$|Satellite {{altimetry}} is {{the only}} method to monitor global changes in sea-ice thickness and volume over decades. Such missions (e. g., ERS, Envisat, ICESat, CryoSat- 2) {{are based on the}} conversion of freeboard into thickness by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Freeboard, the height of the ice above the water level, is therefore a crucial parameter. Freeboard is a relative quantity, computed by subtracting the instantaneous sea surface height from the sea-ice surface elevations. Hence, the impact of geophysical range corrections depends on the performance of the interpolation between subsequent leads to retrieve the sea surface height, and the magnitude of the correction. In this study, we investigate this impact by considering CryoSat- 2 sea-ice freeboard retrievals in autumn and spring. Our findings show that major parts of the Arctic are not noticeably affected by the corrections. However, we find areas with very low lead density like the multiyear ice north of Canada, and landfast ice zones, where the impact can be substantial. In March 2015, 7. 17 % and 2. 69 % of all valid CryoSat- 2 freeboard grid cells are affected by the ocean tides and the inverse <b>barometric</b> <b>correction</b> by more than 1 cm.

40|$|The general Popularity of {{magnitude}} as a convenient and robust measure of earthquake size makes it tempting {{to examine whether}} this parameter can be reliably estimated in near real time. In this study we dernonstrate that this is indeed the case conditioned {{on the design of}} the signal detector being of STA/LTA type where STA is a short term signal power or rms estimate. Using real data we dernonstrate the Random Vibration Theory relation that Amax (21 nN) 1 / 2 Arms, is valid for non stationary seismic signals. Using Rayleigh's theorem we also estabmlaixshed a relation brmetween Arms and the flat portion of the source spectra. These Amax and Arms estimation procedures are used for determining conventional magnitudes and moment magnitudes for 29 events as recorded by the Norwegian Seismograph Network (NSN). We used here a procedure outlined by Sereno et al. (1988) and also their geometrical spreading and attenuation parameters derived from analysis of NORSAR recordings. Our magnitude and moment magnitude estimates for 5 different frequency bands are in good agreement with the ML estimates derived from the conventional magnitude formulas in combination with empirical <b>correction</b> <b>tables.</b> Surprisingly, the Amax and Arms magnitudes produced consistent negative biased by ca. 0. 4 units estimates even in the extreme 4 8 Hz band.
