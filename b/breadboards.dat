50|$|Alternative {{methods to}} create prototypes are {{point-to-point}} construction (reminiscent {{of the original}} wooden <b>breadboards),</b> wire wrap, wiring pencil, and boards like the stripboard. Complicated systems, such as modern computers comprising millions of transistors, diodes, and resistors, do not lend themselves to prototyping using <b>breadboards,</b> as their complex designs {{can be difficult to}} lay out and debug on a breadboard.|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} provide separate bus and terminal strips. Others just provide <b>breadboard</b> blocks {{which contain}} both in one block. Often <b>breadboard</b> strips or blocks of one brand can be clipped {{together to make}} a larger <b>breadboard.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{history of}} the General Dynamics Space Systems Division 20 kHz <b>Breadboard</b> is {{presented}} including its current configuration {{and its role in}} the Space Station Freedom (SSF) program. Highlights and results are presented on a series of tests conducted on the 20 kHz <b>Breadboard.</b> The first test presented is the 20 kHz <b>Breadboard</b> Acceptance test.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to an optical table is an optical breadboard. Some optical systems use <b>breadboards</b> made of solid aluminum for later integration {{with a larger}} system with some form of vibration control. Most optical <b>breadboards</b> are constructed fromsteel, aluminum, or carbon fiber sheets with honeycomb structure and can be placed on an ordinary table or workbench. <b>Breadboards</b> are {{not as good as}} optical tables, but weigh less and are adequate for smaller optical systems that do not require extremely high levels of mechanical stability. The low weight enables one to support these tables on soft air springs which reduce vibrations coming from the floor, although this increases vibrations due to acoustic noise.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Breadboards</b> {{have evolved}} over time, {{with the term}} now being used {{for all kinds of}} {{prototype}} electronic devices. For example, US Patent 3,145,483, was filed in 1961 and describes a wooden plate breadboard with mounted springs and other facilities. US Patent 3,496,419, was filed in 1967 and refers to a particular printed circuit board layout as a Printed Circuit Breadboard. Both examples refer to and describe other types of <b>breadboards</b> as prior art.|$|E
40|$|A <b>breadboard</b> of {{the command}} {{detector}} signal-to-noise-ratio estimator and lock status monitor was built on a wire-wrap card. The <b>breadboard</b> was integrated with the standard command detector, and its performance was measured. The design, design constraints, and construction of the <b>breadboard</b> are described. The performance is shown {{to agree with the}} theoretical model...|$|R
50|$|The <b>breadboard</b> most {{commonly}} used today is usually made of white plastic and is a pluggable (solderless) <b>breadboard.</b> It was designed by Ronald J. Portugal in 1971.|$|R
40|$|NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center {{proposes to}} {{implement}} fault injection into an {{electrical power system}} <b>breadboard</b> to study the reactions of the various control elements of this <b>breadboard.</b> Among the elements to be studied are the remote power controllers, the algorithms in the control computers, and the artificially intelligent control programs resident in this <b>breadboard.</b> To this end, a study of electrical power is being performed to yield {{a list of the}} most common power system faults. The results of this study are being applied to a multichannel high-voltage DC spacecraft power system called the Large Autonomous Spacecraft Electrical Power System <b>Breadboard.</b> Some of the reactions of the <b>breadboard</b> to some of the faults which have been encountered are presented along with the results of this study...|$|R
50|$|<b>Breadboards,</b> perfboards, and stripboards {{are common}} for testing new designs. They allow the {{designer}} to make quick {{changes to the}} circuit during development.|$|E
50|$|Unable {{to afford}} {{traditional}} pear wood boards from which woodcuts were commonly made, she purchased <b>breadboards</b> from Woolworths {{on which to}} create her works.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{relatively}} large parasitic {{capacitance compared to}} a properly laid out PCB (approx 2pF between adjacent contact columns), high inductance of some connections and a relatively high and not very reproducible contact resistance, solderless <b>breadboards</b> are limited to operation at relatively low frequencies, usually less than 10 MHz, depending {{on the nature of}} the circuit. The relatively high contact resistance can already be a problem for some DC and very low frequency circuits. Solderless <b>breadboards</b> are further limited by their voltage and current ratings.|$|E
40|$|The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center {{proposes to}} {{implement}} computer-controlled fault injection into an {{electrical power system}} <b>breadboard</b> to study the reactions of the various control elements of this <b>breadboard.</b> Elements under study include the remote power controllers, the algorithms in the control computers, and the artificially intelligent control programs resident in this <b>breadboard.</b> To this end, a study of electrical power system faults is being performed to yield {{a list of the}} most common power system faults.

40|$|A compact optical {{communications}} transceiver <b>breadboard</b> was constructed. In {{order to}} keep the mass of the <b>breadboard</b> as low as possible the design was made very simple. The entire package weighs less than 5 kg. The optical module uses a 40 mW diode laser and a two-axis voice coil actuator for beam steering. The <b>breadboard</b> is capable of locking onto a laser beacon within its field of view and transmitting the diode laser beam back toward the beacon. Design of the breaboard, details of each component in the <b>breadboard,</b> and current experiments with the package are described...|$|R
40|$|The Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) optics module will be {{assembled}} {{at ambient temperature}} but will operate at liquid helium temperature. The challenging task of ensuring that is possible to maintain alignment through cryogenic cooling and cryogenic vibration has been demonstrated in a DIRBE optics module <b>breadboard</b> program. This paper discusses {{the configuration of the}} DIRBE optics module <b>breadboard,</b> ambient temperature optical alignment methods used to assemble the <b>breadboard,</b> and cryogenic testing of the <b>breadboard.</b> The alignment of the optical assembly at ambient temperature, at 77 K, and after a 77 K vibration was within specification...|$|R
50|$|Development & {{break-out}} boards extend {{wiring and}} may add functionality, often building upon ESP32 module boards {{and making them}} easier to use for development purposes (especially with <b>breadboards).</b>|$|E
50|$|Because the {{solderless}} breadboard {{does not}} require soldering, it is reusable. This {{makes it easy to}} use for creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design. For this reason, solderless <b>breadboards</b> are also extremely popular with students and in technological education. Older breadboard types did not have this property. A stripboard (Veroboard) and similar prototyping printed circuit boards, which are used to build semi-permanent soldered prototypes or one-offs, cannot easily be reused. A variety of electronic systems may be prototyped by using <b>breadboards,</b> from small analog and digital circuits to complete central processing units (CPUs).|$|E
5000|$|Maximite clones made by US {{producer}} CircuitGizmos remain {{compatible with}} the original Maximite design and include a very small CGMMSTICK1 [...] {{that can be used}} with solderless <b>breadboards,</b> and a Colour Maximite compatible CGCOLORMAX1.|$|E
40|$|A four bit {{microprocessor}} {{was designed}} using an Apollo workstation and MOSIS two lambda design rules. The layout {{was intended for}} fabrication with a four level, enhancement mode load, NMOS process. Device operation was verified by <b>breadboarding</b> the microprocessor with 74 â€™OO series CMOS logic parts. Testing of the <b>breadboard</b> showed that all functions operated correctly. However, the final <b>breadboard</b> design indicated the need for revision of the original layout...|$|R
50|$|Veroboard {{is similar}} in concept and usage to plug-in <b>breadboard,</b> but is cheaper and more {{permanent}} - connections are soldered and while some limited reuse may be possible, {{more than a few}} cycles of soldering and desoldering are likely to render both the components and the board unusable. In contrast, <b>breadboard</b> connections are held by friction, and the <b>breadboard</b> can be reused many times. However, a <b>breadboard</b> is not very suitable for prototyping that needs to remain in a set configuration for an appreciable period of time nor for physical mock-ups containing a working circuit or for any environment subject to vibration or movement.|$|R
40|$|A data {{acquisition}} software program developed {{to operate in}} conjunction with the automated control system of the 25 kW PM Electric Power System <b>Breadboard</b> Test facility is described.

The <b>breadboard</b> test facility has two positions for operating separate configurations. The main variable in each test setup is the high voltage Ni-Cd battery...|$|R
50|$|Bus strips {{typically}} {{run down}} {{one or both}} sides of a terminal strip or between terminal strips. On large <b>breadboards</b> additional bus strips can often be found on {{the top and bottom of}} terminal strips.|$|E
50|$|The {{honeycomb}} structure reduces bending {{due to the}} breadboard's own weight, {{so it can be}} tilted and forces applied via the soft spring supports accelerate the table as a whole without misalignment. <b>Breadboards</b> can therefore be used in mobile applications, such as on airplanes. Also, one can bolt a breadboard onto an optical table, build up a module of the experiment on it, and then transfer the module as a whole onto another table without the need to realign the components on the breadboard. Similarly, custom-built optical devices are assembled and aligned on <b>breadboards,</b> which are then enclosed in a case and shipped to the customer.|$|E
50|$|Solderless <b>breadboards</b> are {{available}} from several different manufacturers, but most share a similar layout. The layout of a typical solderless breadboard is made up from two types of areas, called strips. Strips consist of interconnected electrical terminals.|$|E

50|$|Wire wrap {{construction}} {{became popular}} around 1960 in circuit board manufacturing, and use has now sharply declined. Surface-mount technology {{has made the}} technique much less useful than in previous decades. Solder-less <b>breadboards</b> and the decreasing cost of professionally made PCBs have nearly eliminated this technology.|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} provide high-end {{versions of}} solderless <b>breadboards.</b> These are typically high-quality breadboard modules {{mounted on a}} flat casing. The casing contains additional equipment for breadboarding, such as a power supply, one or more signal generators, serial interfaces, LED display or LCD modules, and logic probes.|$|E

40|$|For {{makers and}} developers, circuit {{prototyping}} {{is an integral}} part of building electronic projects. Currently, it is common to build circuits based on <b>breadboard</b> schematics that are available on various maker and DIY websites. Some <b>breadboard</b> schematics are used as is without modification, and some are modified and extended to fit specific needs. In such cases, diagrams and schematics merely serve as blueprints and visual instructions, but users still must physically wire the <b>breadboard</b> connections, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. We present CircuitStack, a system that combines the flexibility of <b>breadboarding</b> with the correctness of printed circuits, for enabling rapid and extensible circuit construction. This hybrid system enables circuit reconfigurability, component reusability, and high efficiency at the early stage of prototyping development...|$|R
