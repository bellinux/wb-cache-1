40|$|Abstract Background Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) {{is considered to}} be a major force driving the evolutionary history of prokaryotes. HGT is widespread in prokaryotes, contributing to the genomic repertoire of prokaryotic organisms, and is particularly apparent in Rickettsiales genomes. Gene gains from both distantly and closely related organisms play crucial roles in the evolution of bacterial genomes. In this work, we focus on genes transferred from distantly related species into Rickettsiales species. Results We developed an automated approach for the detection of HGT from other organisms (excluding alphaproteobacteria) into Rickettsiales genomes. Our systematic approach consisted of several specialized features including the application of a parsimony method for inferring phyletic patterns followed by <b>blast</b> <b>filter,</b> automated phylogenetic reconstruction and the application of patterns for HGT detection. We identified 42 instances of HGT in 31 complete Rickettsiales genomes, of which 38 were previously unidentified instances of HGT from Anaplasma, Wolbachia, Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and Rickettsia genomes. Additionally, putative cases with no phylogenetic support were assigned gene ontology terms. Overall, these transfers could be characterized as “rhizome-like”. Conclusions Our analysis provides a comprehensive, systematic approach for the automated detection of HGTs from several complete proteome sequences that can be applied to detect instances of HGT within other genomes of interest. </p...|$|E

In the post genomics era the sheer size of antibody related NGS information is a major bottleneck in the quest of understanding and tackling complex genetic diseases and immunological disorders. Bioinformatics is becoming hugely involved in the processing of this data with the development of new, more accurate and e-cient algorithms. However, one of the major drawbacks of modern bioinformatics is the fact that protein similarity and blast searches are still based on primary amino acid sequence rather than structural data. Primary sequence searches are inadequate, as they fail to provide a realistic fingerprint for the query protein. Antibody function is much more related to its 3 D structure and physicochemical profile rather than its primary amino acid sequence. After all, structure is much more conserved than sequence in nature.

40|$|This article {{emerges from}} a {{long-term}} project investigating the BBC initiative 'Blast' - an on- and offline creative resource for teenagers. Designed to 'inspire and equip' young people to be creative, the research interrogates the assumptions behind such a resource, particularly {{in terms of the}} so-called 'digital native', and tests such assumptions against the populations actually using and engaging with it. It finds that the conception of a 'digital native' - a technologically enthusiastic, if not technologically literate - teenage population, which is operationalized through the workshop structure of BBC <b>Blast,</b> rarely <b>filters</b> down to the teenagers themselves. Teenage delegates to the Blast workshops rarely validate interest based on technological facilities, enthusiasm or competency. Instead, it is peer groups and social alignments which shape declarations and, more importantly, enactments of interest. This suggests that while the concept of the 'digital native' may be pertinent for generational comparisons of technological use, or is a useful concept for the operationalization of creative media workshops, it is simply not recognized by teenagers to whom it refers, nor does it adequately define use. Further, technological competency and enthusiasm sits uneasily with social and cultural peer group norms, where certain (and very specific) technological competency is socially permitted. This means that the concept of the 'digital native' is problematic, if not entirely inadequate. Focusing on the BBC Blast workshops therefore raises some critical questions around teenage motivations to become technologically literate, and the pleasures teenagers articulate in such engagements per se...|$|R

Purified small RNA sequencing was performed by Eurofins/MWG Operon (Germany) on an Illumina Hi-seq 2000 using the TruSeq™ SBS v 5 sequencing kit. The complete raw dataset is available in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus repository [GEO: GSE 48346]. The raw data were trimmed by removing adapter sequences and low quality sequences using CutAdapt (Martin 2011). All the trimmed reads ranging from 18 to 28 nucleotides were clustered and mapped to O. sativa ssp japonica cv Nipponbare genome (MSU release version 7; [URL] using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) (Additional file 4) in order to evaluate library quality. The 18 – 28 nucleotide reads were them annotated through a filtering process using successive hierarchical BLAST (Additional file 4) versus (in order) miRBase v 17.0 (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones 2011), Rfam v 7, a home-made repeat database (successive curated concatenation of RetrOryza, RepBase, TREP and TIGRRepeats), CDS then gene features (i.e. introns and UTRs) from Oryza sativa ssp japonica var Nipponbare MSU v 7.0 annotation, and finally the MSU v 7.0 rice genome for the sequences not similar to miRNAs, non coding RNAs, Repeat-associated sequences and genes. <b>BLAST</b> <b>filtering</b> was done using Oryza genus data form the different databases (i.e. mainly O. sativa). Mapping of the sequences to the O. sativa MSU v 7.0 reference genome was done {{for the last three}} steps of our annotation pipeline. This genome was used as a reference because (i) of its equal divergence to the two species we analyzed (avoiding favoring one species in mapping analyses rather than the other one), and (ii) because of the larger resources in terms of annotation, expression data and genomic information available for this species. The BLAST and post-filter parameters used were probability of 85  %, e-value of 10 − 3, on a size of 85  % of the reads (minimum size of 16). The same BLAST parameters were used throughout the analysis. Mapping from O. glaberrima and O. barthii small RNA sequences was then compared and filtered using a series of homemade Perl scripts (available on demand). Comprehensive analysis of the miRNA-associated small RNAs from African rice species was limited to the families present in O. sativa, and did not include diverse isoforms. For the same reason, potential African rice specific miRNAs were not investigated. The 21 -mers were used in phasing analysis with the ta-si Prediction tool from the UEA sRNA workbench facilities ([URL] Stocks et al. 2012). A post-analysis manual filtering was performed for sequences mapping to more than 10 loci in genome, as well as telomere-associated loci, leading to the deletion of 123 loci from the 1015 initial loci reported in ta-si Prediction tool outputs. Once the loci were identified, we used the EMBOSS software suite v 6.5. 7.0 (Rice et al. 2000) to extract − 500 /+ 500 bases around each locus, and treated them using MEME v 4.8. 1 (Bailey and Elkan 1994). Then, the loci sequences were used as a BLAST database to add other 21 -nt sequences that were not identified originally as phased (in order to by-pass the genome divergence), in two pass: first we select only new sequences with 100  % of identity on 85  % of their length (minimum HSP length of 16), then we change the threshold to 85  % of identity on 85  % of their length (min HSP length of 16). Finally, statistical tests of all the processed data were performed using g-test and a fixed p-value of 10 − 3. Depending on the experiment, the degree of freedom was adjusted but was generally 1. All the calculations were performed using homemade Perl scripts and CPAN statistical modules.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of unique proteins at different taxonomic levels has both scientific and practical value. Strain-, species- and genus-specific proteins can {{provide insight into}} the criteria that define an organism and its relationship with close relatives. Such proteins can also serve as taxon-specific diagnostic targets. Description A pipeline using a combination of computational and manual analyses of BLAST results was developed to identify strain-, species-, and genus-specific proteins and to catalog the closest sequenced relative for each protein in a proteome. Proteins encoded by a given strain are preliminarily considered to be unique if BLAST, using a comprehensive protein database, fails to retrieve (with an e-value better than 0. 001) any protein not encoded by the query strain, species or genus (for strain-, species- and genus-specific proteins respectively), or if BLAST, using the best hit as the query (reverse BLAST), does not retrieve the initial query protein. Results are manually inspected for homology if the initial query is retrieved in the reverse BLAST but is not the best hit. Sequences unlikely to retrieve homologs using the default BLOSUM 62 matrix (usually short sequences) are re-tested using the PAM 30 matrix, thereby increasing the number of retrieved homologs and increasing the stringency of the search for unique proteins. The above protocol was used to examine several food- and water-borne pathogens. We find that the reverse <b>BLAST</b> step <b>filters</b> out about 22 % of proteins with homologs that would otherwise be considered unique at the genus and species levels. Analysis of the annotations of unique proteins reveals that many are remnants of prophage proteins, or may be involved in virulence. The data generated from this study can be accessed and further evaluated from the CUPID (Core and Unique Protein Identification) system web site (updated semi-annually) at [URL]. Conclusion CUPID provides a set of proteins specific to a genus, species or a strain, and identifies the most closely related organism. </p...|$|R

Honeycombs are an array of two dimensional prismatic cells whereas in foams the arrangements of cells are three dimensional polyhedral cells. Unlike solids, the properties of honeycombs are based on three major variables i. e. a) relative density (p* /p s where p* is the density of the cellular material and ps that of the solid of which it is made) b) cell wall material and c) geometry of the cells. Because of the flexibility in tailoring these variables, cellular solids can be engineered to exhibit a unique combination of mechanical and thermal properties for diversified thermostructural applications. Ceramic based honeycombs fabricated out of cordierite (2 MgO. 2 Al 2 O 35 SiO 2), mullite (3 Al 2 O 32 SiO 2), cordierite: mullite (2 MgO. 2 Al 2 O 35 SiO 2) with specific configurations are the leading candidates for many of the applications such as substrates for catalytic converters, molten metal filters, air heaters and heat exchangers etc. Zirconia by the virtue of its high fracture toughness and low thermal conductivity and high refractoriness is an interesting ceramic material and explored for versatile applications. However, no significant efforts have been reported to produce zirconia/alumina and their composite based honeycomb structures and also they have not been explored for their thermo-mechanical and energy absorption based applications. In the present study, looking at the possible potential applications of the honeycombs of Zirconia/alumina and their composites such as solid oxide fuel cells, high temperature <b>filters,</b> <b>blast</b> protection tiles etc., attempts are made to fabricate honeycomb structures. Chapter 1 of the thesis describes the detailed literature survey that has been carried out using advanced search packages regarding the evolution of ceramic honeycomb structures and their properties followed by the advantages of zirconia/alumina and their composites as candidate materials for targeted applications. Literature survey also covers the various processing techniques, characterization procedures with special emphasis on the thermo-mechanical properties. Chapter II describes attempts on developing an optimum scheme of processing of zirconia honeycomb which includes selection of precursor oxides, mixing of formulations, dough making based on viscosity measurements, shaping by extrusion, microwave drying, debinding and sintering to obtain the defect free monolithic structures keeping in view of the scale up possibilities. The chapter also describes a specially developed die fabrication process with innovative machining procedures. (Patent no. 198045). Sintered honeycombs were also characterized for their critical physiochemical properties. In chapter III mechanical characterization of honeycomb samples is reported after subjecting them to compression testing with varying cell channel orientation, compositions and configurations. It is observed that all honeycombs, irrespective of the composition and configuration exhibited anisotropic behavior. In addition, the anisotropy increases with the rib thickness and decreases with increase in the unit cell length. Thermal conductivity measurement studies of the honeycombs are reported in chapter IV. Two types of measurement techniques viz. laser diffraction and monotonic heating technique have confirmed the reduction of thermal conductivity of the honeycomb samples as compared to their solid counterpart. It is observed that the finer channel honeycombs offer low thermal conductivity as compared to the coarser channel when tested across the channel direction. For equivalent relative density, the thermal conductivity value for triangular channel is found to be more as compared to the square channel. Also, the thermal conductivity values were found less when measured across the channel as compared to the values when measured along the channels. The thermal conductivity value for fine channel zirconia-alumina composite honeycombs was found much less than the thermal conductivity of the alumina matrix.
