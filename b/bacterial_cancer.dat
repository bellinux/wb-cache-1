40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>cancer</b> therapy {{relies on}} the fact that several {{bacterial}} species are capable of targeting tumor tissue and that bacteria can be genetically engineered to selectively deliver therapeutic proteins of interest to the targeted tumors. However, the challenge of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cancer</b> therapy is the release of the therapeutic proteins from the bacteria and entry of the proteins into tumor cells. This study employed an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium to selectively deliver the mitochondrial targeting domain of Noxa (MTD) as a potential therapeutic cargo protein, and examined its anti-cancer effect. To release MTD from the bacteria, a novel bacterial lysis system of phage origin was deployed. To facilitate the entry of MTD into the tumor cells, the MTD was fused to DS 4. 3, a novel cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) derived from a voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv 2. 1). The gene encoding DS 4. 3 -MTD and the phage lysis genes were placed under the control of PBAD, a promoter activated by L-arabinose. We demonstrated that DS 4. 3 -MTD chimeric molecules expressed by the Salmonellae were anti-tumoral in cultured tumor cells and in mice with CT 26 colon carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>cancer</b> {{therapy is}} a concept more than 100 years old — yet, all things considered, it is still in early development. While the use of many passive {{therapeutics}} is hindered by the complexity of tumor biology, bacteria offer unique features that can overcome these limitations.

40|$|Bacterial {{infection}} occasionally has {{a marked}} therapeutic effect on malignancies, as noted {{as early as}} the 19 th century. Recently, there have been attempts to develop cancer treatment by using tumor-targeting bacteria. These treatments were developed to deliver therapeutic molecules specifically to tumors. Researchers used anaerobic microorganisms that preferentially grew in necrotic tumor areas. However, the resulting tumor killing was, at best, limited. We have developed a far more effective <b>bacterial</b> <b>cancer</b> therapy by targeting viable tumor tissue by using Salmonella typhimurium leu-arg auxotrophs. Although these bacteria grow in viable as well as necrotic areas of tumors, the nutritional auxo trophy severely restricts growth in normal tissue. In the current study, we measured the antitumor efficacy of the S. typhimurium A 1 -R mutant, which is auxotrophic for leu-arg and has increased antitumor virulence selected by tumor passage. A 1 -R was used to treat metastatic PC- 3 human prostate tumors that had been orthotopically implanted in nude mice. GFP was used to image tumor and metastatic growth. Of the 10 mice with the PC- 3 tumors that were injected weekly with S. typhimurium A 1 -R, 7 were alive and well at the time the last untreated mouse died.

Several strategies have been pursued over the years, whether searching new biomarkers, drugs or treatments. Ultrasound is often used to treat solid tumours. However, this technique is not always successful, as sometimes it just heats the tumour without destroying it. If {{it would be possible to}} link this treatment with the expression/release of a therapeutic agent, the joint effect could be more effective. Some efforts have been made in this direction, although to date the results have not been very encouraging; potential reasons include lack of precise control over administration of the drug. Therefore, the idea is to overcome this barrier through the use of synthetic and systems biology strategies to engineer a model bacterium to trigger release of a therapeutic agent concurrent with ultrasound treatment. The search for new cancer-fighting drugs has traditionally driven research efforts in this field. Curcumin, due to its attractive properties as a novel drug has recently attracted increased attention. Nevertheless, it is well known that it has a poor bioavailability. Cellular uptake is slow, and it is quickly metabolised once inside cells, requiring repetitive oral doses to achieve sufficient concentration inside the cells for therapeutic activity. Hence, the possibility of synthesizing curcumin in situ in a controlled way, as proposed in this project, provides a powerful alternative.

A growing number of studies have shown that some of the cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are toxic to bacteria but not to normal mammalian cells, exhibit a broad spectrum of cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. Such studies have considerably enhanced the significance of AMPs, both synthetic and from natural sources, which have been of importance both for an increased understanding of the immune system and for their potential as clinical antibiotics.

Interest in cancer immunotherapy {{has grown in}} recent years due to its potential for significant and durable therapeutic responses. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as an immunotherapy as a single agent but has even greater appeal when it is used {{in combination with other}} immunostimulatory approaches. However, the dosing of checkpoint blockade and its combinatorial use with other immunotherapies has been limited by systemic immune-related adverse side effects. One way to overcome these adverse effects is to deliver the therapeutic agents specifically to the tumor microenvironment. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) has been studied for cancer therapy due to its genetic manipulability and tumor-targeting propensity, and in this thesis, the potential of S. Typhimurium as a tumor-targeting immunotherapy vector was investigated. Functional antagonistic single chain antibodies (scFvs) against the immune checkpoints CTLA- 4 and PD-L 1 were isolated from an immunized chicken library and engineered for secretion from S. Typhimurium. The inherent anti-tumor properties and tumor-targeting capability of S. Typhimurium were then tested in transplanted primary and metastatic tumor models as well as a genetically engineered autochthonous BALB-neuT breast cancer model. In each of these models, S. Typhimurium demonstrated native anti-tumor efficacy; however the bacteria did not adequately colonize the autochthonous tumors of the BALB-neuT model. Disruption of tumor vasculature by treating BALB-neuT mice with a vasculature disrupting agent (VDA) improved the colonization of autochthonous tumors over 1000 -fold to levels similar to those observed for transplanted tumors. Subsequent comparison of the tumor targeting capability and efficacy of S. Typhimurium engineered to secrete the antagonistic ?PD-L 1 (scFv) versus a control strain showed that secretion of the scFv may further improve the colonization of autochthonous tumors, leading to a greater reduction in tumor burden of treated mice. These findings provide a proof of principle for the expression and delivery of functional immunotherapeutic single chain antibodies using S. Typhimurium, demonstrate S. Typhimurium's native tumoricidal activity independent of tumor-targeting, illustrate the importance of clinically representative tumor models when studying <b>bacterial</b> <b>cancer</b> therapy, and demonstrate the potential of VDA treatment to improve bacterial tumor-targeting.
