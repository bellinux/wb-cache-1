40|$|Beef cattle {{producers}} {{are concerned that}} selecting for carcass traits such as leanness, or for increased feed efficiency, might be deleterious to maternal efficiency and limit the use of genetic improvement technologies such as Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs). We define maternal efficiency by production parameters such as days to calving, birth weight, growth rate, weaning weight, as well as efficiency measures such as total intake and kg weaned per megajoule of metabolisable energy consumed per cow calf unit – kg weaned/MJ ME intake. Selecting for leanness in cattle is of economic benefit due to the relationship to higher yielding carcasses (Nkrumah et al., 2004). Net Feed Intake (NFI) is a trait used to measure feed efficiency in beef cattle, and is calculated as the actual amount of feed eaten by an individual animal less the expected amount of feed consumed based on the animal’s growth rate and body weight (Koch et al., 1963). Low NFI (high efficiency) is economically desirable due to the potential to reduce feed costs and increase stocking rates. Both traits affect the body condition of dams and this is closely linked to maternal traits in cattle (Morris on et al., 1999; Roche et al., 2000; Meikle et al., 2004). This experiment aims to quantify {{the impact on the}} <b>breeder</b> <b>herd</b> of selection for leanness or feed efficiency over three breeding cycles.

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{investigations}} analysed {{the context}} in which Southern Italian milk husbandry have been developing in the last twenty years and took into consideration the demographic trends both in general and in different breeds. The results highlighted that the total number of Italian Friesian (IF) cattle nearly quadrupled while Italian Brown (IB) cattle (traditionally the dominant breed in the studied area) tripled, in the same period. Like most decisions in farm management, the reasons for this tendency to change animals rely essential upon economic grounds. This work aims to further and deepen our understanding of the phenomenon. To the purpose, an experimental questionnaire investigation was performed. The questionnaire was administered {{to the members of the}} Breeder Associations of Bari and Taranto Provinces which encompass most areas of dairy production. The module questionnaire focussed on collecting data about breeding management including information pertaining to: sex, age and education of the <b>breeder,</b> <b>herd</b> size and cow type, stall housing, artificial inseminations, veterinary assistance in health-related problems, the occurrence of mastitis, incidence of lameness, drug use. This work reports the preliminary evaluation of 198 questionnaires filled out by 198 farmers representing 27 % of the dairy cattle breeders in the surveyed area.

40|$|AbstractBrucellosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease characterized by reproductive failure in animals and undulent fever in humans. In cattle, it {{is caused by}} Brucella abortus while in goats by Brucella melitensis, {{the main cause of}} brucellosis in humans. Brucellosis in livestock has been associated with importation of animals from <b>breeder</b> <b>herd</b> of unknown disease status. The prevalence of bovine brucellosis Brucella abortus in 2014 ranged between 1 % and 2 % in Thailand and Indonesia, and 4 %– 5 % in Malaysia and Myanmar. Prevalence of goat brucellosis Brucella melitensis is approximately 1 % in Malaysia and Thailand. ‘Test-and-slaughter’ is the general policy against brucellosis adopted by most ASEAN countries to eradicate the disease. Under this program, the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) is used as the screening test to identify infected farm/herd while the complement fixation test (CFT) is the confirmatory test. The test-and-slaughter eradication strategy that was implemented since 1979 had managed to keep the prevalence rate to less than 5 %, from 3. 3 % in 1979, 0. 23 % in 1988, 1 % in 1998 and 5 % in 2016. The test-and-slaughter program seemed effective in reducing the prevalence of brucellosis but was unable to eradicate the disease due to several factors, which include failure to locate and identify the remaining affected animals and to control their movement, importation of breeder animals from non-brucellosis free countries and lack of participation by the farmers following unreliable test results. To support the eradication policy, research activities since 1980 s have suggested combinations of serological tests to improve diagnosis while surveillance should be focused on hotspots areas. The prevalence can be further reduced by strictly sourcing breeder animals from brucella-free areas or countries...|$|E
40|$|In 2014, the Australian Government {{implemented}} the Emissions Reduction Fund to offer incentives for businesses to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by following approved methods. Beef cattle businesses in northern Australia can participate {{by applying the}} 'reducing GHG emissions by feeding nitrates to beef cattle' methodology and the 'beef cattle herd management' methods. The nitrate (NO 3) method requires that each baseline area must demonstrate a history of urea use. Projects earn Australian carbon credit units (ACCU) for reducing enteric methane emissions by substituting NO 3 for urea at {{the same amount of}} fed nitrogen. NO 3 must be fed {{in the form of a}} lick block because most operations do not have labour or equipment to manage daily supplementation. NO 3 concentrations, after a 2 -week adaptation period, must not exceed 50 g NO 3 /adult animal equivalent per day or 7 g NO 3 /kg dry matter intake per day to reduce the risk of NO 3 toxicity. There is also a 'beef cattle herd management' method, approved in 2015, that covers activities that improve the herd emission intensity (emissions per unit of product sold) through change in the diet or management. The present study was conducted to compare the required ACCU or supplement prices for a 2 % return on capital when feeding a low or high supplement concentration to breeding stock of either (1) urea, (2) three different forms of NO 3 or (3) cottonseed meal (CSM), at N concentrations equivalent to 25 or 50 g urea/animal equivalent, to fasten steer entry to a feedlot (backgrounding), in a typical <b>breeder</b> <b>herd</b> on the coastal speargrass land types in central Queensland. Monte Carlo simulations were run using the software @risk, with probability functions used for (1) urea, NO 3 and CSM prices, (2) GHG mitigation, (3) livestock prices and (4) carbon price. Increasing the weight of steers at a set turnoff month by feeding CSM was found to be the most cost-effective option, with or without including the offset income. The required ACCU prices for a 2 % return on capital were an order of magnitude higher than were indicative carbon prices in 2015 for the three forms of NO 3. The likely costs of participating in ERF projects would reduce the return on capital for all mitigation options. © CSIRO 2016...|$|E

40|$|Inter-annual {{rainfall}} variability is a {{major challenge}} to sustainable and productive grazing management on rangelands. In Australia, rainfall variability is particularly pronounced and failure to manage appropriately leads to major economic loss and environmental degradation. Recommended strategies to manage sustainably include stocking at long-term carrying capacity (LTCC) or varying stock numbers with forage availability. These strategies are conceptually simple but difficult to implement, given the scale and spatial heterogeneity of grazing properties and {{the uncertainty of the}} climate. This paper presents learnings and insights from northern Australia gained from research and modelling on managing for rainfall variability. A method to objectively estimate LTCC in large, heterogeneous paddocks is discussed, and guidelines and tools to tactically adjust stocking rates are presented. The possible use of seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) in management is also considered. Results from a 13 -year grazing trial in Queensland show that constant stocking at LTCC was far more profitable and largely maintained land condition compared with heavy stocking (HSR). Variable stocking (VAR) with or without the use of SCF was marginally more profitable, but income variability was greater and land condition poorer than constant stocking at LTCC. Two commercial scale trials in the Northern Territory with breeder cows highlighted the practical difficulties of variable stocking and provided evidence that heavier pasture utilisation rates depress reproductive performance. Simulation modelling across a range of regions in northern Australia also showed a decline in resource condition and profitability under heavy stocking rates. Modelling further suggested that the relative value of variable v. constant stocking depends on stocking rate and land condition. Importantly, variable stocking may possibly allow slightly higher stocking rates without pasture degradation. Enterprise-level simulations run for <b>breeder</b> <b>herds</b> nevertheless show that poor economic performance can occur under constant stocking and even under variable stocking in some circumstances. Modelling and research results both suggest that a form of constrained flexible stocking should be applied to manage for climate variability. Active adaptive management and research will be required as future climate changes make managing for rainfall variability increasingly challenging...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{deficiency}} {{is a major}} constraint to {{the productivity}} of <b>breeder</b> <b>herds</b> grazing low-P rangelands due to adverse effects on growth and fertility. However, P supplementation during the wet season, when additional dietary P is most needed, is often difficult due to practical constraints. Body P reserves in breeders can be mobilised and alleviate dietary P deficiency within an annual cycle. Approaches to estimate bone P reserves and net mobilisation or replenishment of P from the analysis of rib and hip (tuber coxae) biopsies are discussed. In at least some circumstances, breeder cows grazing P-deficient pastures mobilise bone P to alleviate the effects of diet P deficiency. Recent experiments with breeders have investigated mobilisation of body P to alleviate the adverse effects of dietary P deficiency during pregnancy and early lactation, and subsequent replenishment of body P reserves. Both mature cows and first-calf cows (FCC) calving in a high P status and fed severely P-deficient diets during lactation were able to mobilise sufficient body P reserves to provide milk for moderate calf growth (viz. 0. 6 - 0. 8 kg liveweight (LW) /day for 3 months), but this was associated with rapid cow-LW loss and markedly decreased bone P content. First-calf cows appear to have lesser capacity than mature cows to mobilise body P. FCC fed P-adequate diets during late pregnancy maintained high voluntary intakes and had higher LW and bone P reserves at calving. When fed a P-deficient diet during early lactation, these greater bone P reserves were utilised. Bone P reserves can be replenished by P-adequate diets fed post-weaning. Breeder management that relies more on mobilising body P reserves when P demands are high and on replacing these body P reserves when P demands are lower offers an opportunity to alleviate the effects of dietary P deficiencies during the early wet season in situations where P supplementation is not possible...|$|R

40|$|Repeat {{breeding}} {{can be a}} {{major factor}} involved in infertility. A “repeat breeder ” is generally defined as any cow that has not conceived after three or more services associated with true estrus (heat). In herds of normal fertility, where conception rates are commonly at 50 - 55 %, about 9 - 12 % of the cows {{are expected to be}} repeat breeders. As the conception rate decreases, the number of cows requiring additional services increases. As a result, repeat breeding rapidly becomes a significant problem, as shown in Table 1. As with other reproductive problems the key to identifying or confirming a repeat breeding problem lies in a good set of records. By keeping and analyzing good estrus and breeding records one can calculate the percent of repeat <b>breeders</b> in a <b>herd.</b> It is important however, when evaluating the significance of repeat breeding in an infertility problem, to keep the definition of a repeat breeder in mind, so only cows requiring more than three services are considered. If natural service is used on the farm, frequent pregnancy exams will be especially helpful in identifying repeat breeders. In general, if more than 15 % of the cows require more than three services, repeat breeding should be considered a significant problem warranting further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of all milk cattle <b>breeders</b> is <b>herd</b> making profit [...] the herd with good {{reproduction}} and consequent high production performance. Such a goal {{can only be}} reached if the herd is of quality genetic base. Cows milk performance is one of important factors influencing final economic results of milk production. The aim of this Diploma work was to examine lactation course and level as well as reproduction of high-performance Czech pied diary cows with regards to their genetic base. The diary cows (190 pieces) on lactation within 27 th March 2008 [...] 13 th June 2008 were examined. The examined cows were divided into three groups based on number of their lactation. These groups with cows on 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd lactation were further divided with regards to their genetic base into herd groups registered as C 1 and C 2. The sub-herd group C 100 was isolated from C 1 herd group. To each lactation group, 2 [...] 3 bulls were assigned based on {{the highest number of}} daughters in specific lactation group. Minimum criterion for bull assignment to lactation group was set on at least 5 daughters in the group. Reproduction performance was examined in these groups. The milk performance was evaluated based on 305 days usage, lactation curve persistence index and the lactation curve course in individual groups. The herd-group C 2 with highest genetic base of diary breed proved the best results in all lactation groups with regards to reproductive performance. The best results were reached on 3 rd lactation. The link between genetic base and reproduction performance of Czech pied cattle was not proved. Neither the link between genetic base and milk performance was proved. The influence of lactation number on most of examined factors was proved. The fathers influence on reproduction or milk performance was not clearly proved. However, the results may be distorted for lack of diary cows in groups examined under this criterion. Finally, the direct link between reproductive and milk performance was also not clearly proved. To summarize our results, we can state that the diary cows in examined herd were above the milk performance average of Czech pied cattle bred in Czech Republic. At the same time, the reproduction performance was just on average of Czech Republic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the dynamics and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in the pig population of Great Britain (GB). The roles of the metapopulation of pig herds (metaherd) and individual herd characteristics are examined, and different control and intervention strategies assessed. A novel stochastic model of a metaherd was created, incorporating the births, deaths, slaughter, culls and movement of pigs within and between herds. The metaherd was structured to have characteristics representative of the GB metaherd: the distribution of herd sizes, ‘source’ herds per herd, and numbers of pigs moved per movement. The metaherd was arranged into a typical pyramidal structure. A stochastic infectious process of PRRSV was included. Herd size {{was found to be}} key to within herd persistence of PRRSV, with infection failing to persist in smaller (250 sow) herds. Fadeout did not occur in larger herds once infection established in the rearing herd. PRRSV reduces productivity of herds and the metaherd. There was variability in productivity both between herds and within herds over time. The number of source herds did not influence the dynamics, persistence or prevalence of infection within a herd. Breeding herd production was further decreased by PRRSV when the herd also had a rearing <b>herd</b> (<b>breeder</b> finisher). The model was extended to test the effects of control and intervention strategies. Vaccination effect increased with herd size, and reduced variability in production. Vaccination in small herds was ineffective in increasing production due to PRRSV failing to persist regardless of vaccination. Vaccination of the breeding herd produced higher gains per vaccine dose than vaccination of the rearing herd only. Vaccination of the rearing herd only resulted in higher total herd and metaherd gains, with less variability. Partial de-population combined with vaccination increased the probability of increasing herd performance unless the herd was small (1000 sows). Results highlighted the value of modelling to support the decisions of individual farmers to vaccinate and partially depopulate, showing that the optimal decision is influenced by the herd size. Results also demonstrated that the decision to introduce interventions is different for individual farmers...|$|R
