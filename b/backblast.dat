25|$|The RPG {{still remains}} a potent threat to armored vehicles, {{especially}} in situations such as urban warfare or jungle warfare, {{where they are}} favored by guerrillas. They are most effective when used in restricted terrain as the availability of cover and concealment can {{make it difficult for}} the intended target to spot the RPG operator. Note that this concealment is often preferably outdoors, because firing an RPG within an enclosed area may create a dangerous <b>backblast.</b>|$|E
25|$|By October 1968, {{with the}} dry season pending, Vang Pao plotted a spoiling attack to be {{launched}} 1 November. He anticipated increased air support from American fighter-bombers because the Operation Rolling Thunder air campaign against North Vietnam had stood down, freeing up those air strikes for use in Laos. Additionally, the 56th Special Operations Wing based at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand had three A-1 Skyraider squadrons available. The Royal Lao Air Force would also be flying its T-28s from Vientiane; debuting in combat were Hmong pilots. These latter pressed home their undisciplined pointblank attacks with reckless courage, often returning in an aircraft holed by the <b>backblast</b> of their own dropped ordnance.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 3 February, the PAVN {{commander}} seeing the buildup of Marines at Huế University thinned out his frontline forces leaving just a platoon to defend the Treasury Building and adjacent post office. On the morning of 4 February the Marines launched their attack on the Treasury complex, the initial assault was on the left flank by Company A, 1/1 Marines which was tasked with securing a Catholic chapel and the Jeanne d'Arc High School (...) [...] The Marines secured the chapel and the east school building, but were pinned down for hours by interlocking fire from the west building. During this action Sergeant Alfredo Cantu Gonzalez would be killed while firing on PAVN machine gun positions, he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle. The Marines eventually broke into the west building and cleared it room by room. Due to the delays on the left flank, the main assault in the centre by Company F, 2/5 Marines was delayed until mid-afternoon. The Treasury compound was hit by M-48 and 106mm fire and tear gas, while a Mule-mounted 106mm engaged the machine gun in the Le Loi Elementary School. Under cover of the tear gas and the 106mm <b>backblast</b> the Marines crossed the street and blew holes in the wall using C4 and Bazookas. The Marines then pushed into the Treasury building which the PAVN had hastily abandoned. The post office also seemed abandoned until the Marines located a vault inside the building, they proceeded to gas out the PAVN inside killing more than 24 of them as they emerged. After securing the Jeanne d'Arc High School, Company A, 1/1 Marines recaptured the Le Loi Elementary School, {{more than half the}} Company's 147 men had been wounded or killed in that day's fighting. That evening VC sappers succeeded in blowing up the An Cuu bridge, cutting the road link to Phu Bai.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} of these types of {{recoilless}} rocket weapons, the <b>backblast</b> that is created when it is fired is a primary safety concern. When the rocket is fired, the rocket propellant in expended entirely within the rocket encasement. This is the cause of the extremely loud and violent <b>backblast.</b> This <b>backblast</b> extends in a 90-meter, 60° cone {{to the rear of the}} weapon. The <b>backblast</b> is lethal out to 30 m, and still extremely dangerous to 90 m. Rounds are under development that would enable a user to fire the rocket from an enclosed building without risk of injury.|$|E
50|$|The <b>backblast</b> {{area is a}} {{cone-shaped}} area {{behind a}} rocket launcher, rocket-assisted takeoff unit or recoilless rifle, where hot gases are expelled when the rocket or rifle is discharged. The <b>backblast</b> area is dangerous to ground personnel, who may be burned by the gases or exposed to overpressure caused by the explosion. In confined spaces, common in urban warfare, even the operators themselves may be at risk. Soft launch methods diminish the <b>backblast.</b>|$|E
50|$|The soft launch {{capability}} of the Javelin allows it to have only a minimal <b>backblast</b> area. In addition to reducing the visible launch signature from the enemy, this enables the Javelin to be fired from inside structures with minimal preparation, which gives the Javelin advantages in urban fighting over the widely used AT4 (which has a large <b>backblast</b> area, although this is lessened in the AT4 CS). A large <b>backblast</b> area would seriously injure personnel if fired from inside an unprepared structure, and may betray {{the location of the}} launch to enemy observers.|$|E
50|$|This is {{technically}} simpler than soft launching but produces a large <b>backblast</b> area.|$|E
50|$|The weapon <b>backblast</b> cone {{has been}} coordinated with the slope angles {{of the vehicle}} hull to allow 10° of {{depression}} and 10° of elevation of the weapon.|$|E

50|$|The MATADOR {{is among}} the lightest in its class. The warhead is {{effective}} against both vehicle armour and brick walls. The weapon has little <b>backblast,</b> making it safe for operation in confined spaces.|$|E
50|$|The troops {{used the}} <b>backblast</b> from jet engines to melt the 32,000 {{cubic meters of}} ice. The tunnel was cleared by 1974, but was not officially opened until 1984 when the first train {{traveled}} from Novy Urgal to Komsomolsk-on-Amur.|$|E
50|$|To keep {{training}} costs down, a reusable RPG-22 {{is available}} that fires a 30 mm subcalibre projectile, weighing 350g, to operational ranges. Handling {{is identical to}} that of the full calibre version, {{with the exception of the}} discharge noise and <b>backblast.</b>|$|E

5000|$|RPG Trooper: This Northern {{specialist}} {{class is}} the primary anti-air ground unit using rocket-propelled grenades. They are also useful for taking out clustered and dug-in enemy positions. RPG Troopers are additionally equipped with shotguns and rifles. They are a potential hazard for themselves and teammates considering the <b>backblast</b> of their weapon.|$|E
50|$|On firing, {{there is}} a <b>backblast</b> danger area behind the weapon, of at least 15 metres. The solid {{propellant}} motor completely burns out while the rocket {{is still in the}} barrel tube, accelerating it to about 133 metres per second. The weapon has simple pop-up sights graduated to ranges of 50, 150 and 250 metres.|$|E
5000|$|The warhead weighed 2.9 kg and {{contained}} 0.8 kg of a 50:50 mixture of TNT and hexogen explosives, and had armour penetration of 200 mm. The Panzerfaust often had warnings written in large red {{letters on the}} upper rear end of the tube, the words usually being [...] "Achtung. Feuerstrahl." [...] ("Beware. Fire jet."). This was to warn soldiers to avoid the <b>backblast.</b>|$|E

Compared to its predecessors it contains a great deal of modern and COTS electronics, rather than the previously slow-moving development of military procurement.|$|E
50|$|In Afghanistan, the Mujahideen often {{modified}} RPG-7 rocket launchers for {{use against}} Russian helicopters {{by adding a}} curved pipe {{to the end of}} the blast tube, which diverted the <b>backblast,</b> allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with saturation anti-personnel suppression fire from machine guns.|$|E
50|$|Though the {{launcher}} {{itself is}} mobile to reduce vulnerability, an actual launch unit requires support vehicles that can cover a 300×300-meter area, {{making it hard}} to move quickly and easier to detect. Also, the launcher is not made to travel off-road and requires solid ground when firing to prevent <b>backblast</b> and debris damage due to the hard launch, restricting its firing locations to roads and pre-made launch pads.|$|E
50|$|ASL 91-110 - these {{scenarios}} are actually reworkings of older scenarios; {{some from the}} ASL Annual and a number from a magazine called <b>Backblast</b> which only had a two issue run in 1994. The magazine was developed by several Avalon Hill playtesters, who formed their own organization called Multi-Man Publishing which later, of course, went on to acquire the rights to ASL. The group included Steve Petersen, Brian Youse, and Perry Cocke.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, new {{versions}} of Duke, Hi-Tech, Kamakura, Long Range and Snake Eyes were released in 2007, {{along with a}} Toys [...] "R" [...] Us exclusive [...] "Land Sea Air" [...] box set, which included Sigma 6 {{versions of}} <b>Backblast,</b> Barrel Roll and Deep Six. Cobra figures in 2007, included new versions of Cobra Commander, Destro, Storm Shadow and Zartan, as well as figures of Firefly, Iron Grenadiers, Cobra Red Ninja, Dark Ninja Master, and Red Banshee.|$|E
50|$|Rocket-propelled grenades can be—and often are—used against {{hovering}} helicopters (e.g., by Somali militiamen {{during the}} Battle of Mogadishu (1993)). Firing an RPG at steep angles poses {{a danger to}} the user, because the <b>backblast</b> from firing reflects off the ground. In Somalia, militia members sometimes welded a steel plate in the exhaust end of an RPG's tube to deflect pressure away from the shooter when shooting up at US helicopters. RPGs are used in this role only when more effective weapons are not available.|$|E
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{is held in}} both hands. The operator {{opens the}} covers {{on both ends of}} the launcher, grasping the forward tube piece firmly with his left hand the operator pulls the back tube outwards with a sharp, hard pull. If the launcher has been successfully cocked, the back piece will not slide in. The operator assumes a correct firing position, keeping in mind the <b>backblast</b> zone of the launcher, takes aim through the flip up sights and squeezes the trigger to fire the rocket. Afterwards the empty tube is disposed of.|$|E
5000|$|The missile itself {{consists}} of a solid rocket-powered booster [...] and a HEAT warhead. Nine collapsible fins extend in mid-flight to ensure a stable flight path. The missile fires via an impact fuse. After firing, the launcher has to be discarded, {{it can not be}} re-used with another missile. The FGR-17 launcher acts as a container for the missile itself and both are meant to be handled as a single unit. The FGR-17, like all weapons of its kind, produces a <b>backblast</b> effect so care for collateral damage must be taken whilst firing.|$|E
50|$|During the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily, {{small numbers of}} the M1A1 bazooka (using an improved rocket, the M6A1) were used in combat by US forces. The M1A1 accounted for four medium German tanks and a heavy Tiger I, with the latter being knocked out by an improbable hit through the driver's vision slot. A disadvantage to the bazooka was the large <b>backblast,</b> which gave away {{the position of the}} shooter, although all weapons have some firing signature. Moreover, the bazooka fire team often had to expose their bodies in order to obtain a clear field of fire against a target.|$|E
50|$|Improvements to the {{ammunition}} have been continual. While the older HEAT rounds {{are not particularly}} effective against modern tank armor, the weapon has found new life as a bunker-buster with an HEDP round. In addition, improved HEAT, high explosive (HE), smoke and illumination (star shell or flare) ammunition is also available. For full effectiveness, illumination rounds have to be fired {{at a very high}} angle, creating a danger for the gunner as the <b>backblast</b> from firing can burn him. For this reason, several armies have retired the illumination rounds, while the U.S. Army requires that they be fired from a standing position.|$|E
50|$|The {{first model}} was the RPzB 43, which was 164 cm long and weighed about 9.25 kg when empty. Operators of the RPzB 43 {{had to wear}} a {{protective}} poncho and a gas mask without a filter {{to protect them from}} the heat of the <b>backblast</b> when the weapon was fired. In October 1943, it was succeeded by the RPzB 54, which was fitted with a blast shield to protect the operator and was heavier, weighing 11 kg empty. This was followed by the RPzB 54/1, which had an improved rocket, a shorter barrel, and a range increased to about 180 meters.|$|E
50|$|By October 1968, {{with the}} dry season pending, Vang Pao plotted a spoiling attack to be {{launched}} 1 November. He anticipated increased air support from American fighter-bombers because the Operation Rolling Thunder air campaign against North Vietnam had stood down, freeing up those air strikes for use in Laos.

5000|$|Rockets produce no {{or little}} recoil, while {{conventional}} gun artillery systems produce significant recoil. Unless firing {{within a very}} small arc {{with the possibility of}} wrecking a self-propelled artillery system's vehicle suspension, gun artillery must usually be braced against recoil. In this state they are immobile, and can not change position easily. Rocket artillery is much more mobile and can change position easily. This [...] "shoot-and-scoot" [...] ability makes the platform difficult to target. A rocket artillery piece could, conceivably, fire on the move. Rocket systems produce a significant amount of <b>backblast,</b> however, which imposes its own restrictions. Launchers may be sighted by the firing arcs of the rockets, and their fire can damage themselves or neighbouring vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in {{the early}} 1960s to Army and Marine Corps service, the M67 {{was used in the}} Vietnam War {{together}} with the much larger 106 mm M40. The M67 proved a reliable and effective weapon, though it was primarily used against personnel and fortifications in combat, and saw little or no use against armor. While troops praised its effectiveness, the M67 came under heavy criticism due to the weapon's weight and length as well as its <b>backblast,</b> which often precluded its use in offensive operations. Because of these disadvantages, some Marine Corps units continued to use the old M20 Super Bazooka in preference to the M67. It was largely replaced in Army service by the M47 Dragon anti-tank missile system starting in 1975.|$|E
50|$|Because some {{projectile}} velocity {{is inevitably}} {{lost to the}} recoil compensation <b>backblast,</b> recoilless rifles tend to fire a fairly heavy explosive shell with less range than traditional cannons, although with a far greater ease of transport, making them popular with paratroop, mountain warfare and special forces units, where portability is of particular concern, {{as well as with}} some light infantry and infantry fire support units. Although the greatly diminished recoil allows many smaller and newer versions to be shoulder-fired by individual infantrymen, the majority of recoilless rifles in service are mounted on light tripods and intended to be carried by a small 2- or 3-man crew. The largest versions, such as the British 120 mm L4 MoBAT and L6 Wombat, retain enough bulk and recoil to be restricted to a firm vehicular mount, such as on a jeep, truck, or armored personnel carrier.|$|E
50|$|The rebels {{also used}} Soviet-made shoulder-launched, heat-seeking surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) and American Redeye shoulder-launched SAMs, which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many {{of them came}} from stocks that the Israelis had captured during their wars with Soviet backed states in the Middle East. Owing {{to a combination of}} the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective. The RPG-7, originally developed as an antitank weapon, was the first effective countermeasure to the Hind. However, the RPG-7, not being designed for air defense, had several shortcomings owing to its design. Often, attempting to use one to shoot down a helicopter could lead to the user injuring himself with the rocket's <b>backblast.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Multi-Man Publishing (MMP) {{was founded}} in 1994 by four Avalon Hill playtesters and a {{graphics}} art designer. Their first publication was <b>Backblast,</b> a fanzine for Avalon Hill's wargame Advanced Squad Leader (ASL). Around the same time, Avalon Hill had {{made the decision that}} ASL did not have a future, and so MMP sought to keep it alive among fans by publishing occasional scenarios and a fanzine. MMP also entered into discussions with AH about purchasing the rights to ASL. In late 1995, professional baseball player Curt Schilling, who was a devoted player of ASL, separately also tried to buy the rights to ASL. Avalon Hill did not agree to either offer, they held out for more money, but introduced Shilling to MMP, who subsequently joined the company as a one-third partner, the other two thirds owned equally by Perry Cocke and Brian Youse.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 rumours of T-34 and T-54 {{tanks in}} {{neighbouring}} Mozambique - where the Rhodesian security forces were increasingly being drawn into external operations against Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), caused a stir, prompting {{the formation of}} tank-killer teams. Infantrymen were trained {{in the use of}} ageing M20 bazookas while the artillery corps rigged M40 recoilless rifles to Unimog trucks for engaging heavy armour. The Unimog crews worked in pairs to counter the likelihood of retaliatory fire, {{due in part to the}} M40's <b>backblast</b> which served to highlight the gunner's position. As the Ferret's firepower was limited, Eland Mk4 armoured cars were also imported in quantity. A South African variant of the French Panhard AML, the Eland was frequently utilised for fire support and anti-tank duties. It was armed with a 90mm cannon capable of destroying a T-34 at medium range, enabling the smaller armoured cars to punch well above their weight during conventional engagements.|$|E
