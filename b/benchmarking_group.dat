On each of these measures, Scotland is close to the average of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>group.</b> * Scotland lies in {{the bottom half of the}} league table on each of the four indicators of labour utilisation which are used. Here, in general, the gap between Scotland and the <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> is large. * Scotland is in the top half of the league table on all of the indicators of labour quality and human capital investment, and often in the top quarter. Scotland outperforms the <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> on the proportions of relevant groups (i) with different types of qualifications (ii) undertaking work-related training and (iii) achieving high scores in internationally comparable tests of 15 year olds. Scotland lags the <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> in the proportion of the workforce with degrees. This report aimed to shed light on two questions: 1 - To what extent do labour market factors (including the quality of the workforce) explain Scotland's relative economic performance? 2 - In which areas is Scotland's labour market performance relatively strong and relatively weak? The report does this by examining 18 indicators of performance using published data from official sources.

Goal of the paper is to identify key specifics of Slovak entrepreneurial activities in comparison to <b>benchmark</b> <b>groups</b> of countries. In our research we focus on investigation of entrepreneurial potential, total early stage entrepreneurial activities and, entrepreneurial activities of established businesses, as well as discontinuation of entrepreneurial activities. In addition to that we analyzed motivation for entrepreneurship, employee entrepreneurial activities, entrepreneurship inclusivity from age and aspirations from growth, innovation and internationalization points of views in Slovakia.

40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} part 1 of our twin {{articles}} on income reference points for Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA). Preventative costs based LCA systems, {{such as the}} EcoCost system and the Oiconomy system, need targets (performance reference points) to determine the marginal preventative costs, {{the costs of the}} most expensive measure that globally needs to be employed to reach the target. To extend the EcoCost system for social issues, targets are required for issues like fair wages and fair inequality of wages, issues for which no agreed standard, no effect level or target exists. One way of setting targets is to take best practices as benchmark, e. g. the practices of a group of best performing countries. The purpose of this part 1 article is to first develop a well-founded <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> of the 20 % best performing countries and thereafter propose a well-founded target for the issue of inequality for preventative costs based SLCA, which can also serve as performance reference point for SLCA in general and for other uses. In part 2, for the same purposes and using the same <b>benchmark</b> <b>group,</b> we propose targets for fair minimum wages for every country. Methods: A <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> of countries for the setting of targets was determined by an assessment of available country performance indicators, based on 5 criteria. Thereafter, we derived a proposal for a maximum inequality ratio based on existing democratically determined inequality ratios in the <b>benchmark</b> <b>group.</b> Results and discussion: The Sustainable Society Index–Human Wellbeing proved the best indicator for a country benchmark for preventative cost-based SLCA. Using the average of maximum democratically determined income differences in a <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> of countries determined by this index, a performance reference point for SLCA for the issue of fair inequality was derived and proposed, resulting in a maximum ratio of income differences for governmental institutions of 14. 1, for government ruled companies of 18. 3 and for industry of a factor 23. 8. Conclusions: It proved possible to derive a target for maximum inequality of wages, based on democratic choices in a <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> of the 20 % best performing countries. The target for governmental institutions may be called objective, and proposed augmentations for government ruled companies and industry, though value choices, seem reasonable for the consumer who requires prevention of all possible harm as consequence of his purchase choices and who, as a voter, contributes to governmental standards...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary care physicians treating patients with type 2 diabetes in six European countries were randomized to give standard care (control group) or standard care with feedback benchmarked against other centers in each country (<b>benchmarking</b> <b>group).</b> In both groups, laboratory tests were performed every 4 months. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving preset targets of the critical quality indicators HbA 1 c, LDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) after 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 4, 027 patients enrolled, 3, 996 patients were evaluable and 3, 487 completed 12 months of follow-up. Primary end point of HbA 1 c target was achieved in the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>group</b> by 58. 9 vs. 62. 1 % {{in the control group}} (P = 0. 398) after 12 months; 40. 0 vs. 30. 1 % patients met the SBP target (P < 0. 001); 54. 3 vs. 49. 7 % met the LDL cholesterol target (P = 0. 006). Percentages of patients meeting all three targets increased during the study in both groups, with a statistically significant increase observed in the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>group.</b> The percentage of patients achieving all three targets at month 12 was significantly larger in the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>group</b> than in the control group (12. 5 vs. 8. 1 %; P < 0. 001).

40|$|It is {{essential}} {{that the quality of}} care is reviewed regularly through robust processes such as benchmarking to ensure all outcomes and resources are evidence-based so that children and young people’s needs are met effectively. This article provides an example of the use of benchmarking in school nursing practice. Benchmarking has been defined as a process for finding, adapting and applying best practices (Camp, 1994). This concept was first adopted in the 1970 s ‘from industry where it was used as a structured approach to quality measurement and improving services’ (Royal College of Nursing (RCN), 2014 : 5). The first ‘paediatric clinical <b>benchmarking</b> <b>group</b> was set up in the North West in 1994 in response to the Chief Nursing Officer requiring a quality tool for paediatric practice’ (RCN, 2007 : 2). Since this initial <b>benchmarking</b> <b>group</b> being developed the North West has continued to lead the way in benchmarking in other areas of clinical practice such as cardiac surgery, neonatal and neurosurgery. The benefits of benchmarking include (RCN, 2007) : reflective practice; sharing of innovative practice; reducing duplication and repetition; promoting a bottom up approach to quality improvement; evidence base for outcomes and resources; providing an avenue for implementing change in practice...|$|E

We do this in the framework of vector autoregressive regressions, utilising impulse functions and variance decompositions with monthly data that starts in 1999 in order to avoid periods of very high inflation and the Russian crisis. We find that exchange rate movements have a clear impact on price developments in the CIS countries. The speed of the pass-through is also fairly high: in most cases the full effect is transmitted into domestic prices in less than 12 months. Unlike in many other emerging market economies, an additional effect from US prices on to domestic prices is not significant. The extent of the exchange rate pass-through is usually much higher than in our <b>benchmark</b> <b>group</b> of emerging market countries. Variance decomposition shows that the relative share of exchange rates in explaining changes in domestic prices is higher in the CIS countries than in the <b>benchmark</b> <b>group.</b> Our results indicate that policy-makers in the CIS countries need {{to pay more attention to}} exchange rate movements than in many other emerging market countries. exchange rate pass-through; inflation; exchange rate regime; transition countries...|$|R
