2500|$|The EEF's rations {{were noted}} for {{their lack of}} variety and poor quality. When in camp, rice, peas, dates, porridge, jam, bread, meat, and <b>bread</b> <b>pudding</b> were available, while sardines, pears, chocolate, sausages, milk, café au lait, cocoa, and {{biscuits}} could be bought from army canteens. However, during operations soldiers survived for long periods on [...] "iron rations" [...] (in individual tins), and a diet of Bully beef and army biscuits, which was only occasionally varied by cooking a stew made from tins of pressed beef and onions. Tinned stew, consisting of meat and mainly turnips and carrots, was available at times. Tea was drunk at every opportunity from early morning, during a break on the march, and in camp.|$|E

A hunk of Swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck Mrs. McCaskey below one eye.

60|$|While {{the cooking}} mania lasted {{she went through}} Mrs. Cornelius's Receipt Book {{as if it were}} a {{mathematical}} exercise, working out the problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of <b>bread</b> <b>pudding,</b> hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.|$|E
60|$|Better is little, than {{treasure}} {{and trouble}} therewith. Better {{a dinner of}} herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. None but a great man would have dared to utter such a glaring commonplace as that. Not only on Sundays now, but all the week, came the hot joint to table, and on every day there was pudding, till a body grew indifferent to pudding; thus a joy-giving luxury of life being lost and but another item added to {{the long list of}} uninteresting needs. Now we could eat and drink without stint. No need now to organise for the morrow's hash. No need now to cut one's bread instead of breaking it, thinking of Saturday's <b>bread</b> <b>pudding.</b> But there the saying fails, for never now were we merry. A silent unseen guest sat with us at the board, so that no longer we laughed and teased as over the half pound of sausages or the two sweet-scented herrings; but talked constrainedly of empty things that lay outside us.|$|E

50|$|The poor {{consumed}} a diet {{largely of}} bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just {{arriving at the}} end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make <b>bread</b> <b>puddings,</b> and <b>bread</b> crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces. At a somewhat higher social level families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens, and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some grew their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbors to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.|$|R
