40|$|Abstract: An {{evaluation}} method of heat convection from brake discs using analytical and experimental approaches is described. Brake discs may be wheel or axle mounted and either ventilated or solid. The majority of brake discs are the ventilated type {{because of the}} cooling effect of the fins. In this study, the cooling efficiency of ventilated discs was investigated through the basic equation for heat convection, brake tests and measurements of the flow volume through the fins. It is concluded that a cooling rate parameter a [(heat convection 6 convection area) /(specific heat 6 disc mass) ] derived from the basic equation for heat convection can express the cooling efficiency of a disc. The parameter a {{can also be used}} to estimate the maximum temperature accumulated in a disc after several cycles of <b>braking</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop.</b> As for the design of the brake discs, the heat convection area is more important than the thickness or number of fins.

5000|$|The Federal Express {{departed}} Boston at 11:00 P.M. After making two stops, {{the train}} halted about 70 mi south of Boston. Its brakes were sticking, and a 45-minute inspection occurred. Conductors discovered a closed [...] "angle cock" [...] (a shutoff valve) {{at the rear}} of the third car. The airbrake system aboard the rail cars had angle cocks at each end of each car. Both valves had to be open for the airbraking system to operate. The only closed valve would be that {{at the rear of}} the final car. Airbrakes on trains are powered by a compressed air tank aboard each car. The engine generates air pressure that is supposed to flow through the airbrake system along the entire length of the train. When this pressure is lessened, valves on the pressurized air tanks come open. The air from the tanks put pressure on the brake disks (or the tread of the wheel), which push against the wheels and cause <b>braking</b> <b>to</b> occur. If the cars separate, from one another or from the engine, the pressure automatically drops and the cars will <b>brake</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop.</b> Closing <b>an</b> angle cock at any point along the system keeps the air pressure in the airbrakes high, thereby preventing the engine from reducing the air pressure and activating the braking system.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the last}} decade a number of {{advanced}} system concepts for improving safety, efficiency, environmental compatibility and comfort of driving have emerged. One of these, Automatic Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS) aims to help drivers to avoid accidents by alerting them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> potential collision and initiating braking. This paper assesses the safety effects of ACAS by examining driver response during emergency braking situations. A series of emergency braking tests were undertaken on a test track. Six subjects (each with {{at least five years}} driving experience) were asked <b>to</b> follow <b>a</b> special ‘dummy’ vehicle and drive the TRG instrumented vehicle.

The TRG instrumented vehicle enabled detailed information to be collected on driver responses such as relative speed, spacing distance, pedal movement, speed and deceleration levels. The data analysis has showed that drivers are likely <b>to</b> initiate their <b>braking</b> before the time to collision (TTC) reaches 4 seconds. Consequently, an autonomous ACAS with a 4 seconds TTC threshold would not give warning that could help drivers reducing their response time.

40|$|TAKEOFF 2. FOR is a FORTRAN {{implementation}} of a modified approach proposed by Krenkel and Salzman to solve for aircraft takeoff. The original methodology solved the aircraft equations of motion parametrically, whereas this program solves through a time-step integration technique.

Balanced field length is often, as here, defined as the distance required <b>to</b> make either <b>a</b> One Engine Inoperative (OEI) takeoff (including obstacle passage) or <b>a</b> braked <b>stop</b> when <b>an</b> engine fails at critical engine failure speed.

50|$|Easy-Spin Starting - This {{compression}} release, implemented as {{an extra}} hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft, was introduced in 1961 to reduce the effort required <b>to</b> start <b>an</b> engine.

The performances of 23 participants were analyzed while they drove a car and rode a motorcycle over the same low-volume, open roads.

A simulation and empirical study were conducted to analyse various measures. From the simulation study it was concluded that 1) An R 2 measure based on the speed vs time relationship can be used to measure deviations from a constant deceleration, 2) minimum time-to-collision is sensitive to target position offsets, and 3) mean TTC-dot can capture braking behaviour characteristics but the required definition of a begin and end sample-point for its calculation is a disadvantage. The empirical study calculated a set of measures using data of 60 participants driving a simulation-based session of 10 stops. It is concluded that reliable and valid measures for a braking experiment are provided by the speed and distance to the target position at braking onset, the stopping position with respect to the target and the R 2 measure to measure deviations from a constant deceleration. Recommended additional measures are: The mean speed of the complete braking manoeuvre, stopping position consistency, maximum deceleration and onset jerk.

Measurement is accomplished in the time domain and allows one to retrieve digitized time series of the spatial components of the magnetic-flux density (MFD) vector, at specific points in the measurement volume.

40|$|The network {{research}} community {{is working in}} the field of automotive to provide VANET based safety applications {{to reduce the number of}} accidents, deaths, injuries and loss of money. Several approaches are proposed and investigated in VANET literature, but in a completely network-oriented fashion. Most of them do not take into account application requirements and no one considers the dynamics of the vehicles. Moreover, message repropagation schemes are widely proposed without investigating their benefits and using very complicated approaches. This technical report, which is derived from the Master Thesis of Michele Segata, focuses on the Emergency Electronic Brake Lights (EEBL) safety application, meant to send warning messages in the case of an emergency brake, in particular performing a joint analysis of network requirements and provided application level benefits. The EEBL application is integrated within a Collaborative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) which uses network-provided information <b>to</b> automatically <b>brake</b> the car if the driver does not react to the warning. Moreover, an information aggregation scheme is proposed to analyze the benefits of repropagation together with the consequent increase of network load. This protocol is compared <b>to</b> <b>a</b> protocol without repropagation and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rebroadcast protocol found in the literature (namely the weighted p-persistent rebroadcast). The scenario is a highway stretch in which a platoon of vehicles <b>brake</b> down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>stop.</b> Simulations are performed using the NS_ 3 network simulation in which two mobility models have been embedded. The first one, which is called Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) emulates the behavior of <b>a</b> driver trying <b>to</b> reach <b>a</b> desired speed and braking when approaching vehicles in front. The second one (Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane change (MOBIL)), instead, decides when <b>a</b> vehicle has <b>to</b> change lane in order <b>to</b> perform <b>an</b> overtake or optimize its path. The original simulator has been modified by - introducing real physical limits to naturally reproduce real crashes; - implementing a CACC; - implementing the driver reaction when a warning is received; - implementing different network protocols. The tests are performed in different situations, such as different number of lanes (one to five), different average speeds, different network protocols and different market penetration rates and they show that: - the adoption of this technology considerably decreases car accidents since the overall average maximum deceleration is reduced; - network load depends on application-level details, such as the implementation of the CACC; - VANET safety application can improve safety even with a partial market penetration rate; - message repropagation is important to reduce the risk of accidents when not all vehicles are equipped; - benefits are gained not only by equipped vehicles but also by unequipped ones...|$|R
