In 1915 he first exhibited etchings of wild fowl, to popular acclaim. Benson turned increasingly to the depiction of landscapes featuring wildlife, an outgrowth of his interest in hunting and fishing. He went on to produce a steady and profitable output of etchings. Once most recognized for his Impressionist paintings, he became equally popular with his etchings. Arthur Philpott, a critic for the Boston Globe, claimed Benson was the [...] "best known and most popular etcher in the world." [...] To one of his daughters he said, [...] "The whole process from the <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> to the finished print is full of fascinating possibilities and possible failures."

40|$|Inclined solar water {{distillation}} systems (ISWDS), {{one with}} <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> {{and the other}} with black cloth wick are designed and tested under actual environmental conditions of Trichy, Tamilnadu, India. In basin type solar still systems, the feed water falls down on the absorber plate and fresh water and hot water are produced simultaneously. In the inclined solar still system, the efficiency of distilled water production is improved by retaining it on an wick coupled absorber plate. It has been observed that the solar still with black-cloth wick produced more distilled water. The fresh water production increases with low inlet mass flow rates and also inclination angle at 260 preferable for getting more fresh water production. The fresh water generation rate increased two to three times when wick was used instead of a <b>bare</b> <b>plate.</b> It was proved that longer the feed water is held on the absorber plate, the greater the rate of evaporation, leading to an increase in the amount of distilled water. The improvement in the efficiency of the system is due to higher retaining capacity of wick, higher retention time for water and efficient utilization of absorbed temperature...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{for the assessment}} of power radiated by a (treated) test panel. Conventional measurement techniques for panel radiation typically use either a diffuse field or a free-field as receiving environment. However, such an environment is not trivial to create, especially in a compact set-up. Therefore, a method is proposed to retrieve radiated power from a set of pressure measurements that can be applied in a small, reverberant receiving cavity. A base of modal shapes is used to describe the radiating panel velocity, complemented with a direct acoustic simulation of the receiving cavity. In this model, panel shape contribution factors are estimated from the pressure measurements. Finally, radiated power can be calculated from this model. For validation purpose, a <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> case is considered, showing a good agreement between the original and reconstructed radiated power. status: publishe...|$|E

The thermal resistance of TEG was experimentally verified against the manufacturer&# 039;s specifications and used for theoretical analysis in this paper. A theoretical model is presented to determine the maximum theoretical heat flux capacity of both the TEG&# 039;s. The conventional methods are used for cooling of TEG&# 039;s and actual limiting heat flux is experimentally established for various cold end cooling configurations namely <b>bare</b> <b>plate,</b> finned block and heat pipe with finned condenser. Experiments were performed on an indoor setup and outdoor setup to validate {{the results from the}} theoretical model. The outdoor test setup consist of a fresnel lens solar concentrator with manual two axis solar tracking system for varying the heat flux, whereas the indoor setup uses electric heating elements to vary the heat flux and a low speed wind tunnel blows the ambient air past the device to simulate the outdoor breezes. It was observed that <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> cooling can achieve a maximum heat flux of 18, 125 W/m 2 for type A and 31, 195 W/m 2 for type B at ambient wind speed of 5 m/s while maintaining respective allowable temperature over the hot side of TEG&# 039;s.

Although the thermocouple contacting to the backside of the W plate did not indicate a remarkable temperature rise, deuterium release peaks from the W layer were close to that from the W layer irradiated by 2 keV D 2 + at 573 K. It was found by glow discharge optical emission spectrometry analysis that retained deuterium in the W layer has a peak at the depth of 50 nm and gradually decreases toward the W substrate. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, it was evaluated that W oxide existed just at the surface and W atoms in the bulk of deposited W layer were not oxidized.

40|$|Viscoelastic and poroelastic {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in multilayer panels for noise control. They are usually used as an inner decoupling layer in double wall systems {{in order to increase}} the sound transmission loss of a <b>bare</b> <b>plate.</b> In order to correctly simulate the acoustical behaviour of such systems, it is necessary to measure the elastic parameters of these materials (storage and loss moduli, and Poisson's ratio). Physical properties related to pore morphology also need to be determined for open cell structures. Most of the materials used in trimmed panels can show elastic parameters that vary with frequency, thus a quasi-static measurement technique is not accurate enough to consider such viscoelasticity effects. This paper focuses on the estimation of complex modulus {{as a function of the}} frequency of isotropic viscoelastic materials. In particular, the tested material is positioned between two plates, with one of them being excited by an electromagnetic shaker. Using a sine burst as an excitation signal, the accelerometric response in the time domain is measured at the top and bottom plates. The time of flight between the plates and the envelope function of time domain acceleration at the top plate are then found. A transfer matrix model of the experimental setup is used to inversely estimate the complex modulus of the materials once the remaining mechanical and physical properties have been fixed. The results will be presented and discussed for different materials and compared with wellestablished quasi-static and dynamic techniques...|$|E

Relatively little attention has been given, thus far, to observing the thermal microwave part of the spectrum. In this experiment, passive microwave radiation emanating from within a 33 -cm snowpack was measured with a 35 -GHz hand-held radiometer, and in addition to the natural snow measurements, the radiometer was used to measure the microwave emission and scattering from layers of manufactured CO 2 (dry ice) crystals. A 1 square meter plate of aluminum sheet metal was positioned beneath the natural snow so that microwave emissions from the underlying soil layers would be minimized. 35 GHz measurements of this plate were made through the 33 -cm snowpack. Layers of the snow were removed and measurements were repeated for the diminishing snowpack until the <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> was in view. Then, 9 cm of CO 2 crystals were deposited onto the sheet-metal plate, and as was the case for the natural snow, hand-held measurements were made each time the thickness of the deposit was altered.

The temperature of the dry ice was - 76 C, whereas the temperature at the top of the snowpack was - 1. 9 C (the air temperature was - 3 C). Two additional 9 -cm increments were placed on top of the existing CO 2 crystals, resulting in a total thickness of 27 cm of dry ice. After this series of measurements was made, the CO 2 crystals were then placed on top of the snowpack, and as before, measurements were made using the 35 -GHz radiometer.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEG) {{working on}} the principle of Seebeck effect have gathered the attention during this period as a potential device that can generate electricity in a sustainable way. Thermoelectric generators produce high open circuit voltage at high temperature difference across its hot and cold side. High temperature can be achieved by applying large heat flux on the hot side of TEG and low temperature on the cold side will needs effective heat sink. Commercially available thermoelectric devices have low figure of merit which lead to low conversion efficiency. This restricts the user from using the active cooling systems on the cold side to lower the temperature for better thermoelectric power generation. Therefore there is an inherent need to find the suitable passive cooling technique for the commercially available thermoelectric generators. The primary aim of the research is to investigate the conventional passive cooling techniques and find the limiting heat flux that can be reached for commercially available thermoelectric generators with these conventional passive cooling methods. Further this research introduces and explores a novel passive cooling technique using the heat pipe for cooling of commercially available thermoelectric generators. Two commercial thermoelectric generators are selected for testing with the conventional passive heat sinks and the innovative non-conventional heat sink for cooling. Indoor experimental setup uses cartridge electric heaters embedded in the aluminium block to achieve the high heat flux. Outdoor experimental setup consists of a Fresnel lens to achieve the high heat flux for hot side of thermoelectric generator. Conventional heat sink configurations include <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> as heat sink, finned heat sink and heat pipe finned heat sink. A novel and non-conventional passive heat sink is proposed this research which uses heat pipes to transfer the heat away from the cold side of thermoelectric generators and dump the heat into water instead of just cooling it with air. This system also opens an avenue for the utilizing the dumped heat in the water for industrial or household purpose. A case study with application of this non-conventional heat sink is presented in this research for a remote area house. System is designed and analysed for electricity and hot water demand fulfilled by using solar concentrator system for high heat flux with thermoelectric generators for electricity generation and passive water cooled heat pipe heat sink for hot water demand of the remote area home. In conclusion limiting heat flux for two commercially available TEG’s is established for conventional passive heat sinks. A non-conventional passive heat sink is introduced for cooling of TEG’s and heat flux capabilities for this heat sink with two TEG’s are established. It is shown that the thermoelectric power generation has a bright future to get into small to medium scale mainstream power generation with existing figure of merit of the materials. Further research and development in the field of materials can lead to higher figure of merit for thermoelectric materials that can compete with the existing conventional heat engines mainstream large scale power production...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the damage development in ceramics {{with and without}} composite cover during ballistic impact. This is relevant for ceramic inserts in body armor that are often covered with a composite material. To study {{the effect of the}} cover on the damage development in the ceramic, projectile impact experiments were performed at sub-muzzle velocities on bare alumina tiles and plates covered with a fiberglass composite. In addition to the experiments, finite element simulations were performed. An atypical formulation was used; Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) for the projectile and Lagrangian for the ceramic target. For the ceramic target, an unconventional material model was chosen; the pseudo-geological model 72 _R 3 in LS-DYNA. Cracking damage in the recovered plates was characterized in a manner that clearly distinguished between cracking mechanisms and allowed the cracks to be tracked and quantified. In light of the common use of composite cover for ceramics in body armor, an unexpected result was found; that the covered plates showed significantly more damage than the <b>bare</b> <b>plates.</b> The simulations successfully matched details of the cracking patterns and elucidated the damage evolution in the ceramic plates.

40|$|Reducing {{the very}} {{annoying}} boom noise which is heard inside the cabin of a moving vehicle is the motivation {{and the subject}} of this research thesis. The attraction of a vehicle to a potential consumer is significantly influenced by its interior noise characteristics. Thus the prediction of vehicle interior noise is a significant challenge for vehicle manufacturers at the early concept design phase. Vehicular interior noise mainly stems from structural vibration such as the power train, driveline vibration or wheel vibration which is induced by road roughness. Among numerous vehicular noise problems, structural-borne noise such as boom noise is considered to have the most annoying acoustic features. The boom noise influences the acoustic quality, and thus the customer&rsquo;s perception of the car for the value and quality. The boom noise generated from structural vibration is mainly due to the strong modal coupling between the flexible structure and the acoustic cavity. Therefore, studying the vibro-acoustic coupling characteristics &ndash; the subject of this research &ndash; is important for car manufacturers. In this research, the first step was to perform experimental modal analysis to identify the plate-cavity resonance problem. Following this, the Finite Element Method (ANSYS) was applied to simulate the plate and cavity system and the simulation results were compared with experimental results; these new results have formed the basis for later analytical formulations and assumptions. Secondly, the deterministic method, based on an Impedance Mobility Compact Matrix, was implemented in the analytical solution to calculate the sound pressure level inside the acoustic cavity and the flexible plate vibration velocity. The analytical results were verified by the results of the VAOne vibro-acoustic simulation model and experimental results. A statistical energy analysis (SEA) was then applied to simulate the plate and cavity system. All SEA parameters were calibrated with analytical formulae and the coupling quotient calculated. The coupling quotient indicated the coupling strength of the plate-cavity system in the mid-high frequency ranges. Then the two methods were combined. The use of the combined method produced results which explained how the air cavity and the flexible structure were coupled in the low-mid frequency ranges. The acoustic pressure calculated by the Impedance Mobility method was used to predict the mean energies of the flexible plate and the cavity. The predicted mean energy curves were verified by the SEA simulation results using the AutoSEA software and experimental data from speaker-microphone experiments. The results from the combined methods have revealed that the coupling between the structure and the acoustic cavity depends on the plate thickness and the cavity size. This study provides a better insight into the coupling strength of the plate structure and the cavity. It is this insight which can be used to understand and solve the boom noise problem. The effect of interior trim materials on the sound quality of the plate-cavity system was also investigated. The sound pressure results calculated by the impedance mobility method were used to calculate the psychoacoustic metrics using the psychoacoustic analysis method. Experiments were carried out on a simply supported aluminium plate which covered an open ended square box, and the box was excited by a shaker. A good agreement between the analytical and experimental results was obtained, and the proposed model was validated and confirmed for feasibility. The results indicated that the interior trim has an influence on the distribution of the sound loudness and sharpness inside the cavity in the middle and high frequency ranges. Finally, the application of the hybrid deterministic-SEA method to predict the sound pressure level and mean energy level responses of the stiffened plate-cavity system was demonstrated. The mean square sound pressure inside the acoustic cavity for nine observation points was averaged and used as an input to calculate the cavity mean energy. A good agreement between analytical and experimental results was obtained, and the proposed method was validated and confirmed for feasibility. The results of the proposed method were also validated by practical engineering applications. It was found that there was a strong coupling between the stiffened <b>bare</b> <b>plate</b> and cavity. This can be demonstrated by the first resonant frequency peak overlap of the stiffened plate and the acoustic cavity. The strength of coupling was found to be reduced by adding the stiffener onto the plate, or increasing the thickness of the plate. A strong coupling of the plate and cavity would induce a high level of boom noise. Overall, the results of this research have shed new insights onto the boom noise and its solution which helps to eliminate this most annoying noise phenomenon. Much more research, however, still needs to be undertaken in order to fully resolve this noise issue...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{examine the}} effect of lead on {{postural}} control of workers who have been exposed to lead.  METHODS— 63 Male, lead battery workers mean (SD) age 41. 0  (7. 4) were compared with 48  age matched male controls after excluding those with acute or chronic diseases. Exposed workers had mean (SD) past blood lead concentrations of 37. 5  (9. 2) µg/dl and 11. 2  (5. 7) years of employment. Postural control was measured with a computerised postural sway measurement system which measured both sway and total movements.  RESULTS—Workers standing straight with eyes open on the <b>bare</b> <b>plates</b> had sway and total movements which were not notably different from controls. On the other hand increased movements were needed in the exposed workers to maintain stability (the general stability quotient 18. 2  (5. 4) v 15. 4  (4. 4) in controls, p< 0. 01) when standing directly on the footplates with closed eyes,, and with the head tilted (15. 0  (3. 8) v 11. 5  (3. 0) in controls, p< 0. 001). Exposed workers also had a trend for less ability to synchronise anterior posterior and lateral sway in the stress positions (0. 0625) than had non-exposed workers.  Significant but low correlations were found between the estimate of the chronic internal dose of lead and three of 10  of the postural control measurements, and present lead blood concentrations and only one of the 10  measurements and (r values ranged from 0. 21  to 0. 31, p⩽ 0. 03).  CONCLUSIONS—These findings suggest that lead affects postural control in asymptomatic workers.

Failure modes examined herein consist of fracturing in the polyurea/steel composite structure. Effects of thicknesses and locations of the polyurea on the blast mitigation are also studied. Explanations of selected strain-rate dependent material models for the steel and polyurea are provided. CFD blast simulations using PUMA 2 are described and validated. Results obtained from numerical studies completed to date show that <b>bare</b> steel <b>plate</b> experiences severe fracturing and fragmentation under prescribed blast loading while polyurea coated plates are able to sustain prescribed pressures without fully fracturing...|$|R
40|$|An extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) spectrometer experiment operated successfully during the STS- 7 mission {{in an experiment}} to measure the global and diurnal variation of the EUV airglow. The spectrometer is an F 3. 5 Wadsworth mount with mechanical collimator, a 75 x 75 mm grating, and a <b>bare</b> microchannel <b>plate</b> detector providing a spectral resolution of 7 X FWHM. Read-out of the signal is through discrete channels or resistive anode techniques. The experiment includes a microcomputer, 20 Mbit tape recorder, and a 28 V, 40 Ahr silver-zinc battery. It is the first GAS payload to use an opening door. The spectrometer's 0. 1 x 4. 2 deg field of view is pointed vertically out of the shuttle bay. During the STS- 7 flight data were acquired continuously {{for a period of}} 5 hours and 37 minutes, providing spectra of the 570 A to 850 A wavelength region of the airglow. Five diurnal cycles of the 584 A emission of neutral helium and the 834 A emission of ionized atomic oxygen were recorded. The experiment also recorded ion events and pressure pulses associated with thruster firings. The experiment is to fly again on Mission 41 -F...|$|R
40|$|Composite plates using flax {{fabrics and}} maleic {{anhydride}} modified polypropylene were fabricated on laboratory scale. The {{aim of the}} current research {{was to develop a}} low cost composite plate or a hybrid structure based on those plates and steel sheet, for making humanitarian demining clothes protecting against secondary fragmentation caused by anti-personnel blast mines. Ballistic impact tests according to STANAG 2920 were carried out for determining the v(50) -limit. So called field tests were performed by means of simulated anti-personnel mines using M 112 explosive; the repeatability and the spatial distribution of the projected fragments were checked before fixing the final experimental setup. The performance of the <b>bare</b> composite <b>plate</b> was compared with the hybrid structures in terms of v(50) and in terms of damage mechanisms. All tested configurations performed amazingly well during the field tests, which was not the case for the ballistic impact tests. This led to the conclusion that v(50) might not be the best criterion to characterize protective clothing. This conclusion is sustained by energetic considerations and by field tests on plates with half the thickness of the initial plates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a {{contamination}} free porous titanium scaffold by a plasma activated sintering within an originally developed TiN coated graphite mold. The surface of porous titanium sheet {{with or without a}} coated graphite mold was characterized. The cell adhesion property of porous titanium sheet was also evaluated in this study. The peak of TiC was detected on the titanium sheet processed with the graphite mold without a TiN coating. Since the titanium fiber elements were directly in contact with the carbon graphite mold during processing, surface contamination was unavoidable event in this condition. The TiC peak was not detectable on the titanium sheet processed within the TiN coated carbon graphite mold. This modified plasma activated sintering with the TiN coated graphite mold would be useful to fabricate a contamination free titanium sheet. The number of adherent cells on the modified titanium sheet was greater than that of the <b>bare</b> titanium <b>plate.</b> Stress fiber formation and the extension of the cells were observed on the titanium sheets. This modified titanium sheet {{is expected to be a}} new tissue engineering material in orthopedic bone repair. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{exploitation}} of environmental exergy resources for heating purposes (solar energy, convection heat transfer from ambient air, moist air humidity condensation) by means of properly designed heat pump systems is a possible opportunity. In particular, the use of direct expansion solar assisted heat pumps (DX-SAHP) is investigated in this study, when a <b>bare</b> external <b>plate</b> (the solar collector) is kept at temperatures lower than the dew point temperature of ambient air, so that condensation takes place on it. The potential of this technology is settled and an instrumented prototype of a small DX-SAHP system is used to verify the actual performance of the system, in terms of specific thermal energy delivered to the user, efficiency and regulation capabilities. Results clearly show that {{the contribution of the}} condensation is significant (20 %- 30 % of the total harvested energy) overnight or in cloudy days with very low or no solar irradiation, and {{must be taken into account}} in a system model devoted to describe the DX-SAHP behavior. During daytime, the percentage gain decreases but is still consistent. By investigating along these lines, the heat due to condensation harvested by the collector is found to be a function of the dew-point temperature alone...|$|R
40|$|Total {{internal}} reflection microscopy (TIRM) monitors Brownian fluctuations in elevation {{as small as}} 1 nm by measuring the scattering of a single sphere illuminated by an evanescent wave when the sphere is levitated by colloidal forces such as electrostatic double-layer repulsion. From the Boltzmann distribution of elevations sampled by the sphere over time, the potential energy profile can be determined with a resolution of approximately 0. 1 of the thermal energy kT. Thus, the interaction between a receptor-coated (goat, horse, or rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)) latex sphere and a protein A (SpA) -coated glass microscope slide was studied. A typical TIRM potential energy profile measured between a bare sphere and a <b>bare</b> glass <b>plate,</b> where the sphere fluctuates around the secondary potential energy minimum formed between double-layer repulsion and gravitational attraction, agrees well with DLVO theory. The interactions measured between IgG-coated spheres and SpA-coated slides, on the other hand, displayed a weaker repulsion compared with that observed between bare surfaces under the same conditions. Analysis of the results obtained between the coated surfaces suggests an additional attractive force. The decay length of this attraction correlates with the known dissociation constants for the binding of IgG with SpA in free solution...|$|R
