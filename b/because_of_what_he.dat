5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the BEA's {{preliminary}} report, the investigation into Lubitz found he had been treated for suicidal tendencies prior to his training as a commercial pilot and had been temporarily denied a US pilot's license because of these treatments for depression. The final report of the BEA confirmed the preliminary report's findings, saying the co-pilot began showing symptoms of psychotic depression. For five years, Lubitz had frequently been unable to sleep <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed were vision problems; he consulted over forty doctors and feared he was going blind. Motivated by the fear that blindness would cause him to lose his pilot's licence, he began conducting online research about methods of committing suicide before deciding to crash Flight 9525.|$|E

Albarn's lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years.

He especially praised Griffin, saying he [...] "consistently liberated the performances". Monk biographer Robin Kelley felt {{because he had}} mastered Monk's songs at that point, his solos on Misterioso and Thelonious in Action were excursive and spirited. Jazz critic Scott Yanow found Misterioso to be the superior record <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was Griffin's unforgettable solo on a passionate rendition of [...] "In Walked Bud", while music historian Ted Gioia listed Monk and Griffin's [...] "freewheeling" [...] performance on the title track {{as one of his}} recommended recordings of the composition. According to Robert Christgau, both this record and Brilliant Corners (1957) represented Monk's artistic peak. He cited Misterioso as his favorite album and, in a 2009 article for The Barnes & Noble Review, wrote that Griffin's tenor solo during [...] "In Walked Bud" [...] remained his [...] "favorite five minutes of recorded music". Liam McManus from PopMatters was less enthusiastic about Griffin's playing, which he believed was occasionally heavy-handed and detracted from the music, but still recommended Misterioso as an exceptional Monk record featuring him in a casual performance with his quartet.|$|E

It {{was at this point}} that the nature of the strip changed. [...] "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as [...] "the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, [...] "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man". Kirby noted in a 1971 interview {{that it was}} Ditko who [...] "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did". Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, [...] "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [...] ". He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character. Writer Al Nickerson believes [...] "that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [...] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators".|$|E

[...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out.

When she sees where Walden lives, where he pretends Alan is his rich landlord, she takes a dislike to Alan and so asks him to move in with her at her apartment. She asks him to find a job, so he goes out selling Christmas trees. For Christmas he gets her a sewing machine, even though Sam Wilson could never afford it, but Walden Schmidt could, she thanks him and says {{that there should be no}} lies with each other. She cares for Sam in a great way and tries to be romantic, like hanging a piece of broccoli as she didn't have any mistletoe. Walden donated $100,000 to Kate to start up a fashion design business but made her think Alan did it, though Alan tried to pull the stunt of only donating half of it and keeping the other half for himself. Kate then went to New York City to prepare a fashion show for her outfits. Weeks later, Sam Wilson came to New York to see Kate and finally revealed to her that his real name is Walden Schmidt and that he's really a billionaire. Kate was upset with him at first because he lied to her but forgave him shortly after realizing that he was really the one who donated that money, not Alan. He told her that they could talk about it when they get back to L.A. but she said that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done for her, she might now have a future in NYC. Walden realized that he really didn't think things through. Kate told Walden that they'd have to see what happens but Walden declared that he loved her. Kate said that it was Sam Wilson she loved but she wasn't sure about Walden Schmidt and told him that she needed time to process this big new information. Weeks later, Kate returned to L.A. on business with a check for $100,000 to pay Walden back because she's gotten a new business partner and investor. Walden begged Kate for another chance and they reconciled, trying to make their relationship work but their work schedules seemed to keep them apart. Walden said that their life together was so much easier when they were poor. Kate was last seen in a limousine, leaving for China with her new business partner and investor, who turned out to be Rose; Rose's real motive for becoming Kate's business partner is to keep Kate and Walden apart.

This is different from being externally driven, in which case things such as comfort, money, power, or fame are the motivating force. Csikszentmihalyi writes:An autotelic person needs few material possessions and little entertainment, comfort, power, or fame <b>because</b> so much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> or she does is already rewarding. Because such persons experience flow in work, in family life, when interacting with people, when eating, even when alone with nothing to do, they are less dependent on the external rewards that keep others motivated to go on with a life composed of routines. They are more autonomous and independent because they cannot be as easily manipulated with threats or rewards from the outside. At the same time, they are more involved with everything around them because they are fully immersed in the current of life.A.

That doesn’t make him sound reasonable or even sane, but it also makes him impossible to dismiss. The show has tried to do ambiguous conflicts before, and fumbled them because it’s hard to work up a lot of tension when the “bad” guys are too indistinct to be a clear threat. But there’s tension right now because the Alexandrians’ apparent decency works in perfect contrast with our heroes’ rugged desperation. It’s still entirely possible that all of this will collapse next week, but for once, there’s a fight going on with a risk that feels more pressing than the loss of a location or the sacrifice of a couple of cast members.

Beau Bremmer sang lead on all four of their Busy-B sides, with Steve Staples adding vocal harmonies. [...] "Clouds Don’t Shine" [...] b/w [...] "No One Cares" [...] was their next Busy-Bee release. [...] “The second record, he let us produce it ourselves,” says Staples, who wrote it after a painful breakup. [...] “My girlfriend at the time, her name was Suzette,” he says. “She was going to break up with me, and she did break up with me.” King’s majestic guitar was key to the track’s power. “He was playing through a Vox Viscount amp and a Maestro Fuzztone, so he had the Vox on distortion and the Maestro on distortion.” “That’s why you had all this overbleeding through cool distortion. It’s like double distortion, is what it actually is. And he was playing a Gibson ES-330. We both had the exact same thing. Well, not the exact same guitar, but the same model. Mine was a little different than his, but he got one because he liked the one that I got.” [...] On the flip side was [...] "No One Cares." [...] According to Staples, “...Mike and I went and wrote that song, and then came back in and we rehearsed it once and recorded it.” And it’s killer <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Ricky did. <b>He</b> just made that drum solo up. The song is a drum solo. And he made the whole thing up right on the spot. And he went on to play drums with some band—I can’t remember the name of the band, but they were touring in Europe, opening for Steppenwolf in the early ‘70s. And Steppenwolf’s drummer got sick, and they hired Ricky to play drums for both acts on the tour.” ...|$|R
50|$|His high placing in {{aeronautical}} engineering exams offered {{a career in}} the Royal Air Force, then expanding to meet the threat of European fascism. After qualifying as a fighter pilot and Flying Boat Captain, he served at RAF Wittering, with 29 (F) Squadron ADGB (Air Defence of Great Britain) in Egypt in 1935. Back in England he was posted to 23 (F) Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill in 1936, and 213 Squadron at Northolt. Northolt was to see the end of his flying career, because on 12 April 1937 he suffered a serious flying accident that left him with extensive third degree burns and a 6-month spell in hospital. It was not, however the end of his RAF career which up to now had been unremarkable. When World War 2 broke out the following year he reported to his old station Biggin Hill where, with his recent active flying experience, he was invaluable as a Controller. By the summer of 1940 he had become a Squadron Leader, and a legend in the Control Room, a legend much enhanced by the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau affair. Coming on duty at 7 a.m on 12 February 1942 he noticed aircraft movements seaward of the French port of Brest that the previous controller had dismissed as air-sea rescue, but that he deduced must have been escorting capital ships <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their speed. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> had seen was what British forces were expecting, the break out of a powerful German flotilla which included the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen from Brest where they had been under heavy attack by Coastal and Bomber Command. A code word had been arranged for this eventuality and Igoe used it. It was one of the several disasters in the chain of events of this famous Channel Dash that it was not acted upon. An attack by a Royal Naval destroyer, which was badly damaged, and the suicidal assault on the ships by unsuited and slow-moving Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft of the Fleet Air arm, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, failed to stop the flotilla from reaching German waters. Controlling had turned him into a specialist in the infant radar equipment, and 1943 saw him posted to command RAF Beachy Head, one of the famous “Chain Home” stations which now became a Fighter Direction Station, and from where he was {{to spend the rest of}} the war developing the use of Radar for Fighter Control based on the famous “Type 16”.|$|R
