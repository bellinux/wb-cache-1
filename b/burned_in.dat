5|$|He spreads poison {{and kills}} much {{livestock}} and many Frenchmen {{to prepare for}} an uprising, but is forced into exile as the French become aware of his actions and begin to search for him. He returns after four years, but is captured and tied to a post to be lashed and <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> front of a massive black audience. While tied to the post, he metamorphoses into an insect and flies overhead before landing in the crowds. During the ensuing pandemonium he is again captured by ten men and <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> the fire. The slaves are certain {{that he has been}} saved and remain in defiant and jubilant spirits. The memory of Macandal is not extinguished in the flames. Ti Noel tells his children the stories he was told by Macandal, and they await his return many years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1621, Bernardino Castillo, {{a generous}} patron and a devotee of the 3rd-century Roman martyr Saint Sebastian, donated the land {{upon which the}} church stands. The {{original}} structure, made of wood, <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> 1651 during a Chinese uprising.

5|$|There was a {{tremendous}} public outcry when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it.

The ghetto is liberated one day shy of Syvia's tenth birthday, on January 19, 1945. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and a younger cousin, Isaac, were three of only twelve children who survived.|$|E

5|$|All four {{ships of}} the class entered service {{in time to see}} action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the {{commander}} of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed at the island of Lissa. There, the Austrian fleet under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff attacked the Italians. The four Regina Maria Pias all took part in the ensuing Battle of Lissa. Regina Maria Pia had been set on fire and badly <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard San Martino and Castelfidardo, but neither were seriously damaged. Ancona emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.|$|E

5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E

The surgical treatment of any severely burnt patient is not only laborious but very costly to the Fiji health system and depletes existing resources with few options for skin coverage. This is the first case report of live sibling skin allograft for severe paediatric burns and one of only few patients to have survived more than 50 % <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> Fiji.

5|$|As Soviet forces {{continued}} to {{fight their way}} into the centre of Berlin, Hitler and Braun committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April. Braun took cyanide and Hitler shot himself. As per Hitler's instructions, their bodies were carried up to the Reich Chancellery garden and <b>burned.</b> <b>In</b> accordance with Hitler's last wishes, Bormann was named as Party Minister, thus officially confirming his position as de facto General Secretary of the Party. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz was appointed as the new Reichspräsident (president of Germany) and Goebbels became head of government and Chancellor of Germany. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide later that day.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> Graz.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E

Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> the city of Rome {{for three days and}} three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E
