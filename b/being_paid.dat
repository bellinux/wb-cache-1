Viyyanna issues a promisory note; Venkatapathy rejects it and drags Ramana from the marriage hall. However, Ramana leaves for Madras and lives there with Ammadu. When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja {{pretend to be a}} nurse and a doctor.

But it was known that if these wild <b>beings</b> <b>paid</b> deference to any one, it was to the Grand Marabout at Bugia; and the Secretary promised to send a letter in the Dey's name, which, with a considerable present, might induce him to undertake the negotiation. Therewith the audience terminated, after M. Dessault had laid a splendid diamond snuff-box {{at the feet of the}} Secretary.|$|R

5|$|During May 1908 {{the workers}} were not <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> {{regularly}} enough, and took to a strike on 6 June; 2,120 men were at the most in strike. As a consequence Norsk Hydro {{became a member of}} Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NAF).

5|$|Manning's first play, Us or Them, was {{initially}} produced at the Childers Street Hall in Canberra on 1 November 1977. It was then re-written and performed in 1984 at the Stables Theatre for the Griffin Theatre Company, where it marked {{a turning point}} in Griffin's history as the play's success led to the cast and creatives <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> full professional rates.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the mobility between three labor market states: working in low paid jobs, working in higher paid jobs and not working. Using German panel data I estimate dynamic multinomial logit panel data models with random effects taking the initial conditions problem and potential endogeneity of panel attrition into account. In line with results from other countries, this first study on Germany finds true state dependence in low pay jobs and confirms previous results of state dependence in non-employment. Moreover, I find {{evidence for a}} "low pay no pay cycle", i. e. <b>being</b> low <b>paid</b> or not employed itself increases the probability of being {{in one of these}} states in the next year. However, compared to non working, <b>being</b> low <b>paid</b> does not have adverse effects on future employment prospects: the employment probability increases with low pay employment and the probability of <b>being</b> high <b>paid</b> seems to be higher for previously low paid workers. I find no evidence for endogenous panel attrition. low pay dynamics, unemployment dynamics, dynamic random effects models, state dependence, panel attrition, unobserved heterogeneity...|$|R

B3 was transferred to Leith during mid-1916 where she was fitted with an experimental hull-mounted directional hydrophone system and later sent to Rosyth in 1917 where she was used as either a target to train anti-submarine forces or experimental work {{for the rest of the}} war. B4 was paid off before the end of 1916. B5 moved to Portsmouth during 1915 where she too was paid off before the end of 1916.|$|E

Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during the 18thcentury copper boom, it was {{customary}} throughout the Cornish mining industry to use bal maidens purely as casual labour. There are no records of bal maidens being contracted to a particular mine or paid a piece-rate {{for the amount of}} work done. Instead, mine accounts invariably show them <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, water shortages meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E

25|$|Neighbours {{had assumed}} the flat was unoccupied, and the odour of decomposing body tissue was {{attributed}} to nearby waste bins. The flat's windows did not allow direct sight into the accommodation. Drug addicts frequented the area, {{which may explain why}} no one questioned the constant noise from the television. Half of her rent was <b>being</b> automatically <b>paid</b> to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials to believe that she was still alive. However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property. Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when the bailiffs broke in. The television and heating were still running due to her bills <b>being</b> continually <b>paid</b> for by automatic debit payments and debt forgiveness.|$|R

5|$|Now a centre {{for arms}} manufacture, the castle was made more secure, {{with a new}} {{defensive}} ditch, freshly repaired walls and a new chapel. The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of Richard Marshal against Henry III in 1233–4, suggesting it had considerable military value at this time. Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the £20 fee each year <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> to the constable of the castle by 1287, {{on a par with}} the much larger castles of Rhuddlan or Nottingham.|$|E
5|$|Revenue {{remained}} a continual problem for Scottish government, {{even after the}} introduction of regular taxation from the 1580s, with receipts insufficient for the business of government and, after 1603, much of the costs <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> out of English revenues. In local government, attempts were made increase its effectiveness, {{with the creation of}} Justices of Peace and Commissioners of Supply. The continued existence of courts baron and introduction of kirk sessions helped consolidate the power of local lairds. In law there was an expansion of central institutions and professionalisation of lawyers as a group. Scottish law was maintained as a separate system after the union in 1707 and from 1747 the central courts gained a clear authority over local institutions.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540. The Moravian {{engineer}} Stefan von Haschenperg {{was responsible for the}} design of the fort, <b>being</b> <b>paid</b> the substantial salary of £75 a year for his work on this and other similar projects, including Calshot, Hurst, Sandgate and Sandown. Philip Chute, John Fletcher and William Oxenbridge, all prominent local men, served as the commissioners for the project, Oxenbridge becoming the pay master. Finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to be pressed into service unwillingly. More artillery pieces were sent to the castle ahead of the work being completed, and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around the castle site.|$|E
