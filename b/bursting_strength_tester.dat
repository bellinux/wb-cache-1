40|$|Paper {{has been}} a very {{important}} part of a human life. It is the most versatile material with diverse uses like writing, printing, packaging, and cleaning. Traditionally, paper was produced by beating cellulose fibres which were extracted either from wood or non-wood plants. These fibres undergo varied chemical treatments that is not very environmental friendly. However, it is very necessary to make sure paper production process and raw materials used does not intent any harm to environment. In addition, discharge of foul smelling waste of vegetables and fruits from households pose various major problems like foul smell, pollution and filthy environment. To minimize such issues, a paper is produced from fruit and vegetable residuals like cabbage, lime and orange pulp, spinach, guava, potatoes and radish leaves with the inclusion of oriental lily leaves, natural binders, anti-microbial agent and non-chlorinated bleaching agent. Quality of the paper is estimated by measuring bursting factor and moisture content using <b>Bursting</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Tester</b> and Hydromette respectively. This research mainly deals with making non-chemical based, eco-friendly and cost effective paper from vegetable and fruit residuals and replace the normally used paper in future...|$|E

40|$|A model {{calibration}} technique is {{considered for the}} estimation of material parameters in freestanding thin foils. The experimental apparatus is inspired by <b>bursting</b> <b>strength</b> <b>testers</b> for paper, textile fabrics and polymer coatings such as geo-membranes. The procedure referred to herein consists of the following phases. A controlled fluid pressure {{is applied to the}} foil specimen placed on an horizontal plane with a suitably shaped hole. The induced out-of-plane displacements are measured by a laser profilometer. The material parameters are then inferred from these measurements through inverse analysis, by simulation of the test and minimisation of a suitable norm which defines the discrepancy between measured and computed displacements. Potentialities and limitations of the proposed method are assessed on the basis of computer-generated “pseudo-experimental” data, wheremodelling errors are ruled out. The identifiability of some industrially meaningful material parameters is established...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} presented advances {{the understanding}} of the accurate prediction of <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> in the drill casings used in the offshore oil and gas industry. The derived predictive equations involve a Limit-State-Design methodology, a methodology common in building structures, but novel in its application to drill casings. The potential exploitation of the software algorithms is currently being evaluated. Accurately predicting the <b>burst</b> <b>strength</b> is very important in the casing design for the oil and gas industry. In this paper, finite element analysis is performed for an infinitely long thick walled casing with geometrical imperfections subjected to internal pressure. A comparison with a series of full-scale experiments was conducted to verify the accuracy and reliability of the finite element analysis. Furthermore, three predictive equations were evaluated using the test data, and the Klever equation was concluded to give the most accurate prediction of <b>burst</b> <b>strength.</b> The finite element analysis was then extended to study the effects of major factors on the casing <b>burst</b> <b>strength.</b> Results showed that the initial eccentricity and material hardening parameter had important effects on the <b>burst</b> <b>strength,</b> while the effect of the initial ovality was small.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{construction}} of warp knitted fabrics upon their <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> and absorbability are the subject of this paper. 	The following results have been obtained from our experiments. 	(1) The <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of warp knitted fabrics made of same material are subject to the densities of fabrics and the toughness of underlap yarns. As the differences of underlap lengths are very little among warp knitted fabrics with same weave and various densities, the <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of such fabrics are mostly determined by their densities. As the density of the fabric is increased, the <b>bursting</b> <b>strength</b> is greatly increased within certain limits of smaller density, and then with the gradually diminishing rate of increase. But the <b>bursting</b> <b>strength</b> does not noticcably increase beyond a certain limit of density. 	(2) The <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of warp knitted fabrics with same density and various weaves are determined by their underlap lengths and the numbers of the crossing of underlap with loop. The <b>bursting</b> <b>strengths</b> of the same density fabrics are increased with the underlap length of the fabric. 	(3) The absorbability of warp knitted fabrics made of same material is determined by the porosity of yarn itself and the inclined porosity between each crossing yarn in unit areas of the fabrics. In case of fabrics knitted with same density, both the total amount of water absorbed (a) and the rate of absorption of water (b) are increased with the increase of the density of the fabric. 	(4) Among same density fabrics, the values of (a) and (b) of the fabric are increased as the underlap length is increased, the increase being especially great in the value of (b) in course direction. 	(5) The value of (b) is usually greater in course direction than in wale direction...|$|R
