5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E

50|$|The Central Coast section {{offers many}} bird species of its own. The Matagorda Bay area {{contains}} American oystercatchers, Hudsonian godwits, and white-rumped sandpipers. The Corpus Christi area features groove-billed anis, olive sparrows, long-billed thrashers, Couch's kingbird, <b>black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> and black-crowned night herons.|$|R
50|$|Toups {{founded the}} Mississippi Coast Audubon Society and {{advanced}} its conservation causes, including the high-profile protection program for terns and <b>black</b> <b>skimmers.</b> She taught Seashore Methodist Assembly elder-hostels and sent fledgling birders out across Coast terrain {{in search of}} native and visiting birds.|$|R
50|$|This 98 acre natural {{preserve}} is undeveloped and undisturbed {{sand dunes}} {{that serves as}} a protected nesting site for the endangered piping plover, the least tern and <b>black</b> <b>skimmers.</b> Other shorebirds and waterfowl, such as the American oystercatcher, various species of sandpipers, gulls, herons, sanderlings and ducks also stop during the year. Pets are not permitted in the area during the nesting season.|$|R

5000|$|Sea turtles and shore birds such as {{the snowy}} plover, least tern, <b>black</b> <b>skimmer</b> and willet nest in the park during the summer.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{wildlife}} {{of the park}} are West Indian manatee, gopher tortoise, bald eagle, osprey, least tern, royal tern, Sandwich tern, and <b>black</b> <b>skimmer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Shorebirds {{including}} <b>black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> gulls, terns, {{and brown}} pelicans {{are among the}} birds which rest on the island, nest, or feed offshore. Neotropical birds, such as warblers and cedar waxwings, live in the tropics and travel to North America to breed, stopping over to feed and rest at Perdido Key. Monarch butterflies migrating to and from South America stop here, finding refuge on the sea oats growing in the dunes of Perdido Key.|$|R
50|$|CWF assists {{with the}} {{recovery}} of beach nesting bird species including piping plovers, least terns, <b>black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> American oystercatchers and red knotss. Beach management plans are implemented to decrease negative impacts on these birds. During the summer months, CWF biologists and volunteers {{keep track of the}} number of nesting birds and fence nesting areas to keep predators away. CWF biologists also collect data and band the shorebirds to track populations, predict their reproductive success and predict future threats against these birds.|$|R
5000|$|Sinepuxent Bay WMA {{serves as}} {{breeding}} habitat for birds which nest together in large colonies. Royal terns and <b>black</b> <b>skimmers</b> {{are among the}} [...] "colonial nesting" [...] shorebirds on the islands. Ducks and herons nest on islands with grasses or small trees. Since 1987, one of these islands is home for a colony of nesting brown pelicans. In the fall, hunters will find ducks, snow geese, Atlantic brant and Canada geese. Fishing is excellent for flounder, sea trout, croaker, spot, and bluefish.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>skimmer</b> (Rynchops niger): Black skimmers are {{specialized}} hunters {{due to the}} {{way they}} use their beaks. Both portions of the beak are partly colored black, but the lower mandible of the <b>black</b> <b>skimmer</b> is longer than the upper mandible and is used to skim {{across the surface of the}} water, thereby scooping up any unsuspecting fish. This species of bird is currently marked as a threatened species. They typically breed in colonies on beaches and lay approximately three to five eggs.|$|E

50|$|In summer, birds which nest on {{the refuge}} include 10 species of herons and egrets, white ibis, roseate spoonbill, mottled duck, white-tailed kite, clapper rail, horned lark, seaside sparrow, <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> and scissor-tailed flycatcher.|$|E
5000|$|The {{common tern}} breeds in colonies {{which do not}} {{normally}} exceed 2,000 pairs, but may occasionally number more than 20,000 pairs. Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast. Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species, such as Arctic, roseate and Sandwich terns, black-headed gulls, and <b>black</b> <b>skimmers.</b> Especially {{in the early part}} of the breeding season, for no known reason, most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea. This phenomenon is called a [...] "dread".|$|R
50|$|At {{least seven}} species of water birds {{are known to}} breed on Montague Island. The island {{is one of two}} known active {{breeding}} colonies of elegant tern in Mexico. During two years, a large number of nests were destroyed by tidal flooding, but there were only low levels of nests lost to predation. The birds nesting on Montague Island have reacted strongly to El Niño, with brown boobies being replaced by blue-footed boobies, and an increase in nesting of least, elegant, and royal terns, as well as <b>black</b> <b>skimmers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cantão State Park {{includes}} 24 sandy islands on the Araguaia river, {{as well as}} a {{large number}} of river sand beaches on bends of the channels that weave through the interior of the park. The sand itself is the primary habitat for a number of species. <b>Black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> yellow-billed terns, yellow-spotted river turtles, the enormous Amazon river turtle, and other species nest directly on the sand in great numbers. Their eggs attract nest predators like the southern caracara, the tayra, and even the jaguar, which also takes adult turtles at night when they climb up onto the beach to nest.|$|R
5000|$|Gulls, terns, allies - Arctic tern, black tern, <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> Bonaparte's gull, California gull, Caspian tern, common tern, elegant tern, Forster's tern, glacour gull, glaucous-winged gull, herring gull, mew gull, red-billed gull, Thayer's gull, {{western gull}} ...|$|E

50|$|The Audubon Society {{priority}} species are the American Oystercatcher, <b>Black</b> <b>Skimmer,</b> Brown Pelican, Clapper Rail, Least Tern, Little Blue Heron, Mottled Duck, Piping Plover, Reddish Egret, Red Knot, Ruddy Turnstone, Sanderling, Seaside Sparrow, Short-billed Dowitcher, Snowy Plover, Western Sandpiper, and Wilson's Plover.|$|E
500|$|The largest body {{of water}} within the park is Florida Bay, which extends from the {{mangrove}} swamps of the mainland's southern tip to the Florida Keys. Over [...] of marine ecosystem lies in this range. Coral, sponges, and seagrasses serve as shelter and food for crustaceans and mollusks, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. [...] Sharks, stingrays, and barracudas also live in this ecosystem, as do larger species of fish that attract sport fishing. Pelicans, shorebirds, terns, and <b>black</b> <b>skimmers</b> (Rynchops niger) are among the birds frequenting park shorelines. The bay also has its own resident population of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).|$|R
50|$|For {{a number}} of years, there has been only one islet at this location. This islet is {{composed}} almost entirely of shell fragments. It is extremely dynamic and builds or recedes with passing storms. Vegetation is almost entirely lacking. Birds known to nest here include royal terns, sandwich terns, <b>black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> and laughing gulls. In addition, the islet is used at various times as a loafing area by white pelicans, brown pelicans, and various other species of terns and gulls. Recent hurricanes and storms have eroded the island {{to such an extent}} that no nesting has occurred since 1992. Public access to the refuge is restricted due to its remoteness.|$|R
50|$|The refuge is an {{important}} resting and feeding area for migratory birds including gulls, terns, neotropical migratory songbirds, and shorebirds. Least terns, <b>black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> Wilson's plovers, and several other shorebird species have nested on the spoil deposits on Tybee. During all seasons, the refuge's shoreline and open spoil deposits are used as resting sites for brown pelicans, gulls, and terns. Endangered species, including piping plovers and wood storks, have been observed on the refuge land, while shortnose sturgeon and manatees {{have been found in}} the waters bordering Tybee. With the use of telescopes, birdwatchers observe the refuge birdlife from levees located across the river within Fort Pulaski National Monument.|$|R
50|$|Cape Henlopen State Park {{is home to}} a {{vast array}} of wildlife, notably several species of shorebird. The <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> least tern, and piping plover are all {{endangered}} species that are abundant within the park. Horseshoe crabs are also very common, especially in the Delaware Bay.|$|E
50|$|Migratory {{bird species}} include American purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus), solitary sandpiper (Tringa solitaria), yellow-billed tern (Sternula superciliaris), <b>black</b> <b>skimmer</b> (Rynchops niger), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), Swainson's flycatcher (Myiarchus swainsoni), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), {{tropical}} kingbird, fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), {{southern rough-winged swallow}} (Stelgidopteryx ruficollis), grey-breasted martin (Progne chalybea) and sand martin (Riparia riparia).|$|E
50|$|The Lake is undredged and shallow. It is {{surrounded}} by mangrove and salt marsh wetlands. At low tide, the exposed area is a feeding ground for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds and wading birds. Avian residents include the American avocet, black-necked stilt, <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> white pelican, Northern shoveler, canvasback, green wing teal, ruddy duck and glossy ibis.|$|E
50|$|The largest body {{of water}} within the park is Florida Bay, which extends from the {{mangrove}} swamps of the mainland's southern tip to the Florida Keys. Over 800 sq mi of marine ecosystem lies in this range. Coral, sponges, and seagrasses serve as shelter and food for crustaceans and mollusks, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. Sharks, stingrays, and barracudas also live in this ecosystem, as do larger species of fish that attract sport fishing. Pelicans, shorebirds, terns, and <b>black</b> <b>skimmers</b> (Rynchops niger) are among the birds frequenting park shorelines. The bay also has its own resident population of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).|$|R
50|$|The {{local chapter}} of the National Audubon Society has {{recorded}} the presence of 104 different species of birds on Figure Eight. Most live in Rich Inlet, generally considered the southernmost nesting area for the critically endangered Great Lakes piping plover. In 2015, approximately 800 Least Tern nested on northern section of the island, making it the largest Least Tern colony in the state, and one of the largest on the Eastern seaboard. Other birds that nested there include American Oystercatchers, Common Terns, <b>Black</b> <b>Skimmers,</b> Piping Plovers, Wilson’s Plovers and Willets. Savannah Sparrows, Atlantic Plovers, Greater Yellowlegs, and pelicans have been found in Mason Inlet to the south.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> marsh <b>skimmer,</b> or blue ground skimmer, (Indothemis carnatica) is {{a species}} of {{dragonfly}} in the family Libellulidae. It is found in many India, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The species breeds in small, heavily weeded ponds and lakes.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{varieties}} of birds {{along the length}} of the system include ducks, geese, and seagulls with many other species found in particular locations. The endangered whooping cranes that winter in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge are among the most famous. The <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> adopted as a symbol of the trail system, can be found throughout almost the entire coastline.|$|E
50|$|Species seen: bananaquit, palm tanager, blue-gray tanager, spectacled thrush, ruddy ground dove, yellow oriole, least grebe, {{southern}} lapwing, white-winged swallow, pied water-tyrant, golden-headed manakin, bay-headed tanager, white-bearded manakin, laughing gull, royal tern, large-billed tern, cattle egret, <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> common potoo, scarlet ibis, white-necked jacobin, tufted coquette, oilbird, red-legged honeycreeper, tropical kingbird, red-crowned woodpecker, rufous-vented chachalaca and red-billed tropicbird.|$|E
50|$|Breezy Point Tip, to {{the west}} of the community, is part of Gateway National Recreation Area, which is run by the National Park Service. This isolated, 200 acre area {{includes}} an ocean-facing beach, a shoreline on Jamaica Bay, sand dunes, and marshland. It is a breeding spot for the piping plover, least tern, <b>black</b> <b>skimmer,</b> American oystercatcher and common tern.|$|E
50|$|Winter {{residents}} on {{the refuge}} include black ducks, pintail, mergansers, long-tailed ducks, scoters, bufflehead, Canada geese, and tundra swans. During spring and summer, the salt marsh grasses, abundant insects, and underwater vegetation attract black ducks, mallards, gadwall, and green-winged teal to nest on the refuge. Gulls, terns, <b>black</b> <b>skimmers,</b> oystercatchers, and willets nest and feed along the marsh grasses, mudflats, and sand bars. The wooded ridges provide nest sites for several water birds. Ten different species, including herons, egrets, and glossy ibis {{have been seen}} in rookeries on the refuge. Rookeries are groups or colonies of birds that nest together. Martin NWR supports the largest colony of brown pelicans in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay.|$|R
40|$|Rising {{sea levels}} in the mid-Atlantic region pose a {{long-term}} threat to marshes and their avian inhabitants. Gull-billed Terns (Sterna nilotica), Common Terns (S. hirundo), <b>Black</b> <b>Skimmers</b> (Rynchops niger), and American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) nest on low, shell edges of salt marsh islands in coastal Virginia. Marsh shellpiles are free of mammalian predators, but subject to frequent floods that reduce reproductive success. Previous studies of these species suggested that elevation was an important nest-site determinant (Lauro and Burger 1989). To test this, we created twenty-eight 4 m 2 elevated shell plots, with matched controls, at 5 shellpile sites to examine habitat selection. We monitored nest-site choice and fate of each species from May 1 to August 1, 2002. Forty-seven percent of early season nests were destroyed during a flood on June 7. Only 4 % of late season nests were lost to floods. Only 5 % of pairs of all species nested in elevated plots, although the plots were immune from flooding. Common Tern nests were significantly lower in elevation than random points at 3 shellpiles and were often on low-lying areas exposed to open water. Common Terns had higher hatching success at higher elevations, and in the late season. Gull-billed Terns, <b>Black</b> <b>Skimmers,</b> and American Oystercatchers primarily chose sites at higher elevations in areas protected from flooding; however 56 % of Gull-billed Tern nests were flooded at one site. Flooding has {{a significant impact on}} waterbird breeding success on low-lying shellpiles and is likely to increase with rising sea levels; however, our experiment met with limited success in improving breeding success. We suspect previous experience at sites may bias nest-site choices...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to obtain}} moult data from wild birds {{have not changed}} much {{over the last century}} and most studies still depend on {{checking}} museum specimens or capturing birds. Here we assess the applicability of systematic field photography for detecting and scoring moult in adult <b>Black</b> <b>Skimmers</b> Rynchops niger from southern Brazil. Moult data extracted from photographs have a high within- (RGLMM = 0. 98) and between- (RGLMM = 0. 97) observer repeatability and show very good fit to current Underhill-Zucchini moult models (R² = 0. 75). Photography offers the advantages of being less invasive, requiring less equipment and human effort, being feasible in areas where captures may not be possible, and causing less disturbance so enhancing the number of sampled individuals...|$|R
