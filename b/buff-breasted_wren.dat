50|$|The <b>buff-breasted</b> <b>wren</b> (Cantorchilus leucotis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Troglodytidae, the wrens.It {{is found in the}} Amazon Basin of {{northern}} Brazil and Amazonian Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and northern-border Bolivia; also the Guianan countries Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana. It occurs in non-Amazonian regions of Venezuela and Colombia and its range extends into eastern Panama.|$|E
50|$|The {{core range}} of the <b>buff-breasted</b> <b>wren</b> is {{northern}} and central South America, especially the Amazon Basin; the range does cover most of Venezuela, and northern Colombia extending into eastern Panama. In the west at the Andes and southwards through Amazonian eastern Peru, it only enters the extreme northwest border regions of Bolivia. The range covers the Guianas and the Amazon River outlet island: Marajo Island, Ilha de Marajo.|$|E
40|$|Testosterone {{promotes}} {{aggressive behaviour}} in male vertebrates during the breeding season, but {{the importance of}} testosterone in female aggression remains unclear. Testosterone has both beneficial and detrimental effects on behaviour and physiology, prompting the hypothesis that selection favours an association between aggression and testosterone only in certain contexts in which intense or persistent aggression may be beneficial. We tested this hypothesis in a year-round territorial female <b>buff-breasted</b> <b>wrens</b> (Thryothorus leucotis), by exposing free-living females to experimental intrusions in different social (either single female or male, or paired decoys) and seasonal (pre-breeding or breeding) contexts. Females responded more aggressively to intrusions by females and pairs than to males. However, female intrusions elicited stronger responses during pre-breeding, whereas responses to pair intrusions were more intense during breeding. Territorial females had elevated testosterone levels after female intrusions and intermediate levels after pair intrusions during pre-breeding, but the levels of testosterone remained low after these intrusions during breeding. These results demonstrate seasonal differences in circulating testosterone following territorial aggression in female <b>buff-breasted</b> <b>wrens</b> and are suggestive of differences according to social context as well. Context-dependent elevation of testosterone implies that selection acts directly on female vertebrates to shape patterns of testosterone secretion...|$|R
