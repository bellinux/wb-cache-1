40|$|ABSTRACT: Small {{and medium}} sized {{enterprises}} (SME’s) play important role in to enhance economy of any country, in Mongolia {{it is not only}} help to develop economy of the country but as same time it is source to create new jobs for unemployed. As larger firms downsize and outsource more functions, the weight of SMEs in the economy is increasing. In Mongolia, most potential business sector completely rely on marketing for its growth and ventures. This is evident of majority of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> in other <b>sectors,</b> falling out of business a few seasons after its inceptions. Among all business sectors food processing and manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and textile industries are highly growing business in Mongolia.

These techniques were briefly analyzed in Mongolia. According to the findings that small firms need to upgrade their management skills, their capacity to gather information and their technology base. Along with governments need to improve SME access to financing, information infrastructures and international markets. Providing regulatory, legal and financial frameworks conducive to entrepreneurship and small firm start-up and growth is a priority...|$|R

All EU members contribute to the budget for each seven-year framework programme for research and innovation, the most recent of these being Horizon 2020, adopted in 2014. British researchers receive EU funding through programmes like Horizon 2020.

Secondly, eight social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> from only the water sectors were studied carefully and key variables were identified (Appendix 1); then the variables were set into the social business format checklist from social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for the water sector (Table  3).
