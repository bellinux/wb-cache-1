5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have <b>been</b> <b>excluded.</b> David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E

An additional seven patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because the time period between T 0 and T 1 was greater than 12 months, and finally, three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because other molar distalizing mechanics were used. Gender differences were not considered a factor because treatment was performed in non-growing patients.|$|R
5|$|Kawan Bergeloet {{contains}} twelve {{short stories}} or sketches written by Soeman, seven {{of which had}} initially been written for and published in Pandji Poestaka. The remaining stories were written especially for the new collection. The first edition included an article on Soeman, written by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, which had previously {{been published in the}} January 1936 issue of Pedoman Pembatja. This has <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> from some later reissues.|$|E
5|$|Perdiccas {{initially}} did {{not claim}} power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, {{under the command}} of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court would {{eventually}} reverse criminal convictions {{due to the}} exclusion of women from the jury pool in Taylor v. Louisiana (1975) and Duren v. Missouri (1979).

5|$|The {{alternating}} {{succession of}} {{the northern and southern}} Uí Néill to the kingship of Tara would finally break down in time of Brian Boru. It was already under strain before Flann Sinna's lifetime. Two branches of the Uí Néill—the northern Cenél Conaill and the southern Síl nÁedo Sláine— had already <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> from the succession by the Cenél nEógain and Clann Cholmáin. Many other branches of the Uí Néill had never shared in the kingship.|$|E

After the tide had <b>been</b> <b>excluded,</b> pits and borings were made to determine {{the nature of the}} bottom. A much narrower dock had been planned, but it was decided to move the south wall further south. A mole was added running along the middle of the dock, which increased the length of the quays.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E

Three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of difficulty with insertion and suspected rupture of the parenchymal balloon. There was no intraparenchymal waveform or ICP reading, and comparison to ventricular ICP was not possible. Three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of unavailability of the investigator for study enrollment or data collection. Two patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of death within four hours of device insertion and inability of investigator to collect data. As a result, 35 patients were successfully enrolled.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of the game, a group of former Team Bondi {{employees}} launched a website called lanoirecredits.com, containing over 100 names which had <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> or incorrectly listed in the official game credits. This was later followed by a series of claims and counter-claims about working hours and company managerial style during the game's development. Anonymous members of the development team publicly discussed the managerial style of the studio, the studio's staff turnover rates and the working hours and conditions associated with L.A. Noire.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> {{from the}} UN {{and since then}} has always been {{rejected}} in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} {{estimated}} to have 10 times the mass and two to four times the diameter of Earth.

An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 allowed for a Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A similar study in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in the outer Solar System and ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E
30|$|Different length {{classes of}} juveniles (71 – 110  mm TL) of Alepes kleinii <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> through JFE-SSD at rates between 52 and 80 %, during the field trials.

Juveniles of Otolithes ruber in the length range of 51 – 170  mm TL showed exclusion rates of 40 - 68 %. Rastrelliger kanagurta above 161  mm TL were retained while length classes of juveniles below 160  mm TL <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> at levels of 77 - 90 %. Juveniles of Epinephelus diacanthus below 110  mm TL <b>were</b> <b>excluded,</b> while length classes between 111 and 160  mm TL <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> at levels from 46 to 75 %.

5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have <b>been</b> <b>excluded.</b> The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Charles's chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, Richard. However, the new Lord Protector had little {{experience}} of either military or civil administration. In 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled and Richard resigned. During the civil and military unrest that followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy. Monck and his army marched into the City of London and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament who had <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> in December 1648 during Pride's Purge. The Long Parliament dissolved itself {{and for the first}} time in almost 20 years, there was a general election. The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications so as to ensure, as they thought, the return of a Presbyterian majority.|$|E
50|$|This list is {{far from}} complete. Many {{countries}} <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from it because their Industry Associations lacked a searchable, online database. Belgium, Iceland and Mexico are some of them. Some European countries who do have it (Greece, Hungary and Spain) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> anyway, because their databases showed no relevant sales pertaining industrial rock and metal groups. Latin American countries with online databases (Argentina and Brazil) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> over the same principle.|$|R
30|$|Reports {{dealing with}} {{patients}} suffering from craniofacial syndromes or developmental disorders <b>were</b> <b>excluded.</b> Those including only primary dentition <b>were</b> as well <b>excluded.</b> The reports taking {{the rates of}} third molar missing cases (without presenting any information to filter third molars out) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> (V Rakhshan, unpublished work).|$|R

5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} <b>been</b> <b>excluded,</b> and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared {{that he did not}} wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to be the ones to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having <b>been</b> <b>excluded</b> from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E

However, economic evaluations and quality-of-life (QoL) were not considered. Single gemcitabine trials <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from our study. Additionally, data of interim analyses <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> only when we retrieved the complete results from the same study. When we were uncertain of the eligibility of a trial, we discussed its eligibility until a decision was reached.|$|R
