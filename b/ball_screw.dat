2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{and availability of}} production machines is strongly affected by the operating characteristics of the installed <b>ball</b> <b>screws.</b> In this context, the value of preloading is an important property greatly influencing {{the quality of the}} feed motion as well as the expected service life. Dynamic applications often require <b>ball</b> <b>screws</b> with high preloading values.

40|$|AbstractBall screws are {{the most}} common {{elements}} in machine tools for transferring rotational into linear movements. Within an electromechanical machine tool axis, <b>ball</b> <b>screws</b> belong to the decisive components for achieving small positioning errors. Due to wear, the preload of <b>ball</b> <b>screws</b> decreases. This often leads to vibrations in the electromechanical power train and influences the machining results negatively. This results in the need of preload compensation systems, which ensure the required machine accuracy. In this article, an adaptronic approach with piezoelectric self-sensing transducers for an active compensation system of preload control in <b>ball</b> <b>screws</b> is presented and common results of the developed self-sensing actuator are discussed...|$|R

50|$|A pivot saw has {{the highest}} degree of stiffness, because the forces are {{arranged}} in a closed loop (fig.1). If {{we assume that the}} base of such a saw is very rigid, the force will flow from the pivot of the gearbox to the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> feed system in a closed loop, whereby the cutting force engages in the middle, approximately, between rotation point and <b>ball</b> <b>screw.</b> This arrangement substantially reduces the lost motion and compliance in the feed system. Furthermore, the <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> drive which forces the blade into the cut is bolted to the fixture frame which again is clamped to the billet and gives this arrangement additional rigidity.|$|E
