25|$|In the mid 30s tastes {{changed and}} heavily {{modelled}} ware came into vogue. The My Garden series issued from 1934 onwards led the way, with small flowers modelled as a handle or base on more rounded shapes. These were fully painted in bright colours – {{the body of}} the ware was covered in thin colour washes – 'Verdant' was green, 'Sunrise' yellow and so on. The range included vases, bowls, jugs, a <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrel,</b> and proved very popular as gift ware. It was produced in more muted colours, right until {{the start of the war}} in 1939.|$|E

50|$|Cookie jars are {{utilitarian}} or decorative ceramic {{or glass}} jars {{often found in}} American and Canadian kitchens. In the United Kingdom, they are known as <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrels</b> or <b>biscuit</b> jars. If they are cans made out of tinplate, they are called biscuit tins. While used to store actual cookies or biscuits, they are sometimes employed to store other edible items like candy or dog treats, or non-edible items like currency (in {{the manner of a}} piggy bank).|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the trains}} were less gay, {{but were not}} less {{significant}} of war. Long lines of wagons, filled with cannon; open trucks with the deadly shell--arranged side by side, point upwards, and looking more like eggs in a basket than deadly missiles--came and went. There, too, were long trains of pontoons for forming bridges while, every half hour, long lines of wagons filled with <b>biscuits,</b> <b>barrels</b> of wine, sacks of coffee, and cases of stores of all sorts and kinds passed through.|$|R
50|$|Cookie jars, {{also known}} as <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrels</b> or jars, {{have been used in}} England since {{the latter part of the}} 18th century. They were often made of glass with metal lids. Cookie jars became popular in America around the time of the Great Depression in 1929. Early American cookie jars were made of glass with metal {{screw-on}} lids. In the 1930s, stoneware became predominant as the material for American cookie jars. Early cookie jars typically have simple cylindrical shapes and were often painted with floral or leaf decorations or emblazoned with colorful decals.|$|R
5000|$|Grant {{joined the}} Labour Party in 2004 and {{was asked by}} a senior local party figure to {{consider}} becoming a local councillor, but she rejected the idea. She offered the local party the use of her company's telephones in late 2004 prior to the 2005 general election. She claimed, however, they showed little interest, and that this left her feeling disillusioned with Labour. She joined the Conservatives in 2006, and later said of her membership of Labour: [...] "It was almost looking in the <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrel,</b> not liking {{the look of the}} biscuits, and slamming the lid shut".|$|E
40|$|All {{over the}} world {{hundreds}} of thousands of initiatives are being developed to generate sustainable energy. The great majority of these are aimed at solar and wind energy, if only because they are available all {{over the world}}. Whats more, the initial investments required are relatively low and are often helped by government support, so even private developments boast a surprising range of solar panels. Another source of sustainable energy is the motion of the sea. Technology to tap this source has also been developed in the Netherlands. In October 2004 the Archimedes Wave Swing generated its first electric power {{after more than a decade}} of research and development: power generated by a 420 tonne underwater <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrel</b> resonating up and down to the frequency of the oceans swell off the Portuguese shore...|$|E

25|$|Between 1929 and 1935 Cliff {{issued a}} mass of shape ranges, {{including}} Conical, Bon Jour/Biarritz, Stamford, Eton, Daffodil, and Trieste. In each of these there were tea and coffee ware shapes, but the first two were so popular that <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrels,</b> sugar sifters, bowls and vases were issued to enlarge the range. Bon Jour had 20 shapes created during 1933, with about 10 more being added in 1934. There were also many other innovatively shaped vases, bowls and 'fancies', such as the Liner vase, Flower tube vase and the (now rare) Lido Lady ashtray and Age of Jazz musicians and dancers.|$|R
50|$|Marks and Spencer has {{developed}} Percy Pig into a brand {{in its own}} right. New Percy-themed lines have included Percy Pig socks, ties, toy cars, <b>biscuit</b> <b>barrels,</b> Advent calendars, bed linen, cushions, pencil cases, birthday cake candles and children's books. Recently, a Percy Pig piggy bank {{was added to the}} line, with a festive hat for the Christmas period. Also available is a Percy Pig mug which emits a piggy sound when lifted. Percy Pig piggy banks also come in limited edition ranges which vary from time to time. Penny Pig was relaunched in the UK and Ireland in the festive season of 2010-2011.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot I say is one thing; wot {{you say is}} another--so it is. I dun know w'ich is right, or w'ich is wrong--no more do you. P'raps you is, p'raps I is; anywise we can't both on us {{be right}} or both on us be wrong--that's a comfort, if it's nothin' else. Wot you say is--that it's morally imposs'ble for a crew sich as us to travel over two {{thousand}} miles of ocean on three casks o' <b>biscuit</b> and a <b>barrel</b> o' salt junk. Wot I say is--that we can, an', moreover, that morals has nothin' {{to do with it}} wotsomediver. Now, wot then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless he smiled. [...] "Ye don't seem to {{have got}} through coming down yet," [...] he continued, as a few small boulders, {{loosened}} in their rapid descent, came more deliberately rolling and plunging after the travelers along the gravelly bottom. Then he turned away with the horses, and, after they were watered, he reentered the house. His guests had evidently not waited for his ministration. They had already taken one or two bottles from the shelves behind a wide bar and helped themselves, and, glasses in hand, were now satisfying the more imminent cravings of hunger with <b>biscuits</b> from a <b>barrel</b> and slices of smoked herring from a box. Their equally singular host, accepting their conduct as not unusual, joined the circle they had comfortably drawn round the fireplace, and meditatively kicking a brand back at the fire, said, without looking at them:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{thermometer}} is at nineteen Fahrenheit to-day. There is {{but little}} wind, and {{what there is}} comes from an unfavourable quarter. Captain is in an excellent humour; I think he imagines he has seen some other omen or vision, poor fellow, during the night, for he came into my room early in the morning, and stooping down over my bunk, whispered, [...] "It wasn't a delusion, Doc; it's all right!" [...] After breakfast {{he asked me to}} find out how much food was left, which the second mate and I proceeded to do. It is even less than we had expected. Forward they have half a tank full of <b>biscuits,</b> three <b>barrels</b> of salt meat, and a very limited supply of coffee beans and sugar. In the after-hold and lockers there are a good many luxuries, such as tinned salmon, soups, haricot mutton, &c., but they will go a very short way among a crew of fifty men. There are two barrels of flour in the store-room, and an unlimited supply of tobacco. Altogether there is about enough to keep the men on half rations for eighteen or twenty days--certainly not more. When we reported the state of things to the Captain, he ordered all hands to be piped, and addressed them from the quarterdeck. I never saw him to better advantage. With his tall, well-knit figure, and dark animated face, he seemed a man born to command, and he discussed the situation in a cool sailor-like way which showed that while appreciating the danger he had an eye for every loophole of escape.|$|R
