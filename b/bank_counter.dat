60|$|From the hush {{of these}} places, it is congenial to {{pass into the}} hushed resorts of business. Down the lanes I {{like to see the}} carts and waggons huddled {{together}} in repose, the cranes idle, and the warehouses shut. Pausing in the alleys behind the closed Banks of mighty Lombard-street, it gives one as good as a rich feeling to think of the broad counters with a rim along the edge, made for telling money out on, the scales for weighing precious metals, the ponderous ledgers, and, above all, the bright copper shovels for shovelling gold. When I draw money, it never seems so much money as when it is shovelled at me out of a bright copper shovel. I like to say, 'In gold,' and to see seven pounds musically pouring out of the shovel, like seventy; the Bank appearing to remark to me--I italicise APPEARING--'if you want more of this yellow earth, we keep it in barrows at your service.' To think of the banker's clerk with his deft finger turning the crisp edges of the Hundred- Pound Notes he has taken in a fat roll out of a drawer, is again to hear the rustling of that delicious south-cash wind. 'How will you have it?' I once heard this usual question asked at a <b>Bank</b> <b>Counter</b> of an elderly female, habited in mourning and steeped in simplicity, who answered, open-eyed, crook-fingered, laughing with expectation, 'Anyhow!' Calling these things to mind as I stroll among the Banks, I wonder whether the other solitary Sunday man I pass, has designs upon the Banks. For the interest and mystery of the matter, I almost hope he may have, and that his confederate may be at this moment taking impressions of the keys of the iron closets in wax, and that a delightful robbery may be in course of transaction. About College-hill, Mark-lane, and so on towards the Tower, and Dockward, the deserted wine-merchants' cellars are fine subjects for consideration; but the deserted money-cellars of the Bankers, and their plate-cellars, and their jewel-cellars, what subterranean regions of the Wonderful Lamp are these! And again: possibly some shoeless boy in rags, passed through this street yesterday, for whom it is reserved to be a Banker in the fulness of time, and to be surpassing rich. Such reverses have been, since the days of Whittington; and were, long before. I want to know whether the boy has any foreglittering of that glittering fortune now, when he treads these stones, hungry. Much as I also want to know whether the next man to be hanged at Newgate yonder, had any suspicion upon him that he was moving steadily towards that fate, when he talked so much about the last man who paid the same great debt at the same small Debtors' Door.|$|E

When {{returning}} with the cash bags, one of the men attempts to jump over the <b>bank</b> <b>counter,</b> but fails and lands unconscious on the bank floor. He is dragged by Jimmy into the car, and comes round just as the police begin shooting and returns fire. The getaway driver is killed by the police but the robbery is on the whole successful. Jimmy gets the money he needs, escaping in a stolen Toyota Celica with his remaining accomplice. Ironically, the stolen auto's radio station bumper sticker is spotted by that station's competition team, who give chase attempting to award Jimmy a $10,000 prize.

50|$|A set of {{concrete}} steps with bullnose edges, {{leading to a}} short verandah along the front wall of the building, form {{the entrance to the}} lower level. The verandah has square posts and a two-rail dowel balustrade. An external flight of stairs to the upper level joins the verandah at the far end. The entrance on this level is a low waisted four-panel timber French door, with a three-pane rectangular fanlight (two panes of clear glass and one painted) and flat arch. The door and windows on this level are surrounded by a false quoin effect created by brickwork proud of the main wall face. Timber elements appear to have been painted red. External walls are constructed in brick with quoins on each corner. The lower floor has double hung timber sash windows with horns and flat arch. Timbers used to support the balcony rest on corbels between the windows and are painted white. A white-painted awning, made from timber palings finished to form a decorative edge, hangs from the balcony and covers windows on two sides of the building. The rear wall of the ground floor is built into the slope behind. This level consists of 3 rooms, two smaller ones that open onto the main room that runs the length of one side of the building. The main room contained the cedar <b>bank</b> <b>counter,</b> which divided the room into two halves. There is no internal access from this level to the floor above. The original unpainted and un-rendered external brick and stonework is retained. Square blocks of stone have been used in part of the rear wall on the lower level and the verandah. One of the side walls on the lower level also uses blocks of stone and has been painted white.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between individuals’ levels of willingness to communicate and their preferences for making transactions online. Two different types of online transactions are being studied here, i. e. online shopping and online banking. Using theories relevant to this study, hypotheses are developed around the variables being studied. The hypotheses propose that: (1) there are significant differences in levels of willingness to communicate for people with different preferences between shopping online and in a retail store; (2) there are significant differences in levels of willingness to communicate for people with different preferences between paying bills online and at a <b>bank</b> <b>counter.</b> A structured questionnaire survey was conducted on approximately 200 university students in Ronneby, Sweden. Results from statistical test show that there are no significant differences in levels of willingness to communicate for people with different preferences between paying bills online and at a <b>bank</b> <b>counter.</b> However, statistical test shows that there are significant differences in levels of willingness to communicate for people with different preferences between shopping online and in a retail store. It is also observed that individuals with a stronger preference (either towards online shopping or “offline” shopping) tend to have a higher level of willingness to communicate than those who have a weaker preference or are neutral between online and “offline” shopping.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a generalization of discrete Mittag-Leffler distributions. We introduce {{and study the}} properties of a new distribution called geometric generalized discrete Mittag-Leffler distribution. Autoregressive processes with geometric generalized discrete Mittag-Leffler distributions are developed and studied. The distributions are further extended to develop a more general class of geometric generalized discrete semi-Mittag-Leffler distributions. The processes are extended to higher orders also. An application with respect to an empirical data on customer arrivals in a <b>bank</b> <b>counter</b> is also given. Various areas of potential applications like human resource development, insect growth, epidemic modeling, industrial risk modeling, insurance and actuaries, town planning etc are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{generalized}} counting {{process with}} Mittag-Leffler inter-arrival time distribution is introduced. This new {{model is a}} generalization of the Poisson process. The computational intractability is overcome by deriving the Mittag-Leffler count model using polynomial expansion. The hazard function of this new model is a decreasing function of time, so that the distribution displays negative duration dependence. The model is applied to a data on interarrival times of customers in a <b>bank</b> <b>counter.</b> This new count model can be simulated by Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, using Metropolis- Hastings algorithm. Our new model has many nice features such as its closed form nature, computational simplicity, ability to nest Poisson, existence of moments and autocorrelation {{and can be used}} for both equi-dispersed and over-dispersed data...|$|E
30|$|This {{system was}} {{successful}} {{in the sense that}} it provided banknotes with stable purchasing power while (almost) avoiding financial turbulence and bank failures (Weber, 1988 and 1992). 3 The issue of banknotes involved considerable costs: production (printing) costs, personnel costs of <b>bank</b> <b>counter</b> service and, particularly important, the costs of the metal reserves necessary for reasons of confidence and trust, and the costs of banknote clearing. Note clearing was a central element of concern: the demand for banknotes was dependent on their acceptance at full value which led the formation of clearing networks including entire groups of banks. For all these reasons, banks’ note issue business remained small and of limited importance throughout most of this period. Complaints about the complicated nature and the inefficiency of the payments’ system remained frequent. Several authors, e.g., Jöhr (1915) or Ritzmann (1973), stressed this state of dissatisfaction and the inefficiencies causing it and thus came, in contrast to Weber, to a negative assessment of note issue competition in this period. The Federal Banknote Act of 1881, introducing common standards of quality in banknote issue, was the result of these perceived inefficiencies.|$|E
