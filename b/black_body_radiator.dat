40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that it}} is possible to construct a coordinate system in the space of illumination spectra such that the coordinate vectors of the illuminants are located in a cone. Changes in the space of illuminants can then be described by an intensity related scaling and a transformation in the Lorentz group SU(1, 1). In practice it is often difficult and expensive to measure these coordinate vectors. Therefore it is of interest to estimate the characteristics of an illuminant from an RGB image captured by a camera. In this paper we will investigate the relation between sequences of illuminants and statistics computed from RGB im-ages of scenes illuminated by these illuminants. As a typical example we will study sequences of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiators</b> of varying temperature. We have shown earlier that <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiators</b> in the mired parametrization can be de-scribed by one-parameter groups of the Lorentz group SU(1, 1).

We show this re-lation for mean vectors of RGB images, for RGB histograms and for histograms of images obtained by applying certain spatio-spectral linear filters to the RGB images.

40|$|The {{market share}} of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in the {{lighting}} world is growing quickly (4 % in 2013 to an expected 74 % in 2030), mainly due to the high energy efficiency compared with traditional lamps. However, the white light which is produced by LEDs {{does not have the}} same color temperature as is produced by (for example) incandescent lamps which are perfect <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiators.</b> Blue light from the LED propagates through a slab of scattering material, where phosphor particles convert the light to different wavelengths, composing white light. To study the extremely complex scatter process inside this phosphor layer, a cloud of negatively charged dust particles being confined inside a plasma is used as a dynamic scatter sample. Due to this negative charge, dust particles are being confined by the electrostatic field in the plasma sheath at the border of the discharge. By changing the plasma parameters, particle cloud properties like density and configuration can be controlled carefully. Hence, utilization of a dusty plasma to study scattering of light has the advantage that properties of the sample can be changed I) in-situ and II) by just turning a knob. A sophisticated setup is designed and developed, allowing spectroscopic measurements at 360 ◦ around the dust cloud.

Turbulence in 3 He-B is created using a vibrating wire resonator and a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiator</b> is used to create a beam of quasi-particles which are retro-reflected off the turbulence. The properties of a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiator</b> are used to create a model to investigate the vortex line density. The vortex line density is shown to be dependent on the temperature of the bulk superfluid. The properties of two different substrates immersed in 3 He-B are studied. It has been found that when a proprietary material, Kapton, is subjected to a changing magnetic field, a large amount of heating and cooling is observed. When a different substrate, aerogel, is used the same effects are observed. We show that when aerogel that is immersed in 3 He-B is subjected to a changing magnetic field the surrounding helium cools from rv 200 JLK to rv 115 JLK. It is thought that the effects are caused by the solid helium that coats the strands. Several models have been developed to calculate the heat capacity and some interesting features have been observed. We identify the fact that aerogel in 3 He-B would make an excellent second cooling stage for many ultra low temperature experiments. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
