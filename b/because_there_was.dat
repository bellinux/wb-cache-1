5|$|One of {{the most}} famous cases of {{changing}} nationality for the Olympics was Zola Budd, a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa.

5|$|The group {{petitioned the}} United States Department of Veterans Affairs for a marker for Kealoha but the Department denied the request <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no {{next of kin}} to approve the request.

After the request's denial, Honor Life Memorials, a local monument maker, donated a granite marker for Kealoha.|$|E

5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E

However, this was rejected by the municipality, who owned Bislett, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not vacant capacity at Bislett.|$|E

5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was {{starved to death}} by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope around her neck.

A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of the occupation, the German {{administration}} pursued a conciliatory policy toward the Belgian people in order to gain their support and co-operation. This policy was, in part, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little resistance activity and because the demands the Germans needed to place on Belgian civilians and businesses were relatively small on account of their military success. During the fighting in Belgium, however, there were incidents of massacres against Belgian civilians by German forces, notably the Vinkt Massacre in which 86 civilians were killed.|$|E

5|$|Julia {{had started}} {{going out to}} dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast {{that she had been}} given the night before.

5|$|Street {{crime was}} {{prevalent}} in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station {{to deal with}} law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became significant problems. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> so much street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers {{killed in the war}} were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots.|$|E

5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers and won two awards at the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival. Reviewers praised the cooperative gameplay highly {{but said that}} the single-player was less fun <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> less to do. Many comparisons were made between Monaco and other media; the most common being the 1960 heist film Oceans 11.

5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence.

General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E
