5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first atomic <b>bombs.</b> <b>In</b> 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E

50|$|During the 1970s and 1980s the ANC {{leadership}} in exile under Oliver Tambo {{made the decision}} to target Apartheid government leadership, command and control, secret police, and military-industrial complex assets and personnel in decapitation strikes, targeted killings, and guerilla actions such as <b>bomb</b> explosions <b>in</b> facilities frequented by military and government personnel. A number of civilians were also killed in these attacks. Examples of these include the Amanzimtoti bombing, the Sterland <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> Pretoria, the Wimpy <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> Pretoria, the Juicy Lucy <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> Pretoria and the Magoo's bar <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Durban. ANC acts of sabotage aimed at government institutions included the bombing of the Johannesburg Magistrates Court, the attack on the Koeberg nuclear power station, the rocket attack on Voortrekkerhoogte in Pretoria, and the 1983 Church Street <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Pretoria, which killed 16 and wounded 130.|$|R
50|$|In {{the town}} of Tarmiyah, 50 km north of Baghdad, gunmen shot and killed a police officer. Another officer {{was killed by a}} sticky <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> Buhriz. A {{roadside}} <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Al Khalis killed a young child and injured 8 others. A car <b>bombing</b> <b>in</b> Muqdadiyah injured seven people.

5|$|On 21 January 1985, nine stupas {{were badly}} damaged by nine <b>bombs.</b> <b>In</b> 1991, a blind Muslim preacher, Husein Ali Al Habsyie, {{was sentenced to}} life {{imprisonment}} for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid-1980s, including the temple attack. Two other members of the Islamic extremist group that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to 20 years in 1986, and another man received a 13-year prison term.|$|E
5|$|Roma {{was damaged}} again by two <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> another raid on 2324 June. One hit the ship aft and to {{starboard}} {{of the rear}} main battery turret and obliterated several staterooms, which were promptly flooded from broken piping. The second landed atop the rear turret itself, but little damage was suffered due to the heavy armor in that location. This attack did not seriously damage Roma or cause any flooding, but she nevertheless sailed to Genoa for repairs. Roma reached the city on 1 July, and returned to La Spezia, on 13 August, once repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen <b>bombs.</b> <b>In</b> their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E

5|$|The Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF), an {{organisation}} of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), {{was formed}} in 1968 to support {{the overthrow of the}} governments of Singapore and Malaysia. The countries had been declared independent in 1965, but the communists rejected their separation. From 1968 to 1974, the armed struggle included planting booby trap <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> public places. The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine, explosives and assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the border area of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{testing of}} the new cores in the Operation Sandstone tests rendered every component of the old weapons obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, production of the old cores was halted, and all effort concentrated on the new Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. More efficient use of fissionable material {{as a result of}} Operation Sandstone would increase the U.S. nuclear stockpile from 56 <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> June 1948 to 169 in June 1949.|$|E
5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, {{the village was}} attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While {{on the way to}} hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that their}} next target is a water-filtration plant near Navy Pier, Fisher infiltrates the Engineers and {{prevents}} {{the release of}} a biological toxin into the water supply. Kobin then tells him that mercenary supplier Reza Nouri may be allied with the Engineers. Sam assaults Nouri's mansion, capturing him for questioning. When he learns about an Engineer sleeper cell in London, Fisher infiltrates an abandoned mill and discovers chemical <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> a shipping bay. Opening a bomb to plant a tracking device, he is exposed to nerve gas. Incapacitated and apparently dying, Fisher is captured by Sadiq and rescued by Briggs; in the ensuing confrontation, Sadiq escapes while Briggs provides first aid to Sam.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for North Vietnam and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> bad weather – the B-52. Without them, there was little that could be done over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was bombed}} twice during the Second World War, but {{remained}} mostly unharmed. One of the <b>bombs,</b> <b>in</b> around 1940, {{was reported to}} have killed a giraffe. Nevertheless, Edinburgh was, like all zoos in Britain, affected by the war. Since bombs could fall at any time, it was not considered safe to keep dangerous animals that might escape if their enclosures were damaged. In 1941 the recently born wolves had therefore to be euthanized, along with a collection of dangerous snakes, to guard against any possible danger to the public. Despite the war the zoo continued to grow, with land to the east being purchased in 1942 and construction of a lake beginning soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Mitchell first {{demonstrated}} {{to the world}} that battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy <b>bombs.</b> <b>In</b> one of his most famous demonstrations, Mitchell convinced the Navy to allow bomb loaded aircraft to attack the German dreadnought , a battleship taken as a prize of war by the United States in 1918. Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel to sink in a mere 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In early October, the NVA had {{intensified}} battalion-size ground probes {{and sustained}} artillery fire against Con Thien, a hilltop stronghold {{in the center}} of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Quang Tri Province. Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds. Westmoreland responded by launching Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> nearly 4,000 airstrikes.|$|E
