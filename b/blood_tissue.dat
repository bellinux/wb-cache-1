Prosecutors had [...] "presented proof that Littlejohn's <b>blood,</b> <b>tissue</b> and DNA were found on the plastic ties that were used to bind St. Guillen's hands." [...] The six men / six women jury took less than seven hours to convict Littlejohn of murdering Imette St. Guillen and found him guilty of first degree murder. One juror, Marian Mallero, said: [...] "The DNA said a lot about it. They gave us evidence and it was obvious"; and, [...] "He's guilty, that's all I'm going to say." [...] Another juror said, [...] "All the evidence pointed to the defendant," [...] despite the defense case that Littlejohn was railroaded.|$|E
60|$|Like all desert men, used to silence, Denton {{talked with}} difficulty, but {{the content of}} his speech made up for its brevity. He told us about the wanderers and prospectors he had rescued from death by {{starvation}} and thirst; he told us about the terrific noonday heat of summer; and about the incredible and horrible midnight furnace gales that swept down the valley. With the mercury at one hundred and twenty-five degrees at midnight, {{below the level of}} the sea, when these furnace blasts bore down upon him, it was just all he could do to live. No man could spend many summers there. As for white women--Death Valley was fatal to them. The Indians spent the summers up on the mountains. Denton said heat affected men differently. Those who were meat eaters or alcohol drinkers, could not survive. Perfect heart and lungs were necessary to stand the heat and density of atmosphere below sea level. He told {{of a man who had}} visited his cabin, and had left early in the day, vigorous and strong. A few hours later he was found near the oasis unable to walk, crawling on his hands and knees, dragging a full canteen of water. He never knew what ailed him. It might have been heat, for the thermometer registered one hundred and thirty-five, and it might have been poison gas. Another man, young, of heavy and powerful build, lost seventy pounds weight in less than two days, and was nearly dead when found. The heat of Death Valley quickly dried up <b>blood,</b> <b>tissue,</b> bone. Denton told of a prospector who started out at dawn strong and rational, to return at sunset so crazy that he had to be tied to keep him out of the water. To have drunk his fill then would have killed him! He had to be fed water by spoonful. Another wanderer came staggering into the oasis, blind, with horrible face, and black swollen tongue protruding. He could not make a sound. He also had to be roped, as if he were a mad steer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effect of <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow on the incidence of anastomotic leakage during esophagectomy. Methods: Reconstruction was done with a gastric tube, and all cases involved cervical anastomosis. <b>Tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow of 43 patients was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter before emplacement and after anastomosis during surgical intervention. The reconstruction route and <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow before emplacement and that after anastomosis were analyzed as possible factors influencing anastomotic leakage. Results: <b>Tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow after anastomosis with leakage was 9. 1 ± 2. 0 mL/min per 100 g, and that without leakage was 13. 7 ± 2. 9 mL/min per 100 g. <b>Tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow with leakage was significantly lower than that without leakage (P <. 01, unpaired t test). Twenty-one patients had <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow after anastomosis of greater than 13 mL/min per 100 g, {{and none of them}} had leakage, whereas 5 patients had blood flow of less than 10 mL/min per 100 g, and all 5 had leakage. Conclusion: <b>Tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow can be an important and useful indicator of the presence of current anastomotic leakage. Low <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow after anastomosis may mediate for appropriate surgical or pharmacologic interventions to detect, localize, and counteract leakage...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the factors regulating {{the increase in}} adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow following meals. DESIGN: Eight subjects were fed three isoenergetic meals; two high-fat meals rich in either saturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids and one low-fat, high-carbohydrate meal. MEASUREMENTS: Blood samples were taken and adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow was measured before and for 6 h after the meal. Plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified fatty acid, total and chylomicron-triacylglycerol and catecholamine concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow rose to a peak after all three meals (P< 0. 05 for each). The three meals stimulated adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow at similar times. There was a marked and statistically significant similarity in {{the time course of}} changes in blood flow and insulin concentrations. In contrast, noradrenaline concentrations peaked later than adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow (P= 0. 014). CONCLUSION: Adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>blood</b> flow may be 'carbohydrate-stimulated' rather than 'fat-stimulated', with insulin having a vasodilatory role in adipose tissue as in skeletal muscle...|$|R

40|$|During endotoxemia, blood {{coagulation}} becomes activated due to {{tissue factor}} (TF) expression on leukocytes and/or endothelial cells. We investigated {{the influence of}} <b>blood</b> cell-derived <b>tissue</b> factor on murine endotoxemia. Therefore, we generated mice that lack tissue factor on their blood cells by transplanting tissue factor-deficient hematopoietic stem cells into lethally irradiated wild-type recipients. Control mice were also irradiated but were injected with stem cells from wild-type littermate embryos. Seven weeks after transplantation, the mice received 250 mug of endotoxin intraperitoneally. Three hours later, the mice were bled and plasma and organs were collected to assess inflammation, coagulation, and apoptosis. Mice that lack tissue factor on their blood cells still reacted to endotoxemia, but markedly less than wild-type controls. <b>Blood</b> cell-derived <b>tissue</b> factor-deficient mice showed significantly less clinical symptoms than control mice. Levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes were lower in <b>blood</b> cell-derived <b>tissue</b> factor-deficient mice than in controls. Surprisingly, inflammation was seen more often in <b>blood</b> cell-derived <b>tissue</b> factor-deficient mice than in control mice, but signs of apoptosis were more pronounced in controls. In summary, our data clearly indicate that endotoxin-induced coagulation and inflammation are strongly influenced by <b>blood</b> cell-derived <b>tissue</b> factor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

5000|$|Because {{the eggs}} of T. vulpis eggs are very {{resistant}} from desiccation, {{they can live}} in soil for up to seven years.
