Bolts and cables can be used with various steel supports, such as I-shaped steel supports, yieldable steel arches, and enclosed steel supports. <b>Bolts</b> <b>or</b> cables can individually be combined with steel supports (Tian et al. 2011), bolts and cables can also be together used with steel supports.|$|R
