5|$|Several {{species of}} animals {{have proved to}} be able to acquire forms of {{communication}} through social learning: for instance a <b>bonobo</b> named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols, none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} know {{of patriarchal}} and matrifocal ancient societies, very little {{can be said}} about a society of a species, which is as remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and <b>bonobo</b> societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E

2500|$|Primatologist Frans de Waal states <b>bonobos</b> {{are capable}} of altruism, compassion, empathy, kindness, patience, and sensitivity, and {{described}} [...] "bonobo society" [...] as a [...] "gynecocracy". Primatologists who have studied <b>bonobos</b> in the wild have documented {{a wide range of}} behaviors, including aggressive behavior and more cyclic sexual behavior similar to chimpanzees, even though the fact remains that <b>bonobos</b> show more sexual behavior in a greater variety of relationships. An analysis of female bonding among wild <b>bonobos</b> by Takeshi Furuichi stresses female sexuality and shows how female <b>bonobos</b> spend much more time in estrus than female chimpanzees. Some primatologists have argued that de Waal's data reflect only the behavior of captive <b>bonobos,</b> suggesting that wild <b>bonobos</b> show levels of aggression closer to what is found among chimpanzees. De Waal has responded that the contrast in temperament between <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees observed in captivity is meaningful, because it controls for the influence of environment. The two species behave quite differently even if kept under identical conditions. A 2014 study also found <b>bonobos</b> to be less aggressive than chimpanzees, particularly eastern chimpanzees. The authors argued that the relative peacefulness of western chimpanzees and <b>bonobos</b> was primarily due to ecological factors.|$|R
50|$|Of course A.ramidus differs {{significantly}} from <b>bonobos,</b> <b>bonobos</b> having retained a functional canine honing complex.

In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in A.ramidus than {{what we see in}} <b>bonobos.</b>|$|R
25|$|Acting on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM {{developed}} the <b>Bonobo</b> and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys {{within the range}} of the <b>bonobo</b> in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society’s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the <b>bonobo</b> within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in <b>bonobo</b> habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{interaction}} {{has also}} been witnessed in female bonobos to avoid aggression. When hungry, the female <b>bonobo</b> will approach a male <b>bonobo</b> and engage in sexual activity to avoid aggression.

25|$|Anatomical {{differences}} between the common chimpanzee and the <b>bonobo</b> are slight. Both are omnivorous adapted to a mainly frugivorous diet. Yet sexual and social behaviours are markedly different. The common chimpanzee has a troop culture based on beta males led by an alpha male, and highly complex social relationships. The <b>bonobo,</b> on the other hand, has egalitarian, nonviolent, matriarchal, sexually receptive behaviour. Bonobos frequently have sex, sometimes to help prevent and resolve conflicts. Different groups of chimpanzees also have different cultural behaviour with preferences for types of tools. The common chimpanzee tends to display greater aggression than does the <b>bonobo.</b> The average captive chimpanzee sleeps 9 hours and 42 minutes per day.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2003, the U.S. {{government}} allocated $54 {{million to}} the Congo Basin Forest Partnership.

50|$|The Salonga National Park {{is home to}} {{an unusually}} large group of <b>bonobos,</b> a species of ape that shares 98% of their DNA with humans and are thus our closest {{non-human}} relatives. The Iyaelima have a harmonious relationship with the <b>bonobos,</b> whose population is much higher in Iyaelima territory than elsewhere in the park.The Iyaelima recognize that <b>bonobos</b> are similar in many ways to humans, and see them as equally intelligent, but have no feeling of kinship with them and are insulted by the suggestion that they are relatives.However, they avoid <b>bonobos</b> when they meet them in the forest, thinking the <b>bonobos</b> may beat them up or kill them, just as other ethnic groups might. For this reason, they do not kill <b>bonobos</b> for fear of stirring up conflict with them.|$|R
50|$|According to one scholar, A.

40|$|SummaryChimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and <b>bonobos</b> (P. paniscus) {{hunt and}} consume {{the meat of}} various mammals. While {{chimpanzees}} frequently hunt in groups for arboreal, group-living monkey species [1, 2], <b>bonobos</b> are thought to focus on medium-sized terrestrial prey, such as forest antelopes, squirrels and other rodents, which are caught opportunistically by single individuals [3]. The absence of monkey hunting by <b>bonobos</b> {{is often used to}} illustrate the divergent evolution of the two Pan species [4]. Here, we present the first information on hunting of diurnal, arboreal and group living primates by wild <b>bonobos...</b>|$|R
25|$|The port town of Basankusu is {{situated}} on the Lulonga River, at {{the confluence of the}} Lopori and Maringa Rivers, in the north of the country, making it well placed to receive and transport local goods to the cities of Mbandaka and Kinshasa.

25|$|As the bonobos' {{habitat is}} shared with people, the {{ultimate}} success of conservation efforts still rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people is salient in the Cuvette Centrale the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities {{have often been}} driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the <b>bonobo</b> habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the <b>bonobo,</b> the African forest elephant, and other species have been severely devastated by poachers and the thriving bushmeat trade. In contrast, areas exist where the <b>bonobo</b> and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.|$|E

2500|$|In <b>bonobos,</b> the {{clitoris}} {{is larger}} and more externalized than in most mammals. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe states that <b>bonobos</b> rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, [...] "which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement"; on average, female <b>bonobos</b> engage in genital-genital rubbing [...] "about once every two hours".|$|R
40|$|SummaryTo {{understand}} {{constraints on}} the evolution of cooperation, we compared the ability of <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees to cooperatively solve a food-retrieval problem. We addressed two hypotheses. The “emotional-reactivity hypothesis” predicts that <b>bonobos</b> will cooperate more successfully because tolerance levels are higher in <b>bonobos.</b> This prediction is inspired by studies of domesticated animals; such studies suggest that selection on emotional reactivity can influence the ability to solve social problems [1,  2]. In contrast, the “hunting hypothesis” predicts that chimpanzees will cooperate more successfully because only chimpanzees have been reported to cooperatively hunt in the wild [3 – 5]. We indexed emotional reactivity by measuring social tolerance while the animals were cofeeding and found that <b>bonobos</b> were more tolerant of cofeeding than chimpanzees. In addition, during cofeeding tests only <b>bonobos</b> exhibited socio-sexual behavior, and they played more. When presented with a task of retrieving food that was difficult to monopolize, <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees were equally cooperative. However, when the food reward was highly monopolizable, <b>bonobos</b> were more successful than chimpanzees at cooperating to retrieve it. These results support the emotional-reactivity hypothesis. Selection on temperament may in part explain the variance in cooperative ability across species, including hominoids...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how outbreaks and {{the occurrence of}} Anthrax, Ebola, Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis may differentially affect the distribution of <b>bonobos</b> (Pan paniscus). Using a combination of mapping, Jaccard overlapping coefficients and binary regressions, the study determined how each disease correlated with the extent of occurrence of, and the areas occupied by, <b>bonobos.</b> Anthrax has only been reported to occur outside the range of <b>bonobos</b> and so was not considered further. Ebola, Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis were each reported within the area of occupancy of <b>bonobos.</b> Their respective overlap coefficients were: J = 0. 10; Q(α = 0. 05)  = 2. 00 (odds ratios = 0. 0001, 95 % CI = 0. 0057; Z = - 19. 41, significant) for Ebola; J = 1. 00; Q(α = 0. 05)  = 24. 0 (odds ratios = 1. 504, 95 % CI = 0. 5066 - 2. 6122) for Monkeypox; and, J = 0. 33; Q(α = 0. 05)  = 11. 5 (Z = 1. 14, significant) for Trypanosomiasis. There were significant relationships for the presence and absence of Monkeypox and Trypanosomiasis and the known extent of occurrence of <b>bonobos,</b> based on the equations y = 0. 2368 Ln(x) + 0. 8006 (R(2)  = 0. 9772) and y = - 0. 2942 Ln(x) + 0. 7155 (R(2)  = 0. 698), respectively. The positive relationship suggested that <b>bonobos</b> tolerated the presence of Monkeypox. In contrast, the significant negative coefficient suggested that <b>bonobos</b> were absent in areas where Trypanosomiasis is endemic. Our results suggest that large rivers may have prevented Ebola from spreading into the range of <b>bonobos.</b> Meanwhile, Trypanosomiasis has been recorded among humans within the area of occurrence of <b>bonobos,</b> and appears the most important disease in shaping the area of occupancy of <b>bonobos</b> within their overall extent of occupancy...|$|R
25|$|In 1995, {{concern over}} declining numbers of bonobos {{in the wild}} led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with {{contributions}} from <b>bonobo</b> scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for Pan paniscus: A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range.

25|$|More {{often than}} the males, female bonobos engage in mutual genital behavior, {{possibly}} to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of <b>bonobo</b> society. The bonding among females {{enables them to}} dominate most of the males. Although male bonobos are individually stronger, they cannot stand alone against a united group of females. Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. This migration mixes the <b>bonobo</b> gene pools, providing genetic diversity.

25|$|The <b>bonobo</b> {{population}} {{is believed to}} have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.|$|E
25|$|German anatomist Ernst Schwarz is {{credited}} with being the first Westerner to recognise the <b>bonobo</b> as being distinctive, in 1928, based on his analysis of a skull in the Tervuren museum in Belgium that previously had been thought to have belonged to a juvenile chimpanzee. Schwarz published his findings in 1929. In 1933, American anatomist Harold Coolidge offered a more {{detailed description of the}} <b>bonobo,</b> and elevated it to species status.

25|$|Along {{with the}} common chimpanzee, the <b>bonobo</b> is the closest extant {{relative}} to humans. Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, {{the formation of the}} Congo River 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the <b>bonobo.</b> Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There is no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. They typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown.|$|E

40|$|Objectives <b>Bonobos</b> and {{chimpanzees}} {{are known}} to differ in various morphological traits, a dichotomy that is sometimes used as an analogy for evolutionary splits during human evolution. The aim of our study was to measure the forearm length of immature and adult <b>bonobos</b> and adult chimpanzees to assess the extent of age–related changes of forearm length in <b>bonobos</b> and sex–dimorphism in <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees. Materials and methods As a proxy of somatic growth we measured forearm length of captive <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees {{ranging in age from}} 1 to 55 years. Measures were taken from subjects inserting their arms into a transparent Plexiglas® tube, a novel technique facilitating repeated measures of nonanesthetized apes in captivity. Results Measures from adult females (> 12 years) showed that <b>bonobos</b> exceed chimpanzees in terms of forearm length and that sexual dimorphism in forearm length is pronounced in chimpanzees, but not in <b>bonobos.</b> Forearm length increased significantly with chronological age in <b>bonobos.</b> Validation tests revealed that the device generates useful data on morphometric dimensions. Discussion In most primates, sexual dimorphism in body size is male-biased and the differences in forearm length in chimpanzees follow this trend. Given that males of the two species did not differ in forearm length, the absence/presence of sexual dimorphism of this trait must be due to differences in somatic growth in females. Our novel method offers an alternative to obtain morphometric measures and facilitates longitudinal studies on somatic growth...|$|R
40|$|Humans' two closest primate living relatives, <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees, differ behaviorally, cognitively, {{and emotionally}} {{in several ways}} despite their general similarities. While <b>bonobos</b> show more affiliative {{behaviors}} towards conspecifics, chimpanzees display more overt and severe aggression against conspecifics. From a cognitive standpoint, <b>bonobos</b> perform better in social coordination, gaze-following and food-related cooperation, while chimpanzees excel in tasks requiring extractive foraging skills. We hypothesized that attention and motivation {{play an important role}} in shaping the species differences in behavior, cognition, and emotion. Thus, we predicted that <b>bonobos</b> would pay more attention to the other individuals' face and eyes, as those are related to social affiliation and social coordination, while chimpanzees would pay more attention to the action target objects, as they are related to foraging. Using eye-tracking we examined the bonobos' and chimpanzees' spontaneous scanning of pictures that included eyes, mouth, face, genitals, and action target objects of conspecifics. Although <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees viewed those elements overall similarly, <b>bonobos</b> viewed the face and eyes longer than chimpanzees, whereas chimpanzees viewed the other elements, the mouth, action target objects and genitals, longer than <b>bonobos.</b> In a discriminant analysis, the individual variation in viewing patterns robustly predicted the species of individuals, thus clearly demonstrating species-specific viewing patterns. We suggest that such attentional and motivational differences between <b>bonobos</b> and chimpanzees could have partly contributed to shaping the species-specific behaviors, cognition, and emotion of these species, even in a relatively short period of evolutionary time...|$|R
