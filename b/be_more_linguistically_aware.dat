40|$|Given the {{importance}} of the role of spelling in literacy, {{it is important to have}} knowledge of the linguistic features that allow students to be successful spellers. Having phonological, morphological, and orthographic knowledge is essentially important to spell conventionally. In the United States, the standard language is Academic English (AE). African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is considered a deviation from AE, with its own sound system. AAVE is the most widely used form of dialect in the United States. Many students who speak AAVE may have difficulties in producing the correct spelling of AE words. The overall purpose of this study was to provide sixth-grade students, who are speakers of AAVE, with an eight-week intervention in the principles of phonology, morphology, and orthography that would assist them in improving their spelling performance. Students had similar scores on all spelling and dialect pretest measures before the intervention began. The research design was a pretest/posttest/posttest design using waitlist- control. This study included 142 students divided into 14 class sections taught by two teachers. The two teachers provided the intervention to the students. The experimental group consisted of seven classes, and the control group consisted of seven classes. After the first implementation of the intervention, the study was replicated with the control group of students. MANOVA was utilized to determine the effect of the intervention. The intervention produced large effects for the students who received the spelling instruction. The results from the criterion-referenced spelling assessments and a sentence writing task revealed that students who received explicit instruction from the intervention made gains in their spelling performance from pretest/posttest 1 /posttest 2 and maintained these gains after being tested eight weeks later. Practical and theoretical recommendations are provided for teachers and researchers. Suggested recommendations include: providing teacher training that will enable teachers to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> <b>aware</b> of AAVE and its features, making students aware of the difference in the AAVE and the AE sound system, and conducting more research-based studies that will assist speakers of AAVE in literacy and spelling...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how professional development conditions, events, and activities {{relate to the}} process of teachers becoming <b>linguistically</b> <b>aware.</b> Through an analysis of 18 transcribed individual and group interviews, I show how changes in beliefs about language, as well as the application of these changes to teachers' pedagogies take place among a sample of 14 teachers. I analyze these findings as an outcome of these teachers' professional development and in relation to models of effective professional development derived from the fields of Multicultural Education, Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), Intercultural Communication, and Sociolinguistics. I also propose a new model, the Process of Linguistic Awareness and Application Model (PLAA Model, Strickling, 2012), that more accurately evaluates how changes take place as the teachers in this study become <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> <b>aware.</b> Changes in beliefs about language involve a cycle of five phases: confronting new linguistic information, questioning linguistic information and previously held beliefs, integrating new linguistic information within contexts of social engagement, evaluating the relational, emotional, and cognitive aspects of the experience, and modifying beliefs about language within the specific context of the experience. The PLAA Model also shows how a nuanced secondary cycle can occur where the process of questioning, integrating, and evaluating inform each other in a repeating cycle of increasing linguistic awareness before the final phase of modifying beliefs takes place. The cycle results in experiential linguistic knowledge and becomes the paradigm for new questioning. Within the secondary cycle, the teachers in this study show that they either gain a <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> <b>aware</b> knowledge from their integrating experience or within some contexts, reinscribe an aspect of their previously held standard language beliefs and gain a linguistic awareness during the same experience. This contrary movement likely indicates a flux in beliefs about language...|$|R

Introduction Two-level phonology combines the computational advantages of finite state technology with a formalism that permits phenomena to be described with familiar-looking rules. The problem with such a scheme is that, in practice, the finite state machines (FSM's) can grow too large to be manageable; one wants to describe them and to run them without having to deal with them directly. The Kimmo approach 1 seeks to achieve this by (1) decomposing the computational process into a battery of parallel finite state machines and (2) compiling rules (which notationally resemble familiar phonologic [...] ...|$|R

The language was then declared alive in 2005, when descendants of Cappadocian Greeks were discovered still speaking the language fluently in central and northern Greece. Today it is still spoken by mainly elderly Cappadocian Greeks in various regions of Greece including in Karditsa, Volos, Kilkis, Larisa, Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, Kavala, and Alexandroupoli.

First of all SUMO already includes a good semiotics architecture for the representation and the communication of information in general. Expanded from the original SUMO somewhat are the basic segments of language, which are classified as LinguisticExpressions: Text, Sentence, Phrase, Word, Morpheme, and PhonemeSequence. There is a further distinction {{in the form of}} the LinguisticExpression which can be Written, Spoken, or Signed. We argue that a WrittenLinguisticExpression is a fundamentally different concept than a SpokenLinguisticExpression, and not simply an attribute like male/female. The distinction is particularly important when reasoning about the equivalentContentRelation between, for example, what someone says and what is printed in a newspaper. There are a number of other semiotic predicates that apply, but some of the most important are refers, represents and containsInformation.

30|$|The {{subjects}} almost unanimously {{agreed that}} English {{had played a}} critical role in their pathways to professional migration. Their proficiency in English, often excellently developed by the educational systems in their own countries, had shaped their interests in migrating to English-dominant host communities, facilitated their entry into the country by earning them points for skilled migration, helped them gain advanced professional and academic training after migration, and qualified them for coveted jobs inaccessible to those who were not competent in English. Others went on to narrate how their proficiency in English was critical for their status in their professions. They could be penalized or they might stagnate in their employment for signs of unproficiency in English. These findings were not surprising. They show the institutional and policy importance of English. The power of neoliberal discourses explains why entry into countries and professions depends on a proficiency in English. However, the subjects went to narrate how their everyday work and development efforts <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> diverse.

40|$|Treebanks, {{such as the}} Penn Treebank (PTB), offer {{a simple}} {{approach}} to obtaining a broad coverage grammar: one can simply read the grammar off the parse trees in the treebank. While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a square-root {{rate of growth of}} the rule set with corpus size suggests that the derived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would be required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However, we offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of structures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an algorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules – rules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the resulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full treebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted grammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the compaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which is argued to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> motivated. Combined with simple thresholding, this method can be used to give a 58 % reduction in grammar size without significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69 % reduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision. ...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{from the}} British academy {{indicates}} that the decline in modern language learning in the UK endangers {{the ability of the}} UK to compete with researchers who <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> competent. Indeed this is a challenge for all Anglophones. Increased competition for funding and learners means that the traditional advantage of Anglophones is being eroded. This creates a pedagogical challenge. Why? Didactic approaches to second language acquisition and strategies used at other European universities are not effective for Anglophones. For the purpose of this scoping piece, the mixed methods approach of sequential explanatory strategy (Creswell, 2003) is adopted. The method is used as follows: first, secondary data is collected to profile the experience of Anglophones when learning a second language. Second interviews are conducted with language lecturers and learners. This qualitative evidence is used to assist in interpreting the findings from stage one. There is need for Anglophones to address their deficit in second languages. A teaching approach that emphasises motivation and utilises a variety of approached will encourage Anglophones to successful learn a second language. This research indicates that a direct, natural and cognitive methods aided by the use of language laboratories may help learners to increase their motivation to learn a new language. Liu (2008) explains that special attention should be paid to the diversity of learning styles and to the importance of dealing with learners that learn differently. Previous research indentifies unique challenges in teaching second language learning to Anglophones. Therefore, higher education providers must provide appropriate teaching resources and methodologies to support motivation and to overcome didactic challenges...|$|R

The corpus used for textual analysis was composed of 10 editorials from each of the groups. A secondary purpose was to explore and contrast reader practices, expectations and perceptions relating to English-language editorials in Thailand and the US, which involved analysis of response to questionnaires by 30 native Thai (TS) and 30 native English speakers (ES). It <b>was</b> found that <b>more</b> EA editorials <b>were</b> published per day, covering broader topics than did editorials in Thailand. The Thai texts <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>linguistically</b> complex than English as there <b>are</b> typically <b>more</b> V-Units (terminal 'Verb-Units', posited in this study) in Thai sentences. ET editorials <b>were</b> <b>more</b> similar to EA than to TT on the range of purposes and the numbers of purposes per editorial. TT editorials have more diverse types of titles than do ET and EA editorials. ET editorials <b>were</b> <b>more</b> similar to EA editorials in terms of organization type preference. EA editorials follow Schneider and Connor's model of coherent text (1990) most closely and Witte's model (1982) least closely.

Most ES subjects are correct in identifying the place of publication as the US or Thailand while guesses by Thai subjects are only at the level of chance for both.
