50|$|Another way {{of seeing}} the utility of flipism in {{decision-making}} can be called revealed preferences. In the traditional form, revealed preferences mean that the preferences of consumers can be revealed by their purchasing habits. With flipism, the preferences can be revealed to the decision-maker themselves. Decisions with conflicting preferences are especially difficult even in situations where {{there is only one}} decision-maker and no uncertainty. The decision options may be either all appealing or all unpleasant, and therefore the decision-maker is unable to choose. Flipism, i.e., flipping a coin can be used to find a solution. However, the decision-maker should not decide based on the coin but instead observe his or her own feelings about the outcome; whether it was relieving or agonizing. In this way, flipism removes the mental block related to the act of decision-making, and the post-decision preferences can be revealed before the decision is actually made. An example of revealed preferences is embodied in the Old Testament story, the Judgment of Solomon, wherein King Solomon offered to resolve a child custody dispute by ordering the <b>baby</b> <b>cut</b> in two, and upon seeing the reactions made an award.|$|E

40|$|From {{experience}} in managing 348 patients with imperforate anus and after considering the existing literature, {{there appeared to}} be the possibility of performing a safe primary correction of supralevator anorectal anomalies via a perineal approach in the neonatal period in males. A total of 39 patients have been treated by the new operation, and in 31 of these patients the operation was carried out at birth. With a stiff catheter in the urethra, via a horizontal 'H'-shaped perineal incision and through the puborectalis sling, the rectum was mobilised and the fistula transfixed. The rectum was brought through the sling and sutured to the perineum so that perineal skin entered the new anal canal. In a few patients an abdominal approach was required at the same time. There were few postoperative complications. Subsequent X-rays showed good urethral and pelvic floor anatomy and function. Twenty-five of the babies are now over 2 years old. Of these, 84 % are continent for solid faeces and 68 % for liquid faeces. The perineal approach permits satisfactory identification of the puborectalis, rectum and fistula in most <b>babies.</b> <b>Cutting</b> the pelvic floor is not satisfactory. Introducing perineal skin into the anal canal is important. Early operation enables the child to learn to use its perineum. It is difficult to know whether the results in this series are attributable to the type of operation or its timing...|$|R

Children are introduced to various environmental stimuli such as taste (honey in Aceh, soil in Kampung Naga), sound (music when descending the stairs, cracking coconuts in Aceh), and taking a journey (going down the stairs in Aceh, Sulawesi and Sunda, horseback riding on the Javanese).
