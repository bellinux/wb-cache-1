50|$|Traditional <b>boresighting,</b> as {{the name}} suggests, {{involves}} removing the bolt and sighting down the bore of a gun to a fixed point. While the rifle is fixed in place, the scope or irons can then be adjusted to also aim at the distant object. A more modern method of <b>boresighting</b> {{is to use a}} laser rather than by visual inspection to illuminate the distant point. This method is preferable because it allows more movement in the gun, as the laser dot will not move relative to the barrel, and is a method of <b>boresighting</b> which does not require the removal of the bolt.|$|E
5000|$|Boresight - Aircraft HUD {{components}} are very accurately {{aligned with the}} aircraft's three axes - a process called <b>boresighting</b> - so that displayed data conforms to reality typically with an accuracy of ±7.0 milliradians (±24 MOA), and may vary across the HUD's FOV. In this case the word [...] "conform" [...] means, [...] "when an object is projected on the combiner and the actual object is visible, they will be aligned". This allows the display to show the pilot exactly where the artificial horizon is, {{as well as the}} aircraft's projected path with great accuracy. When Enhanced Vision is used, for example, the display of runway lights are aligned with the actual runway lights when the real lights become visible. <b>Boresighting</b> is done during the aircraft's building process and can also be performed in the field on many aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and radar engineering, antenna <b>boresight</b> is {{the axis of}} maximum gain (maximum radiated power) of a directional antenna. For most antennas the <b>boresight</b> is the axis of symmetry of the antenna. For example, for axial-fed dish antennas, the antenna <b>boresight</b> is the axis of symmetry of the parabolic dish, and the antenna radiation pattern (the main lobe) is symmetrical about the <b>boresight</b> axis. Most antennas <b>boresight</b> axis is fixed by their shape and cannot be changed. However phased array antennas can electronically steer the beam, changing {{the angle of the}} <b>boresight</b> by shifting the relative phase of the radio waves emitted by different antenna elements, and even radiate beams in multiple directions (multiple <b>boresights).</b>|$|R

Using this method, the normal sight (which is fixed to the receiver) and the collimator (which is fixed to the barrel) can be sighted to match.

The method comprises {{the steps of}} defining a defining a reference frame for the star tracker assembly according to a <b>boresight</b> of the primary star tracker and a <b>boresight</b> of a second star tracker wherein the <b>boresight</b> of the primary star tracker and a plane spanned by the <b>boresight</b> of the primary star tracker and the <b>boresight</b> of the second star tracker at least partially define a datum for the reference frame for the star tracker assembly; and determining the misalignment of {{the at least one}} star tracker as a rotation of the defined reference frame...|$|R
30|$|Originally, the {{requirements}} of the LIDAR <b>boresight</b> direction as a navigation tool allowed relative alignment between the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS 3) and LIDAR to be < 1 °, and for the shift from the −Z axis to be < 0.5 °. Therefore, the tolerance of the shift of the telescope with respect to the spacecraft associated with the launch was not defined quantitatively. In addition, the <b>boresight</b> direction before launch was determined based on the measured differences between the LIDAR <b>boresight</b> and an alignment cube on the LIDAR, and between the alignment cubes on the LIDAR and spacecraft. Therefore, the determined prelaunch <b>boresight</b> direction was treated as a reference value, based on the accuracy requirements stated above. It is concluded that a more precise <b>boresight</b> direction with respect to the spacecraft as a scientific instrument was identified in this experiment.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>boresight</b> {{came from}} high-gain antennas such as {{parabolic}} dishes, which produce narrow, pencil-shaped beams which {{are difficult to}} aim accurately at a distant receiving antenna. These often are equipped with optical <b>boresights</b> to assist in aiming.|$|R

The TAS integrates into a single housing the direct view optics, a second-generation forward looking infrared (FLIR) night vision sight (NVS), missile trackers, and a laser rangefinder. TAS electronics provide automatic <b>boresighting</b> for these components, eliminating both tactical collimation and 180-day verification requirements.|$|E

Kennedy, looked into a report that Oswald had a telescopic sight mounted and sighted at the store in which Ryder was employed. Ryder showed agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on November 25, 1963, a tag which he claimed was in Oswald's handwriting. The undated tag, with the name OSWALD, attested that three holes had been drilled into an unspecified kind of rifle. Further, a telescopic sight had been mounted on the rifle and boresighted. The customer paid $4.50 for drilling and $1.50 for <b>boresighting</b> the rifle.|$|E
40|$|A simple leaky-wave antenna (LWA) array is {{presented}} here radiates in the <b>boresight</b> direction. It {{is based on}} uniform half-width (HW) microstrip leaky-wave antennas (MLWAs). Uniform HW-MLWAs usually radiate a fan-shaped beam with a beam direction near <b>boresight</b> at lower frequencies and near endfire at higher frequencies.

The launch tube is made of fiberglass-epoxy composite material with a gelcoat on the bore. The spotting rifle is mounted {{on the right side}} of the launch tube. It functions semi-automatically by primer actuation, meaning that when fired the primer sets back and unlocks the breech of the spotting rifle, ejecting the spent round. The firing mechanism mechanically fires the spotting rifle, and uses a magnet to fire the rocket. The mounting brackets connects the components and provide the means for <b>boresighting</b> the weapon, while the encased rockets are loaded at the rear of the launcher. The spotting cartridges are stored in a magazine in the cap of the encased rocket.|$|E

40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDAA ([URL] audienceWe present a system for the <b>boresighting</b> of sensors using {{inertial}} measurement devices {{as the basis for}} developing a range of dynamic real-time sensor fusion applications. The proof of concept utilizes a COTS FPGA platform for sensor fusion and real-time correction of a misaligned video sensor. We exploit a custom-designed 32 -bit soft processor core and C-based design & synthesis for rapid, platform-neutral development. Kalman filter and sensor fusion techniques established in advanced aviation systems are applied to automotive vehicles with results exceeding typical industry requirements for sensor alignment. Results of the static and the dynamic tests demonstrate that using inexpensive accelerometers mounted on (or during assembly of) a sensor and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) fixed to a vehicle can be used to compute the misalignment of the sensor to the IMU and thus vehicle. In some cases the model predications and test results exceeded the requirements by an order of magnitude with a 3 -sigma or 99 % confidence...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{calibration}} of LIDAR {{systems has}} been an active field {{of research and development}} over the last years. Traditional calibration approaches rely on manual extraction of geometric features in the laser data and require time-intensive input of a trained operator. Recently, new methodologies evolved using automatic extraction of linear features and planar information to minimize systematic errors in LIDAR strips. This paper presents a new methodology of LIDAR calibration using automatically reconstructed planar features. The calibration approach presented herein integrates the physical sensor model and raw laser measurements and allows for refined calibration of internal system parameters. The new methodology is tested and compared with a traditional approach based on manual <b>boresighting</b> using a typical survey mission. Optech’s software suite LMS, which is the first commercial implementation of this functionality, was used to process the data and to derive means of quality assessment. Different methods of reconstructing automatically extracted geometric features are presented and discussed {{in the context of their}} contribution to the calibration process.

40|$|An Enhanced Vision System (EVS) {{utilizing}} multi-sensor {{image fusion}} is currently under {{development at the}} NASA Langley Research Center. The EVS will provide enhanced images of the flight environment to assist pilots in poor visibility conditions. Multi-spectral images obtained from a short wave infrared (SWIR), a long wave infrared (LWIR), and a color visible band CCD camera, are enhanced and fused using the Retinex algorithm. The images from the different sensors {{do not have a}} uniform data structure: the three sensors not only operate at different wavelengths, but they also have different spatial resolutions, optical fields of view (FOV), and <b>boresighting</b> inaccuracies. Thus, in order to perform image fusion, the images must first be co-registered. Image registration is the task of aligning images taken at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints, so that all corresponding points in the images match. In this paper, we present two methods for registering multiple multi-spectral images. The first method performs registration using sensor specifications to match the FOVs and resolutions directly through image resampling. In the second method, registration is obtained through geometric correction based on a spatial transformation defined by user selected control points and regression analysis...|$|E

Image processing method with Charged Coupled Device camera is chosen for the Error reduction of bore-sighting.

After we confirm the performance of the Dual-Barrel Weapon and that of the Firing Control System in the Dual Barrel Weapon System, the bore-sighting which {{is a part of the}} process in the system assembly is accomplished.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that a Head-Up Display (HUD) can be used to enable more capacity and safer aircraft surface operations. This previous research also noted that the HUD exhibited two major limitations which hindered the full potential of the display concept: 1) the monochrome HUD format; and, 2) a limited, fixed field of regard. Full-color Head Worn Displays (HWDs) with very small sizes and weights are emerging to the extent that this technology may be practical for commercial and business aircraft operations. By coupling the HWD with a head tracker, full-color, out-the-window display concepts with an unlimited field-of-regard may be realized to improve efficiency and safety in surface operations. A ground simulation experiment was conducted at NASA Langley to evaluate the efficacy of head-worn display applications which may directly address the limitations of the HUD while retaining all of its advantages in surface operations. The simulation experiment used airline crews to evaluate various displays (HUD, HWD) and display concepts in an operationally realistic environment by using a Chicago, O Hare airport database. The results pertaining to the implications of HWDs for commercial business and transport aviation applications are presented herein. Overall HWD system latency was measured and found to be acceptable, but not necessarily optimal. A few occurrences of simulator sickness were noted while wearing the HWD, but overall there appears to be commercial pilot acceptability and usability to the concept. Many issues were identified which need to be addressed in future research including continued reduction in user encumbrance due to the HWD, and improvement in image alignment, accuracy, and <b>boresighting...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Dual pushbroom hyperspectral sensors {{consist of}} two {{different}} instruments (covering different wavelengths) that are usually mounted on the same optical bench. This configuration leads to problems, such as co-registration of pixels and squint {{of the field of}} view, known as the <b>boresight</b> effect. Determination of image-orientation parameters is due to the combination of an inertial measurement system (IMU) and global position system (GPS). The different positions of the IMU, the GPS antenna and the imaging sensors cause the orientation and <b>boresight</b> effect. Any small change in the correction of the internal orientation affects the co-registration between images extracted from the two instruments. Correcting the <b>boresight</b> effect is a key and almost automatic task performed by all dual-system users to better analyze the full spectral information of a given pixel. Thus, the <b>boresight</b> effect is considered to be noise in the system and a problem that needs to be corrected prior to any (thematic) data analysis. We propose using the <b>boresight</b> effect, prior to its correction, as a tool to monitor and detect spectral phenomena that can provide additional information not present in the corrected images. The advantage of using this effect was investigated with the AISA-Dual sensor, composed of an EAGLE sensor for th...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of ground-based <b>boresight</b> sources for calibration {{and testing of}} tracking antennas usually entails various difficulties, mostly due to unwanted ground effects. To avoid this problem, DLR MORABA developed a small, lightweight, frequency-adjustable S-band <b>boresight</b> source, mounted on a small remote-controlled multirotor aircraft. Highly accurate GPS-supported, position and altitude control functions allow both, very steady positioning of the aircraft in mid-air, and precise waypointbased, semi-autonomous flights. In contrast to fixed near-ground <b>boresight</b> sources this flying setup enables us to avoid obstructions in the Fresnel zone between source and antenna. Further, it minimizes ground reflections or other multipath effects which affect antenna calibrations. In addition, the large operating range of a flying <b>boresight</b> simplifies measurements in the far field of the antenna and permits undisturbed antenna pattern tests. A unique application is the realistic simulation of sophisticated flight paths, including overhead tracking and unusual trajectories of fast objects such as sounding rockets. Likewise, dynamic tracking tests are feasible which provide crucial information about the antenna pedestal performance, particularly at high elevations, and reveal weaknesses in the autotrack control loop...|$|R
