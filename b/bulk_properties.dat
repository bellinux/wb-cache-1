40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} test results of a passive prosthetic ankle that has mechanical behavior {{similar to that of}} a natural ankle. The ankle prosthesis is designed to store and return enough energy to the amputee to propel their body forward during push-off. The ankle prosthesis is a 2 degree of freedom (DoF) mechanism containing a network of conventional compression springs. One DoF allows the lower leg to compress when weight is applied; the other allows the foot to rotate about the ankle joint. <b>Bulk</b> <b>property</b> and dynamic performance criteria are used to assess the performance of the ankle prosthesis. Lightweight, compactness and low friction are the primary <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> requirements for the ankle device. Stiffness nonlinearity and active behavior similar to that of a human ankle are the major dynamic performance characteristics. In this research, a preliminary computer geometric model of the prosthesis was developed, simulated, and refined in CAD software. A proof-of-concept prototype was then fabricated, modified and tested on both a robot and a human subject. The test results showed that the designed ankle prosthesis demonstrated its ability to satisfy the <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> requirements and some of the dynamic performance characteristics. The nonlinearity of ankle stiffness was validated, however, more active behavior should be achieved by the prosthesis during push-off...|$|R
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> to Ganymede, it {{apparently}} had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> of {{astatine}} are {{not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
40|$|In many {{research}} {{areas and}} application domains, the <b>bulk</b> optical <b>properties</b> of biological materials are of great interest. Unfortunately, these properties cannot be obtained easily for complex turbid media. In this study, a metamodeling {{approach has been}} proposed and applied for the fast and accurate estimation of the <b>bulk</b> optical <b>properties</b> from contactless and non-destructive hyperspectral scatter imaging (HSI) measurements. A set of liquid optical phantoms, based on intralipid, methylene blue and water, were prepared and the Vis/NIR <b>bulk</b> optical <b>properties</b> were characterized with a double integrating sphere and unscattered transmittance setup. Accordingly, the phantoms were measured with the HSI technique and metamodels were constructed, relating the Vis/NIR reflectance images to the reference <b>bulk</b> optical <b>properties</b> of the samples. The independent inverse validation showed good prediction performance for the absorption coefficient and the reduced scattering coefficient, with R 2 values of 0. 980 and 0. 998, and RMSEP values of 0. 032 cm- 1 and 0. 197 cm- 1. respectively. The results clearly support the potential of this approach for fast and accurate estimation of the <b>bulk</b> optical <b>properties</b> of turbid media from contactless HSI measurements. status: publishe...|$|R

The first model to use this approach was the Bernal–Fowler model published in 1933, which {{may also be the}} earliest water model. However, the BF model doesn't reproduce well the <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> of water, such as density and heat of vaporization, and is thus of historical interest only. This is a consequence of the parameterization method; newer models, developed after modern computers became available, were parameterized by running Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations and adjusting the parameters until the <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> are reproduced well enough.|$|E

The <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.|$|E
