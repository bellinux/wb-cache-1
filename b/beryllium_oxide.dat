40|$|Accurate {{characterization}} of the physicochemical properties of aerosols generated for inhalation toxicology studies is essential for obtaining meaningful results. Great emphasis must also be placed on characterizing particle properties of materials as administered in inhalation studies. Thus, {{research is needed to}} identify a suite of techniques capable of characterizing the multiple particle properties (i. e., size, mass, surface area, number) of a material that may influence toxicity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the morphology and investigate the size distribution of a model toxicant, <b>beryllium.</b> <b>Beryllium</b> metal, <b>oxides,</b> and alloy particles were aerodynamically size-separated using an aerosol cyclone, imaged dry using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), then characterized using phase contrast microscopy (PCM), a liquid suspension particle counter (LPC), and computer-controlled SEM (CCSEM). Beryllium metal powder was compact with smaller sub-micrometer size particles attached to the surface of larger particles, whereas the <b>beryllium</b> <b>oxides</b> and alloy particles were clusters of primary particles. As expected, the geometric mean (GM) diameter of metal powder determined using PCM decreased with aerodynamic size, but when suspended in liquid for LPC or CCSEM analysis, the GM diameter decreased by a factor of two (p < 0. 001). This observation suggested that the smaller submicrometer size particles attached to the surface of larger particles and/or particle agglomerates detach in liquid, thereby shifting the particle size distribution downward. The GM diameters of the oxide materials were similar regardless of sizing technique, but observed differences were generally significant (p < 0. 001). For oxides, aerodynamic cluster size will dictate deposition in the lung, but primary particle size may influence biological activity. The GM diameter of alloy particles determined using PCM became smaller with decreasing aerodynamic size fraction; however, when suspended in liquid for CCSEM and LPC analyses, GM particle size decreased by a factor of two (p < 0. 001) suggesting that alloy particles detach in liquid. Detachment of particles in liquid could have significance for the expected versus actual size (and number) distribution of aerosol delivered to an exposure subject. Thus, a suite of complimentary analytical techniques may be necessary for estimating size distribution. Consideration should be given to thoroughly understanding the influence of any liquid vehicle which may alter the expected aerosol size distribution...|$|R

5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory <b>beryllium</b> <b>oxide</b> and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Kerst {{designed}} an aqueous {{homogeneous reactor}} in which enriched uranium {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate, was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a <b>beryllium</b> <b>oxide</b> neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was performed at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1958 to determine critical masses of cylinders of Oralloy (Oy) reflected {{by a number of}} materials. The experiments were all performed on the Comet Universal Critical Assembly Machine, and consisted of discs of highly enriched uranium (93. 3 wt. % 235 U) reflected by half-inch and one-inch-thick cylindrical shells of various reflector materials. The experiments were performed by members of Group N- 2, particularly K. W. Gallup, G. E. Hansen, H. C. Paxton, and R. H. White. This experiment was intended to ascertain critical masses for criticality safety purposes, as well as to compare neutron transport cross sections to those obtained from danger coefficient measurements with the Topsy Oralloy-Tuballoy reflected and Godiva unreflected critical assemblies. The reflector materials examined in this {{series of experiments}} are as follows: magnesium, titanium, aluminum, graphite, mild steel, nickel, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, natural uranium, tungsten, <b>beryllium,</b> aluminum <b>oxide,</b> molybdenum carbide, and polythene (polyethylene). Also included are two special configurations of composite beryllium and iron reflectors. Analyses were performed in which uncertainty associated with six different parameters was evaluated; namely, extrapolation to the uranium critical mass, uranium density, 235 U enrichment, reflector density, reflector thickness, and reflector impurities. In addition to the idealizations made by the experimenters (removal of the platen and diaphragm), two simplifications were also made to the benchmark models that resulted in a small bias and additional uncertainty. First of all, since impurities in core and reflector materials are only estimated, they are not included in the benchmark models. Secondly, the room, support structure, and other possible surrounding equipment {{were not included in the}} model. Bias values that result from these two simplifications were determined and associated uncertainty in the bias values were included in the overall uncertainty in benchmark keff values. Bias values were very small, ranging from 0. 0004 ?k low to 0. 0007 ?k low. Overall uncertainties range from ? 0. 0018 to ? 0. 0030. Major contributors to the overall uncertainty include uncertainty in the extrapolation to the uranium critical mass and the uranium density. Results are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1. Experimental, Benchmark-Model, and MCNP/KENO Calculated Results The 32 configurations described and evaluated under ICSBEP Identifier HEU-MET-FAST- 084 are judged to be acceptable for use as criticality safety benchmark experiments and should be valuable integral benchmarks for nuclear data testing of the various reflector materials.

5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and <b>beryllium</b> <b>oxide</b> have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
25|$|Composite {{materials}} can be used. Examples are a copper-tungsten pseudoalloy, AlSiC (silicon carbide in aluminium matrix), Dymalloy (diamond in copper-silver alloy matrix), and E-Material (<b>beryllium</b> <b>oxide</b> in beryllium matrix).

25|$|Some {{magnetrons}} have <b>beryllium</b> <b>oxide</b> (beryllia) ceramic insulators, {{which are}} dangerous if crushed and inhaled, or otherwise ingested.

In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be directly handled.|$|E
40|$|Modifications {{were made}} in the Carlson and Banks {{procedure}} for the spectrophotometric determination of silicon in <b>beryllium</b> metal and <b>oxide.</b> The refractory oxide is dissolved directly in hydrofluoric acid. The identical procedure is used for metal after ignition to the <b>oxide.</b> Concentrations of <b>beryllium</b> over certain limits have a quenching effect on the fluorescence of the aluminum-Portachrome Blue Black R complex. The determination of trace amounts of aluminum in beryilium can be carried out despite this quenching effect by the method of standard addition. Samples of plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate prepared 9 to 12 months earlier were under investigation to determine the suitability of this compound as a primary analytical standard of plutonium. The compound was determined experimentally to contain four molecules of water of crystallization. Plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate was found to lose a major portion of its water of crystallization when heated at 115 ts C. Indications, but no conclusive evidence, of the existence of another intermediate hydrate of plutonium(IV) sulfate, were found. Microscopic examination of 1 -year-old crystals of Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 shows no evidence of the effect of any alpha radiolysis on the water of crystallization. Continued exposure to a fluctuating atmosphere caused no apparent changes in crystal structure or weight. Heating Pu(SO/sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 to 325 ts C produced a dehydrated salt of weight equivalent to the formula, Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. This material, although slightly hygroscopic, can be readily dried at 120 ts C and appears to be satisfactory for further investigation of its suitability as an alternate primary stand ard of plutonium. A method is presented for the rapid determination of milligram quantities of sulfateiIn pure plutonium sulfates. Plutonium is adsorbed on a cation resin and an acidimetric titration is made of the displaced hydrogen ion which is equivalent to the sulfate content of the sample. A technique used for the prevention of plutonium hydrolysis in neutral solution is described. The method may be applied to the determination of sulfate in any pure plutonium sulfate. A method is described for sampling and analyzing uranium in graphite waste. Sampling data indicate that representative sampling is obtained if the material is pulverized to less than 30 -mesh size before reducing to 20 to 50 -g portions for analysis. A HN 0 /sub 3 / (l - 3) digestion is sufficient for extracting the total uranium in the waste material. Details for the preparation of synthetic scrap solutions of uraniumaluminum, uranium- stainless steel, and uranium-Zircaloy- 2 are presented. Methods of analysis are described and precision data given for the determination of uranium in these solutions. Further evaluation of the isotopic abundance of uranium by mass spectrometric determination was made, and comparisons are shown for National Bureau of Standards and New Brunswick Laboratory values of standard sample NBS-U- 200.

500|$|The Curtis-Wright reactor was {{dismantled}} and its fuel {{returned to}} the AEC. Martin Company, which soon became Martin Marietta, leased the hot cells, intending to use them {{in the manufacture of}} small radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Curtiss-Wright warned Penn State [...] "that the radiation involved in Martin's operations would be 'extremely high' and of a type that posed a particular risk to human health", but Curtiss-Wright itself had left both solid and liquid radioactive waste in the facility. Some of the Curtiss-Wright waste was contaminated with toxic <b>beryllium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Penn State had acquired the reactor license, and with it came legal responsibility for the nuclear waste on the site; its plan with the AEC called for the release of 90percent of the liquid radioactive waste into the environment and the burial of most radioactive solids on site.
