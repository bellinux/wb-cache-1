40|$|Brief history This Standard {{is one of}} {{a series}} of ECMA {{standards}} defining services and signalling protocols applicable to Private Telecommunication Networks (PTNs). The series uses the ISDN concepts as developed by the ITU-T and is also within the framework of standards for open systems interconnection as defined by ISO. It has been produced under ITSTC work items M-IT- 05 4. 3. 1. 1 and 4. 4 for Bon de commande 75 D. 5. This particular Standard defines the signalling protocol for use at the S reference point in support of basic circuit mode services. It is intended to be supported by a suitable layer 2 protocol, for example Standard ECMA- 105, in the D-channel of a <b>basic</b> <b>access</b> <b>interface</b> or a primary rate access interface. The 1 st Edition of Standard ECMA- 106 was published by ECMA in 1985. A 2 nd Edition was published by ECMA in June 1991, to extend the scope to include the connection of all types of Terminal Equipment to Private Telecommunication Networks, instead of just the connection of Data Processing Equipment to Private Circuit-Switching Networks, and to reflect work undeway in ETSI on the corresponding standard for public ISDNs in Europe. The protocol defined in this 3 rd Edition of Standard ECMA- 106 is based upon that now specified in ETS 300 102 - 1. ETS 300 102 - 1 is applicable to interfaces to public ISDNs at the T reference point, or at coincident S and T reference points if there is no NT 2 function. This ECMA Standard references many of the clauses of ETS 300 102 - 1 to avoid reproducing large quantitie...|$|E

30|$|Results {{for this}} seven factor {{solution}} were then {{compared to the}} structure of the six WBI domains, as stated in the third goal of this research. The Life Evaluation domain, as measured by the Cantril Self-Anchoring Scale (Cantril 1965) was added back into the overall IWBS model. This resulted in an eight factor solution (Life Evaluation, Emotional Health, Physical Health, Work Environment, Healthy Behaviors, and three different constructs related to <b>basic</b> <b>access.</b> In order to meet the third goal of this research, alignment of survey structure with the WBI (Gallup, Inc 2009) and based high correlations between the 3 <b>basic</b> <b>access</b> constructs, these three factors were combined into a single <b>Basic</b> <b>Access</b> domain {{for the remainder of the}} analysis in this research. The final IWBS domains were then identified as Life Evaluation, Emotional Health, Physical Health, Work Environment, Healthy Behaviors, and <b>Basic</b> <b>Access.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{communications}} device and method of communicating using a {{communications device}} is disclosed for transmitting data to a mobile communications network or receiving {{data from a}} mobile communications network. The communications device comprises a transmitter configured to transmit signals representing data to an infrastructure equipment of a mobile communications network via a first wireless <b>access</b> <b>interface,</b> a receiver configured to receive signals from the infrastructure equipment of the mobile communications network via the first wireless <b>access</b> <b>interface,</b> and a controller. The controller controls the transmitter and the receiver to transmit data to the infrastructure equipment in accordance with a synchronous process in which a synchronized response is received from the infrastructure equipment, or to receive data from the infrastructure equipment in accordance with a synchronous process in which a synchronized response is transmitted to the infrastructure equipment. The controller is configured {{in combination with the}} transmitter and the receiver to transmit signals via a second wireless <b>access</b> <b>interface</b> to a communications apparatus operating as a relay node, the signals being for transmission to the infrastructure equipment by the communications apparatus as if the signals were transmitted by the communications device via the first wireless communications interface, to receive signals from the infrastructure via the first wireless <b>access</b> <b>interface,</b> to determine an additional delay caused by the transmission of the signals to the communications apparatus acting as the relay node via the second wireless <b>access</b> <b>interface</b> compared with a time taken which would have been taken to transmit the signals to the infrastructure equipment as if transmitted via the first wireless <b>access</b> <b>interface,</b> and to transmit to the infrastructure equipment an indication from which the infrastructure equipment can derive the determined additional delay for adjusting the transmission or reception of the synchronized response. By arranging for the communications device to determine the additional delay and to communicate the additional delay via the relay node to the infrastructure equipment, the infrastructure equipment can adjust the timing of transmitting or receiving the synchronous response to take account of the additional delay...|$|R
