50|$|Bernhard Rudolf Britz (27 March 1906 - 31 May 1935) was a Swedish road {{racing cyclist}} who won bronze {{medals in the}} {{individual}} and team road races at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Between 1927 and 1933 he won nine national titles, three individual and six in teams. He was also an innovator and developed a <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear,</b> though without much commercial success.|$|E
50|$|The aircraft's 42 ft span wing is {{made from}} {{aluminium}} tubing covered in Dacron and {{is supported by a}} single lift strut on each side, plus a jury strut. The fuselage {{is made from}} fiberglass and features a canopy that is hinged on one side for cockpit access. The cockpit is 22 in wide. The landing gear is either a monowheel gear or, optionally, <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Brown was {{a proponent}} of fixed-gear, single-speed {{bicycles}} for ordinary street use. Brown, with Galen Evans and Osman Isvan, developed a method to determine and compare <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. For any combination of front chainring, rear cog, wheel size and crank length, his method results in a number that Brown terms the [...] "gain ratio". Also, Brown expressed personal opinions on chain cleaning, lubrication and wear, a source of controversy {{in the field of}} bicycle maintenance.|$|E

50|$|In 1894 in the Lipe Shop, Alexander T. Brown and Charles E. Lipe invented their {{two-speed}} Hy-Lo Bi-Gear for bicycles. A year later, in 1895, {{they launched}} the Brown-Lipe Gear Company {{and although the}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> failed to catch on during {{the days of the}} two-wheelers, it soon found a lucrative market in the automobile industry. Lipe's brother, Willard Lipe, stepped up after his brother died in 1898 and the company began making three-speed transmissions. Among his first customers were H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company, Yellow Cab Company and Henry Ford.|$|E
50|$|The Speedhub is more {{expensive}} than competing <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> systems (both hub gears and derailleur gears), and it is about 500 to 1,000 grams heavier than a set of derailleur gears, but it offers the gear range of derailleur gears (and at its ratio of 5.26:1 more range than a typical road bike ratio of 4.28:1 with 50/34 chainrings and 11 to 32 tooth cassette) while requiring significantly less maintenance and having a longer service life. It is therefore mainly used in expensive touring bicycles and in mountain bikes, where its lack of (vulnerable) external components is useful.|$|E
50|$|Causes {{for failure}} of <b>bicycle</b> <b>gearing</b> include: worn teeth, {{damage caused by}} a faulty chain, damage due to thermal expansion, broken teeth due to {{excessive}} pedaling force, interference by foreign objects, and loss of lubrication due to negligence.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{essential}} {{piece of equipment}} for a bicycle messenger is a <b>bicycle.</b> Fixed <b>gear</b> <b>bicycles</b> are common among cyclists for their simplicity and ease of maintenance.

50|$|An early human-powered {{aircraft}} was the Gerhardt Cycleplane, developed by W. Frederick Gerhardt at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio in 1923. The aircraft had seven wings stacked nearly 15 ft high. The pilot pedaled a <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> {{that turned the}} propeller. In early tests the {{aircraft was}} towed into the air by an automobile, and released. With Gerhardt as the pilot, the Cycleplane was able to maintain stable, level flight for short durations. Its only human-powered takeoff was a short hop of 20 ft with the craft rising 2 ft.In 1934, Engelbert Zaschka from Germany completed a large human-powered aircraft, the Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft. On 11 July 1934, the Zaschka-HPA flew about 20 meters on the Berlin Tempelhof Airport; the HPA took off without assisted takeoff.|$|E
5000|$|The belt {{problem is}} used [...] {{in the design}} of aeroplanes, <b>bicycle</b> <b>gearing,</b> cars, and other items with pulleys or belts that cross each other.

50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} compact epicyclic {{hub gear}} was a two-speed designed by William Reilly. It was simply called The Hub and {{was launched in}} 1898 by The Hub 2-Speed Gear Company of Salford. William Reilly signed away his rights to any of his future <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> inventions to The Hub company and soon left them to work at Royce of Manchester. Henry Sturmey took the hub gear concept further and designed a three-speed hub which, unlike the original version of The Hub, incorporated automatic freewheeling. Sturmey successfully applied for a patent for his three-speed hub in August 1901. By March 1902, he had entered an agreement giving sole rights to the hub to Frank Bowden, chairman of the Raleigh bicycle company.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} Sirius fuselage is predominately {{made from}} fibreglass, with wooden bulkheads. The 13.4 m span tapered wing has a wooden spar and Styrofoam wing ribs reinforced with fibreglass and features air brakes {{on the top}} surface for glidepath control. The wing's leading edge is fabricated from hot-wire cut foam, laminated with fibreglass. The wing and rudder are fabric covered. The fixed landing gear is a centre-line <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear,</b> with auxiliary wing tip and tail wheels. The main wheel has a drum brake. The [...] König SC 430 engine, or alternatively the [...] JPX D-320 engine, is mounted behind the cockpit and beneath the tail boom in pusher configuration and features a propeller guard plate just behind the main wheel. The propeller is a fixed pitch two-bladed design with small diameter. The cockpit width is 53 cm and the best glide ratio is 23:1.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, demand {{created by the}} bike boom in the United States {{exceeded}} the capacity of European manufacturers. SunTour and Shimano filled the vacuum. SunTour focused on refining existing systems and designs for mid-level and high-end products. [...] Like Shimano, SunTour initially did not sell complete group-sets, so it teamed with other parts makers, such as Sugino for cranksets and Dia-Compe for brakes, so it could sell a complete line of SunTour branded components. Under these types of production agreements, companies did not have design control; if a cooperating component manufacturer decided not to upgrade or redesign its products, SunTour could do little about it. Shimano decided to greatly expand its research and development staff to 200 employees, enabling the company to end its component marketing agreements {{in order to produce}} hubs, pedals, brakes, and other components on its own in competition with its former partners. In comparison, SunTour chose to continue with its existing research and development staff of some 20 persons, and remained primarily a <b>bicycle</b> <b>gear</b> and shifter manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Gear inches is one {{of several}} {{relative}} measures of <b>bicycle</b> <b>gearing,</b> giving an indication of the mechanical advantage of different gears. Values for 'gear inches' typically range from 20 (very low gearing) via 70 (medium gearing) to 125 (very high gearing); as in a car, low gearing is for going up hills and high gearing is for going fast.|$|R
50|$|The Lipe Shop was the incubus for {{the early}} {{typewriter}} industry in Syracuse. Some of the young engineers {{who came out of}} that enterprise included Alexander T. Brown and brothers Lyman C. Smith, Hurlburt W. Smith and Wilbert Smith who were industrialists. Alexander T. Brown was later credited with inventing the modern typewriter and he also invented <b>bicycle</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1987, Sturmey-Archer {{made only}} 3- and 5-speed hubs, and Fichtel & Sachs and Shimano made only 2- and 3-speed hubs. In that year, {{the first book}} (apart from service manuals) for some 80 years dealing solely with {{epicyclic}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>gears</b> was published. Since then, {{there has been a}} slow but steady increase in interest in hub gears, reflected in the wider range of products now available.|$|R
