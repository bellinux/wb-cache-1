5|$|Initially, the <b>baseband</b> pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International Telecommunication Union set a {{standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the <b>baseband</b> signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E
25|$|An OFDM {{carrier signal}} {{is the sum}} of a number of {{orthogonal}} sub-carriers, with <b>baseband</b> data on each sub-carrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK). This composite <b>baseband</b> signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{picks up}} the signal , which is then quadrature-mixed down to <b>baseband</b> using cosine and sine waves at the carrier frequency. This also creates signals centered on , so low-pass filters are used to reject these. The <b>baseband</b> signals are then sampled and digitised using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and a forward FFT is used to convert back to the frequency domain.|$|E
25|$|SSB {{techniques}} {{can also be}} adapted to frequency-shift and frequency-invert <b>baseband</b> waveforms (voice inversion).|$|E
25|$|GPS {{and phone}} <b>baseband</b> chips from major vendors Qualcomm, Exynos and Broadcom all support GLONASS in {{combination}} with GPS.|$|E
25|$|MediaTek started {{shipping}} SoC solutions with integrated 4G LTE <b>baseband</b> {{in volume}} {{in the second}} half of 2014, which was later than Qualcomm, which had been shipping SoCs with integrated 4G for some time, which was likely to impact MediaTek as Chinese telecom providers such as China Mobile and carriers in other countries push and subsidize LTE technology. Although MediaTek's MT6290 stand-alone 4G <b>baseband</b> combined with its MT6582 or MT6592 SoCs is less profitable for MediaTek than a single-chip 4G solution would be, as of mid-2014 they have been adopted in some models by large manufacturers. However, the first generation of new affordable 4G smartphone models from large MediaTek clients such as Alcatel One Touch and ZTE use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 and 410 platforms with integrated 4G <b>baseband.</b> MediaTek has indicated that chips with 4G were expected to make up 20% of shipments in Q4 2014, with a significant increase expected for 2015, which will also see improvements to its product mix as new 4G chips allow it to target higher market segments.|$|E
25|$|That is, a {{sufficient}} no-loss condition for sampling signals {{that do not}} have <b>baseband</b> components exists that involves the width of the non-zero frequency interval as opposed to its highest frequency component. See Sampling (signal processing) for more details and examples.|$|E
25|$|UTP is also finding {{increasing}} use {{in video}} applications, primarily in security cameras. Many cameras include a UTP output with screw terminals; UTP cable bandwidth has improved {{to match the}} <b>baseband</b> of television signals. As UTP is a balanced transmission line, a balun is needed to connect to unbalanced equipment, for example any using BNC connectors and designed for coaxial cable.|$|E
25|$|The {{orthogonality}} {{also allows}} high spectral efficiency, {{with a total}} symbol rate near the Nyquist rate for the equivalent <b>baseband</b> signal (i.e. near half the Nyquist rate for the double-side band physical passband signal). Almost the whole available frequency band can be utilized. OFDM generally has a nearly 'white' spectrum, giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co-channel users.|$|E
25|$|Single-sideband {{modulation}} (SSB) is a {{refinement of}} amplitude modulation that more efficiently uses electrical power and bandwidth. Single-sideband modulation produces a modulated output signal {{that has a}} bandwidth identical {{to that of the}} original <b>baseband</b> signal, unlike amplitude modulation which has double the bandwidth. Although John Renshaw Carson invented SBB in 1915, his patent was not granted until March 27, 1923.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{current is}} used to {{transmit}} information, as {{in the cases of}} telephone and cable television. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. POTS telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the <b>baseband</b> audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information over the air.|$|E
25|$|According to {{information}} provided in MediaTek's Q1 2014 financial results conference call, {{in terms of}} product mix, MediaTek's smartphone chipset shipments consisted of 5-10% single-core, 45-55% dual-core, 30-35% quad-core and 5-10% octa-core. Most octa-cores were sold in China, while the export market (chips sold directly to manufacturers {{in countries such as}} India) was dominated by dual-core. In terms of <b>baseband</b> technology (smartphones only), WCDMA was 50-55%, TD 25-30% and EDGE 10-15%. According to MediaTek's Q3 2014 conference call, dual-core shipments for entry-level devices continued to be important {{in the second half of}} 2014 with an increase in export shipments as MediaTek's competitiveness China was affected by the transition to 4G.|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other <b>baseband</b> signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} IBM CGA {{graphics card}} {{was equipped with}} 16kilobytes of video memory and could be connected either to a dedicated direct-drive CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) RGBI interface, such as the IBM 5153 color display, or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector. The RCA connector provided only <b>baseband</b> video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate RF modulator unless the TV had an RCA jack though with the former combined with an amplifier sometimes was more practical since one could then hook up an antenna to the amplifier and get wireless video.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{information}} to be transmitted (i.e., the <b>baseband</b> signal) is [...] and the sinusoidal carrier is , where fc is the carrier's base frequency, and Ac is the carrier's amplitude, the modulator combines the carrier with the <b>baseband</b> data signal to get the transmitted signal: ...|$|E

2500|$|Shifting the <b>baseband</b> signal 90° out {{of phase}} cannot be done simply by delaying it, as it {{contains}} a large range of frequencies. In analog circuits, a wideband 90-degree phase-difference network is used. The method was popular {{in the days of}} vacuum tube radios, but later gained a bad reputation due to poorly adjusted commercial implementations. [...] Modulation using this method is again gaining popularity in the homebrew and DSP fields. [...] This method, utilizing the Hilbert transform to phase shift the <b>baseband</b> audio, can be done at low cost with digital circuitry.|$|E
2500|$|Single-sideband has the {{mathematical}} form of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) {{in the special}} case {{where one of the}} <b>baseband</b> waveforms is derived from the other, instead of being independent messages: ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{variety of}} custom ROM images {{exist for the}} P500, notably Cyanogenmod 7.2 [...] First Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) Images are {{available}} at xda-developers, yet these still have video playback performance issues due to missing libraries for hardware assisted decoding. It is also possible to run Android 4.4.1 (KitKat) on this phone. LG has released two different <b>Baseband</b> driver versions, the one {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "old baseband" [...] was shipped with the official Android 2.2 ROM images, while the [...] "new baseband" [...] is shipped with the official Android 2.3 ROMs. Depending on the custom ROM one wants to use, the matching <b>baseband</b> has to be installed on the device (for instance the official Cyanogenmod 7.2 ROM-Image uses the new <b>baseband,</b> the unofficial Cyanogenmod 7.1 Image requires the old one). The easiest way to change between <b>baseband</b> versions is to install the corresponding official firmware. To be able to install custom ROM images one has to get root access to the phone, voiding warranty in the process. The Android 2.2 firmware shipped by LG suffers a severe security vulnerability that can be exploited for this purpose by an app named Gingerbreak. On the official Android 2.3 ROM images rooting by an Android App does not seem to work, yet with a PC connected by USB, SuperOneClick and the Android Debug Bridge one can get root access as well. The easiest way to install a custom ROM from the SD-Card is to flash it through ClockworkMod recovery.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the <b>Baseband</b> Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every <b>baseband</b> has a unique Electronic Serial Number (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The <b>baseband</b> processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The <b>baseband</b> processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|E
2500|$|Current GPS {{and phone}} <b>baseband</b> chips from major vendors ST-Ericsson, Broadcom CSR [...] and Qualcomm all support GLONASS in {{combination}} with GPS. Any import restriction {{is likely to have}} little change as most devices shipping worldwide will soon support GLONASS.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} installation, {{data for the}} {{transmit}} pulses are stored in digital memory as a sequence of <b>baseband</b> I/Q samples (see quadrature phase), or as samples of a low IF waveform, and read out to a high speed D/A converters, as required. [...] The analogue signal, so formed, is up-converted for transmission. [...] On reception, returning signals are amplified and, typically, converted to a low IF or to <b>baseband</b> I/Q signals before being digitised by A/D converters. [...] The compression of the chirps and additional signal processing is all performed by a digital computer, which has stored within it the chirp pulse data needed {{to carry out the}} compression process numerically.|$|E
2500|$|More specifically, a {{line code}} [...] (or <b>baseband</b> {{transmission}} scheme) representing the data using pulse-amplitude modulation with 2N different voltage levels, can transfer N bit/pulse. A digital modulation method (or passband transmission scheme) using 2N different symbols, for example 2N amplitudes, phases or frequencies, can transfer N bit/symbol. This results in: ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of <b>baseband</b> frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a beat frequency oscillator (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning.(mixing down to base band). For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted.|$|E
2500|$|In radio communications, single-sideband {{modulation}} (SSB) or single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation (SSB-SC) {{is a type}} of modulation, used {{to transmit}} information, an audio signal, by radio waves. [...] It is a refinement of amplitude modulation which uses transmitter power and bandwidth more efficiently. Amplitude modulation produces an output signal that has twice the bandwidth of the original <b>baseband</b> signal. Single-sideband modulation avoids this bandwidth doubling, and the power wasted on a carrier, at the cost of increased device complexity and more difficult tuning at the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} <b>baseband</b> bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the <b>baseband</b> signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E
2500|$|As an example, {{consider}} an IF SSB signal centered at frequency [...] = 45000Hz. The <b>baseband</b> frequency {{it needs to}} be shifted to is [...] = 2000Hz. The BFO output waveform is [...] When the signal is multiplied by (aka 'heterodyned with') the BFO waveform, it shifts the signal to [...] and to , which is known as the beat frequency or image frequency. The objective is to choose an [...] that results in [...] = 2000Hz. (The unwanted components at [...] can be removed by a lowpass filter (for which an output transducer or the human ear may serve)).|$|E
2500|$|John Renshaw Carson in 1915 did {{the first}} {{mathematical}} analysis of amplitude modulation, showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands {{on either side of}} the carrier frequency, and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original <b>baseband</b> signal. [...] His analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal, and Carson patented single-sideband modulation (SSB) on 1 December 1915. This more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by AT for longwave transatlantic telephone service beginning 7 January 1927. [...] After WW2 it was developed by the military for aircraft communication.|$|E
2500|$|Complex {{sampling}} (I/Q sampling) is {{the simultaneous}} sampling of two different, but related, waveforms, resulting in pairs of samples that are subsequently treated as complex numbers. When one waveform is the Hilbert transform {{of the other}} waveform the complex-valued function, [...] is called an analytic signal, whose Fourier transform is zero for all negative values of frequency. [...] In that case, the Nyquist rate for a waveform with no frequencies ≥B {{can be reduced to}} just B (complex samples/sec), instead of 2B (real samples/sec). [...] More apparently, the equivalent <b>baseband</b> waveform, [...] also has a Nyquist rate of B, because all of its non-zero frequency content is shifted into the interval ...|$|E
2500|$|Requirements for {{the minimum}} amount of RAM for devices running Android7.1 range from in {{practice}} 2GB for best hardware, down to 1GB for the most common screen, to absolute minimum 512MB for lowest spec 32-bit smartphone.

[...] Android 4.4 requires a 32-bit ARMv7, MIPS or x86 architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports), together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible graphics processing unit (GPU). Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and as of latest major version, 3.2 and Vulkan. Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.|$|E
