25|$|At Paramount, Arzner {{directed}} Clara Bow's first talkie, The Wild Party (1929). To allow Bow to {{move freely}} on the set, Arzner had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod, essentially creating the first boom mike. She did not, however, take out a patent. One year later one was filed for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the Fox Film Corporation. Although {{not the first to}} patent the <b>boom</b> <b>microphone,</b> Arzner is still credited with its invention.|$|E

500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a <b>boom</b> <b>microphone</b> suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the third}} season the series {{occasionally}} breaks the fourth wall. For example, in [...] "Physical Credit" [...] Wanda and Brent {{are talking about}} films with poor production values when a <b>boom</b> <b>microphone</b> (in use recording the scene) drops into the shot and hits Wanda on the head. [...] To promote the [...] "Merry Gasmas" [...] episode in 2005, Brent Butt recorded [...] with Craig Northey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} produced in New York City, with occasional stints in California. It was {{not live in}} its early years, although during the 1970s, NBC fed the live taping from Burbank to New York via satellite for editing (see below). The program had been done [...] "live on tape" [...] (uninterrupted unless a problem occurred) since the Jack Paar days. Carson had a talent for quick quips to deal with problems. If the opening monologue fared poorly, the band would start playing [...] "Tea for Two" [...] and Carson danced a softshoe to laughs from the studio audience. Alternatively, Carson might pull the <b>boom</b> <b>microphone</b> close {{to his face and}} announce, [...] "Attention K-Mart shoppers!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an early}} sound film drama, Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster {{father in a}} moment of desperation. [...] A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to {{disguise}} herself as a young boy and escape the law by [...] "riding the rails" [...] with him. [...] In a hobo encampment, or [...] "jungle," [...] they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. [...] Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the <b>boom</b> <b>microphone</b> was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies.|$|E
2500|$|The rapid-fire comedic {{interplay between}} Somers, Carroll, Blackman and audio {{operator}} Murray Tregonning {{was central to}} the show's success. Blackman kept up a near-constant stream of jokes and remarks, and he also provided {{the voice of the}} show's many invented characters; some were merely voiced, while others were seen in various forms, including [...] "Mrs McGillicuddy" [...] (a stock photo of a toothless old woman), [...] "Angel" [...] (a Barbie doll dressed as an angel and Chroma keyed into the scene), [...] "Norman Neumann" [...] (pronounced Noiman), a talking Neumann <b>boom</b> <b>microphone,</b> [...] "The Man From Jupiter" [...] and the character that became an icon of the show, cheeky [...] "schoolboy" [...] Dickie Knee (a ball with a school baseball cap and long black-haired wig, stuck on a stick) who would pop up in front of Daryl (operated by a stage hand) and make rude remarks.|$|E
2500|$|While {{considered}} simple by today's standards, the [...] "flying" [...] {{effects on}} Adventures of Superman were advanced for the period, although during season one {{it was apparent}} that, for distance flight shots, Superman was lying on a flat surface, his torso and thighs noticeably flattened between elbows and knees. Beginning with season two, Superman's [...] "flying" [...] involved three phases: take-off, flight, and landing. Cables and wires were used for Superman’s take-offs early in filming. In early episodes, stuntmen sometimes replaced Reeves for Superman’s wire-assisted take-offs. When Reeves came close to suffering a concussion in the episode [...] "Ghost Wolf" [...] (the supporting wires snapped and he fell to the studio floor), cables and wires were discarded and a springboard was brought in, designed by Thol [...] "Si" [...] Simonson, who remained with the series until its end. Reeves would run into frame and hit the out-of-frame springboard, which would boost him out of frame (sometimes over the camera) and onto padding. The springboard had enough force, along with subtle camera manipulation, {{to make it look}} as though he was actually taking off. The flying scenes were accomplished through a relatively few number of repeated shots. The typical technique had footage of Reeves stretched out on a spatula-like device formed to his torso and leg, operated on a counterweight like a <b>boom</b> <b>microphone,</b> allowing him to bank as if in flight. In a couple of later episodes, such as [...] "The Atomic Secret", Reeves simulated flying, opting to lie on the device without the molded form to support his legs, which are seen to hang from the waist in those episodes in marked contrast to the stock footage of Superman in flight.|$|E

2500|$|Buses and streetcars use the Communications and Information System (CIS). This system employs {{transmit}} facilities {{throughout the}} city. Each bus and streetcar has a Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP) set on board. This {{is attached to}} a transponder receiver, which allows CIS operators to track the location of the vehicle using an older computational system known as dead reckoning. The TRUMP also allows the operators and CIS operators to send and receive text messages for such things as short turns and route adjustments. There is also the option of voice communications between the operator and the CIS operator. The CIS was conceived in the late 1970s and was fully implemented in 1991. With the introduction of the NextBus GPS technology, the CIS positioning system is now using a combination of GPS data and the old dead reckoning sign-post system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on Bell Mobility's CDMA network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control. Recently, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer computer aided dispatch (CAD/AVL) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). There is no current estimate of when this technology is to be implemented. Each TRUMP unit on every streetcar and bus is equipped with a silent [...] "yellow alarm" [...] key which can be activated by the operator {{in the event of an}} emergency on board. When activated, CIS supervisors and transit control dispatchers are able to hear what is going on via a high-quality <b>boom</b> <b>microphone</b> located in front of the steering wheel and dispatch emergency responders. There is also a [...] "red alarm" [...] key, which enables one way communication with CIS once pressed. This can be used in events such as fires when immediate assistance is required and two-way voice communication would prove detrimental to safety.|$|E

2500|$|A noise-canceling {{microphone}} is {{a highly}} directional design intended for noisy environments. [...] One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as <b>boom</b> <b>microphones</b> on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source {{and the second is}} positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson. A few noise-canceling microphones are throat microphones.|$|R
5000|$|Usually, non-anamorphic 4-perf {{films are}} filmed {{directly}} on the entire full frame silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a married print is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 fullscreen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame ("open matte") instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, {{the decision to use}} it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and [...] "protect" [...] for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as <b>boom</b> <b>microphones,</b> cables, and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the unmatted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).|$|R
