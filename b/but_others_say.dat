5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. <b>But</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E

25|$|There {{is still}} {{controversy}} {{about the reasons}} for the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some argue it {{is a direct result of}} alcohol's toxic effect on the nerves, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> factors such as a nutritional deficiency or chronic liver disease may play a role in the development as well. This debate is ongoing and research is continuing in an effort to discover the real cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E

25|$|The Lost Dutchman's {{is perhaps}} the most famous lost mine in American history. Arizona place-name expert Byrd Granger wrote, as of 1977, the Lost Dutchman's story had been printed or cited at least six times more often than two other fairly {{well-known}} tales, the story of Captain Kidd's lost treasure, and the story of the Lost Pegleg mine in California. People have been seeking the Lost Dutchman's mine since at least 1892, while according to one estimate, 8,000 people annually made some effort to locate the Lost Dutchman's mine. Former Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin is among those who have looked for the mine. Some argue that {{there is little or no}} evidence for the mine's existence, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that the main components of the story have at least some basis in fact.|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by {{an examination of the}} attacks on the Pentagon. The film opposes the official story of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, alleging that the path of destruction does not match what a 757 would leave. In particular it claims that the size of the hole in the Pentagon, a lack of debris and, little landscape damage seem inconsistent with prior airliner crashes. It also alleges that too few parts were recovered from the crash site to reliably ascertain that they were of a Boeing 757, and that a flywheel observed at the site seemed too small to {{have been part of the}} aircraft's engine turbine. Experts officially declared that the wheel was part of the APU, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> it didn't come from the APU of a 757 but likely from an E-3 Sentry aircraft. The film also claims that the alleged hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour had difficulty operating basic controls on a small Cessna that he rented at a flight school, and that perhaps not even an experienced pilot could have maneuvered the reflex angle of turn at the airspeed and altitude at which the aircraft approached without going into a high speed stall. The film mentions three cameras on nearby buildings that allegedly caught the entire incident at the Pentagon on film, which it says the government confiscated and has refused to release in full.|$|E
500|$|Sideshow Bob's {{full name}} is Robert Underdunk Terwilliger. His last name was first {{revealed}} in [...] "Black Widower" [...] while his middle name was first mentioned in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts". Competing theories {{as to the}} origin of his name exist; some sources say he was named after the character Dr. Terwilliker, a megalomaniac outwitted by a boy named Bart in the film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T by Dr. Seuss, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> he was named after Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. Yet another theory {{is that he was}} named after Sergeant Terwilliger and Mrs. Underdunk in the pilot episode of the TV show Hunter.|$|E

500|$|Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act {{and other}} efforts to {{compromise}} on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln would write in 1855, [...] "I think I am a Whig, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I {{do no more than}} oppose the extension of slavery." [...] Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members, the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. Lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing Whig Party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement.|$|E

Spix wrote: [...] "habitat gregarius, rarissimus licet, propre Joazeiro in campis riparüs fluminis St. Francisci, voce tenui insignis" [...] ("it lives in flocks, although very rare, near Joazeiro in the region bordering the rio São Francisco, [...] notable for its thin voice").|$|E

5000|$|The {{name of the}} Pound, Wilpena, is {{reported}} to be Aboriginal, meaning [...] "place of bent fingers"; this might either be a reference to the mountains resembling the shape of a gently cupped hand, or the freezing cold of the ranges in winter. The traditional owners, the Adnyamathanha, however, have no such word in their language. Their name for the Pound is Ikara which means [...] "meeting place". It's not clear who named St Mary Peak: a somewhat discredited turn-of-the-century account has the surveyor B.H. Babbage naming it in 1856, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>says</b> that the pastoralist George Marchant suggested the name while in the area in 1851, and the latter explanation is more likely.|$|R

Others think the doll is simply a Shirley Temple doll. It is in fact a Shirley Temple doll, despite reasonable suspicion that it is a Twilight Zone reference. Talky Tina can be found in the library of Disney's Hollywood Studios version in Florida.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} the {{apostrophe}} in the group's name was for a while open to conjecture. Some commentators {{said it was a}} deliberate attempt to appeal to a youthful audience by imitating an informal, uneducated style; others suggested it was simply a case of bad grammar on the part of its creator; <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> it was simply that the owner of the domain hearsay.com, refused to license the name to the band. [...] One explanation for its inclusion is that a Canadian band had already been using the name [...] "Hearsay" [...] since 1992. Interviewed on BBC1's Breakfast on 4 June 2008, Suzanne Shaw stated that the apostrophe was included because [...] "it looked good on paper, it was a design thing". In her best-selling book on punctuation, Eats, Shoots & Leaves, the author Lynne Truss states that [...] "the naming of Hear'Say in 2001 was [...] a significant milestone on the road to punctuation anarchy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may {{have much to do with}} that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. If you give me good music, I'll give you a great show," [...] implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. <b>But</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going [...] "Heya-heya-heya-heya" [...] sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.|$|E

5000|$|Although killing oneself is {{forbidden}} under normal Jewish law {{as being a}} denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed {{no choice but to}} either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples). As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for [...] "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying [...] "to sanctify God's Name". (See: Martyrdom).

60|$|We {{walked a}} mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width; a road paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a {{considerable}} degree of engineering skill. Some {{say that that}} wise old pagan, Kamehameha I planned and built it, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> it was built so long before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out of the traditions. In either case, however, as the handiwork of an untaught and degraded race it {{is a thing of}} pleasing interest. The stones are worn and smooth, and pushed apart in places, so that the road has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of Rome which one sees in pictures.|$|E
60|$|By {{this fire}} stood the Prince, whom I knew from his statues. His years {{appeared}} fewer than mine although {{we were born}} upon the same day, and {{he was tall and}} thin, very fair also for one of our people, perhaps because of the Syrian blood that ran in his veins. His hair was straight and brown like to that of northern folk who come to trade in the markets of Egypt, and his eyes were grey rather than black, set beneath somewhat prominent brows such as those of his father, Meneptah. His face was sweet as a woman's, but made curious by certain wrinkles which ran from the corners of the eyes towards the ears. I think that these came from the bending of the brow in thought, <b>but</b> <b>others</b> <b>say</b> that they were inherited from an ancestress on the female side. Bakenkhonsu my friend, the old prophet who served under the first Seti and died but the other day, having lived a hundred and twenty years, told me that he knew her before she was married, and that she and her descendant, Seti, might have been twins.|$|E
