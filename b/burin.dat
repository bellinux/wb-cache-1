5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued {{in response to}} Isaac on October 1 for the Avalon Peninsula. The watch was upgraded to a {{tropical storm}} warning the next day, while a separate watch was posted for the <b>Burin</b> and Bonavista peninsulas, though it was quickly discontinued. By 2100 UTC on October 2, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were lifted. Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were expected, prompting the issuance of rainfall warnings for parts of southeastern Newfoundland, while wind and gale advisories were declared offshore.|$|E

25|$|The {{excavation}} of Mureybet has produced {{an abundance of}} lithic material. During all periods, flint was the main raw material from which tools were made. It was procured from local sources. Obsidian was much less common. Natufian tools include points, <b>burins,</b> scrapers, borers and herminettes, a kind of tool that was primarily used for woodwork. Flint arrowheads appeared in the Khiamian period. Other stone tools included <b>burins,</b> end-scrapers and borers. Mureybetian stone tools included Mureybet arrowheads, scrapers and <b>burins,</b> while borers were much less common. During the PPNB phase, Byblos arrowheads replaced the Mureybetian types, and other technological improvements were also introduced.|$|R
5|$|Dunderdale also {{announced}} soon after being sworn {{in that she}} wanted to end a year-long strike on the <b>Burin</b> Peninsula that involved 15 home care workers. The government had been called on to settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government. Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Dunderdale {{was on an}} action {{committee}} that successfully lobbied Fishery Products International to reverse a decision to shut down its <b>Burin</b> fish plant. The committee was successful and the plant remains in operation. She worked {{as a social worker}} with the provincial Department of Social Services, and accepted an offer to be part of an appeals board for inshore fishers after the cod moratorium.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence {{produced}} powerful winds peaking at 101mph (163km/h) {{and moderate}} amounts of rainfall {{of up to}} 2.6inches (67mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport and also to the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed {{a house in the}} small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to shingles and sides of homes, while the strong waves damaged roads and boats along the <b>Burin</b> Peninsula.|$|E

40|$|The {{industry}} of Plasenn-al-Lomm (a site that probably {{belongs to the}} Upper Perigordian) is defined by an abundance of <b>burins.</b> These <b>burins</b> show various methods of resharpening and contain some intermediate pieces between tools and cores. Despite a lack of backed-bladelet, a localised bladelet production exits and goes with a very significant deficit in burin-spalls. These facts are suggesting the assumption that a backed-bladelet production did exist, but has left only few traces. The blanks used for this production should have been bladelet {{as well as some}} burin-spalls from specific <b>burins,</b> which are designed as cores and not as tools.

50|$|Technological {{diagnostics}} of the Dorset culture include small, triangular end-blades; soapstone; and <b>burins.</b> The end-blades were hafted onto harpoon heads. They primarily {{used the}} harpoons to hunt seal, but also hunted larger sea mammals such as walrus and narwhals. They used soapstone to make kudlik (lamps), which when filled with seal oil, would heat the Dorset dwellings {{during the cold}} and dark months. The distinctive <b>burins</b> were a special type of stone flake with a chisel-like edge. They were probably used for engraving, or for carving wood or bone. The <b>burins</b> were also used by Pre-Dorset groups; they usually had a distinctive mitten shape.|$|R
5|$|Dunderdale {{served on}} the <b>Burin</b> town council and worked {{with an array of}} organizations, {{including}} the local school board and the Status of Women. She was president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador and after her husband retired from the sea and her children moved away for university, she became heavily involved in the consulting company her husband had started. She help found Women in Resource Development Corporation (WRDC) in 1997, an organization that works to get women involved in the trades and technology sector in Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
5|$|Kathleen Mary Margaret Warren {{was born}} and raised in <b>Burin,</b> Newfoundland and Labrador by her mother Alice and father Norman, she was one of 11 children. Dunderdale {{received}} a High School diploma in 1970. After attending Memorial University of Newfoundland for social work, she dropped out of university to get married. She met her late husband, Captain Peter Dunderdale, in 1972 while she was home from university for the summer. Captain Dunderdale was a British master mariner whose boat was in dry dock undergoing repairs. The couple had a son, Tom, and daughter, Sarah, together and Dunderdale was a stay-at-home mom during their formative years, while her husband sailed the world. When her children grew older, she worked away from home in many different volunteer roles.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} impacts from Igor {{were attributed to}} torrential rains, which led to excessive runoff and flash flooding. Several rivers rose to record levels across the Bonavista and <b>Burin</b> Peninsulas where many roads were washed out. Entire bridges, homes and portions of roads were destroyed. In some instances, flood waters were higher than entire homes. In response to the widespread floods, Newfoundland Power Inc. warned residents who still had power by the afternoon of September21 to turn off their main electrical panel if water enters their basement. Parts of St. Bernard's – Jacques Fontaine had to be evacuated by boat during the storm as rising water flooded {{some areas of the}} small town. Portions of Clarenville had to be evacuated under similar circumstances after a state of emergency was declared for the town. Water and sewage lines in Sunnyside broke due to flooding. In Glovertown, downed power lines sparked two fires during the storm, both of which were put out by firefighters without injuries.|$|E

5|$|Roughly a {{month after}} the storm, a benefit concert was held in St. John's. The concert raised about $400,000 (2010CAD) toward storm relief in one night. In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours. Following {{more than a year of}} discussions, the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous insurance claims, reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course of the recovery phase, several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the <b>Burin</b> Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point. An additional $200,000 had been pledged by donors.|$|E

25|$|Thereafter {{engraving}} {{tended to}} lose ground to etching, {{which was a}} much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although Rembrandt's prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, {{many of them have}} some <b>burin</b> or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.|$|E

50|$|Light-duty {{tools are}} mainly flakes. There are scrapers, awls (with points for boring) and <b>burins</b> (with points for engraving). Some of these {{functions}} belong also to heavy-duty tools. For example, there are heavy-duty scrapers.|$|R
50|$|An {{impressive}} 2000 stone artefacts {{were found}} made mainly from bluegrey silex. The silex occurs enclosed in Santonian limestones which crop {{out in the}} vicinity. Several varieties of brown flints were also used, mainly for <b>burins</b> and knives.|$|R
50|$|Artifacts {{found at}} this level include {{lanceolate}} points with heavy edge grinding, sub-conical microblade cores, microblades and scrapers. The upper layer of this level also has notched points, lanceolates, flake <b>burins,</b> microblades, a microblade core and a graver spur on a flake.|$|R
25|$|Traditional engraving, by <b>burin</b> or {{with the}} use of machines, {{continues}} to be practised by goldsmiths, glass engravers, gunsmiths and others, while modern industrial techniques such as photoengraving and laser engraving have many important applications. Engraved gems were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers relief as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.|$|E
25|$|Each graver is {{different}} and has its own use. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a <b>burin,</b> or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate. However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. Dies used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.|$|E
25|$|Punch and Judy {{shows have}} always taken place during summer {{right next to}} the pier on the beach to the west of it, and this {{tradition}} is continued in the annual Herne Bay Festival. Pierrots used to perform in the open air {{at the end of the}} pier until 1914, and in 2009 a recreation of such a show at the Herne Bay Bandstand was specially commissioned by the Council for Herne Bay Festival. Ken Russell chose Herne Bay Pier as the backdrop to the opening sequence of his first feature film, French Dressing (1963), and returned to Herne Bay in 2008 to bemoan the missing pier. It also featured in Hugues <b>Burin</b> des Roziers' film Blue jeans - Du beurre aux Allemands, filmed in 1976. In 2008 Canterbury art students designed a virtual pier as part of the Cultural Trail.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{culture in}} the tradition {{is known as the}} Châtelperronian which produced denticulate tools and distinctive flint knives. It is argued that this was superseded by the Gravettian with its Font Robert points and Noailles <b>burins.</b> The tradition culminated in the proto-Magdalenian.|$|R
50|$|Wax carving is {{the shaping}} of wax using tools usually {{associated}} with machining: rotary tools, saws, files and <b>burins</b> or gravers. Actual knives can be used and most certainly are, but the hardness of the material is such {{that they are not}} the ideal tool, generally.|$|R
