2500|$|The race {{seemingly}} {{having been}} decided by progress through <b>bed-pan</b> slops, Curll prays to Jove, who consults the goddess Cloacina. He hears the prayer, passes {{a pile of}} feces down, and catapults Curll to the victory. As Curll grabs the phantom Moore, the poems {{it seemed to have}} fly back to their real authors, and even the clothes go to the unpaid tailors who had made them (James Moore Smythe had run through an inherited fortune and bankrupted himself by 1727). Dulness urges Curll to repeat the joke, to pretend to the public that his dull poets were really great poets, to print things by false names. (Curll had published numerous works by [...] "Joseph Gay" [...] to trick the public into thinking they were by John Gay.) For his victory, she awards Curll a tapestry showing the fates of famous Dunces. On it, he sees Daniel Defoe with his ears chopped off, John Tutchin being whipped publicly through western England, two political journalists clubbed to death (on the same day), and himself being wrapped in a blanket and whipped by the schoolboys of Westminster (for having printed an unauthorised edition of the sermons of the school's master, thereby robbing the school's own printer).|$|E
50|$|Tanpuri: {{small-scale}} instruments, {{used for}} accompanying instrumental soloists. It is {{two to three}} feet long, with a flat <b>bed-pan</b> type wooden body with a slightly curved tabli. It may have from four to six strings. Tamburi are tuned to the higher octave and are the preferred instruments for accompanying solo performances by string-playing artists, as the lighter, more transparent sound does not drown out the lower register of a sitar, sarod, or sarangi.|$|E
5000|$|In 1688, at {{the time}} of the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart, son and heir of King James II, when the new prince was widely {{believed}} to have been smuggled into the Queen's bedchamber in a <b>bed-pan,</b> Witherley was Second Physician to the King and gave evidence that he had been present at the birth. He deposed that he [...] "saw Mrs Labadie bring the child from the midwife, and carry him into the next room... and saw the child before he was cleaned..." [...] A strong royalist, he was later accused by the Whig historian Burnett of being complicit in a plot by King James to turn a changeling into Prince of Wales so that there could be a Roman Catholic heir to the throne.|$|E
50|$|A list of non-food {{humanitarian}} assistance {{for the elderly}} was formed in Donetsk. These are crutches, walkers, walking sticks, close stools, diapers, swaddling clothes, <b>bed-pans,</b> hygiene packages, underwear and applicators. More than fifteen hundred older people received this inventory.|$|R
50|$|Union {{medical care}} {{improved}} dramatically during 1862. By {{the end of}} the year each regiment was being regularly supplied with a standard set of medical supplies included medical books, supplies of medicine, small hospital furniture like <b>bed-pans,</b> containers for mixing medicines, spoons, vials, bedding, lanterns, and numerous other implements. A new layer of medical treatment was added in January 1863. A division level hospital was established under the command of a Surgeon-in-Chief. The new divisional hospitals took over the role of the brigade hospitals as a rendezvous point for transports to the general hospitals. The wagons transported the wounded to nearby railroad depots where they could be quickly transported to the general hospitals at the military supply hubs. The divisional hospitals were given large staffs, nurses, cooks, several doctors, and large tents to accommodate up to one hundred soldiers each. The new division hospitals began keeping detailed medical records of patients. The divisional hospitals were established at a safe distance from battlefields where patients could be safely helped after transport from the regimental or brigade hospitals.|$|R

40|$|Aim: to {{determine}} how collecting urine voided directly into a container compares with urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration. Method: urine samples were collected in a sterile recipient placed in the toilet or in the <b>bed-pan</b> during voiding, after the vulval region had been cleaned by water. These samples were compared with samples of the same urine obtained by suprapubic aspiration. The samples were examined for pyuria and bacteriuria. Applying the Kass criteria on the voided urine specimen and assessing the presence of leucocyturia, {{it was possible to}} differentiate urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria and contamination. Results: all 13 cases of infection found on suprapubic aspiration were also identified by this sampling technique. The technique produced four false-positive results. Conclusion: this simple sampling method may not only obviate the need for suprapubic aspiration but also for bladder catheterization in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in many elderly women...|$|E
