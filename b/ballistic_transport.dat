50|$|Ballistic {{conduction}} is the unimpeded flow of charge, or energy-carrying particles, over relatively {{long distances}} in a material.

Thus, <b>ballistic</b> <b>transport</b> in a material is determined by how ballistically conductive that material is. Ballistic conduction differs from superconductivity due to the absence of the Meissner effect in the material. A ballistic conductor would stop conducting if the driving force is turned off, whereas in a superconductor current would continue to flow after the driving supply is disconnected.|$|E
