5|$|Eastwood next {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards <b>Breezy</b> (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films {{over the next ten}} years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of <b>Breezy</b> because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. <b>Breezy</b> was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined {{with a lack of}} passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing <b>breezy</b> conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|The temple takes {{advantage}} of Singapore's abundant sunlight by having three different kinds of solar energy cells on its rooftop. They are the poly-crystalline silicon solar array, mono-crystalline silicon solar array and amorphous silicon solar array. Poh Ern Shih's water is heated by its solar panels, and its night lighting is powered by electricity converted from solar energy, With its <b>breezy</b> location, wind generators have also been erected to convert wind activity into electricity.|$|E

50|$|The Rainbow Celebration {{is almost}} near as {{everyone}} in Ponyville prepares and awaits the first rainbow of the season. Meanwhile, at the magical city of Unicornia, Cheerilee is teaching a young unicorn pony named Rarity {{about being a}} Rainbow Princess and her duties to make the First Rainbow of the Season using the magic wand. Rarity is still young and she accidentally uses the wand, which in turn teleports her {{into the middle of}} Breezie Blossom. Cheerilee, Brights Brightly and Whistle Wishes venture outside Unicornia in search of her. Rarity befriends the <b>Breezies</b> and they visit Ponyville and later Rarity feels homesick. Pinkie Pie, Minty, Rainbow Dash, Spike and the <b>Breezies</b> help her get home, {{just in time for the}} first rainbow of the season.|$|R
5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but <b>Breezy</b> was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|Booth brought {{himself into}} {{contention}} for the Test selection {{with a series}} of strong displays in 196061. He aggregated 981 runs at an average of 65.40, with three centuries. Only five players scored more runs, all at lower averages. Two of the centuries were in combined Australian XI matches {{at the end of the}} season for expected Test squad members. In a match against the Tasmanian Tigers, Booth struck a <b>breezy</b> 100 from 104 balls in 90 minutes of batting. Another highlight was an 87 against the touring West Indies, helping New South Wales to complete an innings win. Booth's productivity helped his state to another Sheffield Shield win.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of <b>breezy</b> sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E
5000|$|My Little Pony: The Princess Promenade (February 7, 2006) - Featured {{the debut}} of the [...] "G3" [...] {{incarnation}} of Spike the Dragon.

5000|$|It {{appeared}} on Dylan's album Blood on the Tracks, released in January 1975. According to the Telegraph {{the song is}} the album's [...] "simplest, <b>breeziest</b> song - yet it remains heartbreaking in its almost carefree surrender to the inevitability of romantic pain." [...] Dylan has not performed the song since 1976.|$|R
60|$|This may {{be taken}} as a fairly {{accurate}} description of the real state of Mr. Barrett's mind on one subject. It is illustrative of the very best and <b>breeziest</b> side of Elizabeth Barrett's character that she could be so genuinely humorous over so tragic a condition of the human mind.|$|R
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during <b>breezy</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{conditions}} became more <b>breezy</b> but remained {{hot in the}} Saturday morning practice sessions. Häkkinen was fastest in the third practice session {{with a time of}} 1:19.115. Barrichello was second quickest, recording a lap time 0.089 seconds slower than Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher was third fastest, two-tenths of a second in front of Trulli, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve. Frentzen, Fisichella, Verstappen and Herbert completed the top ten. Coulthard did not set a lap during the third session as his team changed his engine as it developed an electrical problem. In the final practice session, Coulthard had a trouble-free session and was fastest with a time of 1:18.654. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello maintained their pace from Friday and were second and third fastest. Häkkinen was fourth quickest and was unable to improve his time as he passed an area with waved yellow flags. Trulli was fifth fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher who was running quicker after set-up changes. Villeneuve, Frentzen, Salo and Fisichella completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|The Lil <b>Breezy</b> was {{inspired}} by the similar RLU-1 <b>Breezy</b> and designed to comply with the United States FAR Part 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules in its single place version and also the US light-sport aircraft rules. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a single-seat or optionally a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit without a windshield, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.|$|E
50|$|The release scored chart {{success in}} many European {{countries}} peaking at #2 in the Netherlands and #3 in Belgium. It {{was the least}} successful release to date in the UK hitting #17, but received the more airplay than previous hits from national station BBC Radio 1 due to the change in direction to a much lighter, <b>breezier</b> house-reggae fusion.|$|R
50|$|The Spring Promenade {{is nearly}} here, and the ponies are {{preparing}} for it {{with the help of}} the <b>Breezies.</b> But a troublesome weed lands Wysteria and Pinkie Pie in a mysterious cave where Spike the dragon has been sleeping for a thousand years.

6000|$|... 'Mr. W.E. Norris {{is always}} happy in his {{delineation}} of everyday experiences, but rarely {{has he been}} brighter or <b>breezier</b> than in [...] "Matthew Austin." [...] The pictures are in Mr. Norris's pleasantest vein, while running through the entire story is a felicity of style and wholesomeness of tone which one is accustomed {{to find in the}} novels of this favourite author.'--Scotsman.|$|R

2500|$|Christopher Shea {{wrote for}} The Washington Post that [...] "In the end, {{it must be}} said, the profusion of {{proposals}} in Nudge, however worthy, and the countless summaries of studies supporting them grow a bit wearisome. As influential as the book is likely to be, it's hard to imagine it pushing its way alongside Malcolm Gladwell's Blink (inferior social science, far <b>breezier</b> style) on the bestseller list".|$|R
50|$|Aldrich often {{works on}} gessoed panels {{with a mixture}} of oil paint, mineral spirits, and wax, which he lays on with a brush or palette knife. The {{combination}} of the resistant ground and viscid alloy registers his short hesitant strokes with tender congealed precision. His larger and <b>breezier</b> canvases have been compared to Philip Guston's transitional pictures from the mid-1960s (and also sometimes evoke Per Kirkeby or Joan Mitchell).|$|R
50|$|The Westminster Abbey {{concert was}} also the launch event for the band's third album, Sky 3. A {{generally}} brighter and <b>breezier</b> album than its predecessors, the record demonstrated Steve Gray's new and prominent compositional role within Sky, {{moving away from the}} harpsichordal and psychedelic elements of the Monkman years and taking the band towards a more jazz-influenced sound. Sky went on to tour Australia, Europe and the UK in support of the release.|$|R
25|$|The EZ Flyer was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} design of Wayne Winters of Indus, Alberta. In 1991 Winters set out to design a high performance kit plane {{that he intended to}} produce commercially. While considering the design parameters of that proposed aircraft he saw a picture of a <b>Breezy</b> homebuilt and decided instead to design a smaller and lighter aircraft inspired by the <b>Breezy</b> instead. Winter's own past experience flying Ultraflight Lazairs provided the motivation for the design of a slow, easy to handle aircraft with an open cockpit.|$|E

5000|$|The film starred Ralph Byrd as Bill [...] "Breezy" [...] Duke, who at {{the time}} was best known for his role as Dick Tracy in the 1937 serial of the same name. The film was an attempt to make a [...] "light funster" [...] out of Byrd. Olympic swimmer Stubby Kruger co-starred in the film as <b>Breezy's</b> friend, Dan [...] "Cookie" [...] Cook. Veda Ann Borg played Maureen; author John Cocchi felt she was miscast in the role.|$|R
5000|$|She is {{currently}} writing {{a biography of}} Ben Hecht for Yale University Press's Jewish Lives series. According to the publisher's website: [...] "Ben Hecht wrote {{some of the greatest}} Hollywood movies ever made.... Yet as he was tossing off the <b>breeziest</b> scripts, he was also becoming a fierce propagandist for pre-state Israel’s terrorist underground. A self-described “child of the century,” the charismatic and contradiction-ridden Hecht came to embody much that defined America—and especially Jewish America—in his time." ...|$|R
6000|$|A year or {{two later}} [...] "Jim Wolf and the Cats" [...] {{appeared}} in a Tennessee paper in a new dress--as to spelling; spelling borrowed from Artemus Ward. The appropriator of the tale had a wide reputation in the West, and was exceedingly popular. Deservedly so, I think. He wrote some of the <b>breeziest</b> and funniest things I have ever read, and did his work with distinguished ease and fluency. His name has passed out of my memory.|$|R
