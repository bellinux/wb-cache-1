5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a modified equipment module.

The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cargo module.|$|E
