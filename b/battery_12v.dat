50|$|The {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a starting motor (D.C. 12V, 1 kW), and an alternator to provide electricity and charge onboard <b>batteries</b> (<b>12V,</b> 55A).|$|R
50|$|The charger is {{supplied}} with six batteries that {{were identified by}} a Czech website in 2010 to be rebranded Eneloop HR-3UTG Sanyo-manufactured rechargeable <b>batteries</b> (<b>1.2V</b> 1900mAh). Apple claims that these batteries will last over 1500 recharges while retaining 70% of their capacity—even after being stored {{for long periods of}} time. The Apple Battery charger was discontinued on January 15, 2016.|$|R
50|$|In November 1974, Daihatsu {{released}} the 'Hallo'(ES38V), a tilting trike powered by {{an electric motor}} and two <b>12V</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|SPHERES {{satellites}} are powered {{using two}} non-rechargeable <b>12v</b> <b>battery</b> packs. Each battery pack consists of eight 1.5v AA battery {{cells that are}} spot-welded in series.|$|R
50|$|It was {{powered by}} four <b>12V</b> <b>batteries</b> {{placed under the}} hood giving it a claimed top speed of 36 km/h {{and a range of}} 50 mi.|$|R
50|$|Onboard {{electrics}} are 24V as is {{the norm}} for utility vehicles of this class. They have two <b>12V</b> <b>batteries</b> connected in series. Some all-wheel drive models also have blackout lights.|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha DS7 {{motorcycle}} {{was made}} in 1972 for one year. It was a 250cc twin two-stroke that made 30 hp @ 7,500 rpm. Top speed was 93 mph. <b>12v</b> <b>battery</b> ignition. five-speed gearbox. 1/4 mile in 14.8 seconds.|$|R
50|$|As power source, 12V marine deep cycle, sealed {{lead acid}} {{batteries}} are commonly used. For voltages higher than <b>12V,</b> <b>batteries</b> are connected in series. Common car starter batteries are not recommended power sources for electric trolling motors, since such batteries are optimized for strong currents and not for being deeply discharged on a regular basis.|$|R
50|$|Ross Lovegrove’s {{original}} design {{consisted of a}} sinuous tree constructed of steel pipes, measuring 5.5 meters, supporting a light bubble in which 38 solar cells, each with 38 watt capacity, connected to a hidden <b>12V</b> <b>battery</b> system which lit an assortment of 1W LEDs at the tip. The solar cells for the project were commissioned by Sharp Solar.|$|R
5000|$|More recent {{uses for}} R/C BECs are {{converting}} higher voltage lithium polymer <b>battery</b> packs to <b>12v.</b> This has occurred {{due to the}} increased popularity of camera equipment for FPV use. Several BEC manufacturers offer a BEC ( [...] voltage regulator [...] ) for this purpose and people may become confused as this is 'out of the ordinary' to use a BEC for a 12v application.|$|R
50|$|Almost in {{the middle}} of the runway, 1,100 meters away from the {{northern}} end and 1,000 from the southern, there was a storm drain leading to a disused sewer that crossed below the runway. A cable was laid through the 250 meters of tunnel, emerging from the storm drain and connecting the charge to the <b>12V</b> <b>battery</b> of a parked vehicle. The switch would be activated from a nearby pit.|$|R
50|$|Batteries are {{contained}} in one big battery box that is bolted to {{the underside of the}} vehicle. It can be removed using specialized shop equipment. Individual batteries are then serviced and replaced from the open top of the module. The battery layout inside the box is not the same for the Lead-Acid and NiMH battery type. The Lead-Acid setup is using 39 x 8V batteries setup on two layers. The NiMH setup is using 25 x <b>12V</b> <b>batteries</b> on one layer.|$|R
5000|$|The TEVan had an 8.8 kW three-stage ceramic {{electric}} heater. The 120A DC/DC converter provided all the 12v power, {{there was}} no auxiliary (<b>12V)</b> <b>battery.</b> Gauges included motor temperature and SOC (state of charge, akin to [...] "Fuel Level") using the stock instruments. It was also equipped with electric air conditioning (R-134a), regenerative braking, power brakes using a Delco electric vacuum pump, power steering, AM/FM Stereo, and airbags. The original equipment tires were LRR, (Low Rolling Resistance), Goodyear P205/75R15 Momentum at 50PSI.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to later}} silicon or {{germanium}} devices, copper-oxide rectifiers {{tended to have}} poor efficiency, and the reverse voltage rating was rarely {{more than a few}} volts. A number of rectifier discs would need to be used in series to provide an adequate reverse breakdown voltage figure - a bridge rectifier for a <b>12V</b> <b>battery</b> charger would often use 12 metal rectifiers. Selenium rectifiers were generally more efficient than metal-oxide types, and could handle higher voltages. However, considerably more skill was required for their construction.|$|R
50|$|As {{a battery}} is {{discharged}} {{the density of}} lead sulfate in solution increases. In common designs, it reaches a critical density when discharged to about 75% depth of discharge, or below. For instance, a <b>12V</b> <b>battery</b> with a 100 Ampere-hour (Ah) capacity will reach this density when 25 Ah (300 Wh) or more have been drawn from the battery. At this point, the lead sulfate will begin to precipitate out of solution onto the battery plates, forming a spongy film. If the battery is immediately recharged, the film will dissolve back into the acid.|$|R
25|$|For higher-powered lights, an {{external}} <b>battery</b> pack of <b>12V</b> VRLA <b>battery</b> is often required. These battery packs usually strap {{to the top}} tube of the frame, or come in the shape that fits in a water bottle cage, or can {{be placed in a}} basket. A cable connects the battery pack to the light. Another advantage with battery power (especially with 12 volt) is the ability to power other components outside of lighting, as well as all from one battery (as long as they run safe on 12 volts) though wire spaghetti from splicing can be a setback depending on how complicated the electric system is.|$|R
50|$|Switched-mode power {{supplies}} {{are used for}} DC to DC conversion as well. In automobiles where heavy vehicles use a nominal 24 VDC cranking supply, 12V for accessories may be furnished through a DC/DC switch-mode supply. This has the advantage over tapping the <b>battery</b> at the <b>12V</b> position (using half the cells) that all the 12V load is evenly divided over all cells of the 24V battery. In industrial settings such as telecommunications racks, bulk power may be distributed at a low DC voltage (from a battery back up system, for example) and individual equipment items will have DC/DC switched-mode converters to supply whatever voltages are needed.|$|R
50|$|The nu50 and nu50m, or Honda urban express, {{replaced}} the express II model for 1982 {{and was only}} produced until 1983. It utilized a similar belt driven, variated engine as in the nx50, however the belt side of the cases is longer and top speed is slightly higher. Most bikes run about 30 mph. The nu50m comes with an electric start, {{in addition to the}} regular urban express standard features, including; oil injection, blinkers, <b>12v</b> <b>battery,</b> cdi ignition, an alternator, oil tank indicator, and beefier shocks and larger wheels than the regular express. A unique restricted version was produced just for the lower speed requirements to be sold in Iowa; the Iowa models are limited to maximum 25mph.|$|R
5000|$|Crossband Repeaters - Similar to an STSP, {{but usually}} {{based on a}} COTS Dualband Tranceiver with native {{cross-band}} repeat functionality. These {{have the advantage of}} being very portable - a Crossband Repeater based on a Dual-band Hand-held Transceiver can be transported, complete with antenna and mast, by 2 trampers. This would include an external <b>12V</b> <b>battery</b> power supply capable of running the unit for a number of days. Crossband units are often inserted into areas of bush or scrub via Helicopter, with a Search Party (made up of tramping club members or LandSAR volunteers and/or Police staff) conducting the actual installation. Commercial type approved equipment is required for use on the commercial and government frequencies used for SAR operations.|$|R
5000|$|Conventional {{lead-acid}} batteries {{consist of}} a number of plates of lead and lead dioxide suspended in a cell filled with weak sulfuric acid. Lead oxide reacts with the sulfur and oxygen in the acid to give up an electron, leaving the plate positively charged and producing lead sulfate. Lead reacts with the acid by taking in two electrons, leaving it negative while also producing lead sulfate. The two chemical processes continue as long as an external circuit is available to allow the electrons to flow back into the positive plates, but reaches equilibrium quickly when the battery is disconnected from the circuit. Each complete reaction produces about 2.11V. A typical <b>12V</b> <b>battery</b> consists of six individual [...] "cells" [...] wired together in a single box, producing 13.2V when fully charged.|$|R
50|$|Funai 212 {{came with}} a JVC model GX-44E hand held Vidicon tube camera with a zoom lens. Model 212D was the NTSC version and 212E was PAL for Europe. The deck and {{electronics}} from the 212 were also used to build the model 335 Technicolor Video Showcase, which included a colour video monitor, speaker and contained an internal <b>12V</b> <b>battery.</b> A lightweight television tuner pack was available to enable the 212 to record off-air television programming, but since it contained no timer {{it was not possible}} to set it for unattended recordings. Grundig also produced a CVC-format VCR for the PAL market, the VP100, based on the 212E but smaller. The VP100 weighed only 2.3 kg with battery, and had a separate power pack. Model 212 was also available in France as a SECAM recorder, the variant letter for this model is unknown. SECAM tapes play in monochrome on PAL players.|$|R
50|$|In March 2014, Neato Robotics {{released}} an expanded model dubbed BotVac developed over several years, {{with a side}} brush previously available only on the limited distribution Vorwerk Kobold models in Germany (see below). BotVacs were initially priced about 20 {{percent higher than the}} older XV models. The new model featured additional major changes re-arranging the internal construction with larger filter area and dust bin, for less frequent servicing and covering larger premises, and the battery compacted into a single compartment instead of two separate compartments in the older models. The main front brush was made longer and closer to the wall, with a new more closely fitting bump sensor construction. Along with the side brush this cleans the margin against walls much more closely than the older models, which left a two inch wide strip untouched. The longer brush covers a wider swath of floor on each pass and the unit runs much quieter. The casing was modernized with more snap-fit fastenings and fewer screws. Internal electronics were upgraded and refined, and new commercial embedded systems operating system used. The brush drive belt was covered by a cowling with a new mounting method. A major improvement in efficiency was made with a lower voltage 10-cell <b>12v</b> <b>battery</b> but higher in Ampere-Hours capacity than the older 12-cell battery, reflecting advances in battery manufacture over years. The battery remains NiMh compared to the Lithium battery used in Germany (and avoiding all hazard concerns with Lithium Ion batteries). However, the new Botvac Connected has a lithium battery. The BotVac is sold in several packages differing in accessories included such as extra filters and different brush types, same as the previous XV models were packaged.|$|R
