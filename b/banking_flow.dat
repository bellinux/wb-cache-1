In addition to the usual determinants of capital flows in terms of global push and local pull factors, it {{examines the}} role of bilateral factors, such as growth differentials and economic size, as well as contagion factors and measures of the depth in financial interconnectedness between lenders and borrowers. The analysis finds profound differences across regions. In particular, {{in spite of the}} severe impact of the global financial crisis, <b>banking</b> <b>flows</b> in emerging Europe stand out as a more stable region than is the case in other developing regions. Assuming that the determinants of <b>banking</b> <b>flows</b> remain unchanged in the presence of structural changes, the authors use these results to explore the short-term implications of Basel III capital regulations on <b>banking</b> <b>flows</b> to emerging markets.

40|$|This paper uses a large {{panel of}} {{bilateral}} <b>bank</b> <b>flow</b> data {{to assess how}} institutions and politics affect international capital -bank in particular- flows. The following key findings emerge: 1) The empirical "gravity" model is the benchmark in explaining the volume of international banking activities. 2) Conditioned on standard gravity factors (distance, GDP, population), well-functioning institutions are a key driving force for international <b>bank</b> <b>flows.</b> Specifically, foreign <b>banks</b> invest substantially more in countries with i) uncorrupt bureaucracies, ii) high-quality legal system, and iii) a non-government controlled banking system. 3) Beyond institutions, politics exert also a firstorder impact. 4) The European Integration process has spurred cross-border banking activities between member states. These results are robust to various econometric methodologies, samples and the potential endogeneity of institutional characteristics. The strong institutions/politics-bank flows nexus has strong implications for asset trade and international macro theories, which have not modelled these relationships explicitly.

40|$|Unequal {{quality of}} {{fundamental}} institutions induces different patterns of international capital flows {{in terms of}} both direction and magnitude. This dissertation examines, theoretically and empirically, the link between the financial intermediation sector and capital flows by highlighting the role of institutions and the technological level that financial intermediaries have access to. The theoretical section employs a model with endogenous labour input in monitoring loans by the financial intermediary. Numerical exercises reveal that this modification improves the traditional exogenous model by replicating the stylized facts, in particular, the model is able to replicate and explain the non-monotonic relationship between institutional quality and international net <b>bank</b> <b>flows.</b> Furthermore, contrary to the exogenous model, the model with endogenous labour input is able to reproduce a loan interest rate profile which decreases as institutional quality improves. The empirical section uses a panel of 56 rich and middle-income countries and cross-border <b>bank</b> <b>flows</b> and reveals that, firstly, institutional quality matters slightly more for the mid-income countries in explaining the net <b>bank</b> <b>flows,</b> while for high-income countries it is the market fundamentals which are significant explanatory forces. Secondly, while for both income groups {{the rule of law and}} voice & accountability indices are significant, for mid-income countries government effectiveness is also of significance...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influences of}} global <b>banking</b> <b>flows</b> and its implication on the monetary policy regimes and economic fluctuations in the recipient economies. This work {{is based on the}} view that monetary policy shocks in core countries could be transmitted to the recipient EMEs via cross-border <b>banking</b> <b>flows.</b> Chapter 1 investigates influences of internal transactions within Asia-headquartered global banking group on the monetary policy effectiveness in selected Asian countries. It has been argued that global banks, when facing financial stress, reallocate their internal funds from their foreign affiliates in support of the parent banks. This action might help the parent banks to better protect their bank lending. In this spirit, the chapter investigates evidences suggestive of the operation of the channel for the Asian global banks. In Chapter 2, the US monetary policy shock identified from narrative sources is applied to measure the responses of <b>banking</b> <b>flows</b> and US global banks that inÂ­termediate cross-border interbank funding. The results suggest that the responses of US global banks and the magnitude in banking outflows are much larger than previously thought. Chapter 3 examines an interaction between exchange rate regimes and financial crisis in EMEs triggered by a US monetary policy shock. First, an empirical evidence on the magnitude in banking outflows in EMEs in response to a US monetary policy shock is suggested. Then, an open economy model equipped with a banking sector is estimated and analyzed. The model predicts the well-known wisdom in the literature on sudden stops episodes: countries in the position of having to defend an exchange rate peg are more likely to suffer severe Sudden Stops and financial distress. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—When the {{flows in}} natural or man made channel {{sections}} exceed the main channel depth, the adjoining floodplains become inundated and carry {{part of the}} river discharge. Due to different hydraulic conditions prevailing in the river and floodplain of a compound channel, the mean velocity in the main channel and in the floodplain are different. This leads to the transfer of momentum between the main channel water {{and that of the}} floodplain making the flow structure more complex. Results of some experiments concerning the overbank flow distribution in a compound channel are presented. Flow sharing in river channels is strongly dependant on the interaction between flow in the main channel and that in the floodplain. The influence of the geometry on velocity and flow distribution and different functional relationships are obtained. Dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the over <b>bank</b> <b>flow</b> sharing in the subsections. The equations agree well with experimental discharge data and other published data. Using the proposed method, the error between the measured and calculated discharge distribution for the a compound sections is found to be the minimum when compared with that using other investigators.

40|$|There is no {{agreement}} regarding the growth-enhancing effects of financial liberalization, mainly {{because it is}} associated with risky international <b>bank</b> <b>flows,</b> lending booms, and crises. In this paper we {{make the case for}} liberalization despite the occurrence of crises. We show that in developing countries trade liberalization has typically been followed by financial liberalization, which has indeed led to financial fragility and a greater incidence of crises. However, financial liberalization also has led to higher GDP growth. In fact, the fastestgrowing countries are typically those that have experienced boom-bust cycles. That is, there is a positive link between GDP growth and the bumpiness of credit, which is captured by the negative skewness - not by the variance - of credit growth. To substantiate our interpretation of the data we present a model that shows why in countries with severe credit market imperfections, liberalization leads to higher growth and, as a byproduct, to financial fragility. Thus, occasional crises need not forestall growth and may even be a necessary component of a developing country's growth experience. Finally, our analysis indicates that foreign direct investment does not obviate the need for risky international <b>bank</b> <b>flows,</b> as the latter are the only source of financing for most firms in the nontradables sector. ...|$|R

The results indicate that global factors, namely the US-sourced funding of European global banks and global risk, were influential in driving cross-border banking inflows to Ireland. Furthermore, the empirical analysis suggests these global factors contributed to changes in domestic private non-financial sector credit during the Irish credit boom. These results shed new light on the factors influencing the international funding of Irish retail banks and changes in domestic credit during the credit boom. ...|$|R
