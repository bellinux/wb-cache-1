40|$|Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) {{is one of}} {{the annual}} plants in Bangladesh that has {{potential}} as a fiber source. It is a crop generally cultivated for its nutritive value to soil. This paper describes the effect of harvesting age of dhaincha on chemical, morphological, pulp, and papermaking properties and its <b>bleachability.</b> Dhaincha is a short length fiber that {{can be used as a}} substitute to hardwood. Fiber length was found to increase slightly with increasing age of the plant. The alpha-cellulose content in dhaincha increased and pentosan decreased with increasing age. Dhaincha pulp was prepared from 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 month old plants under identical cooking conditions. Pulp yield (43 - 45 %) and kappa number (26 - 30) did not follow direct correlation with plant age. But physical properties of unbleached pulp increased linearly with the increase of age. <b>Bleachability</b> of dhaincha pulp was quite poor.

40|$|There {{is still}} some {{uncertainty}} about the mechanism of increased <b>bleachability</b> by interstage activation of two-stage oxygen delignification (the OxO process). To possibly help in understanding the chemistry of the OxO process, residual lignin in kraft pulp bleached by oxygen and peracetic acid was extracted by the diox-ane/water acidolysis method. The content of functional groups in the extracted lignin was determined by 13 C-and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. For isothermally cooked kraft pulp, no significant difference {{could be seen in}} the chemical properties of residual lignin extracted with the dioxane/water acidolysis method. These data do not provide a chemical rationalization of the differ-ences in <b>bleachability</b> between oxygen delignified (O) and peracetic acid treated (OPa) pulp. For polysulfide/ AQ kraft pulp cooked to high kappa numbers, the changes in functional group content is in accordance with studies performed on lignin model compounds.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{method for}} maximizing the yield of kraft pulp {{seems to be}} cooking to kappa numbers between 40 and 45 {{with the addition of}} polysulfide and anthraquinone (PS/AQ) to the kraft cooking liquor, followed by oxygen delignification to kap-pa numbers around 22 and subsequent bleaching with more spe-cific bleach chemicals. The <b>bleachability</b> of the oxygen delignified high-yield PS/AQ kraft pulp and of conventional and ITC-type kraft pulps of comparable kappa numbers is in-vestigated and correlated to structural parameters of the lignin as determined by NMR spectroscopy.

Both conditions were performed to kappa number 15. 5 ± 0. 5 and 18. 0 ± 0. 5. The pulping parameters and pulp properties evaluated were: screened yield, viscosity, brightness, hexenuronic acid content, and index k/corrected kappa (ratio between the light absorption rate, a brightness formula term, and the corrected kappa number, disregarding the hexenuronic acid contribution). Each one of the pulps was bleached, to achieve 90 ± 1 % ISO brightness, following three pre-defined bleaching sequences: 1 Sequence - OA(ZE) DP; 2 Sequence - OA/D(EOP) DP; and 3 Sequence - OD(EOP) DP.

40|$|Consumption of {{chemicals}} during ECF bleaching of kraft pulp correlates reasonably well with kappa number, which measures with KMnO 4 {{the total amount}} of oxidizable material in the pulp. However, the method does not distinguish between the oxidizable material in residual lignin and other structures susceptible to oxidation, such as hexenuronic acids (HexAs), extractives and carbonyl groups in the pulp. In this study an attempt is made to separate the main contributors to the kappa number in oxygen - delignified eucalyptus Kraft pulps and evaluate how these fractions behave during ECF bleaching using chlorine dioxide as the sole oxidant (DEDD sequence). Residual lignin and HexAs proved to be the main fractions contributing to the kappa number and chlorine dioxide consumption in ECF bleaching. Pulp <b>bleachability</b> with chlorine dioxide increases with increasing HexAs content of the pulp but chlorine dioxide per se does not react with HexAs. Reduction of pulp with sodium borohydride under conditions for removing carbonyl groups has no impact on <b>bleachability.</b> No correlation was found between the pulp of the extractive content and pulp <b>bleachability.</b> The removal of HexAs prior to ECF bleaching significantly decreases the formation of chlorinated organics in the pulp (OX) and filtrates (AOX) as well as of oxalic acids in the filtrates...|$|E

40|$|The general {{objectives}} {{of this new}} project {{are the same as}} those described in the original proposal. Conventional kraft pulping technologies will be modified for significant improvements in pulp production, such as strength, <b>bleachability,</b> and yield by using green liquor, a naturally high, kraft mill-derived sulfidity source. Although split white liquor sulfidity and other high sulfidity procedures have the promise of addressing several of the latter important economic needs of pulp mills, they require considerable engineering/capital retrofits, redesigned production methods, and thus add to overall mill expenditures. Green liquor use, however, possesses the required high sulfidity to obtain in general the benefits attributable to higher sulfidity cooking, without the required capital constraints for implementation. Before introduction of green liquor in our industrial operations, a stronger understanding of its fundamental chemical interaction with the lignin and carbohydrates in US hardwood and softwoods must be obtained. In addition, its effect on <b>bleachability,</b> enhancement of pulp properties, and influence on the overall energy and recovery of the mill requires further exploration before the process witnesses widespread mill use in North America. Thus, proof of principle will be accomplished in this work and the consequent effect of green liquor and other high sulfide sources on the pulping and bleaching operations will be explored for US kraft mills. The first year of this project will generate the pertinent information to validate its ability for implementation in US pulping operations, whereas year two will continue this work while proceeding to analyze pulp <b>bleachability</b> and final pulp/paper properties and develop a general economic and feasibility analysis for its eventual implementation in North America...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrochemically}} mediated delignification of pulp fibers {{is one of}} {{the promising}} bleaching methods, which can give the delignified pulp with good subsequent <b>bleachability</b> and high pulp viscosity. Our previous work has shown that the poplar kraft pulp can be delignified to 45 % delignification ratio with less than 10 % pulp viscosity loss at the condition of 1 % pulp consistency which limits the application of this method in pulp industry. The high-consistency electrochemical delignification of poplar kraft pulp was investigated in this paper. The delignification ratio, pulp viscosity loss and brightness were measured as well as the delignification conditions, such as pulp consistency, voltage of electrolysis cell, temperature, circulation of electrolysis liquor and time, were discussed.

Heartwood groundwood was identified to be the major culprit in the bleaching of Douglas-fir groundwood. For this particular sample, the <b>bleachability</b> of its heartwood groundwood was inversely linearly proportional to the pulp freeness at the lower freeness levels. The addition of pure dihydroquercetin to sapwood groundwood had a minor effect on both brightness and <b>bleachability</b> of this groundwood, but the addition of quercetin resulted not only in decreased unbleached brightness but also in insignificant brightness gain during groundwood bleaching with zinc hydrosulfite.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 ’s, {{a lot of}} work was focused on {{extending}} the kraft cook to a low lignin content (low kappa number). The driving force was the need to further reduce the environmental impact of the bleaching, as less delignification work would be needed there. However, the delignification during the residual phase of a kraft cook is very slow and, due to its poor selectivity, it is a limiting factor for the lignin removal. If the amount of lignin reacting according to the residual phase could be reduced, {{it would be possible to}} improve the selectivity of the kraft cook. In the work described in this thesis, special attention has been given to the activation energy of the slowly reacting residual phase of a kraft cook on softwood raw material and to the influence of different cooking parameters on the amount of the residual phase lignin. The activation energy of the residual phase delignification of the kraft cook was shown to be higher than that of the bulk phase delignification. In order to decrease the amount of residual phase lignin, it was essential to have a high concentration of hydrogen sulphide ions when cooking with a low hydroxide concentration. It was also important to avoid a high sodium ion concentration when cooking with low hydroxide and low hydrogen sulphide ion concentrations. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that dissolved wood components had a positive effect on the delignification rate in the bulk phase of a kraft cook. The influence of different cooking parameters in the extended softwood kraft process on the <b>bleachability</b> (i. e. the ease with which the pulps can be bleached to a target brightness) of the manufactured pulp was also investigated. If variations in <b>bleachability</b> were seen, an attempt would also be made to find chemical reasons to explain the differences. It was difficult to establish clear relationships between the chemical structures of the residual lignin and the <b>bleachability</b> of the pulp. However, it was seen that the higher the content of β-aryl ether structures in the residual lignin after cooking, the better was the QPQP*-bleachability. In the middle/end of the 1990 ’s, the focus moved from extended cooking to efficient utilisation of the wood raw material, e. g. by interrupting the kraft cook at higher kappa number levels and choosing appropriate cooking conditions to maximise the cooking yield. A high cooking yield often leads to a somewhat higher hexenuronic acid (HexA) content of the pulp at a given kappa number. Therefore additional attention was devoted to how the HexA content and carbohydrate composition were affected, e. g. by a set of cooking parameters. Performing these studies it was also important to investigate the effects of a low HexA (after cooking) strategy on such vital factors as the cooking yield, the <b>bleachability</b> and the yellowing characteristics of the pulp obtained. It proved to be difficult to significantly reduce the HexA content in a kraft pulp by altering the cooking conditions for both softwood and the hardwood Eucalyptus Globulus. A reduction in HexA content can be achieved by extending the cook to lower kappa numbers, or by using a high hydroxide concentration, a low hydrogen sulphide concentration or a high sodium ion concentration. However, neither of these strategies is attractive for industrial implementation since they would result in an extensive loss of yield, viscosity and strength. QC 20100825 </p...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{approximately}} 25 to 30 million tons of industrial wood waste generated in the United States per year is burned for energy and/or landfilled. In this study, kraft pulp from industrial wood waste was evaluated and compared with softwood (loblolly pine, Douglas-fir) and hardwood (aspen) pulp. Pulp <b>bleachability</b> was also evaluated. Compared to loblolly pine pulp, industrial wood waste pulp needed less cooking time {{to achieve the same}} kappa number and achieved a higher pulp yield for a similar kappa number. Industrial wood waste pulp was more effectively bleached than loblolly pine pulp and consumed less chlorine dioxide under similar bleaching conditions. Mechanical properties of paper from industrial wood waste pulp and loblolly pine pulp were very similar except for tear values, which were about two points higher for loblolly pine. Both wood waste and loblolly pine pulps were much stronger than hardwood kraft pulp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} {{potential}} applications of microbial xylanases in the {{pulp and paper industry}} is gradually increasing and several are approaching commercial use. This industry needs a xylanase, which is free of cellulase. Twenty isolated Streptomycetes strains from Egyptian soils, which produce cellulase free-xylanase and are easily grown using a low-cost agriculture waste substrate, were investigated. The two most active strains have been identified as Streptomyces albus and Streptomyces chromofuscus. Their maximum xylanase activity was 13. 25, 19. 31 and 32. 53, 43. 01 on untreated rice straw pulp and pulp treated with TiO 2 in both Streptomyces species respectively. The enzyme activity increased when both isolates were grown on yeast extract. Optimum production of xylanase was recorded after five days of fermentation. Xylanase produced with Streptomyces chromofuscus showed higher bleaching activity than that from Streptomyces albus. The enzyme enhanced the liberation of reducing sugars, which improved pulp <b>bleachability...</b>|$|E
40|$|Three {{selected}} alkali-based organosolv pulps (alkali-sulWte-anthraquinone-methanol (ASAM), alkali-anthraquinone-methanol (organocell) and ethanol-soda) from agroWbre crop {{giant reed}} (Arundo donax L.) were bleached by an ozone-based TCF (totally chlorinefree) bleaching sequence AZERQP (where A is an acidic pulp pre-treatment, Z is an ozone stage, (ER) is an alkaline extraction {{in the presence}} of reducing agent, Q is a pulp chelating, P is a hydrogen peroxide stage) without oxygen pre-bleaching, and compared with a conventional kraft pulp used as a reference. The diVerent response on bleaching conditions within each bleaching stage was noted for all tested pulps. The pulp <b>bleachability,</b> in terms of brightness improvement or lignin removal per unit of applied chemicals, was found higher for the organocell pulp. The ASAM and ethanol-soda pulps showed the highest bleaching selectivity, expressed by viscosity loss per unit of lignin removed or brightness improved. The overall bleaching results of organosolv pulps were superior to kraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{luminescence}} {{characteristics of}} a variety of feldspars were investigated using the post-IR IRSL signal to facilitate the understanding of the origins and behavior of signals used in luminescence dating. These feldspars were characterized in terms of major composition, Al,Si ordering, and minor impurities, and compared to the luminescence decay parameters of brightness, <b>bleachability,</b> and kinetic order calculated from the pIRIR decay signal. The behavior of these parameters over varying preheat temperatures, pIRIR measurement temperatures, IR 50 measurement times, and first IR measurement temperatures were analyzed. Correlations between the physical and the luminescence characteristics were noted, as well as the general behavior of similar feldspar samples over different dating protocol parameters. Variations in Al,Si order were found to have the largest effect on K-feldspars, although some luminescence parameters were surprisingly insensitive. It may be that bond length has a fundamental effect on the luminescence origin of all feldspar species...|$|E
