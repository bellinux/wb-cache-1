40|$|Abstract Introduction Gastrojejunocolic (GJC) fistulae {{represent}} a significant post-surgical cause of morbidity and mortality. GJC fistulae represent rare post-surgical complications, {{and most are}} associated with gastric surgery. In the past, this complication has been under-recognized because a fistula may form years after surgery. Case presentation We describe two cases of gastrojejunocolic fistula in men aged 67 and 60 who both initially presented with watery diarrhea and weight loss. Upper GI studies with small bowel follow-through or <b>barium</b> contrast <b>enema</b> studies allowed a conclusive diagnosis to be made. Both patients underwent one-stage en bloc resection, and their postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusion With surgery, this condition is entirely correctable. Pre-operative nutritional status should be evaluated in patients undergoing corrective surgery, and total parenteral nutrition {{plays a major role}} in the provision of bowel rest to allow recovery in malnourished patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Management of {{intestinal}} intussusception {{in children}} {{has evolved from}} exclusively surgical treatments to nonoperative reduction under fluoroscopic monitoring. Aim: To report a 10 year experience in a University Hospital {{in the management of}} intestinal intussusception. Patients and methods: Seventy two patients, aged 2 to 72 months of age, with an uncomplicated intussusception, that were treated by <b>barium</b> or air <b>enema,</b> were studied. Results: The success rate was 73 % with barium reductions, and 100 % with air reductions. In 17 patients (24 %), enema reduction was unsuccessful and were subjected to a surgical reduction. Conclusions: Nonsurgical reduction is safe and effective as the initial treatment of uncomplicated intussusception in childre...|$|R

25|$|Colonoscopy {{is one of}} the {{colorectal}} cancer screening tests available to people in the US who are over 50 years of age. The other screening tests include flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast <b>barium</b> <b>enema,</b> computed tomographic (CT) colongraphy (virtual colonoscopy), guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and multitarget stool DNA screening test (Cologuard).|$|E
25|$|CT scans and {{ultrasounds}} are now {{the tests}} of choice for the initial evaluation of abdominal masses, and colonoscopies are becoming the standard for routine colon screening for those over age 50 or with a familial history of polyps or colon cancer, {{although it is not}} uncommon for a <b>barium</b> <b>enema</b> to be done after a colonoscopy for further evaluation.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people with}} situs inversus totalis {{are unaware of}} their unusual anatomy until they seek medical {{attention}} for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a <b>Barium</b> meal or <b>enema.</b> The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms {{will be on the}} atypical side. For example, if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies. Thus, {{in the event of a}} medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform their physicians before an examination, so the physician can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate.|$|R
40|$|Multimodality {{treatment}} of loco-regional advanced rectal cancer has demonstrated to improve local control and overall survival. Proctoscopy, {{digital rectal examination}} (DRE), computer tomography (CT), endorectal ultrasound (ERUS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot correctly detect downstaging in rectal tumors after chemo radiation therapy (CRT). New imaging techniques, like 18 F-FDG PET, may play some role in predicting the pathologic response to CRT before surgical resection. Aim {{of the present study}} was to further investigate the accuracy and predictive value of 18 F-FDG PET in a large series of patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative intensified CRT. Between January 2000 and December 2003, 81 patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma in clinical stage II-III disease, according to criteria of TNM classification, were included in this study. All patients were submitted to diagnostic staging workup with DRE, proctoscopy with biopsy, ERUS, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis or pelvic MRI plus liver ultrasonography, coloscopy or <b>barium</b> colonic <b>enema.</b> One month later the end of CRT all patients were submitted to diagnostic restaging work-up (DRW) and 18 F-FDG PET. Surgery was performed 8 - 9 weeks after the end of CRT and pathologic stage was defined. Moreover a pathologic assessment of tumor regression was made with tumor regression grade score (TRG). PET correctly identified 22 / 28 (79 % specificity) patients with complete pathologic response (pCR). However, sensitivity was 45 % (24 / 53) while PPV, and NPV were equal to 77 and 43 %, respectively. Total PET accuracy rate was 56 %. PET sensitivity increased from 45 to 56 % if the end-point was pCR, or TRG score, respectively. The best correlation was found between PET findings and pathologic stage (P < 0. 01) or TRG score (P < 0. 01). The accurate identification of rectal cancer patients with major pathological response after preoperative CRT further supports the necessity of designing prospective studies with new and more accurate was imaging technologies with the main object of offering conservative treatment in responder patients...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the clinical characteristics of childhood intussusception and to estimate the incidence rate of intussusception before the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Korea. MethodsDemographic, clinical, diagnostic, treatment, and outcome data for patients aged < 5 years who were diagnosed with intussusception in Jeonbuk Province, South Korea from January 2000 through December 2002, were retrospectively collected using a standardized data collection instrument. ResultsDuring the 3 -year period, 408 patients were diagnosed with intussusception; 82. 8 % of children were aged < 24 months. Predominant signs and symptoms were vomiting (64. 5 %), bloody stool (43. 9 %), and abdominal pain/irritability (41. 9 %). The combination of ultrasound and <b>barium</b> or air <b>enema</b> was the most frequently used diagnostic approach (38. 7 %). Three hundred and thirteen patients (76. 7 %) were treated by radiologic reduction, 88 (21. 6 %) patients were treated by surgical intervention, and the remaining seven patients had no treatment. The mean annual incidence rate of intussusception in Jeonbuk Province was 236 / 100000 among children aged < 2 years and 106 / 100000 among children aged < 5 years. ConclusionsThis retrospective study provides a background incidence rate of childhood intussusception in Korean children before the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine...|$|R
25|$|These {{may reveal}} {{congestion}} and edema (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa, and in 10-15% of cases {{there may be}} a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall. Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda. Rarely, a neoplasm (tumour) may form on {{the leading edge of the}} intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention. These investigations may be used with contrast media (<b>barium</b> <b>enema)</b> which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a <b>barium</b> <b>enema,</b> which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, [...] Dr. Niwa and Dr Yamagata at Tokyo University {{developed}} the device. After 1968, Dr. William Wolff and Dr. Hiromi Shinya became pioneered {{the development of}} the colonoscope. Their invention, in 1969 in Japan, was an advance over the <b>barium</b> <b>enema</b> and the flexible sigmoidoscope because it allowed for the visualization and removal of polyps from the entire large intestine. Wolff and Shinya advocated for their invention and published much of the early evidence needed to overcome skepticism about the device’s safety and efficacy.|$|E
2500|$|Colonoscopy is {{the usual}} {{diagnostic}} test of choice as it favours the common right-side location of polyps better than sigmoidoscopy if the mutation is attenuated FAP, and can confirm or allow (a) the actual clinical presentation and any change to the condition, of the 'at risk' individual, (b) quantification of polyps throughout the colon, (c) a histologic diagnosis (cell/cancer type detection) and (d) where polyps exist, it can suggest whether out patient excision (removal) is viable or surgery is recommended. <b>Barium</b> <b>enema</b> and virtual colonoscopy (a form of medical imaging) {{can also be used}} to suggest the diagnosis of FAP.|$|E

Dr. Moher's {{examination}} did not reveal anything and ordered Stevens to undergo an x-ray and <b>barium</b> <b>enema</b> on April1, neither of which showed anything. On April19 Stevens underwent a G.I. series that revealed diverticulitis, a gallstone, and a severely bloated stomach. Stevens was admitted to St. Francis Hospital and on April 26 he was operated on by Dr. Benedict Landry. It was determined that Stevens was suffering from stomach cancer. Stevens was released on May 11 {{and returned to his}} home on Westerly Terrace to recuperate. His wife insisted on trying to attend to him as he recovered but she had suffered a stroke in the previous winter and she was not able to assist as she had hoped. Stevens entered the Avery Convalescent Hospital on May 20. By early June he had recovered some of his strength and on June 9 he attended a ceremony at the University of Hartford where he received an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from the Hartt College of Music. On June 13 he traveled to New Haven to receive an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Yale University. On June 20 he returned to his home at Westerly Terrace and also insisted on returning to work. On July 21 Stevens was readmitted to St. Francis Hospital and his condition deteriorated. On August1 he lapsed into a coma and died on August 2, 1955 at eight-thirty in the morning. [...] He is buried in Hartford's Cedar Hill Cemetery.|$|E
