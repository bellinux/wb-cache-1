25|$|Chennai Port lies {{on a flat}} {{coastal plain}} known as the Eastern Coastal Plains {{on the east coast}} of the Indian {{peninsula}} known as the Coromandel Coast in the Bay of Bengal. The <b>bed</b> <b>slope</b> is fairly flat. The port is situated on the thermal equator and is also coastal, which prevents extreme variation in seasonal temperature. The climate is tropical, specifically tropical wet and dry, and for most of the year, the weather is hot and humid, with temperatures ranging from a maximum of 42°C in May to a minimum of 18°C in January. The mean minimum temperature is 18°C in January and 26.8°C in May. The mean highest temperature is 29.3°C in December and 39.6°C in May. The port gets most of its seasonal rainfall from the northeast monsoon winds, from mid-September to mid-December. Occasionally, cyclones in the Bay of Bengal hit the coast. The average annual rainfall in the region is about 1298.11mm, with 443.5mm during southwest monsoon (June–September), 753.1mm during northeast monsoon (October–December), 37.3mm during winter season (January–February) and 64.2mm during hot weather (March–May). The monthly average varies from 7mm in April to 308mm in November. Humidity ranges from 63 to 83 percent during January–March, from 57 to 72 percent during April–June and from 70 to 81 percent during October–December.|$|E

40|$|In many ice streams, basal {{resistance}} {{varies in}} space and time due to the dynamically evolving properties of subglacial till. These variations can cause internally generated oscillations in ice-stream flow. However, the potential for such variations in basal properties is not considered by conventional theories of grounding-line stability on retrograde <b>bed</b> <b>slopes,</b> which assume that bed properties are static in time. Using a flow-line model, we show how internally generated, transient variations in ice-stream state interact with retrograde <b>bed</b> <b>slopes.</b> In contrast to predictions from the theory of the marine ice-sheet instability, our simulated grounding line is able to persist and reverse direction of migration on a retrograde bed when undergoing oscillations in the grounding-line position. In turn, the presence of a retrograde bed may also suppress or reduce the amplitude of internal oscillations in ice-stream state. We explore the physical mechanisms responsible for these behaviors and discuss the implications for observed grounding-line migration in West Antarctica...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{stability}} of marine ice sheets grounded on <b>beds</b> that <b>slope</b> upwards {{in the overall}} di-rection of flow is investigated numerically in two horizontal dimensions. We give examples of stable grounding lines on such retrograde slopes illustrating that marine ice sheets are not unconditionally unstable in two horizontal dimensions. Retrograde <b>bed</b> <b>slopes</b> at the grounding lines of marine ice sheets, such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), do not per se imply an instability, nor do they 5 imply that these regions are close to a threshold of instability. We therefore question those estimates of the potential near-future contribution of WAIS to global sea level change {{based solely on the}} notion that WAIS, resting on retrograde slope, must be inherently unstable. ...|$|R

According to the deformation evidence and calculation results, the engineering geologic mechanical theory is used to analyze the deformation and failure mode of slope, and it is indicated that the current and future failure modes of hard rock slope with large thickness are all slipping-shear failure...|$|R
