These diseases are resulting from irregular production of ROS and unstable mechanism of antioxidant protection system. in order to reduction of harmful effects of ROS, natural antioxidants of plants and synthesis antioxidant can be used. It is shown that phenyl compounds, lipid peroxidations and oxidative damage to DNA in some plants can be prevented through cleaning some ROS such as Hydrogen peroxide and hydrocele radicals. <b>Black</b> <b>Cherry</b> is brimful of these compounds; in addition, root and stem of <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> are used in medical profession.

40|$|Abstract <b>Black</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus serotina) is a {{valuable}} hardwood timber species, and its value highly depends on the wood quality which is often threatened by insect pests. Transgenic <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> plants that are more resistant to cambial-mining insects may reduce the occurrence of gummosis and have great economic benefits to landowners and the forest products industries utilizing <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> lumber and logs. In this review, general information about <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> {{and the problem of}} gummosis are introduced. The various strategies for gene containment, the possibility of using cyanogenesis to enhance host resistance, and the current status of micropropagation, adventitious shoot regeneration, rooting, and Agrobacterium-mediated trans-formation in P. serotina and several other Prunus species are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|In Mexico <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) fruits are {{consumed}} fresh, dried or prepared in jam. Considering {{the evidence that}} has linked intake {{of fruits and vegetables}} rich in polyphenols to cardiovascular risk reduction, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the phenolic profile of <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits and to determine their antioxidant, vasorelaxant and antihypertensive effects. The proximate composition and mineral contents of these fruits were also assessed. <b>Black</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits possess a high content of phenolic compounds and display a significant antioxidant capacity. High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis indicated that hyperoside, anthocyanins and chlorogenic acid were the main phenolic compounds found in these fruits. The <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> aqueous extract elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of aortic rings and induced a significant reduction on systolic blood pressure in L-NAME induced hypertensive rats after four weeks of treatment. Proximate analysis showed that <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits have high sugar, protein, and potassium contents. The results derived from this study indicate that <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits contain phenolic compounds which elicit significant antioxidant and antihypertensive effects. These findings suggest that these fruits might be considered as functional foods useful for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases...|$|R

40|$|General EcologyEastern tent {{caterpillars}} (Malacosoma americanum) are specialist herbivores on the Rosaceae family, {{particularly on}} <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> trees (Prunus serotina). However, variation in tent occurrence and defoliation exists within populations of <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> trees. This variation was exemplified in Waldron's Fen in Emmet County, Michigan {{in the spring}} of 2010. <b>Black</b> <b>cherry</b> trees were surveyed at the fen to see whether tree size and relative isolation from other trees affected tent occurrence. Additionally, caterpillars from the fen were raised in the lab to track weight gain in three groups each receiving a different food type: leaves from favored <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> trees, unfavored <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> trees, and sweet cherry trees. It was found that defoliation was higher in densely populated cherry plots and was lower in a plot densely populated with other non-cherry tree species. There were also trends indicating that trees with smaller DBHs and those that were more isolated from other trees had higher tent occurrences. It was also found that the optimal range for height of tent to be between 2 and 2. 5 m in height. The caterpillars that were fed unfavored <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> leaves in the first cohort collected had significantly higher growth than the other groups. The caterpillars fed both <b>black</b> <b>cherry</b> leaf types in second cohort collected grew significantly larger than those fed sweet cherry. However, there was not a significant difference between nitrogen and phosphorus levels between the three food categories. All of these results suggest that selection may favor female moths that choose host trees with these characteristics...|$|R
