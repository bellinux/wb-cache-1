5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and <b>barometers.</b> The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of <b>barometers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Details of {{the modern}} climate record are known through the taking of {{measurements}} from such weather instruments as thermometers, <b>barometers,</b> and anemometers {{during the past few}} centuries. The instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.|$|E

Citizen Kane was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll, retaining the top spot in every subsequent poll until 2012, when Vertigo displaced it.|$|E
25|$|Microelectromechanical systems (or MEMS) <b>barometers</b> are {{extremely}} small devices between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (i.e. 0.001 to 0.1mm). They are created via photolithography or photochemical machining. Typical applications include miniaturized weather stations, electronic <b>barometers</b> and altimeters.|$|E

40|$|We {{have seen}} {{increasingly}} popularity in embedding <b>barometer</b> into smartphone today. A <b>barometer</b> measures the barometric pressure, {{and it can}} be used for a variety of applications. For example, in localization techniques, it is used to detect the altitude or altitude change of a user. Unfortunately, the smartphone <b>barometer</b> measurement is not accurate, and it has to calibrate appropriately before use. In this paper, we present Scalable <b>Barometer</b> Calibration (SBC), a scalable, transitive calibration algorithm to automatically calibrate <b>barometer</b> for a large number of smartphone users. SBC requires neither any infrastructure nor any human intervention, it uses smartphone <b>barometer</b> and accelerometer only. SBC provides high accuracy of <b>barometer</b> calibration and minimum energy consumption, making it more realistic for real-world deployment. Our simulation and prototype system demonstrate the performance, scalability, and robustness of SBC...|$|R

25|$|A {{barometer}} {{can also}} be found in smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S3-S6, Motorola Xoom, Apple iPhone 6 smartphones, and Timex Expedition WS4 smartwatch, based on MEMS and piezoresistive pressure-sensing technologies. Inclusion of <b>barometers</b> on smartphones was originally intended to provide a faster GPS lock. However, third party researchers were unable to confirm additional GPS accuracy or lock speed due to barometric readings. The researchers suggest that the inclusion of <b>barometers</b> in smartphones may provide a solution to determining a user's elevation, but also suggest that several pitfalls must first be overcome.|$|E
25|$|Just some of such {{instruments}} included chronometers, telescopes, sextants, microscopes, magnetic compasses, thermometers, hygrometers, <b>barometers,</b> electrometers, and eudiometers. Furthermore, it {{was necessary}} to have multiple makes and models of each specific instrument to compare errors and constancy among each type.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Bert Bolle <b>Barometer</b> the Denmark Visitor Centre lost its world attraction. Differences of opinion with the Board of Denmark Tourism Incorporated and the {{management}} of the Denmark Visitor Centre about promoting and signposting the water <b>barometer</b> and the <b>Barometer</b> Tower at the Denmark Visitor Centre lay at the bottom of an ongoing conflict. Eventually Bolle and his wife asked Denmark Council for the <b>barometer</b> to be given back to them, which was unanimously approved on 21 December 2010. The <b>Barometer</b> Tower was dismantled mid February 2011.|$|R
25|$|Ferdinando {{was obsessed}} with new technology, and had several hygrometers, <b>barometers,</b> thermometers, and telescopes {{installed}} in the Pitti. In 1657, Leopoldo de' Medici, the Grand Duke's youngest brother, established the Accademia del Cimento, which set up to attract scientists from all over Tuscany to Florence for mutual study.|$|E
25|$|His {{experiences}} in South America having convinced him of certain serious {{errors in the}} readings of aneroid <b>barometers</b> at high altitudes, he published a work entitled How to Use the Aneroid Barometer and succeeded in introducing important improvements in their construction. He afterwards published two guide books to Zermatt and Chamonix.|$|E
25|$|Aneroid <b>barometers</b> have a {{mechanical}} adjustment {{that allows the}} equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an aneroid barometer is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as the local weather station) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being set—regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few aneroid <b>barometers</b> intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing either the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.|$|E

50|$|The Zambretti Forecaster is {{a weather}} {{forecasting}} instrument {{used in conjunction}} with a <b>barometer.</b> It interprets the reading of a <b>barometer</b> into one forecast from a large selection of permutations after making allowances for variable factors. These include wind direction, a rising, falling or steady <b>barometer,</b> and the season.|$|R
25|$|The mean {{sea level}} {{pressure}} (MSLP) is the average atmospheric pressure at sea level. This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the Internet. When <b>barometers</b> in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure adjusted to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barometers</b> and {{pressure}} altimeters (the most basic and {{common type of}} altimeter) are essentially the same instrument, but used for different purposes. An altimeter {{is intended to be}} transported from place to place matching the atmospheric pressure to the corresponding altitude, while a barometer is kept stationary and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather. The main exception to this is ships at sea, which can use a barometer because their elevation does not change.|$|E
25|$|Saussure carried <b>barometers</b> and boiling-point {{thermometers}} to {{the summits}} {{of the highest}} mountains, and estimated the relative humidity of the atmosphere at different heights, its temperature, the strength of solar radiation, the composition of air and its transparency. Then, he investigated {{the temperature of the}} earth at all depths to which he could drive his thermometer staves, and the course, conditions and temperature of streams, rivers, glaciers and lakes, even of the sea.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a plant health <b>barometer,</b> an instrument to measure the general phytosanitary situation {{on a national level}} (Belgium) and on a yearly basis and to monitor its evolution over time, is described. The elaboration of a set of 13 plant health indicators (PHI’s) {{as the basis for the}} plant health <b>barometer</b> is discussed. These indicators were weighted by experts - including scientists, policy makers and agroindustrial representatives - to determine their relative impact in the <b>barometer.</b> The result of the <b>barometer</b> is expressed as a comparison with the previous year. Based on the results of the 13 PHI’s, it is concluded that the general plant health in Belgium shows a positive evolution from 2007 until 2010 and a negative evolution from 2010 until 2012. The plant health <b>barometer</b> provides a overview of the phytosanitary situation of plants and plant products in Belgium and is a tool to communicate in an intelligible, comprehensible manner on aspects of plant health to consumers and professional stakeholders in the plant production chain.

25|$|Android devices {{incorporate}} many optional hardware components, including still {{or video}} cameras, GPS, orientation sensors, dedicated gaming controls, accelerometers, gyroscopes, <b>barometers,</b> magnetometers, proximity sensors, pressure sensors, thermometers, and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as smartphones, and additional requirements apply {{if they are}} present. Some other hardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a phone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the phone function became optional. Android used to require an autofocus camera, which was relaxed to a fixed-focus camera if present at all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes.|$|E
