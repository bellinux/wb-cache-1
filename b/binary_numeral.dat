25|$|The two's {{complement}} {{of the minimum}} number in the range {{will not have the}} desired effect of negating the number. For example, the two's {{complement of}} −128 in an 8-bit system results in the same binary number.

25|$|Leibniz {{may have}} been the first {{computer}} scientist and information theorist. Early in life, he documented the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system (base 2), then revisited that system throughout his career. He anticipated Lagrangian interpolation and algorithmic information theory. His calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects of the universal Turing machine. In 1961, Norbert Wiener suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of cybernetics.|$|E

25|$|In computers, {{the main}} numeral systems {{are based on}} the {{positional}} system in base2 (<b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system), with two binary digits, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three (octal numeral system) or four (hexadecimal numeral system) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases232 or 264 (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the machine word) are used, as, for example, in GMP.|$|E
25|$|Pāṇini (c. 5th century BC) {{formulated}} {{the rules}} for Sanskrit grammar. His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules, transformations, and recursion. Pingala (roughly 3rd–1st centuries BC) in his treatise of prosody uses a device corresponding to a <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system. His discussion of the combinatorics of meters corresponds to an elementary version of the binomial theorem. Pingala's work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called mātrāmeru).|$|E
25|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is said to}} take logarithmic time if T(n) = O(log n). Due {{to the use of}} the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system by computers, the logarithm is frequently base 2 (that is, log2 n, sometimes written lg n). However, by the change of base for logarithms, loga n and logb n differ only by a constant multiplier, which in big-O notation is discarded; thus O(log n) is the standard notation for logarithmic time algorithms regardless of the base of the logarithm.|$|E

25|$|Example 4. Ultimately {{constant}} sequences. Any Boolean {{combination of}} ultimately constant sequences is ultimately constant; hence these form a Boolean algebra. We can identify these with the integers by viewing the ultimately-zero sequences as nonnegative <b>binary</b> <b>numerals</b> (bit 0 {{of the sequence}} being the low-order bit) and the ultimately-one sequences as negative <b>binary</b> <b>numerals</b> (think two's complement arithmetic with the all-ones sequence being −1). This makes the integers a Boolean algebra, with union being bit-wise OR and complement being −x−1. There are only countably many integers, so this infinite Boolean algebra is countable. The atoms are the powers of two, namely 1,2,4,.... Another way of describing this algebra is as the set of all finite and cofinite sets of natural numbers, with the ultimately all-ones sequences corresponding to the cofinite sets, those sets omitting only finitely many natural numbers.|$|R
25|$|Leibniz {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the I Ching through his contact with the French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet, who visited China in 1685 as a missionary.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{numeral system}} is the unary numeral system, in which every natural number is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol / is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by ///////. Tally marks represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it {{plays an important role}} in theoretical computer science. Elias gamma coding, which is commonly used in data compression, expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a <b>binary</b> <b>numeral.</b>|$|E
500|$|Second, a {{comparable}} theorem applies in each radix or base. For example, in base 2 (the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system) 0.111... equals 1, and in base 3 (the ternary numeral system) 0.222... equals 1. In general, any terminating base b expression has a counterpart with repeated trailing digits equal to b [...] 1.

500|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{application}} of binary logarithms was in music theory, by Leonhard Euler: the binary logarithm of a frequency ratio of two musical tones gives {{the number of}} octaves by which the tones differ. Binary logarithms {{can be used to}} calculate the length of the representation of a number in the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system, or the number of bits needed to encode a message in information theory. In computer science, they count the number of steps needed for binary search and related algorithms. Other areas ...|$|E
50|$|The {{octal numeral}} system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, {{and uses the}} digits 0 to 7. Octal numerals {{can be made from}} <b>binary</b> <b>numerals</b> by {{grouping}} consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right). For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010. Two zeroes can be added at the left: (00)1 001 010, corresponding the octal digits 1 1 2, yielding the octal representation 112.|$|R
25|$|Binary is also easily {{converted}} to the octal numeral system, since octal uses a radix of 8, {{which is a}} power of two (namely, 23, so it takes exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and <b>binary</b> <b>numerals</b> {{is the same as}} for the first eight digits of hexadecimal in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.|$|R

500|$|Zero also {{fits into}} the {{patterns}} formed by other even numbers. The parity rules of arithmetic, such as , require 0 to be even. Zero is the additive identity element [...] {{of the group of}} even integers, and it is the starting case from which other even natural numbers are recursively defined. Applications of this recursion from graph theory to computational geometry rely on zero being even. Not only is 0 divisible by 2, it is divisible by every power of 2, which is relevant to the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> system used by computers. In this sense, 0 is the [...] "most even" [...] number of all.|$|E

2500|$|When spoken, binary numerals {{are usually}} read digit-by-digit, {{in order to}} {{distinguish}} them from decimal numerals. For example, the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> 100 is pronounced one zero zero, rather than one hundred, to make its binary nature explicit, and for purposes of correctness. Since the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> 100 represents the value four, it would be confusing {{to refer to the}} numeral as one hundred (a word that represents a completely different value, or amount). Alternatively, the <b>binary</b> <b>numeral</b> 100 can be read out as [...] "four" [...] (the correct value), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.|$|E
40|$|We embed Safe Recursion on Notation (SRN) into Light Affine Logic by Levels (LALL), {{derived from}} the logic L 4. LALL is an intuitionistic {{deductive}} system, with a polynomial time cut elimination strategy. The embedding allows to represent every term t of SRN as a family of proof nets |t|^l in LALL. Every proof net |t|^l in the family simulates t on arguments whose bit length is bounded by the integer l. The embedding is based on two crucial features. One is the recursive type in LALL that encodes Scott <b>binary</b> <b>numerals,</b> i. e. Scott words, as proof nets. Scott words represent the arguments of t {{in place of the}} more standard Church <b>binary</b> <b>numerals.</b> Also, the embedding exploits the "fuzzy" borders of paragraph boxes that LALL inherits from L 4 to "freely" duplicate the arguments, especially the safe ones, of t. Finally, the type of |t|^l depends on the number of composition and recursion schemes used to define t, namely the structural complexity of t. Moreover, the size of |t|^l is a polynomial in l, whose degree depends on the structural complexity of t. So, this work makes closer both the predicative recursive theoretic principles SRN relies on, and the proof theoretic one, called /stratification/, at the base of Light Linear Logic...|$|R

While modern processors usually perform addition and multiplication just as fast as bitwise operations due to their longer instruction pipelines and other architectural design choices, bitwise operations do commonly use less power because of the reduced use of resources.|$|R
40|$|Interval {{arithmetic}} {{is hardly}} feasible without directed rounding as provided, for example, by the IEEE floating-point standard.

Although {{it may be possible}} to adapt these algorithms for use in decimal interval I/O, we argue that outward rounding in radix conversion is computationally a simpler problem than guaranteeing identity.
