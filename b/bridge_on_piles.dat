40|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of pile foundation is assessed for the 30 km long viaduct bridge structure seating in the ground subsidence area in {{the central part of}} Taiwan. The focus of this paper is placed on the settlement behaviour of a continuous 3 -span R. C. viaduct <b>bridge</b> supported <b>on</b> <b>piles</b> adjacent to highway embankment. Monitoring data accumulated over the last 12 years indicate that the observed pace of the settlement of the viaduct structure in other sections matches that of the ground. However, the bridge piers adjacent to the embankment have been suffering an additional approximately 1 cm settlement every year since the completion of the embankment construction. It was believed that the piers may suffer from enormous negative skin friction owing to the surcharge from the embankment and groundwater depression. This paper first summarizes the settlement analysis results to quantify the settlement of pile due to regional ground subsidence and the combined effects from ground water fluctuation and embankment surcharge loading. Accordingly, a loading path on P'-q stress space is formulated to illustrate the loading variation subject to the combined loading effects that can explain why the combined effect becoming significant on settlement control for civil infrastructure in ground subsidence area...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effects of soil-structure {{interaction}} and spatial variability of seismic motion due to nonlinear site amplification on the seismic behaviour of long multi-span <b>bridges</b> founded <b>on</b> <b>piles.</b> An analysis framework able to include the spatial variation of ground motion induced by specific geological and geomorphological scenarios in the seismic soil-structure interaction analysis of long bridges is adopted, exploiting advantages of the substructure approach.

The reference input motion at the outcropping bedrock is represented {{by a set of}} real accelerograms and different seismic response models are used to compute site amplification effects, discussing the contribution to the free-field ground motion of both the two-dimensional configuration of the deposit and the nonlinear soil behaviour.

40|$|When {{evaluating}} the seismic performance of pile foundations in liquefiable soils, it {{is critically important}} to estimate the effects of cyclic ground displacements <b>on</b> the <b>pile</b> response. Advanced analyses based on the effective stress principle account for these effects in great detail by simulating the process of pore pressure build-up and associated stress-strain behaviour of soils. For this reason, the effective stress method has been established as a principal tool for the analysis and assessment of seismic performance of important engineering structures. In this paper, effective stress analysis is applied to {{a case study of}} a <b>bridge</b> pier founded <b>on</b> <b>piles</b> in liquefiable soil. The study examines the likely effects of liquefaction, cyclic ground displacements and soil-structure interaction <b>on</b> the <b>bridge</b> foundation during a strong earthquake. A fully coupled effective stress method of analysis is used to compute the dynamic response of the soil-pile-bridge system. In the analysis, an elastoplastic deformation law based on a state concept interpretation is used for modelling nonlinear behaviour of sand. The seismic performance of the pile foundation is discussed using computed time histories and maximum values of ground and pile displacements, excess pore water pressure and pile bending moments. The advantages of the effective stress analysis are discussed through comparisons with a more conventional pseudo-static analysis of piles...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} {{community has}} devoted much effort {{to understanding the}} response of soil-structure systems to seismic ground motions, but {{little attention to the}} effects of an outcropping fault offset. The 1999 earthquakes of Turkey and Taiwan, offering a variety of case histories of structural damage due to faulting, have (re) fueled the interest on the subject. This paper presents a methodology for design of bridges against tectonic deformation. The problem is decoupled in two analysis steps: the first (at the local level) deals with the response of a single pier and its foundation to fault rupture propagating through the soil, and the superstructure is modeled in a simplified manner; and the second (at the global level) investigates detailed models of the superstructure subjected to the support (differential) displacements of Step 1. A parametric study investigates typical models of viaduct and overpass <b>bridges,</b> founded <b>on</b> <b>piles</b> or caissons. Fixed-head piled foundations are shown to be rather vulnerable to faulting-induced deformation. End-bearing piles in particular are unable to survive bedrock offsets exceeding 10 cm. Floating piles perform better, and if combined with hinged pile-to-cap connections, they could survive much larger offsets. Soil resilience is beneficial in reducing pile distress. Caisson foundations are almost invariably successful. Statically-indeterminate superstructures are quite vulnerable, while statically-determinate are insensitive (allowing differential displacements and rotations without suffering any distress). For large-span cantilever- construction bridges, where a statically determinate system is hardly an option, inserting resilient seismic isolation bearings is advantageous as long as ample seating can prevent the deck from falling off the supports. An actual application of the developed method is presented for a major bridge, demonstrating the feasibility of design against tectonic deformation. © 2008 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag GmbH...|$|R

The second section of the thesis is concerned with the analysis of fluid flows around fixed or oscillating bodies, through the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations.
