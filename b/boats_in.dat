5|$|Before {{the storm}} reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport {{provided}} notices for the advancing storm. On {{the day of}} the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, <b>boats</b> <b>in</b> the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 <b>boats</b> <b>in</b> the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|USS Philadelphia is a gunboat (referred to in {{contemporary}} documents as a gundalow or gondola) of the Continental Navy.

Her light anti-aircraft armament was also increased to 52 Oerlikon guns at the same time. In January 1944 a number of her 20mm guns were replaced by more Bofors guns, many of which were in the positions formerly occupied by the ship's <b>boats</b> <b>in</b> the sides of the hull.

She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, {{and the fact that}} the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E
5|$|By December, Etruria {{had been}} moved to Tobruk, where she {{provided}} gunfire support to the Italians defending the city.

In all, 40,400tourists were evacuated from the Mexican coastline. According to the Secretaría de Gobernación, under which the Mexican Civil Protection Service operates, there were 5.5million homes and 21million people in 21states threatened by the system in all of Mexico.
