The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local <b>black</b> <b>paper</b> was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E

It said that Shaw had escaped from the hotel minutes before the main explosion, abandoning its other occupants to their fate. Shaw took out another libel action against Ziff and his British publisher. After lawyers in Israel failed to find evidence supporting Ziff's version of events, the book's publishers withdrew it from circulation and apologised to Shaw.|$|E

25|$|Bass became {{widely known}} in the film {{industry}} after creating the title sequence for Otto Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm (1955). The subject of the film was a jazz musician's struggle to overcome his heroin addiction, a taboo subject in the mid-1950s. Bass decided to create an innovative title sequence to match the film's controversial subject. He chose the arm as the central image, {{as it is a}} strong image relating to heroin addiction. The titles featured an animated, white on <b>black</b> <b>paper</b> cut-out arm of a heroin addict. As he hoped, it caused quite a sensation.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house.

500|$|The {{common toad}} usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short {{shuffling}} jumps involving all four legs. It spends the day concealed in a lair {{that it has}} hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous. It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months. It is voracious and eats woodlice, slugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, earthworms and even small mice. Small, fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of the tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole {{in a series of}} gulps. It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving [...] piece of <b>black</b> <b>paper</b> as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece. Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at very low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything. Periodically, the common toad sheds its skin. This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 Cox and {{his friend}} A. E. Dyson founded the {{literary}} journal Critical Quarterly. English teachers {{in more than half}} the grammar schools in the country subscribed to it. The journal published five <b>Black</b> <b>Papers</b> between 1969 and 1977. These were controversial, due to their criticism of comprehensive schools and child-centered teaching methods.|$|R
40|$|Concerned with {{countering}} racist images, black newspapers historically {{functioned as}} public relations managers for African Americans. When southern blacks migrated to northern {{cities in the}} early twentieth century black newspapers imagined a new audience of readers. Envisioned as aspiring but working class, <b>black</b> <b>papers</b> introduced these new readers to northern, urban life. A key component of this urbanization included modern sexual values and perceptions of sex outside of the confines of reproduction. Black newspapers, then, helped to create a “New Negro” identity situated in the context of race, class, gender and sexuality. At the same time, readers 2 ̆ 7 engagement with papers through their letters to the editor aided <b>black</b> <b>papers</b> 2 ̆ 7 transformation into modern publications that attempted to target a mass black public which was comprised of African Americans of different classes. ^ This dissertation examines sexual representations in black newspapers between 1925 and 1940. Black newspapers deployed certain journalistic, literary, and artistic genres to represent African American sexuality. Readers responded to images of sexuality with both pleasure and disgust in letters to the editor. These responses suggest that many African Americans used <b>black</b> <b>papers</b> as a public sphere to debate issues surrounding sexuality. This project, then, argues that readers and journalists often engaged in an intraracial contest in black newspapers over what image of sexuality should be representative of the “race. ” Together, the representations and readers 2 ̆ 7 responses reveal that early twentieth century African American sexuality was somewhere between Victorian and modern. In the broadest sense, debates around newspapers 2 ̆ 7 representations of sexuality indicate that modern black sexuality incorporated ideas of black progress into what on the surface seemed to be simple issues related to sexual behavior, identity and expression. ^ Historians 2 ̆ 7 emphasis, however, on African Americans 2 ̆ 7 efforts to achieve civil justice via newspapers have overshadowed these intersections. Contemporary readers, though, were quite aware that <b>black</b> <b>papers</b> provided a public space in which they could view and respond to a multiplicity of sexual representations at once. This dissertation strives to provide a forum for these readers to once again air their ideas about African American sexuality. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 328 - 334) On 2 November 1976 James Earle Carter, Jr. {{was elected}} as the 39 th President of the United States. The white press reported that Carter received support from 96 {{percent of the}} black voting public. Ironically, the majority of the traditional black leaders and organizations did not support the candidacy of the former Georgia governor. The thesis, therefore, studied a frequently overlooked entity, the black press, to determine its views about Carter's candidacy. The content study analyzed twelve newspapers for one year. They were the Washington Post, New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Christian Science Monitor, Los Angeles Sentinel, New Pittsburgh Courier, Chicago Daily Defender, Afro-American, Amsterdam News and Black Panther. The black newspapers were chosen because they were the most influential <b>black</b> <b>papers</b> in the country and were representative of different parts of the nation. The major criteria for selecting white papers were that they be printed and distributed principally in the same geographical area as the <b>black</b> <b>papers.</b> (See more in text. ...|$|R

2500|$|While Thurber {{drew his}} {{cartoons}} {{in the usual}} fashion in the 1920s and 1930s, his failing eyesight later required changes. He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon (or on <b>black</b> <b>paper</b> using white chalk, from which they were photographed and the colors reversed for publication). Regardless of method, his cartoons became as noted as his writings; they possessed an eerie, wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life. He once wrote that people said {{it looked like he}} drew them under water. Dorothy Parker, a contemporary and friend of Thurber, referred to his cartoons as having the [...] "semblance of unbaked cookies". The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on <b>black</b> <b>paper,</b> which was featured as the cover of Time magazine on July 9, 1951. The same drawing was used for the dust jacket of The Thurber Album (1952).|$|E
2500|$|Begin {{said that}} Shaw had been {{responsible}} for the failure to evacuate the hotel: [...] "A police officer called Shaw and told him, 'The Jews say that they have placed bombs in the King David.' And the reply was, 'I am here to give orders to the Jews, not to take orders from them.'" [...] The 1947 Irgun pamphlet <b>Black</b> <b>Paper</b> said that Shaw had forbidden anyone to leave the hotel: [...] "For reasons best known to himself Shaw, the Chief Secretary of the Occupation administration, disregarded the warning. That is, he forbade any of the other officials to leave the building, with the result that some of his collaborators were killed, while he himself slunk away until after the explosion. … Shaw thus sent nearly 100 people to their deaths—including Hebrews, including friends of our struggle." [...] Begin said that he had heard the information about Shaw from Israel Galili, Chief of Staff of Haganah, when they met on July 23, the day after the bombing. In an interview with Bethell, Galili said that his source for the Shaw story had been Boris Guriel, the future head of Israel's intelligence service, who had heard it in turn from the American Associated Press bureau chief Carter Davidson. Thurston Clarke interviewed both Galili and Guriel, the former in 1977. Guriel denied that he had been the source of the story. Galili was unable to produce any evidence that Shaw had received a warning. Carter Davidson died in 1958 and so could not be asked to confirm or deny what Galili had said. Clarke's assessment was that the story about Shaw was, in fact, [...] "a baseless rumour promoted by the Haganah in order to mollify the Irgun and fix responsibility for the carnage on Shaw." [...] Shmuel Katz, who {{had been a member of}} the Irgun's high command, later also wrote that [...] "the story can be dismissed." ...|$|E
