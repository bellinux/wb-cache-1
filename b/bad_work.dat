5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and <b>bad</b> <b>work</b> units.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, Laudrup was {{appointed}} manager of Mallorca {{on a contract}} lasting {{until the end of}} June 2012. In his first season, he kept the struggling Mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the UEFA Europa League due to its poor financial situation. At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 September 2011, Laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, Erik Larsen. Laudrup cited great frustration with Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a <b>bad</b> <b>work</b> climate as the main reason for his resignation.|$|E
500|$|MOBA accepts {{unsolicited}} works if {{they meet}} its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion {{in the art}} that {{they are unable to}} reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to [...] "relentless creativity" [...] in an exhibition titled [...] "I Just Can't Stop" [...] that was covered by local news and CNN. Other artists are clearly technically proficient, but attempted an experiment that did not end well. Michael Frank has compared [...] some of the works at MOBA with outsider art or art brut; some MOBA artists' works are also included in other galleries' outsider collections. Dean Nimmer, a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: [...] "They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for <b>bad</b> <b>work...</b> are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.|$|E

Foster said: [...] " [...] But now I'm told, apparently, that every celebrity {{is expected to}} honor {{the details of their}} private life with a press conference, a fragrance and a prime-time reality show. You know, you guys might be surprised, but I am not Honey Boo Boo Child. No, I'm sorry, that's just not me. It never was and it never will be.
