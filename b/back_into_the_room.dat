25|$|The {{event that}} finally took {{him off the}} road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The {{following}} morning while attempting to leave his hotel room with his then girlfriend, two men shoved the two <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied {{with the amount of}} money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just going to be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

2500|$|The next night, after a {{complaint}} {{from the school}} teacher, his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling, eventually knocking {{him out of his}} chair with exasperation. [...] At that point, Cayce 'heard' the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before. [...] She told him that if he could sleep a little 'they' could help him. [...] He begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book. [...] When his father came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and woke him up, he knew all the answers. [...] In fact, he could repeat anything in the book. [...] His father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him out of the chair again.

2500|$|Robert Long {{was arrested}} on November 16, 1984, and charged with the sexual battery and {{kidnapping}} of Lisa McVey. Long signed a formal Miranda waiver, and consented to questioning. After the detectives procured a confession for the McVey case, their questioning focused {{on a series of}} unsolved sexual battery homicides pending in the area. As the detectives began to question Long about the murders, he replied, [...] "I'd rather not answer that." [...] The detectives continued the interrogation, and handed Long photographs of the various murder victims. At this point, Long stated, [...] "The complexion of things sure have changed since you came <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> I think I might need an attorney." [...] No attorney was provided, and Long eventually confessed to eight murders in Hillsborough County, and one murder in Pasco County.|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioning}} Sir Rowland, Lord finds {{differences between}} {{the stories of the}} people involved. Sir Rowland, concerned that the Inspector strongly suspects Clarissa of the crime, tells her to tell the police the truth. Desperate to shield Pippa, most of the story she tells is truthful except for the confession of her stepdaughter. Under some duress from Lord, she if forced to change her tale again and this time confesses to the crime herself, albeit stating that she killed Costello thinking he was a burglar. Questioned over Elgin's remembrance of {{the use of the word}} [...] "blackmail", she states that this was a discussion over the cheap rental they are being charged for the house – four guineas a week. Sir Rowland comes <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> despite being told to keep out, desperate to find out how Clarissa is doing and is appalled to hear of her own confession. Taking Clarissa through her story more carefully, the recess door is opened and the Inspector receives a shock – the body has gone! ...|$|E

By degrees Fedora, too, came back to earth {{and they had a}} very gay little tea-party. At the end of it they all strolled <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> together.

2500|$|Don Giovanni {{revels in}} {{the luxury of}} a great meal, served by Leporello, and musical {{entertainment}} during which the orchestra plays music from popular (at the time) late-18th-century operas: [...] "O quanto in sì bel giubilo" [...] from Vicente Martín y Soler's Una cosa rara (1786), [...] "Come un agnello" [...] from Giuseppe Sarti's Fra i due litiganti il terzo gode (1782) and finally, [...] "Non più andrai" [...] from Mozart's own The Marriage of Figaro (1786). Leporello complains that he is {{sick and tired of}} hearing Mozart's aria everywhere all the time. (Finale [...] "Già la mensa preparata" [...] – [...] "Already the table is prepared"). Donna Elvira enters, saying that she no longer feels resentment against Don Giovanni, only pity for him. ("L'ultima prova dell'amor mio" [...] – [...] "The final proof of my love"). Don Giovanni, surprised, asks what she wants, and she begs him to change his life. Don Giovanni taunts her and then turns away, praising wine and women as the [...] "support and glory of humankind" [...] (sostegno e gloria d'umanità). Hurt and angry, Donna Elvira gives up and leaves. Offstage, she screams in sudden terror. Don Giovanni orders Leporello to see what has upset her; when he does, he also cries out, and runs <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> stammering that the statue has appeared as promised. An ominous knocking sounds at the door. Leporello, paralyzed by fear, cannot answer it, so Don Giovanni opens it himself, revealing the statue of the Commendatore. With the rhythmic chords of the overture, now reharmonized with diabolic diminished sevenths accompanying the Commendatore ("Don Giovanni! A cenar teco m'invitasti" [...] – [...] "Don Giovanni! You invited me to dine with you"), the statue offers a last chance to repent, but Don Giovanni adamantly refuses. The statue disappears and Don Giovanni cries out in pain and terror as he is surrounded by a chorus of demons, who carry him down to Hell. Leporello, watching from under the table, also cries out in fear.|$|E
