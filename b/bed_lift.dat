50|$|The CXT/Commercial Extreme Truck was {{introduced}} in September 2004. Based on the International 7300 chassis (now known as the Workstar), it was available in a two-door extended cab or four-door crew-cab bodystyle. All CXTs were equipped with permanent four-wheel drive with a Meritor MTC 4208 two-speed transfer case. To convert the chassis to a pickup truck, Navistar purchased pickup beds from Ford Motor Company; the CXT used {{the bed of the}} dual-rear wheel F-350 Super Duty. As an option, the CXT is equipped with a hydraulic <b>bed</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1898 Camillo Henry, Prince of Starhemberg, made {{a present}} {{of the castle}} building, the {{outbuildings}} and some land to the Upper Austrian State Welfare Society (Oberösterreichischen Landeswohltätigkeitsverein or OÖ. LWV). It was intended to use further donation to convert the building into an [...] "Idiot's Institute" [...] as it was described at the time. In addition between 1900 and 1910 major renovation and conversion work was carried out to enable the building {{to be used as}} a care home for mentally handicapped people. In 1926 a staircase was dismantled and replaced by a <b>bed</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The hospital, {{which is}} visited by about 600 outpatients daily, also has 197 beds for inpatients, {{including}} the 2016 {{addition of a}} 100-bed surgical ward. The building that once housed the isolation ward was renovated {{at a cost of}} [...] with 12 beds for the sake of inpatients' attendants, with basic amenities for free of cost. About 5 LED television sets and playing equipment for the children at hospital were donated from the Railway Staff Benefit fund. An orthopaedic block with 57 beds was constructed at {{the second floor of the}} surgical ward, covering an area about 1000 m2 and costing also installed were a [...] <b>bed</b> <b>lift</b> and an automated analyser and mechanical ventilator at a cost of [...] and , respectively.|$|E
60|$|One, two, three, four, five! The harsh clanging of a brazen clock {{somewhere in}} the {{building}} had penetrated to the chamber, followed by a deep, resonant bell. The man on the <b>bed</b> <b>lifted</b> his head.|$|R
60|$|For answer Dacre {{came across}} to me, {{and placed the}} small lamp upon the table which stood by my <b>bed.</b> <b>Lifting</b> up the ill-omened filler, he turned the brass rim so that the light fell full upon it. Seen {{in this way the}} {{engraving}} seemed clearer than on the night before.|$|R

60|$|Then {{he walked}} about the room, and taking {{me by the}} hand, I walked with him; and by and by, taking his advantage, he threw me down upon the bed, and kissed me there most violently; but, to give him his due, offered no manner of rudeness to me, only kissed a great while. After this {{he thought he had}} heard {{somebody}} come upstairs, so got off from the <b>bed,</b> <b>lifted</b> me up, professing a great deal of love for me, but told me it was all an honest affection, and that he meant no ill to me; and with that he put five guineas into my hand, and went away downstairs.|$|R
60|$|Hodder {{had lost}} his way, yet a hand had been held out to him, and he seized it. With {{a sense of being}} led, psychically as well as physically, he {{followed}} Mr. Bentley into a large bedroom, where a high, four-posted <b>bed</b> <b>lifted</b> a pleated canopy toward the ceiling. And after he had washed his hands they entered a dining-room looking out upon a little yard in the rear, which had been transformed into a garden. Roses, morning glories, and nasturtiums were growing against the walls; a hose lay coiled upon the path; the bricks, baked during the day, were splashed with water; the leaves and petals were wet, and the acrid odour of moist earth, mingling with perfumes, penetrated the room. Hodder paused in the window.|$|R
50|$|By the 1990s Rogla had a {{capacity}} of over 1,200 <b>beds</b> and ski <b>lifts</b> handling 12,200 skiers per hour.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{leaned across}} the <b>bed</b> and <b>lifted</b> {{slightly}} the arm that lay there, taking the wrist between his thumb and finger. [...] "I think we had better let Mr. Peck rest a while," [...] {{he said to the}} company generally, [...] "We're doing him no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all," [...] {{said her}} mother, turning from Alice, who had hidden {{her face in}} her hands, to inspect the costume on the <b>bed.</b> She <b>lifted</b> one piece of it after another, turned it over, looked at it, and laid it down. [...] "You can never get such a dress in this country." ...|$|R
50|$|The Beeching Axe hit {{the village}} in 1969, as it was {{announced}} that the line between Bourne End and High Wycombe would be shut. The track <b>bed</b> was <b>lifted</b> soon after closure in 1970. A commercial estate was developed adjacent to the station, though most remains as a footpath between the village and Wooburn.|$|R
60|$|Augusta {{walked up}} to the <b>bed</b> and gently <b>lifted</b> the sheet, {{revealing}} the sweet face, fringed round about with golden hair, of little Jeannie, in her coffin.|$|R
60|$|He, too, {{approached}} the <b>bed</b> and reverently <b>lifted</b> the covering. Lord Ashleigh was lying there, his body a little doubled up, his arms wide outstretched. On his throat were two black marks.|$|R
5000|$|The scene {{shifts to}} Club Penguin Island. [...] "65 million years later" [...] {{appears on the}} screen. The camera moves from a window towards an alarm clock. Jangrah awakens from her sleep, presses the alarm clock, sits up and then checks her phone. She {{gets out of bed}} and presses a red button on her wall; her <b>bed</b> <b>lifts</b> up to show nine checklists {{attached}} to the bottom of it. She takes one of the checklists, heads to her bathroom, sets a stop watch, and then begins {{to get ready for the}} day ahead. Once ready, Jangrah puts her checklist back and picks up another one for her beach party. She opens the door and to her surprise, sees Roofhowse, along with Lorna, drop some items for the party in front of her. They have a conversation about the beach party and Lorna briefly talks about The Penguin Island Compendium book she has. Cadence is the one who started this, which she will tell everyone about it later.|$|R
50|$|The station {{building}} {{is now known}} as 'Seeonee Lair' and is run as an activity centre by East Cleveland Scout District. The track <b>bed</b> has been <b>lifted</b> and the station canopy removed, but the platforms remain.|$|R
40|$|Dust devils, {{small-scale}} convective vortices {{found on}} Earth and on Mars, can transfer substantial quantities of {{dust from the}} ground into the atmosphere. It has been proposed that the low-pressure region found {{at the center of}} dust devil vortices provides a lift (the ï¿½?P' effect) that 'sucks up' material from the surface. Two simple models are compared to investigate the physics behind the ?P effect and the relevance of competing processes. The first considers an impermeable bed of particles where lifting is by vertical pressure gradients, the second considers a permeable <b>bed</b> where <b>lifting</b> is by drag forces on the particles as gas is sucked from the <b>bed.</b> Pressure gradient <b>lifting</b> appears to be far more efficient than drag force lifting. We describe conditions that favor lifting by the ?P effect and make qualitative predictions that might be tested in the laboratory, the field, or through observations from Mars Landers...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wondered}} where you were," [...] came the plaintive voice. The mother stretched out her arms. The child {{stood beside the}} high <b>bed.</b> Brangwen lightly <b>lifted</b> the tiny girl, with an [...] "up-a-daisy", then took his own place in the bed again.|$|R
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the intervention, most of the subjects in this study were lying in bed (some in the dark), with the windows of their rooms closed. As soon as the dog came in, there was a change in these aspects; the patients got out of bed or asked that the back of the <b>bed</b> was <b>lifted,</b> the windows were opened, the lights were turned on, and the patients asked that their hair was brushed and their clothes were changed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{goes around}} {{to the other side of}} the <b>bed,</b> and <b>lifts</b> the baby's little pink hand to his lips. For a while he waits so, in sad and secret communion with himself. I see his mother softly open the door, and watch him as I am {{watching}} him. In a moment more our suspense is at an end. With a heavy sigh, he lays the child's hand back again on the sealed letter; and by that one little action says (as if in words) to his son--"I leave it to You!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The artwork, which {{features}} a naked man sprawled on a <b>bed</b> was <b>lifted</b> from one of Anderson's old photo books. Taken by American photographer Joanne Leonard in 1971, the front cover picture was originally titled [...] "Sad Dreams on Cold Mornings" [...] and the rear photo [...] "Lost Dreams". Anderson says, [...] "I just liked the image, really, of the bloke {{on the bed in}} the room. It's quite sort of sad and sexual, I think, like the songs on the album." [...] The image on the window of the back cover is the same image on Quintessence' 1972 album Self.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] she answered. Then {{she knelt}} {{down by the}} <b>bed</b> and <b>lifting</b> her beautiful, agonised face, put up some silent prayer. Next she rose and kissed first her father, then her mother, kissed their dead brows in a last {{farewell}} and turned to go. As she went her eyes fell upon the assegai that lay near to the dead Zulu. Stooping down, she took it and with it in her hand {{passed on to the}} stoep. Here her strength seemed to fail her, for she reeled against the wall, then with an effort flung herself into Richard's arms, moaning: ...|$|R

60|$|Hitherto Gyp {{had kept}} his {{comfortable}} <b>bed,</b> only <b>lifting</b> up his head and watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing. But no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket, and begin to twist his apron round his waist, than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his master's face with patient expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he would doubtless have wagged it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his emotions, he was like many other worthy personages, destined to appear more phlegmatic than nature had made him.|$|R
6000|$|The Saracens {{let them}} alone, only {{now and then}} {{launching}} volleys of Greek fire. The King, on seeing these coming, would kneel down, and cry, [...] "Lord, spare my people!" [...] But worse enemies were at work. Warrior after warrior succumbed to his sufferings, and the clergy, going about among the dying, caught the infection, till there were hardly sufficient to perform the daily offices of religion. Joinville rose from his <b>bed</b> to <b>lift</b> up his chaplain, who, while singing mass, fainted on the step of the altar. Supported in his arms, he finished the mass, but, says the Seneschal, [...] "he never chanted more." ...|$|R
50|$|By the 1990s Rogla had a {{capacity}} of over 1,200 <b>beds</b> and ski <b>lifts</b> handling 12,200 skiers per hour. A new Hotel Dobrava with 160 new beds was opened in 2000 and between 2002 and 2004 four new chairlifts were constructed and artificial snow systems extended, making Rogla one of the ski centres in Slovenia with the best snow conditions and the longest ski season.|$|R
6000|$|Together {{we moved}} over to the <b>bed,</b> and I <b>lifted</b> the lawn from her face. God! How {{beautiful}} she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat. And as for Arthur, he fell to trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, {{he said to me}} in a faint whisper, [...] "Jack, is she really dead?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Temperature {{was also}} {{a major factor in}} {{determining}} whether bedding mortar was used between each placement session. Although bedding mortar was used in a narrow zone on the upstream side and at each abutment contact {{at the beginning of each}} day's RCC placement, it was only necessary to <b>bed</b> the entire <b>lift</b> if the [...] "degree-hours" [...] (that is, the product of the temperature and time between lifts) exceeded 500 degree hours.|$|R
30|$|Pure {{drilling}} fluid region, dispersed layer, and stationary cuttings bed are emerged in low rotary speed or flow rate. As the flow rate is increased, {{the intensity of}} turbulent eddies grows in strength and eventually the particles of the cuttings <b>bed</b> are totally <b>lift</b> into the dispersed layer and there only exists pure {{drilling fluid}} layer and dispersed layer. Finally, with further increases in the flow rate, all particles will be transported in a heterogeneous flow.|$|R
60|$|Æthra was {{therefore}} {{very proud of}} her son, and began to hope {{that when he was}} older {{he would be able to}} roll away the great stone in the glen. She told him nothing about it when he was little, but, in her walks with him in the woods or on the sea shore, she would ask him to try his force in lifting large stones. When he succeeded she kissed and praised him, and told him stories of the famous strong man, Heracles, whose name was well known through all Greece. Theseus could not bear to be beaten at lifting any weight, and, if he failed, he would rise early and try again in the morning, for many men, as soon as they rise from <b>bed,</b> can <b>lift</b> weights which are too heavy for them later in the day.|$|R
50|$|The scene {{shifts to}} the streets where the virgins have already drunk the wine. Tiresias arrives and stops anyone else from getting it, but the virgins take off to kill the queen and king, having become possessed by Ares. They enter the royal bedroom and stab the beds repeatedly, then dance off into the night. Pentheus, in the next room, waits {{a moment and then}} enters. He {{approaches}} the <b>bed</b> and <b>lifts</b> the covers to find that his parents are not there. As he turns they enter, along with Nestor and Hercules. Hercules bats Pentheus away as he tries to attack, but the prince has one last trick up his sleeve as he drinks some of the wine. Ares possesses him and attacks Hercules. The two fight, with Hercules coming out the winner. Hercules then finds the secret shrine to Ares that Pentheus had built and smashes it, releasing everyone who drunk the wine from Ares' control.|$|R
60|$|Bill Swinton {{was sitting}} up again with John Stukeley, and as he bent over the sick man's <b>bed</b> and tenderly <b>lifted</b> his head while he held a cup with some cooling drink to his lips, the {{contrast}} between his broad, powerful figure, and his face, marked with the characteristics alike of good temper, kindness, and a resolute will, and the thin, emaciated invalid was very striking. Stukeley's face was without a vestige of color; his eyes were hollow and surrounded by dark circles; his cheeks were of an ashen gray pallor, which deepened almost to a lead color round his lips.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{availability}} of foam rubber and air mattresses, balsam fir boughs were a preferred mattress in places where trees greatly outnumbered campers. Many fir limbs are vertically bowed from alternating periods of downward deformation from snow loading and new growth reaching upward for sunlight. Layers of inverted freshly cut limbs from small trees created a pleasantly fragrant mattress <b>lifting</b> <b>bedding</b> off the wet ground; and the bowed green limbs were springs beneath the soft needles. Upper layers of limbs were placed with the cut ends of the limbs touching the earth to avoid uncomfortably sharp spots and sap.|$|R
60|$|From {{that time}} there was little more cause for anxiety. Philip was, indeed, {{exceedingly}} reduced, unable to turn in <b>bed,</b> to <b>lift</b> his head, or to speak except {{now and then a}} feeble whisper; but the fever was entirely gone, and his excellent constitution began rapidly to repair its ravages. Day by day, almost hour by hour, he was rallying, spending most of his time profitably in sleep, and looking very contented in his short intervals of waking. These became each day rather longer, his voice became stronger, and he made more remarks and inquiries. His first care, when able to take heed of what did not concern his immediate comfort, was that Colonel Deane should be written to, as his leave of absence was expired; but he said not a word about Hollywell, and Amabel therefore hoped her surmise was right, that his confession had been prompted by a delirious fancy, though Guy thought something was implied by his silence respecting the very persons of whom it would have been natural to have talked.|$|R
5000|$|That night, at his apartment, Spade {{questions}} Wonderly about Cairo and {{the black}} bird. Nervous about Cairo's offer and afraid of losing Spade's help, she begins to attempt to seduce him, but is interrupted when Dundy and Polhaus arrive. Spade keeps them outside the door as they question him {{about his relationship with}} Archer's wife, Iva (Thelma Todd), with whom Spade has been having an affair. They are about to leave when Wonderly screams, and they rush in to find her holding a gun on Cairo. Spade laughs the incident off with a preposterous story which nonetheless gets the police to leave, with Cairo in tow, allowing Spade and Wonderly to continue their [...] "interrogation". The next morning, as Wonderly sleeps in his <b>bed,</b> Spade <b>lifts</b> her key and thoroughly searches her apartment, finding nothing. Returning to his own place, Spade gets a visit from Iva Archer. Spade tries to get rid of her, but she sees Wonderly in the bedroom doorway and leaves in a huff, threatening to tell everything she knows to Lt. Dundy.|$|R
5000|$|Granted {{political}} asylum in the UK in 2004, Wenda’s {{freedom of movement}} was restricted in 2011 when, {{at the behest of}} the Indonesian government, Interpol issued a ‘red notice’ putting him at extreme risk of extradition should he travel. The following year the <b>‘red</b> notice’ was <b>lifted</b> after being deemed [...] "predominantly political in nature". Wenda then embarked on a worldwide [...] "Freedom Tour" [...] to build support and awareness for the West Papuan Independence movement. To date Benny has performed and spoken in such diverse places as New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Poland, the United Kingdom, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the United States of America, and many others.|$|R
