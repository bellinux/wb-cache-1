40|$|In the Sixties of {{the last}} century the vault of a 17 th century private chapel was opened, {{revealing}} three isolated skulls with evidence of surgical and anatomical activity. The chapel was built by Baronio Vincenzi, who lived and practiced medicine in Borgo Cerreto, a village in the province of Perugia, between the 16 th and the 17 th century. The skull bc 01 belongs to an adult male, aged 25 - 35 years. It shows a hole on the left front-parietal region (30 x 31 mm), that can be identified {{as the result of a}} skull trepanation. The margins of the lesion are regularly smoothed and inclined internally and the diplopic tissues result almost completely obliterated by a cicatricial bone. A <b>bone</b> <b>splinter</b> (10 x 8 mm), completely reabsorbed, can be observed on the right side of the hole. These findings are the proof of a long survival of the subject. X-ray examination confirms a regular process of ossification, without infection. Trepanation was performed with a Hippocratic trypanon, largely used in cranial surgery of Modern Age. The specimen bc 02 is without skullcap and the right upper part of the face; it belongs to an adult male, 25 - 30 years aged. The cuts were produced by a bone saw with a thin blade. The choice of these regions suggests the willingness to study the basal skull, the right eye cavity and the paranasal sinuses. The skull bc 03 consists only in a skullcap of an adult individual, which shows the signs of a bone saw. In conclusion, the recovery of a trepanned skull, at present the first specimen of this type recovered so far in Umbria, together with two others skulls with the signs of postmortem examination, inside the Vincenzi family vault can be probably related to the professional activity of Baronio. He was an experienced surgeon and a skilled anatomist, who certainly experienced the empirical surgery of the nearby surgical School of Preci, famous throughout Europe for the treatment of urinary bladder stones, cataract as well as the ability in skull trepanation...|$|E

The results claimed for the operation are, however, variable. There have also been reports of sciatic nerve lesions. In this study ten cadavers were operated upon. Chiari osteotomy was performed upon five, and five acted as controls. The hemipelvis was removed from each cadaver; each specimen was deep-frozen and sectioned fransversely. The distance of the sciatic nerve from the nearest bony point was measured in each section and the results were recorded graphically. A further radiographic and photographic study was performed to determine whether apparent displacement at the osteotomy might be misleading. The conclusion was drawn that the sciatic nerve is angulated at the osteotomy and further endangered by the risk of <b>bone</b> <b>splintering</b> at the sciatic notch. The radiographic study suggested that some poor clinical results may be explained by a radiological artefact, because there is a tendency for the osteotomy to hinge posteriorly at the sciatic notch opening anteriorly like a book.

40|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} {{conducted in the}} 13 th century cemetery of the Church of S. Agostino in Poggibonsi, Tuscany (Italy), a skull with evidences of neurosurgical intervention was brought to light. The skull, belonging to an adult male, shows two traumatic lesions produced by bladed instruments. The first lesion, located on the anterior part of the parietal bones, involved only the outer cranial table; bone remodeling indicates that the individual survived the injury for a long time. The second lesion, located on the frontal bone, involved all {{the thickness of the}} bone; the absence of reparative processes allows a diagnosis of peri mortem lesion. In order to treat this wound the patient was submitted to a surgical intervention. In fact, in correspondence to the lesion, an oval bone loss, with clean and well-defined cutting-edges, can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} trepanation, probably performed to clean the wound and to remove any <b>bone</b> <b>splinters.</b> Half of the bone "rondella" was found in situ; it can be hypothesized that the surgeon decided to replace the bony piece to protect the brain.

The excavation of a prehistoric well (Genomi, Sardinia) brought to light sixty canine bones of the Age Roman (2 nd century AD), although this well was built during the Nuragic Age. (1 st millennium BC). Two canine skulls showing three traumatic lesions underwent computed tomography in order to study the endocast of the brain cavity and indirectly locate possible brain lesions. In the first case, a traumatic lesion {{was found in the}} left parietal bone with depression of the outer surface. This lesion determined compression of the left frontal cortex and was compatible with life, as can be deduced by the inflammation of the periostenum. In the second case, two different traumatic lesions were found. The former was a wide fracture of the right frontal bone near the orbital cavity. The injured area showed clear signs of bone remodeling which took place many months before death. The latter was a severe comminuted fracture involving both the outer and inner surface of the left frontal bone, which provoked a deep wound in the left frontal cortex. The sharp outline of <b>bone</b> <b>splinters</b> with no signs of bone remodelling indicates that the trauma was not compatible with life. All lesions described were consequent to severe blows from humans and testify mistreatment of dogs in the Roman Age...|$|R

40|$|The {{sample of}} fossil human bones from the Sima de los Huesos, Atapuerca, has been {{analysed}} to trace parts of its taphonomic history. The work reported here {{is restricted to}} analysis of the skeletal elements preserved and their surface modifications. Preliminary plans of specimen distribution published 6 years ago indicate that the skeletal elements are dispersed within the cave, but more recent data are not yet available. Most of the fossils are broken, with some breakage when the bone was fresh and some when already partly mineralized, both types showing some rounding. There are few longitudinal breaks on shafts of long bones and so very few <b>bone</b> <b>splinters.</b> All skeletal elements are preserved but in unequal proportions, with elements like femora, humeri and mandibles and teeth with greater structural density being best represented. There {{is no evidence of}} weathering or of human damage such as cut marks on any of the human assemblage, but trampling damage is present on most bones. Carnivore damage is also common, with some present on more than half the sample, but it is mostly superficial, either on the surfaces of shafts and articular ends or on the edges of spiral breaks. The sizes and distribution of the carnivore pits indicate extensive canid activity, and this is interpreted as scavenging of the bones in place in the cave. Indications of tooth marks from a larger carnivore indicate the activity possibly of a large felid: the marks are too large to be produced by small canids, with the larger marks concentrated on spiral breaks on the more robust bones, and {{there is no evidence of}} <b>bone</b> crushing and <b>splintering</b> in the manner of hyaenas. The nature of the SH human assemblage is also consistent with accumulation by humans, the evidence for this being the lack of other animals, especially the lack of herbivorous animals, associated with the humans, and the high number of individuals preserved.
