25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> correct fit using a method adopted by plastic surgeons. Using a flexible tape measure, position the tape {{at the outside}} of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E
25|$|When Jeopardy! {{made the}} move on December 31, 1984, WABC {{was looking to}} improve its ratings in the hour leading up to Eyewitness News at 5:00p.m.. Jeopardy! helped, but the station {{did not seem to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{complementary}} program for it at 4:30p.m.. The station first tried Name That Tune as the accompanying program, but the show had already been struggling in the ratings in its earlier morning timeslot and did not fare better. Thus, WABC moved it to a late-night timeslot and added Divorce Court in its place in early 1985. While Divorce Court was popular, the fictional court program switched stations for the fall of 1985. WABC responded by signing on as an affiliate for the syndicated edition of Sale of the Century, which had been airing on WOR since its January 1985 premiere and was entering its second season that fall. But once again, the station was left needing another solution, as Sale became the third straight problematic Jeopardy! lead-out program and was cancelled by its syndicator in 1986.|$|E

500|$|Willis's review, written {{more than}} half a century past the {{original}} writing of the volume, is in some respects a gentler way of phrasing the work's immediate reception. One of Russell's contemporaries wrote: [...] "As a contribution to social science... or to the study of government, the volume is very disappointing... In this pretentious volume, Russell shows only the most superficial familiarity with progress made in the study of social phenomena or in any special field of social research, either with techniques of inquiry, or with materials assembled, or with interpretations developed... it seems doubtful that the author knows what is going on in the world of social science." [...] (Merriam, 1939) Indeed, the very preface of the work candidly states: [...] "As usual, those who look in Russell's pronouncements for dotty opinions will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> few". (Russell 1938:x) Still, some scholars, like Edward Hallet Carr, found the work of some use. (Carr 2001:131) ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{agreement}} on Samoa, much of Bayard's {{term of office}} was taken up in settling disputes with Great Britain. [...] The largest of these concerned the Canadian fisheries off the Atlantic coasts of Canada and Newfoundland. [...] The rights of American fisherman in Canadian waters had been disputed since American independence, but the most recent disagreement stemmed from Congress's decision in 1885 to abrogate part of the 1871 treaty that governed the situation. [...] Under that treaty, American fishermen {{had the right to}} fish in Canadian waters; in return, fishermen from Canada and Newfoundland had the right to export fish to the United States duty-free. [...] Protectionists in Congress thought the arrangement hurt American fisherman, and convinced their colleagues to repeal it. [...] In response, Canadian authorities fell back on an interpretation of the earlier Treaty of 1818, and began to seize American vessels. [...] In 1887, the lame duck 49th Congress then passed the Fisheries Retaliation Act, which empowered the president to bar Canadian ships from American ports if he thought Canadians were treating American fishermen [...] "unjustly;" [...] Cleveland signed the bill, but did not enforce it and hoped he and Bayard would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic solution to the escalating trade war.|$|E

In 1962, over the strong objections of Frankfurter, the Court agreed that questions regarding malapportionment in state legislatures were not political issues, and thus were not outside the Court's purview.
