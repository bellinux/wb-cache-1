40|$|PURPOSE: Children {{who have}} brain tumors {{are at risk}} for a variety of treatment-related sequelae, {{including}} neuropsychological and cognitive impairment, neurologic deficits, and neuroendocrinologic disturbances. We sought to determine the value of proton <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> in assessing <b>brain</b> tissue remote from the tumor site to ascertain the effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in these patients. METHODS: Single-voxel proton MR spectra from 70 patients (111 spectra) and 11 healthy volunteers (11 spectra) were analyzed. NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios based on peak areas were obtained from nonneoplastic regions of the frontal lobe. The relationship between MR spectroscopic ratios and treatment was determined. RESULTS: NAA-containing ratios were decreased in patients as compared with control subjects. The presence of gadolinium-based contrast material did not cause significant changes in the ratios as compared with precontrast data. When chemotherapy was a component of a child’s treatment protocol, we found a significant decline in NAA/Cr ratios. Patients who underwent both chemotherapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward lower NAAcontaining ratios if the chemotherapy was administered before the radiation therapy. Patients receiving whole-brain radiation had a trend toward lower NAA-containing ratios than did those who had only focal tumor treatment.

40|$|The recent {{advances}} in brain tumor imaging offer unique anatomical as well as pathophysiological information that provides new insights on brain tumors, directed at facilitating therapeutic decisions and providing information regarding prognosis. This information is presently utilized in clinical practice for initial diagnosis and noninvasive, preoperative grading of tumors, biopsy planning, surgery, and radiation portal planning, as well as, prognostication. The newer advances described in this review include magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography, perfusion imaging, <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> and functional imaging, using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) technique. Diffusion tensor MR imaging is the only noninvasive in vivo method for mapping white matter fiber tract trajectories in the human brain. In the current clinical practice, {{one of the most}} important indications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is to study the relation of a tumor to the adjacent white matter tracts. Perfusion imaging with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an exciting new radiological technique for noninvasive evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics, in certain definite clinical settings. Cerebral perfusion imaging describes the passage of blood through the brain&#x 2032;s vascular network. Perfusion imaging, especially with MRI has become an integral component of the complete radiological assessment of <b>brain</b> tumors. <b>MR</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (MSR) is the only noninvasive technique capable of measuring chemicals within the body. MRS distinguishes various metabolites on the basis of their slightly different chemical shifts or resonance frequencies.

In patient care, functional MR imaging is primarily used in the preoperative evaluation of the relationship of a brain tumor with an eloquent cortex.

The metabolic characterization of diverse brain lesions and pathological conditions is well established by spectroscopy studies at 1. 5 T, but recently, {{an increase in the number}} of 3 T magnets has noticeably improved routine neuroimaging in general. For brain proton spectroscopy, the use of higher magnetic fields has been promising in terms of increasing the signal/noise ratio across the spectrum and widening the frequency bandwidth to allow clearer separation of peaks that are otherwise too close to each other at 1. 5 T, especially glutamate, glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The individual detection and quantification of these metabolites will add more details to the characterization of brain diseases, and allow the inclusion of more brain pathologies.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. Subjective and methods: Between April 2011 and December 2013, a total of 30 patients having partial seizures with or without secondary generalization were selected from the Neurology Department, Sayed Galal Hospital, Al Azhar University and were studied in this work. All patients included in the study had clinical history, seizure symptoms, inter-ictal electroencephalography and neuroimaging findings that were consistent with “non-lesional epilepsy of temporal lobe origin”. We mean by non-lesional epilepsy that those cases are not secondary to other pathological lesions e. g. tumor, vascular insult or post inflammatory. Mesial temporal sclerosis was considered as nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. Each patient was thoroughly asked about the detailed clinical history after reviewing the referring imaging request and laboratory findings. The MRI and MRS examinations were performed in all the patients in one session. They were performed at 1. 5  T super conducting system. Results: MRS was performed in a total of 30 patients. Sixteen patients were males and 14 were females. The average age of the patients was 32  years (range: 17 – 47  years). Seventeen patients (56. 7 % of total patient number) were found to have clinical and EEG criteria of epileptic activity related to temporal lobe origin on the right side, while 11 patients (36. 7 % of total patient number) were found to have these findings on the left side. Two patients (6. 6 % of total patients’ number) were having bilateral temporal lobe epileptic activity. Twenty six patients (about 87 % of total patient number) were able to be lateralized with MRS using asymmetry index, 16 cases lateralized to the right side (about 53 % of total patient number) and 10 cases lateralized to the left side (about 34 % of total patient number).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Brain</b> <b>MR</b> imaging and single-voxel proton <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> of the right cerebellar hemisphere and pons were performed in 30 patients with sporadic (n = 16) or inherited (n = 14) degenerative ataxia and in 20 healthy control subjects. Several indexes of brainstem and cerebellar atrophy were measured on MR images, {{as well as the}} N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr), choline/Cr (Cho/Cr), and myo-inositol/Cr (mI/Cr) ratios in the MR spectra. Differences between patients and subjects were evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, whereas correlation of clinical, MR imaging, and spectroscopic data was assessed with nonparametric Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Measurements of brainstem and cerebellar atrophy obtained from MR images revealed patients had olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) (n = 11), spinal atrophy (SA) (n = 8), or corticocerebellar atrophy (CCA) (n = 4). Seven patients did not fulfill the criteria for any group and were considered undefined.

Pontine and cerebellar NAA/Cr ratios were also significantly reduced in patients with SA and CCA. Five patients with undefined ataxia had a substantial decrease of pontine or cerebellar NAA/Cr ratio when compared with that of the control subjects. In patients with OPCA, the pontine NAA/Cr ratio (but not the atrophy measurements) showed a correlation (P =. 04) with disability.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{published}} work shows that proton (hydrogen 1 [(1) H]) magnetic resonance (<b>MR)</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> has evolved from a research tool into a clinical neuroimaging modality. Herein, the authors present a summary of brain disorders in which <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> {{has an impact on}} patient management, together with a critical consideration of common data acquisition and processing procedures. The article documents the impact of (1) H <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> in the clinical evaluation of disorders of the central nervous system. The clinical usefulness of (1) H <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> has been established for brain neoplasms, neonatal and pediatric disorders (hypoxia-ischemia, inherited metabolic diseases, and traumatic brain injury), demyelinating disorders, and infectious brain lesions. The growing list of disorders for which (1) H <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> may contribute to patient management extends to neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, and stroke.

40|$|<b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is a noninvasive {{technique}} to quantify hepatic steatosis. <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> provides {{information about the}} chemical composition of tissues in a spectrum. Hepatic steatosis is characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver. The prevalence of hepatic steatosis is increasing due to its relation with obesity and insulin resistance in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This thesis describes the applications of <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (primarily on 3 T) for noninvasive assessment of hepatic steatosis. Several aspects of <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> were studied such as a meta-analysis of literature, reproducibility, comparison of accuracy of available imaging modalities for hepatic steatosis assessment, hepatic steatosis assessment in a cohort of morbidly obese patients, evaluation of hepatic steatosis in an experimental rat model and the feasibility of <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> for hepatic lipid composition analysis in rats and patients...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: In a {{previous}} study, {{we have shown}} that modulus post-processing is a simple and efficient tool to both phase correct and frequency align magnetic resonance (MR) spectra automatically. Furthermore, this technique also eliminates sidebands and phase distortions. The advantages of the modulus technique have been illustrated in several applications to <b>brain</b> proton <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Two possible drawbacks have also been pointed out. The first one is the theoretical decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by a factor up to √ 2 when comparing the spectrum obtained after modulus versus conventional post-processing. The second pitfall results from the symmetrization of the spectrum induced by modulus post-processing, since any resonance or artifact located at {{the left of the}} water resonance is duplicated at the right of the water resonance, thus contaminating the region of the spectrum containing the resonances of interest. Herein, we propose a strategy in order to eliminate these two limitations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Concerning the SNR issue, two complementary approaches are presented here. The first is based on the application of modulus post-processing before spatial apodization, and the second consists in substituting the left half of the spectrum by the fit of the water resonance before applying modulus post-processing. The symmetrization induced by modulus post-processing then combines the right half of the original spectrum containing the resonances of interest with the left half of the water fit, free of noise and artifacts. Consequently, the SNR is improved when compared to modulus post-processing alone. As a bonus, any artifact or resonance present in the left half of the original spectrum is removed. This solves the second limitation. RESULTS: After validation of the technique on simulations, we demonstrated that this improvement of the modulus technique is significantly advantageous for both in vitro and in vivo applications. CONCLUSION: By improving the SNR of the spectra and eliminating eventual contaminations, the new strategies proposed here confer an additional competitive advantage to the modulus post-processing technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. Subjective and methodsBetween April 2011 and December 2013, a total of 30 patients having partial seizures with or without secondary generalization were selected from the Neurology Department, Sayed Galal Hospital, Al Azhar University and were studied in this work. All patients included in the study had clinical history, seizure symptoms, inter-ictal electroencephalography and neuroimaging findings that were consistent with “non-lesional epilepsy of temporal lobe origin”. We mean by non-lesional epilepsy that those cases are not secondary to other pathological lesions e. g. tumor, vascular insult or post inflammatory. Mesial temporal sclerosis was considered as nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. Each patient was thoroughly asked about the detailed clinical history after reviewing the referring imaging request and laboratory findings. The MRI and MRS examinations were performed in all the patients in one session. They were performed at 1. 5 T super conducting system. ResultsMRS was performed in a total of 30 patients. Sixteen patients were males and 14 were females. The average age of the patients was 32 years (range: 17 – 47 years). Seventeen patients (56. 7 % of total patient number) were found to have clinical and EEG criteria of epileptic activity related to temporal lobe origin on the right side, while 11 patients (36. 7 % of total patient number) were found to have these findings on the left side. Two patients (6. 6 % of total patients’ number) were having bilateral temporal lobe epileptic activity. Twenty six patients (about 87 % of total patient number) were able to be lateralized with MRS using asymmetry index, 16 cases lateralized to the right side (about 53 % of total patient number) and 10 cases lateralized to the left side (about 34 % of total patient number). The remaining 4 patients (about 13 % of total patient number) failed to be lateralized in our study. The sensitivity and specificity of the Conventional MRI and <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> for detection of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy were 60 % & 65 % and 86 % & 83 % respectively. ConclusionMR spectroscopy is a very sensitive guiding tool in predicting the temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the side of involvement in patients with TLE even in patients with MR negative studies. It helps in detecting abnormal spectra of various <b>brain</b> metabolites. <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> has demonstrated consistent metabolic abnormalities in partial seizures.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} how proton <b>MR</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (1 H-MR spectroscopy) was useful in elucidat-ing {{the diagnosis of}} galactosemia in an undiagnosed 6 -month-old infant. In vivo 1 H-MR spectroscopy of the brain showed a doublet at 3. 7 parts per million, which was identified as galactitol (Gal-ol) by in vitro 1 H-MR spectroscopy of the urine. Galactosemia was subsequently confirmed by laboratory tests and treatment was initiated. A follow-up <b>brain</b> <b>MR</b> imaging and 1 H-MR spectroscopy study revealed resolution of white matter lesions and disappearance of Gal-ol peaks. Inborn errors of metabolism can lead to accumulation ofmetabolites {{in the brain and}} consequent abnormal peaks in the proton <b>MR</b> (1 H-MR) <b>spectroscopy</b> spectrum. Patients with disorders in the carbohydrate metabolism can show ab-normal brain 1 H-MR spectroscopy with unusual peaks in the region of the sugars, around 3. 7 ppm. It was shown that in vitro 1 H-MR spectroscopy of the urine can help in the correct assignment of these peaks. 1 We report here a case where in vivo and in vitro 1 H-MR spectroscopy aid in the diagnosis of galactosemia...|$|R
