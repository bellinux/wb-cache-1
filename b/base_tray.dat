40|$|The {{operation}} of a radio beacon position locator {{during and after the}} remotely controlled transport aircraft is discussed. The radio beacon transmission was actuated and was picked up by the Navy P- 3 A chase aircraft for a short time, after which reception was lost. The pilot reported that he received a signal on both 121. 5 MHz and 243 MHz for a period of approximately 5 seconds. Five minutes after the crash a portable direction finding unit located {{on the roof of the}} NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, 4 miles distant from the crash, was unable to pick up the beacon transmission. The fire crews started fighting the fires approximately 90 seconds after the time of impact. Navy personnel access to the crash site was allowed on the morning of December 2, 1984. Radio beacon locator was found resting top side up, 15 feet forward and 13 feet perpendicular from the tray location the starboard side of the aircraft. An immediate inspection indicated the airfoil suffered moderate fire damage with paint peeling but not intumescing. The visual marker strobe lamp housings were intact but extensively burned such that it was impossible to see if the lamps had survived. The airfoil suffered minor structural damage, with assorted dents, etc. The extended plunger on the ARU- 21 release unit indicated that the pyrotechnic deployment system operated. The radio beacon <b>base</b> (<b>tray)</b> suffered some heat and fire damage, and was charred and blackened by smoke. The frangible switch in the nose survived and the switch in the belly was recovered and found to have actuated. It is assumed that this switch fired the ARU- 21 squib.

40|$|Seven {{empirical}} equations {{were developed}} for the prediction of seal strength for medical device trays. A new methodology was developed and used for identifying burst and peel locations and comparing burst pressure and peel force. Multiple linear regression was used to fit 76 models, selecting the best models based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and adjusted R 2 (R 2 adj) value of each model. The selected models have R 2 adj and prediction R 2 (R 2 pred) values of. 83 to. 94. Factors investigated for the peel force response were sealing pressure (3 levels), dwell time (3 levels), sealing temperature (3 levels), and adhesive. Additional factors investigated for the burst pressure response were restraining plate gap, and tray volume, height, length-to-width ratio and area. Polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) trays with Tyvek 1073 B lids and two popular water-based adhesives were used. Trays were selected to yield three levels of area and three levels of length-to-width ratio, defining nine package configurations. Packages for burst testing were sealed under a fractional factorial design with 27 treatments. Packages for peel testing were sealed under a 17 -point face-centered central composite design. Packages were tested using peel testing following the ASTM F 88 - 07 standard and restrained burst testing with three gap distances following the ASTM F 2054 - 00 standard. All possible subsets of the factors were evaluated, with the best models selected based on AIC value.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifth-year students of the Nijmegen Dental School made 25 correct impressions for 23 PRDPs for 21 patients using alginate, and 31 correct impressions for 30 PRDPs for 28 patients using polyvinyl siloxane. Clinical fit of the framework as a whole and of each retainer separately were evaluated by calibrated supervisors during framework try-in before (first evaluation) and after (second evaluation) possible adjustments (score 0 = poor fit, up to score 3 = good fit). Framework fit and fit of the denture base were evaluated at delivery (third evaluation). Finally, postinsertion sessions were evaluated and total number of sessions needed, sore spots, adjustments to the denture base, and reported food-impaction were recorded. RESULTS: No significant differences in clinical fit (of the framework as a whole, for the retainers, or for the denture base) were found between the groups in the three evaluation sessions. Differences were not found for postinsertion sessions with one exception: in the alginate group, four subjects reported food impaction, versus none in the polyvinyl siloxane group.

Only a few products have been launched in dual-chamber systems so far-presumably due to dual-chamber systems' complex and costly drug product manufacturing process. Within this paper, two improved processes (both <b>based</b> on <b>tray</b> filling technology) for freeze-drying pharmaceuticals in dual-chamber systems are described. Challenges {{with regards to}} heat transfer were tackled by (1) performing the freeze-drying step in a needle-down orientation in combination with an aluminum block, or (2) freeze-drying the drug product "externally" in a metal cartridge with subsequent filling of the lyophilized cake into the dual-chamber system. Metal-mediated heat transfer was shown to be efficient in both cases and batch (unit-to-unit) homogeneity with regards to sublimation rate was increased. It was difficult to influence ice crystal size using different methods when in use with an aluminum block due to its heat capacity. Using such a metal carrier implies a large heat capacity leading to relatively small ice crystals. Compared to the established process, drying times were reduced by half using the new processes. The drying time was, however, longer for syringes compared to vials due to the syringe design (long and slim). The differences in drying times were less pronounced for aggressive drying cycles. The proposed processes may help to considerably decrease investment costs into dual-chamber system fill-finish equipment. LAY ABSTRACT: Dual-chamber syringes offer self-administration and home care use for freeze-dried pharmaceuticals. Only a few products have been launched in dual-chamber syringes so far-presumably due to their complex and costly drug product manufacturing process. In this paper two improved processes for freeze-drying pharmaceuticals in dual-chamber syringes are described. The major challenge of freeze-drying is to transfer heat through a vacuum. The proposed processes cope with this challenge by (1) freeze-drying the drug product in the syringe in an orientation in which the product is closest to the heat source, or (2) freeze-drying the drug product outside the syringe in a metal tube. The latter requires filling the freeze-dried product subsequently into the dual-chamber syringe. Both processes were very efficient and promised to achieve similar freeze-drying conditions for all dual-chamber syringes within one production run. The proposed processes may help to considerably decrease investment costs into dual-chamber syringe fill-finish equipment...|$|R

Removing crystals before all of the water had evaporated from the tray was the intention, as it meant that impurities would have been left in the tray and the process could be continued all day without having to close the evaporation process down whilst salt was collected. In theory the tray vessel could have been topped up with water roughly one hundred times before the concentration of the bittern impurities and pan-scale left behind became too high.

40|$|Background: The {{thickness}} of the alveolar mucosa influences the probability of the occurrence of denture-induced irritations. Thick denture-supporting tissues offer relief from mucosal tenderness and ulcers; however, the uniformity of the thickness across the entire mandibular alveolar mucosa cannot be accurately determined in edentulous patients. This study aimed to assess the mucosal {{thickness of}} the denture-bearing area in the edentulous mandible. Methods: Twenty-seven edentulous patients underwent cone-beam computed tomography scanning, wherein the patients wore a record base to retract soft tissues away from the alveolar mucosa. The measured regions were the central incisor (IC), lateral incisor (IL), canine (Ca), first premolar (P 1), second premolar (P 2), first molar (M 1), and second molar (M 2) regions. The thickness was measured in the alveolar ridge crest (T), buccal (B 1 -B 4), and lingual (L 1 -L 4) alveolar ridge mucosa. The average {{thickness of the}} mucosa at buccal sides (B) and lingual sides (L) were also assessed. Results: The differences in the mucosal thickness between {{the left and right}} sides were not significant. In the Ca-M 2 regions, T was the thickest, and L 3 was the thinnest of all the measured points in the same regions. L was significantly less than B in posterior regions (P < 0. 01). On the other hand, M 2 at L 4 was thinnest of all the measured regions from Ca to M 2 (P < 0. 01), and was thicker than IC, IL, P 1, and P 2 at B 2. Conclusions: Since the mucosal thickness of denture-bearing area in the edentulous mandible is not uniform; the tissue surface of the denture <b>base</b> or custom <b>tray</b> should be selectively relieved, which may reduce the risk of denture-induced irritations...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the optimum}} number of trays in a {{distillation}} column {{has been an}} important process optimization problem for over fifty years. Over the past decade this problem has been addressed successfully as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. But tools for solving MINLPs are not widespread, especially in connection with detailed simulation models. This paper therefore addresses the question: is there an accurate tray optimization formulation that can be solved using current nonlinear programming algorithms? In this study we obtained a positive answer by introducing a differentiable distribution function (DDF). In this formulation, all streams around a column, except the top and bottom products, are directed to all of the column trays using the DDF. As a result, the distributed flowrate of the entry or exit streams is directed to a specific <b>tray</b> <b>based</b> on the value of its DDF at that tray. This approach allows the placement of feeds, sidestreams and number of trays in the column to be continuous variables in the DDF and in the optimization problem it eliminates the need for integer variables. Instead, we formulate the tray optimization problem as an NLP using the original MESH model. In this approach it is critical to deal with trays that have no liquid or vapor flows. To describe this phenomenon properly in the optimization, complementary constraints are formulated and added to the NLP, by taking advantage of a smoothing algorithm developed by Gopal and Biegler for phase equilibrium. Also, since pressure in each tray has a substantial affect on distillation calculations, the pressure drops across each tray depend on the optimal number of trays and a related smoothing function formulation is presented that removes the pressure drop on dry trays.

This experiment used completely randomized design with species of tropical tree legumes as treatment.   Each treatment was replicated five times.   Each experimental unit consisted of one tray (size 12. 5 x 25 cm) and planted by 20 seed.   Each tray was filled with soil while the seeds were planted one cm deep.   All seeds were immersed in warm water (600 C) for five minutes before planted.   The <b>base</b> of the <b>trays</b> were drilled to create some holes for water to drain out.   The trays were sprayed twice daily (07. 00 am and 03. 00 pm) to keep the soil to be moist using a very smooth sprayer.   The variables recorded included the initiation time of germination, the range time of germination {{and the percentage of}} seed germination.   The data obtained were analyses using the Minitab 11. Least significance difference was used to test for possible differences between treatment means. The result revealed that initiation time of germination and the range of germination were not varied (P> 0. 05) among the seeds tested. The initiation time of germination ranged between 9 to 12 d after sowing.   Gliricidia maculata seed has the shortest period to germinate (12 - 16 d after sowing), meanwhile Leucaena leucocephala cv.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as the test bacteria in the fluorometric control method. RESULTS: Among the first group of the enzymatic cleaning agents tested, four disinfectants (Pandion, Resinase A 2 X, Spezyme GA 300 and Paradigm) were the most potent against bacterial biofilms after 30 min incubation time (residual bacterial count less than 10 (3) CFU (colony forming units) /ml). However, only Resinase A 2 X and Paradigm showed a good effect on bacterial biofilms after 15 min incubation time. Proteinase disinfectants (alkalase, chymotrypsin, cryotin and krilltrypsin) from the second group of the disinfectants showed a good effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm when tested in the absence of milk. The performance of the disinfectants was reduced in the presence of milk. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the cleaning agents was determined as the lowest concentration inhibiting bacterial growth. The MIC was tested on Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Lactobacillus lactis (L. lactis) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Paradigm against S. thermophilus and L. Lactis were lower than L. Bulgaricus. Whereas, the MIC of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was lower than MIC against L. lactis. Resinase A 2 X had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth when the concentration was {{less than or equal to}} 2. 4 mg/ml and Spezyme GA 300 concentration less than or equal to 7. 3 mg/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration of Pandion against L. bulgaricus was 2. 7 microg/ml and against L. lactis 5. 3 microg/ml. Growth of S. thermophilus was inhibited in all concentration of Pandion tested. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of disinfectant or cleaning agent along with the optimum concentration and the time of action is very important when destroying microbes. It is also important that the resistances of microbes to different disinfectants and cleaning agents be taken into account when planning the cleaning proces...|$|R
