An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 <b>bail</b> <b>bond</b> from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release.

5|$|Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, who {{was being}} held at Fortress Monroe, should either be set free or put on trial. Davis's wife Varina urged Greeley to use his {{influence}} to gain her husband's release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000. Greeley {{was among those who}} signed the <b>bail</b> <b>bond,</b> and the two men met briefly at the courthouse. This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the Tribune (especially the Weekly Tribune) also dropped off, though they recovered during the 1868 election.|$|E

25|$|Jackson posted $3million bail, later {{requesting}} a reduced amount.

50|$|Bail Reform is also {{grounded}} on {{the current}} state of commercial bail establishments in which there exists both benefits and limitations. Some benefits include protecting the presumption of innocence, relieve jail overcrowding, helps the courts manage case overloads, and providing some (very little) cost-saving benefits for taxpayers. Some limitations include discrimination against the economically disadvantaged, abuse of power, and a rising risk of wrongful imprisonment. Despite various reform effort, the commercial bail industry continues to thrive, making profits of $20 million in surplus profit. But, the <b>bail</b> <b>bonds</b> industry has not survived because it is socially efficient, rather because the people who are making public policy decisions are heavily influenced by those profiting from the <b>bail</b> <b>bonds</b> industry. The <b>bail</b> <b>bonds</b> industry prioritizes capitalism and privatization over justice and support for defendants.|$|R

25|$|New York's use of remand (pre-trial detention) and bail {{procedures}} have been criticized. For example, New York {{is one of}} only four states that does not allow judges to consider public safety when making a bail determination. And almost without exception, New York judges only set two kinds of bail at arraignment, straight cash or commercial <b>bail</b> <b>bond,</b> while other options exist such as partially secured bonds, which only require a tenth of the full amount as a down payment, and unsecured bonds, which don't require any up front payment. The Court of Appeals ruled in 1991 that most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours, and in 2013, {{for the first time since}} 2001, the average time it took to arraign defendants fell below 24 hours in all five boroughs of New York City. But there have been accusations of systematic trial delays, especially with regards to the New York City stop-and-frisk program. There have also been allegations that excessive pre-trial detention and systematic trial delays are used to pressure defendants to accept plea bargains.|$|E
25|$|New York City's use of remand (pre-trial detention) {{has also}} been criticized. Almost without exception, New York judges only set two kinds of bail at arraignment, {{straight}} cash or commercial <b>bail</b> <b>bond,</b> while other options exist such as partially secured bonds, which only require {{a tenth of the}} full amount as a down payment to the court (and presumably refunded when redeemed), and unsecured bonds, which don't require any up front payment. The New York City Criminal Justice Agency has stated that only 44 percent of defendants offered bail are released before their case concludes. A report by Human Rights Watch found that among defendants arrested in New York City in 2008 on nonfelony charges who had bail set at $1,000 or less, 87 percent were jailed because they were unable to post the bail amount at their arraignment, and that 39 percent of the city's jail population consisted of pre-trial detainees who were in jail because they had not posted bail. A report by the Vera Institute of Justice concluded that, in Manhattan, black and Latino defendants {{were more likely to be}} held in jail before trial and more likely to be offered plea bargains that include a prison sentence than whites and Asians charged with the same crimes.|$|E

500|$|Prior to his {{involvement}} in the shooting, Clemmons had at least five felony convictions in Arkansas and at least eight felony charges in Washington. His first incarceration began in 1989, at age 17. Facing sentences totaling 108 years in prison, the burglary sentences were reduced in 2000 by Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee to 47 years, which made him immediately eligible for parole. The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously moved to release him in 2000. Clemmons was subsequently arrested on other charges and was jailed several times. In the months prior to the Parkland shooting, he was in jail on charges of assaulting a police officer and raping a child. One week prior to the Parkland shooting, he was released from jail after posting a $150,000 <b>bail</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E

On November 26, 2009, less than one week after Clemmons posted his <b>bail</b> <b>bond,</b> during a Thanksgiving gathering at the home of Clemmons' aunt, Clemmons told several people he was angry about his Pierce County legal problems and that he planned to use a gun to murder police officers and others, including school children. He showed a gun {{to the people in the}} room and told them he had two others in his car and home. Clemmons said he planned to activate an alarm by removing a court-ordered ankle monitor, then he would shoot the police officers who responded to his house.

Saldívar's <b>bail</b> <b>bond</b> was initially set at $100,000, but District Attorney Carlos Valdez persuaded the presiding judge to raise it to $500,000. When bail was announced, fans asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Saldívar so they could kill her when she was released. In prison, she faced more death threats from inmates. The Mexican Mafia, a dominant gang in the Texas penal system, reportedly placed a price on her head and spread the word that anyone who committed the crime would be a hero.|$|E
