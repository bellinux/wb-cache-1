5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944 it {{was also}} {{apparent}} that Germany had abandoned the development of its own bomb and Rotblat asked to leave the project. Chadwick was then shown a security dossier in which Rotblat was {{accused of being a}} Soviet spy and that, having learned to fly at Los Alamos, he was suspected of wanting to join the Royal Air Force so that he could fly to Poland and defect to the Soviet Union. In addition, he was accused of visiting someone in Santa Fe and leaving them a <b>blank</b> <b>cheque</b> to finance the formation of a communist cell.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a <b>blank</b> <b>cheque,</b> some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
25|$|After retirement, {{as well as}} {{his duties}} for LCB, he played {{part-time}} for Worsley CC. There he used the club's headed paper to submit fake invoices to LCB for coaching. He then took LCB's cheques to the WCC treasurer, saying the money was intended for WCC and the rest was due to be paid to other local clubs. After the WCC treasurer handed back to Hayhurst a <b>blank</b> <b>cheque,</b> he completed the cheque and banked it to his own personal account.|$|E
2500|$|Ahern was criticised by the Moriarty Tribunal {{for signing}} <b>blank</b> <b>cheques</b> for the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey, without asking what those cheques were for. Ahern told the {{tribunal}} that {{a policy of}} signing <b>blank</b> <b>cheques</b> was used on the Fianna Fáil party leader's account for reasons of [...] "administrative convenience". In September 2006 The Irish Times printed claims allegedly leaked from The Mahon Tribunal that Ahern had received money from a millionaire businessman while Minister for Finance in 1993.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{investigation}} could get under way, Sherman alleged {{that he had}} paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay GBP2,500 each to Belcher and Sir Frank Soskice, the Solicitor General. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 cheque made out to Lass & Co. The cheque {{turned out to be}} a forgery, made out on a stolen <b>blank</b> <b>cheque.</b> Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the Lord Chancellor William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt should be alerted and asked to investigate. On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley. On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.|$|E
500|$|Although Mullum Malarum {{was passed}} by the Central Board of Film Certification on 4 August 1978, there were {{problems}} with its release. After Kamal Haasan's intervention, it was released on 15 August, India's Independence Day. The film's commercial performance during its first few weeks was poor. Chettiar, who despaired of the film's success and thought he was [...] "doomed", refused to underwrite any more publicity: [...] "A good product needs no publicity, whereas a bad product cannot be pushed in the market however much you publicise it". During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and word of mouth spread; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success, with a 100-day theatrical run. Chettiar apologised to Mahendran and offered him a <b>blank</b> <b>cheque,</b> to which he politely refused. The director instead thanked him for [...] "letting him make a movie with Rajinikanth".|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Home Secretary Theresa May {{introduced}} a Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, which was {{criticized by the}} civil liberties and human rights pressure group Liberty because [...] 'Sadly this Bill ignores reforms that could improve the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions and continues the discredited trend of unnecessary and unjust <b>blank</b> <b>cheque</b> powers that {{have the potential to}} undermine long term security'.|$|E

2500|$|Reece {{was well}} known for his staunch support of the HEC and its power {{development}} schemes on the Gordon River, which earned him the nickname [...] "Electric Eric". In 1972, he approved the flooding of Lake Pedder, which proceeded despite a determined protest movement and a <b>blank</b> <b>cheque</b> offer from Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to preserve the Lake Pedder area. Reece refused Whitlam's offer, stating that he would [...] "not have the Federal Government interfering with the sovereign rights of Tasmania".|$|E
2500|$|The European Union sent Development and Aid Commissioner Louis Michel as a {{diplomatic}} envoy {{in the region}} to ask rebel leader Nkunda to ask his delegation to be 'flexible' during the peace talks due to Obasanjo's complaint of the rebel delegation being uncooperative. Michel declared that he had [...] "urged some flexible proposals with Nkunda"; however, Nkunda reaffirmed that he still wanted direct talks with the Congolese president, saying that DR Congo's problems extended beyond its borders. [...] "The problems we are dealing with are national problems so they have to be addressed nationally and not as problems of one part of the country", he said. Nkunda also contested the president's election, saying that [...] "Legitimacy is not elections and elections are not a <b>blank</b> <b>cheque</b> for a government to do whatever it wants." [...] Michel contested this, saying that [...] "President Kabila is legitimately elected ... Those who want to contest that legitimacy {{have to wait until the}} next elections." ...|$|E

50|$|Edward Sands {{had been}} {{employed}} as Taylor's personal assistant, serving as cook and valet. Although {{he was born}} in Ohio, he spoke with an affected English accent (screen star Mary Miles Minter referred to him as a cockney). Taylor left Sands in charge of his affairs during a vacation in 1921 and returned to find Sands gone and several of the director's possessions missing including his car, chequebook, a large supply of distinctive cigarettes and jewelry. Sands had cashed several <b>blank</b> <b>cheques</b> left by Taylor and, using the stolen checkbook, began forging Taylor's signature.|$|R

If he got used cheques into his hands, he could try to imitate the signature.

One solicitor was fooled by asking him to collect a debt; Saward got the signature when he paid the debt minus his commission by a cheque.|$|R
