50|$|On January 15, 1953, train 173, the {{overnight}} Federal from Boston, was approaching Washington behind GG1 4876. The train passed a signal 2.1 mi north of Union Station between 60 and 70 mph, and the engineer decreased the throttle and started applying the brakes.

A signalman, hearing the horn and noting {{the speed of the}} 4876, phoned ahead to the station master's office. 4876 negotiated several switches without derailing, at speeds well over the safe speed limits and entered the station at around 35 to 40 mph. The train demolished the <b>bumping</b> <b>post,</b> continued through the station master's office and into the concourse where it fell through the floor into the station's basement.

50|$|The 2012 running {{was another}} Triple-Crown {{showdown}} between 2011 Triple Crown Orfevre and 2012 Fillies Triple Crown Gentildonna, 28 years since Mr. C.B. and Symboli Rudolf. It ended in another controversy again as Gentildonna, which was first past the <b>post,</b> <b>bumped</b> Orfevre {{off the line}} when they are battle on the straight line in a 1-2 finish. The following stewards inquiry decided Orfevre did being interfered by Gentildonna, but only her jockey Yasunari Iwata received a 2-day suspension, the result would still stand. Gentildonna became the first three year old Philly to win the Japan Cup.|$|R
40|$|Electromigration (EM) of micro bumps of 50 μm pitch was studied using four-point Kelvin structure. Two {{kinds of}} bumps, i. e., SnAg solder <b>bump</b> and Cu <b>post</b> with SnAg solder were tested. These bumps with thick Cu under bump {{metallization}} (UBM) were bonded with electroless Ni/Au (ENIG) pads. The results showed different EM features comparing with larger flip chip joints. Under various test temperatures from 100 to 140 °C, the increasing of electrical resistance under current stressing was mainly {{due to the}} formation of the high temperature intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The resistance increase-rate in solder bump interconnects was faster than that of Cu <b>post</b> with SnAg <b>bump</b> joints since there was more low temperature solder and under current stressing, more IMCs would be formed. When Cu <b>post</b> with SnAg <b>bumps</b> were tested at 140 °C with the current density of 4. 08 × 10 4 A/cm 2, after certain stressing time the resistances would reach a plateau region, where the diffusion between different materials, i. e., Cu, Ni and Sn reached equilibrium, and IMCs became stable. Large number of Kirkendall voids and a number of cracks were found in the Cu post interconnects which was caused by the electron wind since less voids and cracks were found in the adjacent bump interconnects. When Cu <b>post</b> with SnAg <b>bumps</b> were tested at 140 °C with the current density of 2. 04 × 10 4 A/cm 2 for 1000 h, the resistance did not reach steady state. The electron flow direction also has an effect on the diffusion of materials. The degradation of resistance increased faster when electrons flow from Cu UBM to ENIG. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
