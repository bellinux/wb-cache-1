5|$|That even a dead ala is <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> seen in {{the legend}} {{explaining}} {{the origin of the}} Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking black fly (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, tells how a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they fly out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for the flies to swarm, the wall shattered.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything <b>Bad</b> <b>Is</b> Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E

Apart from the sound, she also endorsed a new image for the release going from an innocent girl to an edgier and more sexual look.|$|E

500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score.

[...] "What a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into the movie and lets you know something <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> going to happen from the get go", Walker said.
