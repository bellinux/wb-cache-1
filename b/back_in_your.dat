500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, Janet Maslin praised the {{performances}} of the cast: [...] "Mr. Singer has assembled a fine ensemble cast of actors who can parry such lines, and whose performances mesh effortlessly despite their exaggerated differences in demeanor ... Without the violence or obvious bravado of Reservoir Dogs, these performers still create strong and fascinatingly ambiguous characters." [...] The Independent praised the film's ending: [...] "The film's coup de grace is as elegant as it is unexpected. The whole movie plays <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mind in perfect clarity—and {{turns out to be}} a completely different movie to the one you've been watching (rather better, in fact)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lear {{released}} <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Arms {{in spring}} 1998, an album consisting of re-recorded 1970s disco hits and remixed versions of tracks from the 1995 album Alter Ego. The album {{failed to make}} much impact on the market, but the re-recordings have since been featured on many mid-price compilations in Europe. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Arms was soon re-released with a slightly different track list and title, and a new remix of [...] "Blood and Honey" [...] was released on a single. Her next acting and television ventures were a French movie Bimboland, in which she starred alongside Gérard Depardieu, and an Italian makeover TV show Il Brutto Anatroccolo. On the set of Il Brutto Anatroccolo Lear met male model and actor Manuel Casella, some thirty years her junior. Lear and Casella began a long-term relationship and were featured prominently in the tabloid press in both France and Italy, before splitting in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife {{had on her}} iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures in different parts {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album. It lulls you into sitting <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> chair, puts you in a trance a bit, although the subject matter might be a bit dark." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that {{he walked into the}} room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get that fucking thing out of here, get out of here and get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E

2500|$|According to British-based Imam Muhammad Al-Hussaini, {{traditional}} commentators {{from the}} 8th and 9th century onwards have uniformly interpreted the Qur'an to say explicitly that the Land of Israel {{has been given}} by God to the Jewish people as a perpetual covenant. Hussaini bases his argument upon Qur'an 5:21 in which Moses declares: [...] "O my people, enter the Holy Land which God has prescribed for you, and turn not <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> traces, to turn about losers." [...] He cites the Qur'an commentator Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, who says that this statement is [...] "a narrative from God... concerning the saying of Moses... to his community from among the children of Israel and his order to them according {{to the order of}} God to him, ordering them to enter the holy land." [...] He argued that this promise to the Jews is ever lasting, and further said: [...] "It was never the case during the early period of Islam... that there was any kind of sacerdotal attachment to Jerusalem as a territorial claim." [...] This interpretation of the promise to the Jews as ever-lasting is not uniformly accepted by all Islamic commentators ...|$|E
2500|$|David Jeffries from Allmusic noted Diddy's [...] "unfiltered self" [...] and [...] "unique attitude", stating [...] "This hook-filled, vibrant {{effort is}} that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level {{and then put}} a little strut <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> step." [...] Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R vocals from Dirty Money and the guest {{features}} from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that [...] "There’s no telling why she turns up but she sounds right {{at home on the}} thumping club anthem. [...] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if you want to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Art Fern was the [...] "Tea Time Movie" [...] announcer, whose {{theme song}} was [...] "Hooray for Hollywood". Carson once {{admitted}} on camera {{that this was}} his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: [...] "Slim Pickens, Patti Page, Duke Wayne, and Charlton Heston in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!" [...] Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of Jackie Gleason's [...] "Reginald Van Gleason III" [...] character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress Carol Wayne became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971–1982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matinée Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting [...] "Ho— leeeee!" [...] and turning almost everything she said into a sexual double entendre. After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air {{for most of the}} next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then Teresa Ganzel to play the Matinée Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at [...] "the fork in the road". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the [...] "Slauson Cutoff", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abrubtly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to [...] "Get out of your car, cut off your slauson, get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> car," [...] often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.|$|E
