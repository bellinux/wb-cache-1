In 1987 the <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E

There were some unsprung, dumb buffered ballast <b>wagons</b> and some <b>bogie</b> flat <b>wagons.</b> There were two couverts surbaissés, which were low floor <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> for conveying cattle or horses. For mineral traffic four wheeled steel sided dropside open wagons were used. Some had brake-huts. There were also ten bogie opens. Another fifty <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> were ordered by the Mines de Barbery in 1914, {{but it is not}} known if these were delivered.|$|R

50|$|A bogie in the UK, or a {{railroad}} truck, wheel truck, or simply truck in North America, is a structure underneath a railway vehicle (wagon, coach or locomotive) to which axles (and, hence, wheels) are attached through bearings. In Indian English, bogie may also refer to an entire railway carriage. In South Africa, the term bogie is often alternatively {{used to refer}} to a freight or goods wagon (shortened from <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{company now}} {{concentrated}} on the manufacture of sand-lime bricks, in which damp sand and slaked lime (8% of the content) were mixed before being poured into moulds and heated under pressure in an autoclave. The autoclaves were about 2.5 m in diameter and 12 m long with a railway track built in to enable the bricks to be inserted into the autoclave on a <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon.</b> The fine-ground lime came from the lime works at Cocking.|$|E
50|$|By the 1890s, {{the goods}} rolling stock {{on the narrow}} gauge part of the RAR {{consisted}} mainly of (1) a four-wheeled wagon utilising a standard wooden underframe with a cast iron double bearing assembly attached under each side to accommodate the wheelsets; and (2) a channel framed <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> with cast iron bogie frames. There were at least three designs of bogie carriage in use at this time, namely the original 'knifeboard' open pattern, a closed 1st/2nd class composite with diagonal body planking and a 'curly roofed' suprintendent saloon. There were also a number of Bagnall and Fowler bogie wagons {{left over from the}} abortive Suakin-Berber campaign. By World War One, the closed seven plank <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> using the type (2) chassis above was the most ubiquitous item of rolling stock and a small number of these even remained on site after the closure of the railway system. There were also seven narrow gauge passenger coaches supplied by Bristol Carriage & Wagon Co. in 1917 but these, along with all other narrow gauge passenger stock, are thought to have been disposed of in 1923.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} above <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons,</b> there were also the KF and KW four wheel wagons, and the larger BFW/VBCW wagons used for {{transporting}} car parts.|$|R

50|$|Since 2009, Kiruna Wagon has {{manufactured}} Side Dumpers for the Swedish {{mining and}} smelting company Boliden AB. The Side Dumper TAIMN091 for Boliden is a closed container wagon {{designed for the}} transport of ore concentrate in an environmentally sustainable way. The 4-axle <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> measures a little over twelve metres and has a capacity of carrying 73 metric tonnes, or 40.5 m3. The wagon {{is equipped with a}} roof for environmental reasons and is constructed for both left and right-side tipping.

50|$|The {{range of}} {{vehicles}} {{was designed to}} be complementary to a model railway set, and for instance included a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, a Humber Super Snipe, an AEC Routemaster bus, a Shell petrol tanker and a towtruck. The most remarkable vehicle was a Road-Railer, an articulated lorry with a pair of pivoting rear axles, one bearing road wheels and the other rail wheels. The semi-trailer could be remotely uncoupled and then collected by a <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> on the Tri-ang railway system. These could in theory be chained together to compose a train. This vehicle suffered from being underpowered. Vehicles could also be driven aboard a car-carrying wagon in the Tri-ang railway system.|$|E

There are however accounts of them being used elsewhere, with accounts surviving of JA 1279 running on the Waiuku Branch in the early 1960s, and later on the Raetihi Branch during the same decade after coal-fired AB 700 caused several lineside fires. When working with other 4-8-2s on the NAL, {{they were required to}} have a <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> such as a UB flat wagon between the two engines in order to distribute weight more evenly on the light bridges along that line.|$|E

50|$|New {{carriages}} {{were built}} using the chasses of <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons.</b> These initial efforts at creating passenger stock proved unsatisfactory — {{they had a}} tendency to derail due to their very rigid construction.

50|$|In 2014 a bid {{was made}} by the Trust to re-build the open coach, {{converted}} in 1962 from one of the ex Nocton Class D wagons, into a disabled friendly passenger vehicle. After winning a vote in the 'Peoples Millions' competition run by ITV the Trust was awarded £43,400 to do the work, and the project was completed by the end of 2015. The 'D' class <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> has been returned to its original appearance apart from the addition of a safety rail above the sides and ends of the vehicle, and the inclusion of a small door in one of the drop sides of the wagon for the loading and unloading of passengers and wheelchairs. Seating is provided in the form of boxes resembling WW1 ammunition boxes secured around the sides of the vehicle. The platform at Wall's Lane (former Lakeview) station has also been extended and upgraded to accommodate a two coach train, and provide disabled access to the trains. A water tank has been installed in anticipation of the return of Jurassic to traffic in the near future.|$|E
50|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed. The last four wheeled open wagons were built in 1958, but were not scrapped in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them. In 1987 the <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E
25|$|Most Japanese reefers were four-wheeled due {{to small}} traffic demands. There {{were very few}} <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> in late years. The total number of Japanese reefers {{numbered}} approximately 8,100. At their peak, about 5,000 refrigerated cars operated in the late 1960s. Mechanical refrigerators were tested, but did not see widespread use.|$|R
50|$|Between 1979 and 1981 the Victorian Railways {{fleet of}} <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> was reclassed {{in line with}} the then-new Australian standards. All wagons kept their BMF/BMX/BP numbers. Generally speaking, BMF became VBAY, and BMX became VBAX, {{indicating}} Victorian, Boxvan, 1st variant and either fixed or gauge convertible, and BP became VBPY indicating Passenger use.|$|R
50|$|Lowmac style wagons {{were widely}} used {{throughout}} the 1890s till the 1950s when road transport {{was able to take}} their loads of machinery and vehicles. All were removed from service and (except those on preserved railways) scrapped by British Railways because they were replaced by more modern <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> such as Warwells.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} wheel-rail {{contacts}} and track gauge variation to hunting behaviours {{has been investigated}} using a comprehensive three-piece <b>bogie</b> <b>wagon</b> non-linear dynamics model. The determination of critical hunting speed is through the simulations using the decreasing vehicle speed and the constant speeds. It is found that the critical hunting speed is corresponding to the one at which the cycle amplitude starts to reduce. Based on constant speed simulations, a critical hunting speed with the accuracy of 0. 2 km/h can be determined. The key influence on three-piece wagon hunting {{appears to be the}} rolling radius difference at flange and as track gauge increases the stability of a three-piece wagon will decrease due to resulting increases in the rolling radius difference at flange. The widening track gauge will significantly increase the hunting cycle amplitude and decrease the hunting cycle frequency...|$|E
50|$|<b>Bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> {{can have}} their gauge changed by lifting them off one set of bogies and putting them back down again on another set of bogies. The pin that centres the bogies and the hoses and {{fittings}} for the brakes must be compatible. A generous supply of bogies of each gauge is needed to accommodate {{the ebb and flow}} of traffic. The <b>bogies</b> and <b>wagons</b> also need to have standardized hooks, etc., where they may be efficiently lifted. The two wheel sets on four-wheel wagons can be changed as well if the wagon has been designed accordingly.|$|R

50|$|The Victorian Railways used {{a variety}} of both 4 wheel and <b>bogie</b> open <b>wagons</b> for the {{transport}} {{of a wide range of}} loads.|$|R
500|$|Most early wagons were four-wheeled open vehicles, {{although}} a few six-wheeled vehicles were provided for special loads. Covered vans followed, initially for carrying cattle but later for both general and vulnerable goods too. The first <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> appeared in 1873 for heavy loads, but <b>bogie</b> coal <b>wagons</b> were built in 1904 following on from the large four-wheel coal wagons that had first appeared in 1898. Rated at 20tons (20.3tonnes) these were {{twice the size of}} typical wagons of the period, {{but it was not until}} 1923 that the company invested heavily in coal wagons of this size and the infrastructure necessary for their unloading at their docks; these were known as [...] "Felix Pole" [...] wagons after the GWR's general manager who promoted their use. Container wagons appeared in 1931 and special vans for motor cars in 1933.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, by the 1960s the original, short U vans {{were becoming}} maintenance-intensive, particularly those with wooden bodies. However, {{at the time}} there were not enough <b>bogie</b> <b>wagons</b> on the Victorian Railways to justify scrapping of the fleet, so instead the underframes were recycled and rebuilt with new bodies at Bendigo workshops. Of the 460 short wagons originally built (179 timber body, 281 all-steel), 254 had their bodies replaced with the new type, along with 76 underframes donated from scrapped open wagons of the IA type.|$|R
