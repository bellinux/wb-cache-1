5000|$|In the 1950s, the mayor, Yue Weifan, of Taiyuan made a {{plan for}} the first city {{planning}} of Taiyuan after 1949. In the plan, Yingze Street was the most attractive part of the city plan.

Facing the dispute, Yue Weifan advocated the conception of [...] "Don't fall behind in 50 years, or you'll regret it in 100 years" [...] on city construction and focused on the long-term development. Eventually, Yue Weifan overcame all objections and the construction of Yingze Street began in 1956. One year later, the first-stage construction was finished from the east of May 1 square to the west of Yingze Bridge. Because certain surrounding buildings could not be demolished, the final phase of construction resulted in a street width of 66 meters.|$|E
