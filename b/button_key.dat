5000|$|One day, Wybie {{gives her}} a button-eyed ragdoll which eerily resembles Coraline. The doll then lures her to a small door in the living room, which is bricked up and can only be {{unlocked}} by a <b>button</b> <b>key.</b> That night, a rat guides her through the door, where the bricks {{have been replaced by}} a corridor to the Other World, an idealised parallel dimension of Coraline's life, inhabited by button-eyed doppelgängers of people from her real world. Coraline meets the Other Mother and the Other Father, who are noticeably warmer and more attentive than her real parents.|$|E
50|$|After {{an intense}} confrontation, Coraline quickly escapes into the {{corridor}} and slams and locks the door shut onto the Beldam's hand, severing it. Her parents return to the real world, who appear to {{have no memory of}} what just happened. That night, the ghosts, who passed onto the afterlife with their real eyes, warn her {{to get rid of the}} <b>button</b> <b>key</b> to prevent the Beldam from accessing the real world. As Coraline prepares to drop it down the well, the Beldam's severed hand violently ambushes her and tries to drag her back to the Other World. Wybie saves Coraline by crushing the hand with a rock, throwing its remains and the key into the well and sealing it shut.|$|E
50|$|The piano {{accordion}} became highly popular during the 1950s and has flourished {{to the present}} day in céilí bands and for old time Irish dance music. Their greater range, ease of changing key, more fluent action, along with their strong musette tuning blended seamlessly with the other instruments and were highly valued during this period. They are the mainstay of the top Irish and Scottish ceilidh bands, including the County Antrim-based Haste to the Wedding Celidh Band, the Gallowglass Céilí Band, the Fitzgerald Céilí Band, Dermot O'Brien, Malachy Doris, Sean Quinn and Mick Foster are well known Irish solo masters of this instrument and were well recorded. The latest revival of traditional music from the late 1970s also revived the interest in this versatile instrument. Like the <b>button</b> <b>key</b> accordion, a new playing style has emerged with a dry tuning, lighter style of playing and a more rhythmically varied bass. The most notable players of this modern style are Karen Tweed (England) and Alan Kelly (Roscommon).|$|E

50|$|The 1A2 Key Telephone System was a {{modular system}} that {{provided}} flexible solutions {{for a variety}} of telephone service requirements. It provided multiple users with control over multiple telephone lines without the requirement for an operator, system attendant, or receptionist. Each user could select a specific telephone line to place calls on, or to answer calls, and manage those calls by placing them on hold or transferring them to other stations. The system provided options for station-to-station signaling and intercom, and music-on-hold. The control functions were operated directly on each telephone instrument with a set of push <b>buttons</b> (<b>keys)</b> that had lamps installed internally to provide visual indication of line status.|$|R

There was also an optical {{metronome}} incorporated into the discs which showed as a red flashing light for the downbeat and white for the upbeats inside the Optigan badge above the keyboard. The advantages of this unique optical playback system were that the Optigan's range of timbres was infinitely expandable {{and that there was}} no limit on the duration of a note as there was on the Optigan's professional-grade counterpart, the magnetic tape-based Chamberlin or its successor the Mellotron. The disadvantage was that notes could have neither attack nor decay, as the tracks had no specific beginning or end.|$|R
