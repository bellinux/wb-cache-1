40|$|Abstract. A {{reliable}} {{condition monitoring}} system is very useful {{in a wide}} range of industries to detect the occurrence of incipient defects so as to prevent machinery performance degradation, malfunction and sudden failure. Among the rotating machinery, many mechanical problems are attributed due to bearing failures. So implementing condition monitoring for bearing is critically needed. Considering that most research for condition monitoring only focus on detecting the existing fault, this paper add degradation tendency prognostics into the condition monitoring process. The kernel of bearing condition monitoring method presented in this paper is related to condition features extraction and remaining useful life prediction. The former is realized by the comprehensive vibration analysis for specific fault frequencies. The latter is achieved by adaptive neuron-fuzzy inference system based on extracted degradation signal. For illustration purpose, a <b>bearing</b> <b>case</b> from NASA data repository is used to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The result indicates that the performance degradation of bearing can be effectively monitored and the predicted remaining useful life with 5. 6 % relative error can be the important reference for maintenance decision making...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} general conclusions may {{be drawn}} from the ex-perimental work described: Inherently compensated thrust bearings can operate quite successfully when one of the pads is a compliant elastomer. Some consideration does need to be given to the possibility of pneumatic hammer instability. Compliant surface air lubricated bearings show an increased load capacity over equivalent rigid surface bearings at the same supply pressure. In some cases this increase was as much as 100 percent. There is a corresponding increase in flow rate as compared to a rigid bearing so that compliant bearings should be designed to run near their maximum load capacity where the clearance is small and the flows are much reduced. I t is possible to run the compliant bearings near this load limit because their stiffness is virtually constant. There is no rapid decrease in stiffness as the load limit is approached analogous to the rigid <b>bearing</b> <b>case.</b> Stiffness of the compliant bearings (at least for the inherently compensated type) is not much different from that of their rigid bearing equivalents. Extremely soft elastomers would probably show some reduction in relative stiffness. Bonding and machining of natural rubber is readily accom-plished. Acknowledgment...|$|E

Following Chomsky's Government and Binding theory, we develop an analysis of for-to that predicts the distribution of for-to complements based on the requirements of Case, and the varieties of licit movement of features allowed by each dialect. To do this, we propose a Revised Case Filter which requires functional categories <b>bearing</b> <b>Case</b> features to discharge Case. We also show that the features of functional categories can move either by head movement (allowing movement of to into for) or by feature transmission (allowing for to move into to). Each of these mechanisms generates a specific range of well-formed for-to complements; the distribution of these complements can be predicted by {{the ways in which}} the dialects allow features to move. Appalachian English and Ottawa Valley English allow head movement of features only, while Belfast English allows features to move via head movement and feature transmission. Thus for-to complements are more wide-spread in Belfast English than in the other for-to dialects.

40|$|Abstract: Fly ash, a {{by-product}} of thermal power plants and available in abundance, is considered not an eco-friendly material from an environmental point of view. If ways are found to use this, the resulting efforts can serve the twin purposes of facilitating applications for the ash bearing materials {{and at the same}} time reducing pollution. One way to achieve this task is to make ash–bearing composites involving polymer matrices. The ash particles, generally being hollow in nature, display lower densities while oxides present as constituents make them possess high modulus and strength thereby enhancing specific strength and stiffness of polymer systems which by their very nature have lower densities compared to many metal based systems. An effective way to composite with fly ash would be to adopt the mechanical mixing route. This process inherently induces entrapment of air bubbles, which are seen as voids in cast polymer slabs. Non-destructive evaluation comes in handy to assess this defect content in such cases. This work presents, first, the non destructive pattern obtained on the plain epoxy system; where after the images obtained due to the introduction of 20 and 30 % ash fillers into it are included. These ultrasonic C-scan pictures differing in the attenuation features find a good correlation with void content data which varies from 1. 7 for the neat epoxy to 9. 9 % for the 30 % ash <b>bearing</b> <b>case...</b>|$|E

Evidence from Yimas shows that both of these views can be correct, within a single language. Explanation of what kind of inflection is used where also provides us with an account of the unusual split ergative agreement system of Yimas, and suggests a novel explanation for the ban on subject incorporation, and some exceptions to the ban. 1. Two types of inflection My main aim in this paper is to demonstrate that inflectional affixes can be very different kinds of syntactic objects, even within a single language. I illustrate this point with evidence from Yimas, a Papuan language of New Guinea (Foley 1991). Understanding {{of the nature of the}} different inflectional affixes of Yimas provides an explanation for its remarkably elaborate agreement system, which follows a basic split-ergative scheme, but with a number of added complications. Anticipating my conclusions, the structure in (1 c) shows what I assume the four principal case affixes on a Yimas verb to be. What I refer to as Nominative and Accusative affixes are pronominal arguments: these inflections, which are restricted to 1 st and 2 nd person arguments in Yimas, begin as specifiers and complements of the verb, and incorporate into the verb by Sstructure.

40|$|Standard size {{samples of}} four natural rubber compounds, varying {{the amount of}} carbon black from 10 to 70 phr, were characterised under {{uniaxial}} compression and simple shear tests in order to obtain the strain energy function constants. These constants were then used as hyperelastic material constants for the Windows-based finite element package (COSMOS/M version 1. 75). The investigated bearings, made with those NR compounds, had the approximate area and thickness of 50 x 106 mm 2 and 50 mm respectively. Each compound of bearing consisted of four different values of shape factor ranging from about 0. 33 to 1. 70, according to the number of reinforcing plates in the bearing. Three deformation modes of compression, shear and compression-shear were predicted. Good agreement was found between twelve compression model predictions and the corresponding experimental values of bearings, containing 10, 20 and 40 phr of carbon black and each of which consisted of four different layers of reinforcing metal plates (0, 1, 2 and 3 layers). On the other hand, deviation from the predicted valve was clearly seen in the 70 phr black <b>bearing</b> <b>case.</b> The percentage difference increased with respect to the increasing number of reinforcing plates or the rising shape factor. Therefore, the improved FEA model was supplemented with an imaginary elastic glue layer between the rubber block and metal plate as glue failure compensation. The optimum value of the elastic layers modulus is 8 MPa while the thickness of the layer depends on the total thickness or total volume of rubber block. This model can predict the 70 phr carbon black bearings, having shape factor ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 35 for 11 cases. The FEA prediction of shear behaviour agrees well with the experimental data for all four bearing compounds and there is no effect of shape factor on shear stress. Moreover, shear stress does not depend on the compressive force applied to like bearing before shear and the FEA results agreed with the corresponding experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{continuous}} increase in the demand of hard disk drives (HDDs) for the mobile applications. In such devices, HDDs are often subjected to mechanical shocks and vibrations. Such external disturbances can degrade the read/write (R/W) performance of mobile drives and in extreme cases it can even cause the loss of stored magnetic information. Hence the ability of the head-disk interface (HDI) to withstand such excitation becomes critical in determining the reliability of a mobile disk drive. This dissertation presents a simulation method to accurately model the response of a mobile HDD to external disturbances which can aid the design process. A numerical investigation was conducted on a 2. 5 inch form factor laptop drive to understand the dynamics of the HDI during dynamic events such as operational shocks. A detailed model for the mobile disk drive was developed which includes a spinning disk, a fluid dynamic bearing (FDB) based spindle motor, a base plate and an actuator. The behavior of the HDI subjected to various disturbances was determined by solving a fluid-structure interaction problem in which a spinning disk and a head (slider) were coupled through an air <b>bearing.</b> <b>Case</b> studies were conducted to determine the effect of parameters like shock pulse width, HDD orientation, parking ramp contact and FDB dynamic coefficients on the performance of a HDD during the excitation. It was observed that the proximity of the pulse to the HDD component's natural frequencies has an adverse effect on the shock resistance of the HDI. Furthermore, the orientation of the HDD during the shock can also affect the stability of the HDI. In the case of planar excitations, the FDB dynamics becomes critical in determining the slider's vibration amplitude. This knowledge about the HDI failure mechanism and its vibration characteristics can be helpful in designing a mobile HDD with a better shock performance...|$|E

This is particularly the case for large fall bodied bulk carriers and tankers. Non-uniform wake distribution around the stem of vessels causes uneven and constantly varying loads upon the bearing. These loads are examined and it is concluded that they may cause lubricant film breakdown and seal failures. Examination of stem bearing failures generally confirms this view and several <b>bearing</b> <b>case</b> histories are presented Present designs of stem bearings are appraised with the conclusion that all recent advances in stem bearing design have been for the purpose of improving maintainability rather than reliability. Examination of the loading pattern and the basic design requirements of stem gear indicate that the provision of jacking oil would considerably improve stem gear reliability. This is particularly aimed at reducing the frequency of failure caused by turning gear operation. Experimental work in which oil film thickness measurements were taken on the aftermost bearing of a container ship is presented. This clearly demonstrates the problem of turning gear damage. Furthermore the shaft movements recorded at this plummer bearing show that considerable tallshaft lift (the full stem bearing clearance is taken up) occurs and that the tailskaft probably executes a closed loop under the action of the propeller. Design curves are given to show the lubricating oil pressures and quantities required. It is further postulated that, within the framework of existing classification society rules full hydrostatic lubrication would have even greater advantages. Design curves to a basis of shaft diameter are presented to enable clearance, pressure, lubricant flow, stiffness and basic dimensions to be derived by simple calculation.

40|$|As {{the failure}} of a bearing could cause {{cascading}} breakdowns of the mechanical system and then lead to costly repairs and production delays, bearing condition monitoring has received much attention for decades. One of the primary methods for this purpose is based on the analysis of vibration signal measured by accelerometers because such data are information-rich. The vibration signal collected from a defective bearing is, however, a mixture of several signal components including the fault-generated impulses, interferences from other machine components, and background noise, where fault-induced impulses are further modulated by various low frequency signal contents. The compounded effects of interferences, background noise and the combined modulation effects make it difficult to detect bearing faults. This is further complicated by the nonstationary nature of vibration signals due to speed variations in some cases, such as the bearings in a wind turbine. As such, the main challenges in the vibration-based bearing monitoring are how to address the modulation, noise, interference, and nonstationarity matters. Over the past few decades, considerable research activities have been carried out to deal with the first three issues. Recently, the nonstationarity matter has also attracted strong interests from both industry and academic community. Nevertheless, the existing techniques still have problems (deficiencies) as listed below: (1) 	The existing enveloping methods for bearing fault feature extraction are often adversely affected by multiple interferences. To eliminate the effect of interferences, the prefiltering is required, which is often parameter-dependent and knowledge-demanding. The selection of proper filter parameters is challenging and even more so in a time-varying environment. (2) 	Even though filters are properly designed, they are of little use in handling in-band noise and interferences which are also barriers for bearing fault detection, particularly for incipient bearing faults with weak signatures. (3) 	Conventional approaches for bearing fault detection under constant speed are no longer applicable to the variable speed case because such speed fluctuations may cause “smearing” of the discrete frequencies in the frequency representation. Most current methods for rotating machinery condition monitoring under time-varying speed require signal resampling based on the shaft rotating frequency. For the <b>bearing</b> <b>case,</b> the shaft rotating frequency is, however, often unavailable as it is coupled with the instantaneous fault characteristic frequency (IFCF) by a fault characteristic coefficient (FCC) which cannot be determined without knowing the fault type. Additionally, the effectiveness of resampling-based methods is largely dependent on the accuracy of resampling procedure which, even if reliable, can complicate the entire fault detection process substantially. (4) 	Time-frequency analysis (TFA) {{has proved to be a}} powerful tool in analyzing nonstationary signal and moreover does not require resampling for bearing fault identification. However, the diffusion of time-frequency representation (TFR) along time and frequency axes caused by lack of energy concentration would handicap the application of the TFA. In fact, the reported TFA applications in bearing fault diagnosis are still very limited. To address the first two aforementioned problems, i. e., (1) and (2), for constant speed cases, two morphology-based methods are proposed to extract bearing fault feature without prefiltering. Another two methods are developed to specifically handle the remaining problems for the bearing fault detection under time-varying speed conditions. These methods are itemized as follows: (1) 	An efficient enveloping method based on signal Fractal Dimension (FD) for bearing fault feature extraction without prefiltering, (2) 	A signal decomposition technique based on oscillatory behaviors for noise reduction and interferences removal (including in-band ones), (3) 	A prefiltering-free and resampling-free approach for bearing fault diagnosis under variable speed condition via the joint application of FD-based envelope demodulation and generalized demodulation (GD), and (4) 	A combined dual-demodulation transform (DDT) and synchrosqueezing approach for TFR energy concentration level enhancement and bearing fault identification. With respect to constant speed cases, the FD-based enveloping method, where a short time Fractal dimension (STFD) transform is proposed, can suppress interferences and highlight the fault-induced impulsive signature by transforming the vibration signal into a STFD representation. Its effectiveness, however, deteriorates with the increased complexity of the interference frequencies, particularly for multiple interferences with high frequencies. As such, the second method, which isolates fault-induced transients from interferences and noise via oscillatory behavior analysis, is then developed to complement the FD-based enveloping approach. Both methods are independent of frequency information and free from prefiltering, hence eliminating the tedious process for filter parameter specification. The in-band vibration interferences can also be suppressed mainly by the second approach. For the nonstationary cases, a prefiltering-free and resampling-free strategy is developed via the joint application of STFD and GD, from which a resampling-free order spectrum can be derived. This order spectrum can effectively reveal not only the existence of a fault but also its location. However, the success of this method relies largely on an effective enveloping technique. To address this matter and at the same time to exploit the advantages of TFA in nonstationary signal analysis, a TFA technique, involving dual demodulations and an iterative process, is developed and innovatively applied to bearing fault identification. The proposed methods have been validated using both simulation and experimental data collected in our lab. The test results have shown that the first two methods can effectively extract fault signatures, remove the interferences (including in-band ones) without prefiltering, and detect fault types from vibration signals for constant speed cases. The last two have shown to be effective in detecting faults and discern fault types from vibration data collected under variable speed conditions without resampling and prefiltering...|$|E

Due to the varying assembly compliance and the internal clearance existing in the <b>bearing</b> in most <b>cases,</b> a highly non-linear behaviour of the rotor bearing system appears. Thus, a dynamic model of a horizontal rotor supported on ball bearings with radial internal clearance is considered, taking into account contact forces between the balls and the races, as well as the effect of varying compliance and of the internal radial clearance. However, since rotational speed fluctuations of various levels practically appear in all rotating equipment, their effect is now additionally considered. Their effect is examined in two characteristic rotor <b>bearing</b> <b>cases.</b> The analysis includes all the characteristic states of the dynamic behaviour of the rotor, such as periodic, unstable periodic and chaotic responses, using methods like frequency spectra, phase spaces, higher-order Poincare maps and Lyapunov exponents. All results presented show a dominant stabilization effect of the speed fluctuations with respect to the system behaviour. From the analysis performed, it is concluded that even a minimum fluctuation of the rotor speed may result in major changes of the system dynamics, indicating that speed fluctuations of the rotor are a governing parameter for the dynamic behaviour of the system.
