That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship. While {{pitching}} in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but {{turned out to be a}} non-cancerous tumor in his back.

5|$|In {{the seventh}} {{round of the}} 1977 NBA draft, the New Orleans Jazz {{selected}} Harris with the 137th pick overall.

However, the league voided the Warriors' selection, thus Harris became {{the first and only}} woman ever officially drafted. Harris did not express an interest to play in the NBA and declined to try out for the Jazz. It was later revealed that she was pregnant at the time, which made her unable to attend the Jazz's training camp. She was selected ahead of 33 other male players, including the Jazz's eighth round selection, Dave Speicher from the University of Toledo.|$|E

5|$|The 1966–67 NBA season saw West playing only 66 {{regular-season games}} due to injury; his averages fell {{slightly}} to 28.0points, 5.9rebounds and 6.8assists per game.

Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired, and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over; under his reign, the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967–68 NBA season in their first season in The Forum. The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury and scoring 26.3points, the lowest average since his rookie year: after being a First-Teamer for six times en bloc, he only made the All-NBA Second Team.|$|E
