5|$|Ramona Ramirez is {{introduced}} the Marsdens' Spanish nanny, originally a minor character that {{was intended to}} only be in the programme for only 2 episodes believing that the Mardens' would regularly replace their son's carer. She subsequently became a series regular and an important supporting character and friend to the main 6 characters eventually appearing in all 5 series of Cold Feet's original run and appeared in nearly every episode. Ramona was developed to be the complete opposite of the typically English Karen and David. David finds her continental personality annoying but Karen enjoys it. Ramona's role in Series 2 developed <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> child-caring—in Episode 2, she bribes David for £30 to cook dinner for his former boss. By Series 3, she has a major storyline where she dates Pete. In Series 4, she gets caught up in Karen and David's deteriorating marriage and briefly quits to work for their neighbours, and to work part-time at a strip club. In Series 5, she dates Lee, a fitness instructor who is the catalyst of Pete and Jo's break-up when he sleeps with Jo.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{coaching}} extended <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> {{within the}} program itself. Bowerman had his athletes mentor {{the community and}} continued to be active in the sport after his retirement. He was also a coach for the US Olympic team in 1972 and an assistant coach in 1968 US Olympic Team. Bill Dellinger coached the distance runners in the 1984 Olympic Games. After Dellinger retired from the University of Oregon, he continued to coach running on a consulting basis despite suffering through a stroke. Tom Heinonen remained a running coach after his retirement at the volunteer level for the University of Oregon Running Club. Alumnus Alberto Salazar became a noted marathon coach after his running days under the employ of Nike. Salazar used controversial coaching tactics like tweaking runners' natural running form, but had coached many athletes to the apex of their careers. He launched an experimental training program called the Oregon Project financed by Nike {{with the purpose of}} integrating African runners' training conditions into American training mixed with modern technology. He also discovered similarities in running posture between sprinters and top level distance runners, two disciplines previously thought to be exceedingly different. Instilling some of these methods into American runners, he was able to coach Kara Goucher to a third-place finish in the Boston Marathon in 2009, an event that East Africans typically dominate. Mo Farah and alumnus Galen Rupp were training partners under Salazar and finished first and second respectively in the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 10k. Rupp was the first American to medal in the 10k since Billy Mills in 1964 and the first medalist not born in Africa since 1988. Also running for Salazar and the Oregon Project, alumnus Matthew Centrowitz Jr. won a gold medal in the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first American to win gold in the 1,500m since Mel Sheppard in 1908, ending a 108 year drought. Similar to his collegiate coaches, Salazar wrote a pair of books about distance running. Matt Centrowitz, another University of Oregon alumnus and father of Matthew, took the American University track and field program to prominence since the rebirth of the program in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Sir J. T.

25|$|According to the Bible, for {{her share}} in the transgression, Eve (and womankind after her) is sentenced {{to a life of}} sorrow and travail in childbirth, and to be under the power of her husband. Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel (Qayin and Heḇel), the first a tiller of the ground, the second a keeper of sheep. After the death of Abel, Eve gave birth to a third son, Seth (Šet), from whom Noah (and thus the whole of modern humanity) is descended. Genesis 5:4 says that Eve had sons and daughters <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> Cain, Abel, and Seth.|$|E
25|$|Social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} can and does extend <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> the secondary level. The original subject might share the experience (primary social sharing) with 5 other people. These people in turn share the experience (secondary social sharing) with more people, possibly 3–4. According to one study, these ‘tertiary’ individuals will again share {{the experience with}} 2 or 3 people, at least in 64% of cases. In total, 5 people are implicated by primary social sharing, then 18 more people by secondary social sharing, and finally 30 additional people by tertiary social sharing, summing to over 50 people total from the one event.|$|E

The Montreal trains are now among the oldest North American subway trains in service - the Canadian Vickers MR-63 dating back to the system's opening in 1966 - but extended longevity is expected of rolling stock operated under fully sheltered conditions.|$|E

25|$|For various reasons, an {{approach}} based on cardinal utility, where the utility has a meaning <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> giving a ranking of alternatives, is not common in contemporary economics. However, once one adopts that approach, one can take intensities of preferences into consideration, or one can compare (i) {{gains and losses}} of utility or (ii) levels of utility, across different individuals. In particular, Harsanyi (1955) gives a justification of utilitarianism (which evaluates alternatives {{in terms of the}} sum of individual utilities), originating from Jeremy Bentham. Hammond (1976) gives a justification of the maximin principle (which evaluates alternatives in terms of the utility of the worst-off individual), originating from John Rawls.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the social sharing of emotions extends <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> the realm of psychology; it also has been considered {{in the context of}} anthropology. Because an emotional episode is shared with a group of people, it becomes part of a shared knowledge within that group. As discussed above, knowledge of an event experienced by a single person can extend to more than 50 people via secondary and tertiary social sharing, thus the event has become a shared part of a relatively large group of people. Yet, an event can be extended to even larger groups of people, perhaps even whole communities or even nations, when the event is very intense one or when many people concurrently experience the event.|$|E
25|$|In-game {{activities}} may also differ {{between the sexes}} in games with less linear plots such as the Grand Theft Auto series. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like The Sims or Civilization, {{but this is not}} universally true. In 2013, Variety reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played Call of Duty and 15% played Grand Theft Auto. There has been persistent female interest in action-adventure games and MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Second Life. Compared to males, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. This emphasis on socialization extends <b>beyond</b> <b>just</b> the game itself: In {{a study published in the}} Journal of Communication in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.|$|E
