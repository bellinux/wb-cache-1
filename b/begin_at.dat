5|$|Kansas Turnpike mileposts are {{continuous}} {{along the}} entire length of the turnpike. Mile markers <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> the point where I-35 enters Kansas at the southern border. These numbers are continued along the other three Interstates that make up the turnpike, rather than numbering each Interstate individually, leading to discontinuous numbering on I-70—the exit numbers on tolled I-70 are much lower than those on free I-70.|$|E

5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which {{oscillations}} <b>begin,</b> <b>at</b> about 1m/s (2.2mph) in this example, sometimes called the double root speed due to there being a repeated root to the characteristic polynomial (two of the four eigenvalues have exactly the same value).

In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Highway 35, {{like many}} {{highways}} that <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> Lake Ontario and eventually cross into the Canadian Shield, began as several trails connecting settlements. Most {{of the southern}} portion of the highway follows various sidelines and concessions. Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls, Highway 35 follows the former Fenelon Road, while north of there it follows The Cameron Road, a trail carved in the 1850s between Fenelon and Minden. North of Minden, the highway generally follows The Bobcaygeon Road, a colonization road built {{as far north as}} Dwight in the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|I-375 and the Chrysler Freeway <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> Jefferson Avenue and St. Antoine Street in {{downtown}} Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just {{about a mile}} (1.6km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets the Fisher Freeway which carries I-75 north of downtown. At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher Freeway and use the Chrysler Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{that are important to}} the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Ilyushin began {{construction}} of another prototype to evaluate this solution {{and this was}} endorsed on 16 October 1954 when the Council of Ministers ordered production to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> Factory (Zavod) No. 168 at Rostov-on-Don of the improved version, designated as the Il-40P. The Il-40P prototype first flew on 14 February 1955 and began State acceptance trials on 12 October 1955. The changes had resolved all the problems suffered by the earlier design and an order for a first batch of forty production machines was placed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, NJDOT {{announced}} that {{work on the}} $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> the end of 2013.

The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY43 was truncated slightly on its western end to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> a junction {{with the new}} NY30 north of Schoharie. Meanwhile, NY45 was reassigned to another highway in Orange County. The portion of former NY45 from Troy to Averill Park became part of NY66 while the remainder became an eastward extension of NY43. The extended NY43 was now concurrent with US9 and US20 along Madison Avenue from Delaware Avenue to Rensselaer, where it followed Broadway and Washington Avenue to US4 in Defreestville. The route continued east to Averill Park on what had been legislative Route21.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} {{as time went}} on. In the early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was truncated to end in Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was truncated to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> the junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E
5|$|NY178 was {{truncated}} eastward in {{the late}} 1960s to <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> NY3 west of Henderson.

The former routing of NY178 between Snowshoe Road and NY3 in the town of Henderson is now maintained by Jefferson County as CR178 while the section of old NY178 from US11 to NY177 is designated as CR189.|$|E

5|$|Powerball is {{a drawing}} {{game in which}} players try to match five numbers from 1 through 69, plus a Powerball number from 1 through 26. A ticket that matches all six numbers wins the jackpot. Jackpot amounts <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> $40 million and grow with each drawing in which the jackpot is not won. Top-prize Powerball winners can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments. The jackpot is pari-mutuel, meaning that if {{multiple}} tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total jackpot.|$|E
5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from a {{standing}} position along a curved starting line and after hearing the starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes <b>begin</b> <b>at</b> a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
5|$|Saien {{was pressed}} {{immediately}} into Japanese service.

The Japanese ships attacked on schedule, firing on the defenses until they stopped returning fire after half an hour.
