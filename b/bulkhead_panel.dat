50|$|Receptacle {{refers to}} {{the other half of}} the {{connector}} pair, designed to be mounted—with jam nut fittings or other fastener hardware—to a <b>bulkhead,</b> <b>panel</b> or box. Inlinereceptacles are also available for cable-to-cable connections. As with the plug, it is the design and location of the receptacle in the system, not the gender of its contacts, which makes it a receptacle.|$|E
50|$|Plug {{refers to}} the half of a {{connector}} pair designed to attach to a wire or cable; {{as opposed to the}} Receptacle half which is typically mounted to a <b>bulkhead,</b> <b>panel</b> or box. Even though plugs are usually thought of having male (pin) contacts, they can in fact house any type of contact—pins, sockets or even both. Therefore, it is the design and location of the connector which makes it a plug, not the gender of its contacts.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{comparative}} analysis of failure prediction {{when using the}} solution heat treatment cold die forming and quenching process, known as HFQTM, for forming an aluminium alloy AA 6082 automotive panel part (<b>bulkhead</b> <b>panel),</b> is presented. An experimental programme has been designed {{and a series of}} tests have been carried out to investigate the effect of process parameters on the success of forming the complex-shaped automotive panel component using the high strength aluminium alloy. A set of unified viscoplastic plane-stress continuum damage mechanics (2 D-CDM) constitutive equations was calibrated for AA 6082 over a temperature range of 450 [*]∘C– 525 [*]∘C and strain rates of 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10 [*]s− 1, and then was integrated into the commercial finite element code, LS-DYNA, via a user-defined material subroutine, UMAT, for the forming process simulation. The results show that the CDM model can be used to provide accurate formability and failure predictions...|$|E

The rear facade of 302, however, features an cast-iron storefront with <b>bulkhead</b> <b>panels</b> and two storefront sash double doors. Cast-iron columns separate the storefront sash from the beams with rosettes.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} weight reduction of a pressurized Hybrid Wing-Body (HWB) fuselage {{is a serious}} challenge. Hence, research and development are presently being continued at NASA under the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) and Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) projects {{in collaboration with the}} Boeing Company, Huntington Beach and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). In this paper, a structural analysis of the HWB fuselage and <b>bulkhead</b> <b>panels</b> is presented, with the objectives of design improvement and {{structural weight}} reduction. First, orthotropic plate theories for sizing, and equivalent plate analysis with appropriate simplification are considered. Then parametric finite-element analysis of a fuselage section and bulkhead are conducted using advanced stitched composite structural concepts, which are presently being developed at Boeing for pressurized HWB flight vehicles. With this advanced stiffened-shell design, structural weights are computed and compared to the thick sandwich, vaulted-ribbed-shell, and multi-bubble stiffened-shell structural concepts that had been studied previously. The analytical and numerical results are discussed to assess the overall weight/strength advantages...|$|R
50|$|The {{main part}} of the car bodies were painted crimson lake but this faded to brown. The panels were {{initially}} edged with gold leaf but this was later discontinued. The underframe, beam, fenders and panels below windows were painted Indian red. The <b>bulkheads,</b> rocker <b>panels</b> and side stanchions were cream, the roof was white, and decency boards along the top deck grey. Inside panels were varnished wood and brass handrails were fitted.|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{appears to}} be one of the most {{attractive}} joining techniques for aircraft industry because, being a solid state welding process, allows overcoming all the well-known problems related to phase transformation of fusion welding process. In addiction, welding is very attractive in view of the fact that it allow saving weight in aerostructures if compared to the riveting technology. In the present paper, the experimental mechanical characterization of a subcomponent manufactured using the FSW lap joint technique is presented. The coupons simulate a <b>bulkhead</b> <b>panel,</b> i. e. a panel which separates a pressurized ambient of aircraft (i. e. the cabin) by another non-pressurized (i. e. the hold). Such a panel is usually stiffened by extruded parts that are riveted to the panel itself. In this case the extruded parts, with a T shape section, are friction stir welded to the panel by means of two different beads in single lap configuration. Loading conditions have been chosen to simulate two real operative conditions: hoop stress and T-pull. Results allow appreciating the good performances attained by coupons. Some specific features of FSW w. r. t. lap joint, such as “hook defect”, play a significant role in both the failure occurrences observed during the static tests and in the crack initiation phenomenon observed during the cyclic tests. Care should be put in both process parameters setting and tool design in order to minimize the hook defect occurrence...|$|E
50|$|The Firebug is {{constructed}} on a rigid jig with 6 timber stringers and a centerline web. The flat bottom is 600 mm wide and {{is made from}} 9 mm marine plywood. The sides, bilge <b>panels</b> <b>bulkheads</b> and deck are cut from 2.5 panels of 4 mm marine plywood. The minimum weight of the completed hull is 40 kg (sometimes cited as 27 kg).|$|R
40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on <b>bulkhead</b> <b>panels</b> that require inline access for mate and demate operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the connector shell until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the connector shell edge. Then, by squeezing the handles, the end effector jaws grip the connector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the connector shell is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism. A cross-link mechanism was used to complete this task, while ensuring smooth operation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bulkheads</b> made of <b>panels</b> {{were set}} into {{the tops of the}} floors to divide the hull into compartments. These were not watertight, as {{centrally}} placed limber holes run through the floor for the drainage of the bilge. While the presence of bulkheads invites comparisons with Chinese ships, the ones on the Kadakkarapally Boat are different in that Chinese bulkheads are watertight and thus serve a somewhat different function.|$|R
50|$|The M-28-Tahquamenon River Bridge is {{plate girder}} bridge built of nine steel girders encased in {{concrete}}.

40|$|Friction StirWelding {{is a young}} {{solid state}} joining {{technology}} that, invented and patented at TheWelding Institute (TWI) of Cambridge (UK) in 1991, has been showing many potentialities. Due to the interesting features of FSW, lots of research activities {{have been carried out}} all over the world, on different materials (aluminium alloys first of all, but also steel, titanium, magnesium, copper, polymers, etc.) and for different geometries, even if the most investigated one is, without any doubt, the butt joint configuration. Other geometries, such as lap joint, even if potentially very interesting, have been less studied. In the present paper, attention has been focused on joints simulating a geometrical configuration used in aircraft structures to manufacture <b>bulkhead</b> <b>panels.</b> The aim is to exploit the feasibility of substituting rivets with a friction stir weld. An AA 2024 T 351 T shape extruded stringer was overlap friction stir welded to an AA 2056 T 3 clad rolled sheet (see Table 1 for chemical compositions) by means of two parallel beads, as illustrated in Figure 1. The principal welding process parameters adopted are: rotational speed of 400 RPM, welding speed of 100 mm/min and tilt angle of 3 °. It is important to put in evidence that the two beads were one by one welded with the same rotational verse and welding direction. Static and dynamic tests were carried out in two different loading conditions. The first loading condition, named "hoop stress", simulates the pressurization of the cylindrical fuselage with a load applied to the skin, perpendicularly to the stringer; the second loading condition, named "T pull", simulates the pulling action of stringer on the skin. On the basis of the experimental characterization carried out, the following conclusion can be drawn: · FSWappears to be a suitable welding technology to make sound lap joints of extruded parts on rolled sheets. The obtained overlap friction stir welds resulted free of distortions and appreciable defects. · Static mechanical properties in hoop stress loading way are very high compared to the skin parent alloy. The joint mechanical efficiency resulted close to one. · Static mechanical properties in T-pull loading appear very high if compared with those provided by conventional riveted joints. · Fatigue properties are fully governed by the hooking material in the advancing side of beads: this defect plays {{a significant role in the}} crack initiation both upon T-pull and hoop stress loading. Its significant role is present at every fatigue stress level, even if the failure modes can be significantly different. As a consequence, much care should be put in setting the process parameters and in designing the tool geometry in order to minimize the hook defect occurrence. Probably an mportant role, in hook defect occurrence, is played by skin cladding layer too...|$|R

50|$|The {{lower portion}} of the front wall was tiled with deep-green enamel finish ceramic tiles, which also wrapped around the Barker Street corner. The profile of the tiled section was such that the engaged piers of the {{original}} facade were distinguishable. Five double glass doors led into a wide set of stairs up to the foyer. The opening, which was the same proportions {{as that of the}} Astor, was surmounted by a timber <b>panelled</b> <b>bulkhead</b> with downlighting. On each side of the entry doors, three glass display cabinets were set into the tiled walls with posters of current and forthcoming attractions. A cantilevered awning lined alternately with aluminium strips and fluorescent lighting projected over the street. This lighting effect was intended to assist the transition from the dark interior of the foyer to the brightness of the street.|$|R
5000|$|The Rand Building is a {{historic}} commercial building in Huntsville, Alabama. Built in 1883, it and the adjacent building, the Donegan Block, represent a simplified Italianate architecture style common in smaller towns in the late 19th century. It is one of few remaining Italianate buildings which once were prevalent on Courthouse Square. The two-story green-painted brick building has an elaborate bracketed metal cornice with decorative panels between the brackets. The street-level façade has large four-pane fixed windows supported by <b>paneled</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> with a central recessed entry. A second row of smaller windows runs above the first, below a smoothed concrete header panel which along which an awning runs {{the width of the}} building.

50|$|Butlers' Store is a {{group of}} three {{historic}} commercial buildings in New Hope, Alabama. The Butler family began their dry goods and hardware business in the 1850s, and in 1909 built 2 two-story buildings on New Hope's main street. The central building was used for a general merchandise, dry goods, and hardware store and office space. It features a five-bay façade with cast iron columns separating large glass panes atop wood <b>panel</b> <b>bulkheads</b> on the storefront level. Large transom windows over the main windows cast light into the room with 18-foot (5.5-meter) ceilings and a mezzanine in the rear. The northern building was used for a bank until the Great Depression, after which it was connected to the central building and used as a grocery store. It is shorter than the central building, due to a lower ceiling on the ground floor. Both of the older buildings have brick corbelling and slightly arched second-floor windows. The one-story southern building was constructed in 1939 and housed a furniture store. Three bays in width, its ground floor appearance is similar to the northern building, but its roofline is more plain.|$|R
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit <b>bulkhead.</b> Other, smaller <b>panels</b> gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|R

The {{primary goal of}} this test article is to prove that PRSEUS components are capable of carrying combined loads that are representative of a hybrid wing body pressure cabin design regime. This paper summarizes the analytical approach, analysis results, and failure predictions of the test article. A global finite element model of composite panels, metallic fittings, mechanical fasteners, and the Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) test fixture was used to conduct linear structural strength and stability analyses to validate the specimen under the most critical combination of bending and pressure loading conditions found in the hybrid wing body pressure cabin. Local detail analyses were also performed at locations with high stress concentrations, at Tee-cap noodle interfaces with surrounding laminates, and at fastener locations with high bearing/bypass loads. Failure predictions for different composite and metallic failure modes were made, and nonlinear analyses were also performed to study the structural response of the test article under combined bending and pressure loading. This large-scale specimen test will be conducted at the COLTS facility at the NASA Langley Research Center...|$|R
