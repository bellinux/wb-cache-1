This aircraft had an amidships crew position and on 26 June, Lanchester was flown as an observer. The tail oscillations started at 80 mph; Lanchester observed that the tail was twisting by 15° to either side and deduced that the cause was asymmetric movement of the right and left halves of the elevators, which were not rigidly linked but connected by long control cables. He recommended that the halves of the elevators be connected, the elevator balances removed and further bracing added between the lower longerons and the lower tailplane spar, measures which were wholly successful.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionSeveral studies {{reported}} better clinical results with total hip resurfacing than with conventional total hip replacement, including in young patients, but without comparative stabilometry assessment. HypothesisResurfacing arthroplasty provides better functional performance than conventional total hip replacement. ObjectivesTo test the above hypothesis in a stabilometry study comparing balance and functional performance {{in patients with}} total hip resurfacing or conventional total hip replacement and healthy controls. Materials and methodsResults were analyzed on three cohorts of 20 patients: healthy control subjects, with unilateral total hip replacement or unilateral total hip resurfacing. The 40 operated patients were comparable in gender, age, weight (body-mass index), date of operation and clinical results. The 20 control subjects were younger and served as reference. Balance analysis employed a force platform commonly used in stabilometry, standardizing both leg or single leg stance balance analysis. The software interpreted individual balance by measuring plantar pressure center variation during the analysis so as to contour an individual both leg or single leg area of balance (statokinesigram, in mm 2). ResultsBalance analysis on both leg found comparable results in the control and resurfacing groups. The weight-bearing statokinesigraphic both leg <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> was greater in the hip replacement than in either {{of the other two}} groups (p< 0. 05), and five times greater than in the resurfacing group (p< 0. 05).
