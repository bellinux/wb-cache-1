25|$|Experimentally, {{deuterium}} is {{the most}} common nuclide used in nuclear fusion reactor designs, especially in combination with tritium, because of the large reaction rate (or nuclear cross section) and high energy yield of the D–T reaction. There is an even higher-yield D– fusion reaction, though the <b>breakeven</b> point of D– is higher than that of most other fusion reactions; together with the scarcity of , this makes it implausible as a practical power source until at least D–T and D–D fusion reactions have been performed on a commercial scale. However, commercial nuclear fusion is not yet an accomplished technology.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many claims about the {{capabilities}} of helium-3 power plants. According to proponents, fusion power plants operating on deuterium and helium-3 would offer lower capital and operating costs than their competitors due to less technical complexity, higher conversion efficiency, smaller size, the absence of radioactive fuel, no air or water pollution, and only low-level radioactive waste disposal requirements. Recent estimates suggest that about $6 billion in investment capital {{will be required to}} develop and construct the first helium-3 fusion power plant.

40|$|Survival in {{the beef}} cattle {{business}} {{for the next year}} or so will depend on doing little things well, says Don Pretzer, extension farm management specialist at Kansas State. "Doing enough little things right will add up to big differences in profitability. no matter whether you're a cow-calf operator, a backgrounder or a cattle finisher. ” He offers some interesting ideas for cattle ranchers. The economist says cow herd costs are running around $ 375 per cow-calf unit per year. This includes $ 178 for feed, including pasture for 15 % replacements. 15 % interest on the value of the cow ($ 450) and $ 32 a year for 1 abor. "A 92 % calf crop with steer sale weights averaging 475 lbs. and heifers at 425 lbs. indicates the producer needs $ 98 cwt. for his steers and $ 92 cwt. for heifers to cover all of his costs. " the economist notes. Current prices of $ 67 and $ 61. respectively, show a full-cost loss of $ 101 per cow-cal f unit. ” The specialist says survival strategy warrants looking only at cash costs, including rented grass. On a cash cost budget, the <b>breakevens</b> are at $ 70 and $ 64 cwt., resulting in a $ 9 -per-unit loss per year...|$|R
40|$|In October, 1995, 3, 565 head {{of freshly}} weaned, British-breed calves were {{received}} into a weaning facility in southwest Nebraska. Calves {{were determined to}} be preconditioned if they had received both viral an d Pasteurella vaccines prior to weaning (PREWEAN; n = 2, 315), and all other calves were considered to have no preconditioning (CRTL; n = 1, 250). Cattle were processed within 24 hours of arrival, and booster vaccinations were given when appropriate. Average days on feed at the weaning facility were similar between PREWEAN and CTRL calves (52. 4 and 50. 3 days, respectively), but average daily gain (2. 24 vs 1. 87 kb) and cost per lb of gain ($. 64 vs $. 81) were improved (P<. 01) for PREWEAN. Processing ($ 7. 48 vs $ 9. 10 /hd) and medicine costs ($ 1. 39 vs $ 5. 27 /hd) were lower (P<. 01) for PREWEAN calves during the weaning phase. Only 10. 6 % of the PREWEAN calves were treated for sickness, whereas 34. 7 % of the CTRL calves were treated a t least once (P<. 01). Mortality tended to be lower for PREWEAN calves compared to CTRL calves, although it was low for both groups (. 26 % v s. 48 %, respectively). The average total cost per head was similar for PREWEAN and CTRL calves ($ 73. 62 vs $ 72. 79, respectively). Theoretical <b>breakevens</b> reflected lower costs and increased performance in PREWEAN cattle. These results suggest that producers should get a return on their money invested in preconditioning programs that include protection against IBR, BVD, PI 3, BRSV, and Pasteurella...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{a number}} of {{researchers}} pointed out that the experiment was far below ignition, and did not represent a breakthrough as reported. Others noted that the definition of <b>breakeven</b> as recorded in many references, and directly stated by Moses in the past, was when the fusion output was equal to the laser input. In this release, the term was changed to refer to the energy deposited in the fuel, not the energy of the laser.

50|$|Ignition {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>breakeven,</b> a similar concept that compares the total energy being given off to the energy being used to heat the fuel.
