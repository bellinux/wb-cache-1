500|$|Separate {{awards for}} Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance were {{introduced}} in 1990. Beginning that year, Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song [...] "One" [...] from ...And Justice for All, their cover of Queen's [...] "Stone Cold Crazy", and their eponymous album in 1992. When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992, drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously [...] "thanking" [...] Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year, though they actually had released the album Catfish Rising in 1991. A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't tell you I was disappointed.

[...] As of 2010, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category, with a total of six.|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would <b>be</b> <b>lying</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> said that I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E

5000|$|It's kind of my motto for life. It's so {{much easier}} to be mean. It's so easy to just kind of give {{yourself}} that, but it's so hard to walk away from a situation, turn your cheek the other way, and be the bigger person. So, that's what 'Kill Em with Kindness' represents. I think people need to hear that more often. — Gomez, on the theme of magnanimity According to Gomez, one of the main inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos surfaced online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015.

6000|$|There {{is another}} proverb, [...] "As {{you have made}} your bed, so you must lie on it"; which again <b>is</b> simply a <b>lie.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> have made my bed uncomfortable, please God I will make it again. We could restore the Heptarchy or the stage coaches if we chose. It might {{take some time to}} do, and it might be very inadvisable to do it; but {{certainly}} it is not impossible as bringing back last Friday is impossible. This is, as I say, the first freedom that I claim: the freedom to restore. I claim a right to propose as a solution the old patriarchal system of a Highland clan, if that should seem to eliminate the largest number of evils. It certainly would eliminate some evils; for instance, the unnatural sense of obeying cold and harsh strangers, mere bureaucrats and policemen. I claim the right to propose the complete independence of the small Greek or Italian towns, a sovereign city of Brixton or Brompton, if that seems the best way out of our troubles. It would be a way out of some of our troubles; we could not have in a small state, for instance, those enormous illusions about men or measures which are nourished by the great national or international newspapers. You could not persuade a city state that Mr. Beit was an Englishman, or Mr. Dillon a desperado, any more than you could persuade a Hampshire Village that the village drunkard was a teetotaller or the village idiot a statesman. Nevertheless, I do not as a fact propose that the Browns and the Smiths should be collected under separate tartans. Nor do I even propose that Clapham should declare its independence. I merely declare my independence. I merely claim my choice of all the tools in the universe; and I shall not admit that any of them are blunted merely because they have been used.|$|R
