50|$|The coalition's advance {{was much}} swifter than US generals had expected. On 26 February, Iraqi troops began {{retreating}} from Kuwait, {{after they had}} set 737 of its oil wells on fire. A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq-Kuwait highway. Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that {{it came to be}} known as the Highway of Death. Hundreds of Iraqi troops were killed. American, British, and French forces continued to pursue retreating Iraqi forces over the border and back into <b>Iraq,</b> eventually moving <b>to</b> within 150 miles (240 km) of Baghdad, before withdrawing <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Iraq's</b> border with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.|$|R
5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Iraq</b> on 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to the Iraqi Army. While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an Iraqi Army brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of Iraqi aeroplanes. The Iraqi Army lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while the Iraqi historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated in the Iraqi nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed Iraqi soldiers. This further enraged the Iraqi public against the Assyrians.|$|E

500|$|... : Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Air Force. On 21 January 1991, seven Iraqi Su-25s {{were flown}} to Iran {{in an effort}} to find a {{temporary}} safe haven from Operation Desert Storm attacks on major Iraqi airfields. These aircraft were considered by Iran to be a gift from its former adversary, and were seized by the Iranian military. However, {{as a result of a}} lack of spare parts, documentation, and pilot training, these aircraft were not flown by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force. Iran has added at least six new examples to its inventory and has since likely restored ex-Iraqi Su-25s to flight status as well.

And we came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Iraq</b> War, because he had begun to think that the two twin themes of the UN, security and development, really were a single theme. … We were sitting in his office and ElBaradei said … “What the Iraq War should have taught us is that security and development are inextricably intertwined.” Where you have poverty and abrogation of human rights, you also often have inept governance, you have a circumstance in which people, as they see the inequity, and are not allowed to express their views, the result is a natural situation for fomenting not only humiliation and injustice but anger, and a sense of wanting to redress wrongs. So from that you have violence of multiple sorts: you have civil strife; you have a breeding ground for extremism; and ultimately, if the seeds are sown deeply enough, that is where we are seeing the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.|$|R
