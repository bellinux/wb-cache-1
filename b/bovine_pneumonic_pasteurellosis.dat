40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica {{serotype}} 1 is the bacterial agent {{responsible for}} the pathophysiological events associated with <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Our previous studies support a role for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from P. haemolytica in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. One of the pathological hallmarks of <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> is an influx of neutrophils into the alveolar spaces. This pronounced influx suggests the local production of a chemotactic factor(s) such as interleukin- 8 (IL- 8). In {{the context of the}} lung, the alveolar macrophage appears to be the major producer of IL- 8, a proinflammatory cytokine with potent neutrophil chemotactic activity. By using Northern blot analysis, we have examined the kinetics of IL- 8 mRNA expression in P. haemolytica LPS-stimulated bovine alveolar macrophages and found that 1 ng of LPS per ml induces maximal expression of IL- 8 mRNA. The results also indicate a biphasic time course expression pattern in which IL- 8 mRNA levels peak between 1 and 2 h in the first phase and between 16 and 24 h in the second phase (P < 0. 01). In addition, monospecific polyclonal antibodies were used to demonstrate the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the second phase of IL- 8 mRNA expression. Our findings support a role for P. haemolytica LPS and TNF-α in the induction of IL- 8 from bovine alveolar macrophages...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of Pasteurella haemolytica culture supernatant for bovine and porcine cells was evaluated by 51 Cr release. Sterile bacterial culture supernatant was toxic for bovine pulmonary lavage cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes and neutrophils, and cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells, resulting in marked 51 Cr release. Only slight release was induced from cultured Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, porcine pulmonary lavage cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, or neutrophils. No release was detected with primary bovine spleen cell cultures, bovine erythrocytes, or porcine erythrocytes.

40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica A 1 leukotoxic culture {{supernatant}} {{was evaluated}} {{for its ability}} to induce histamine release from bovine pulmonary mast cells isolated by enzymatic dispersion of lung tissue. Histamine was measured by a radioimmunoassay technique. Leukotoxic culture supernatant of P. haemolytica significantly released histamine in a time and concentration-related manner. This effect was lost when culture supernatant was heat-inactivated or preincubated with leukotoxin neutralizing rabbit serum. Preincubation of the mast cells with propranolol or p-bromophenacyl bromide reduced the histamine-releasing effect of leukotoxin, while verapamil enhanced release. Experimental infection of calves with P. haemolytica A 1 reduced the total histamine content of pulmonary mast cells recovered at postmortem. Histamine release induced by P. haemolytica leukotoxin is likely an important factor in the pathogenesis of <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Iron plays {{a central}} role in {{bacterial}} infections, influencing both bacterial virulence and host cellular defense mechanisms. We investigated whether iron chelation might be of benefit in the treatment of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of calves. Neutrophils obtained from calves previously treated with the iron chelator, deferoxamine, were studied for their responses to latex and opsonized zymosan by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan by superoxide generation. Treatment with deferoxamine in vivo failed to influence these in vitro measures of neutrophil oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, iron depletion with deferoxamine failed to modify the pathophysiological derangements that occurred in calves following experimental induction of pneumonia by intratracheal inoculation with Pasteurella haemolytica. These data indicate that iron chelation using deferoxamine cannot be recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of cattle...|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the capsular polysaccharide (CP) of Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1. Purified CP was first covalently coupled to poly-L-lysine and then optimally adsorbed at a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml to microtiter plates in the presence of carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9. 8). The ELISA was used to evaluate and compare the CP-specific IgG response of calves vaccinated with different P. haemolytica-derived experimental vaccines. Elevated levels of ELISA IgG titers were detected in postvaccination sera and lung lavage from calves vaccinated intradermally with live logarithmic-phase organisms or the culture supernatants.

The treatments were evaluated by comparing clinical illness scores, total sick days, weight changes, mortality rates, and postmortem lung scores between treatment groups. Both antibiotics were highly effective in reducing respiratory disease in the experimentally infected calves. The clinical response to sulbactam/ampicillin treatment was comparable with that of chloramphenicol and was significantly improved compared with {{the response to the}} placebo treatment.

Furthermore, partial hydrolysis of bovine IgG 2 was observed, but neither bovine IgA nor IgM were affected by incubation with ppCS.

40|$|Immunity against <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> was {{studied in}} calves after {{recovery}} from experimental respiratory disease with Pasteurella haemolytica.

After recovery from the disease, these nine principal and four control calves were challenged with aerosols of bovine herpesvirus 1 and P. haemolytica A 1 four days apart. With this viral-bacterial challenge, the nine principal animals failed to develop clinical responses to this bacterial challenge and their lungs did not show the growth of P. haemolytica on cultures, whereas two of four control calves had elevated temperatures and developed necropurulent pneumonia with the isolation of P. haemolytica from the lungs. The principal calves had developed high levels of cytotoxin neutralizing antibodies in their sera following parainfluenza- 3 virus-P. haemolytica infection.

40|$|Pasteurella haemolytica, {{the cause}} of fibrinous {{pleuropneumonia}} in cattle, produces extensive microvascular endothelial cell damage. This study investigated endothelial cell-leukocyte inter-actions by using a Millicell coculture assay system that modeled the bovine pulmonary alveolar defense system and showed that P. haemolytica-mediated endothelial cell damage was enhanced {{by the presence of}} alveolar macrophages, presumably due to soluble alveolar macrophage prod-ucts. The alveolar macrophage-enhanced endothelial cell damage occurred regardless of the presence of anti-P, haemolytica immune serum; however, neutrophils and immune serum effec-tively prevented endothelial cell damage.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{retrospective}} morphological and microbiological study, 39 of 55 cases of bovine fibrinous pneumonia were diagnosed as fibrinous pleuropneumonia.

In contrast, of the 16 cases classified as fibrinous bronchopneumonia. one (6 %) was associated with P. hemolytica, and nine (5 6 %) with P. multocida. In eight cases Mycoplasrna and Hernophilus sornnus wcrc found in association with either P. hernolytica or P. multocida but were never isolated alone.

40|$|The role of {{neutrophils}} in {{the development}} of peracute lung lesions of <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> was investigated. Eight calves were divided into two groups of four calves each. Group I was treated with intravenous phosphate-buffered saline and served as the neutrophil sufficient calves. Group II was treated with intravenous hydroxyurea which produced a state of neutropenia. When peripheral blood neutrophil numbers dropped below 300 cells/microL in group II, all calves were challenged with an intrabronchial bolus of Pasteurella haemolytica in the log phase of growth. An acute inflammatory process occurred in both groups of calves indicated by a rise in body temperature. While pulmonary lesions occurred in both groups by six hours postinoculation, they varied in pathological characteristics. Pulmonary lesions in the neutrophil sufficient calves consisted of fibrinopurulent alveolitis-bronchiolitis with associated alveolar septal necrosis, interlobular edema, and intravascular thrombi. The neutrophil deficient calves had extensive intra-alveolar edema, interlobular edema, intraalveolar hemorrhage, atelectasis, and focal areas of alveolar septal necrosis.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Pasteurella haemolytica leukotoxin (LKT) on the {{activity}} of phospholipase D (PLD) and the regulatory interaction between PLD and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) were investigated in assays using isolated bovine neutrophils labeled with tritiated phospholipid substrates of the two enzymes. Exposure of [3 H]lyso-phosphatidylcholine-labeled neutrophils to LKT caused concentration- and time-dependent production of phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of PLD. LKT-induced generation of PA was dependent on extracellular calcium. Both production of PA and metabolism of [3 H]-arachidonate ([3 H]AA) -labeled phospholipids by PLA 2 were inhibited when ethanol was used to promote the alternative PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation reaction, resulting {{in the production of}} phosphatidylethanol rather than PA. The role of PA in regulation of PLA 2 activity was then confirmed by means of an add-back experiment, whereby addition of PA in the presence of ethanol restored PLA 2 -mediated release of radioactivity from neutrophil membranes. Considering the involvement of chemotactic phospholipase products in the pathogenesis of pneumonic pasteurellosis, devel-opment and use of anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit LKT-induced activation of PLD and PLA 2 may improve therapeutic management of the disease.

The surgical site was closed with tissue adhesive and staples and the animals were monitored for signs of respiratory tract infection. Within 24 hours after inoculation they became depressed, anorectic, pyretic and dyspneic. Fibrinous pleuropneumonia with prominent areas of necrosis and hemorrhage was present. Pericardial effusion was a frequent finding. There was infiltration of the pleura and alveoli with degenerate heterophils and macrophages, a hyperplastic mesothelium and fibrin exudation on the pleura and within alveoli. Hemorrhage, congestion, consolidation, edema and fibrin exudation were prominent in the hilar region of the lungs. Bacterial colonies were evident in all airways.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{diagnostic}} accuracy of acute phase proteins and proinflammatory cytokines in sheep with <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Blood samples were collected from 56 sheep (36 naturally infected with Pasteurella multocida and 20 healthy controls) belonging to one farm in Eastern region, Saudi Arabia. Serum samples were evaluated for acute phase proteins (Haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen (Fb)), and the proinflammatory cytokines (interleukins (IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-ϒ)). Additionally, nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavages were collected from all animals for bacteriological examinations. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic performance of each parameter. All parameters showed moderate to high degree of positive correlation with case-control status. There was no significant difference in the area under the curve (AUC) among acute phase proteins; however, both Hp and SAA showed better sensitivity and specificity than Fb. The proinflammatory cytokines (IL 1 -α, IL 1 -β, and IL 6) showed similar and highly accurate diagnostic performance (AUC > 0. 9), whereas IFN-ϒ was moderately accurate (AUC = 0. 79).

40|$|P. haemolytica is the {{aetiological}} {{agent of}} <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in sheep and goats, and, as a secondry invader it also exacerbates lesions of chronic non-progressive pneumonia (CNP). These diseases cause considerable economic {{loss to the}} New Zealand farming industry. P. haemolytica exists as 15 serotypes and immunity is serotype specific. Vaccines against P. haemolytica are produced, {{but it is not}} known if the serotypes contained in the vaccine are the same as those causing disease in New Zealand as {{there is a lack of}} information on the prevalence and distribution of the serotypes of P. haemolytica in this country. This is largely due to the technical difficulties involved in typing isolates because the standard method, the indirect haemagglutination assay, (IHA), is laborious and may give anomalous results due to cross-reactions. The present investigation was undertaken with two major aims: to replace IHA with a more convenient typing system, viz. agar gel immunodiffusion, (AGID), and to use AGID to survey the serotypes of P. haemolytica present in CNP lesions of sheep, <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of sheep, <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of goats and the nasal cavities of goats. Difficulties were encountered in the preparation of rabbit antisera to some of the 15 prototype strains. These difficulties were overcome by using domestic hens when necessary. Using these sera it was possible to distinguish the 15 prototype strains by IHA, and following absorption of sera, by AGID. The results obtained by IHA and AGID were in agreement, at least when prototype strains were examined. It was necasary to show that AGID is able to correctly establish the serotype of field isolates of P. haemolytica. Hence 2 5 caprine isolates of P. haemolytica from field cases of <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> were serotyped by both IHA and AGID. In 24 cases the results from the two tests agreed. In the remaining case IHA indicated that the isolate was serotype A 2 or All. We were able to show that this isolate gave a line of identity with antigen prepared from the prototype strain of All, but showed no line of identity in the AGID with any other antigen preparation. Taking this as the critical criterion we concluded that this isolate was serotype All, although IHA showed a 2 - fold preference for A 2 over All. Since AGID was shown to be a reliable test we used it alone for future serotyping, for two reasons: it is more convenient, and any cross-reactions that do occur may be resolved by looking for a line of identity between antigens of the isolate and a prototype antigen. In the case of two serotypes involved in many crossreactions, namely Al and A 7, the capsular polysaccharide was purified by organic solvent precipitation. This purified polysaccharide was used to test for a line of identity with reacting isolates. This eliminates the possibility that the line of identity seen was due to a non-serotypespecific antigen. Four surveys (two in sheep, two in goats) of the serotypes of P. haemolytica present in New Zealand were undertaken. The first involved 139 isolates derived from ovine lesions of CNP collected from 4 areas of New Zealand. A total of 9 serotypes were found. Serotypes Al (31. 7 %), A 2 (47. 8 %) and A 7 (10 %) made up 89. 5 % of the total. A smaller survey of 18 isolates from <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> of sheep revealed 6 serotypes, including 1 isolate of TlO, a serotype and biotype not previously found in New Zealand. Al (11. 1 %) and A 2 (61. 1 %) were the predominant serotypes present and represented 72. 2 % of the total. The 25 isolates of P. haemolytica from caprine <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> contained only 4 serotypes. A 2 represented 8 0 % of the total. 14 isolates of P. haemolytica were obtained from the nasal cavities of 109 goats. Only 2 serotypes were isolated. 13 isolates were A 2 and the remaining isolate was All. The implications of these results for vaccine manafucture were discussed and it was suggested that a vaccine containing A 2, Al and A 7 (in order of importance) should control CNP in sheep and <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in both sheep and goats. Field isolates of P. haemolytica were compared with prototype strains for capsule production (using Laurell Rocket test), and antibiotic sensitivities. The total proteins of caprine and ovine strains were also compared, using SDS-PAGE. Laurell Rocket tests showed that the prototype strains produced more capsular polysaccharide than did any of our field isolates. All isolates of P. haemolytica showed some resistance to streptomycin while none were resistant to more than 4 f. 1 g/ml chloramphenicol or penicillin so these are the drugs of choice.

The expression of IL- 8 in <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> was assessed by Northern analysis, 'in situ' hybridization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of IL- 8 mRNA was elevated dramatically in lesional lung compared to non-lesional lung, viral pneumonia, and normal lung. 'In situ' hybridization revealed intense IL- 8 mRNA expression in alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, and milder expression in several other cell types. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from lesional lung contained 16. 06 ± 4. 00 ng/ml IL- 8, but lower levels were present in non-lesional lung, viral pneumonia, and normal lung (mean ± SEM). Recombinant bovine IL- 8 (rbIL- 8) was produced using a pGEX expression system. The rbIL- 8 induced in vitro chemotaxis and shape change of bovine neutrophils at doses as low as 6. 3 ng/ml. After injection of 1. 0 ng to 3. 3 m g of rbIL- 8 into bovine skin, neutrophils marginated in vessels within 15 minutes and infiltrated the dermis by 1 hour after injection. These results demonstrate that bovine IL- 8 is a neutrophil chemoattractant 'in vitro ' and 'in vivo', at levels equivalent to those present in pneumonic pasteurellosis. An ovine model of pneumonic pasteurellosis was developed to ascertain the effects of in vivo neutralization of IL- 8 {{on the development of}} disease. At 0, 3, 8 and 20 hours after bacterial infection (p. i.), BAL fluid samples contained 6. 5 ± 2. 4, 110 ± 48, 554 ± 118, and 507 ± 70 ng/ml IL- 8, respectively. Neutrophil infiltration was mild at 3 hours p. i. but progressively more intense at 8 and 20 hours p. i. Lambs were treated intravenously with up to 80 mg of an IL- 8 -neutralizing antibody prior to bacterial challenge. The antibody treatment failed to completely neutralize IL- 8 activity, probably because the levels of IL- 8 in the lung were unexpectedly high. The contribution of IL- 8 to the neutrophil chemotactic activity of BAL fluid from cattle and lambs with pneumonic pasteurellosis was assessed. Pre-treatment of pneumonic BAL fluid samples with a neutralizing antibody to IL- 8, compared to pretreatment with a control antibody, reduced the 'in vitro' neutrophil chemotactic activity significantly, by 15 - 63 % in 9 / 10 samples. An extract of pneumonic bovine lung induced vigorous neutrophil infiltration following injection into bovine skin, and depletion of IL- 8 from the extract reduced this neutrophil influx by 60 %. These data indicate that IL- 8 is an important neutrophil chemoattractant in both early and well-developed lesions of pneumonic pasteurellosis, but that mediators with actions redundant to those of IL- 8 must also be present at these times...|$|E

Neutrophil chemotactic activity was measured in pneumonic BAL fluid samples treated with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to ovine IL- 8, and compared to the activity in samples treated with an isotype-matched control antibody. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed at a dilution which induced a half-maximal response, and the concentrations of antibody were optimized in a preliminary experiment. Following incubation of replicate samples of diluted pneumonic bovine BAL fluid with 70 microg/mL of IL- 8 -neutralizing antibody or control antibody, the neutrophil chemotactic activities of the samples were determined using an in vitro microchemotaxis assay. Overall, pretreatment of BAL fluid samples with neutralizing anti-IL- 8 antibody reduced neutrophil chemotactic activity by 15 % to 60 %, compared to pretreatment with control antibody. This effect was highly significant (P < 0. 001), and was present in 5 of 5 samples. These data indicate that IL- 8 is an important neutrophil chemoattractant in calves with pneumonic pasteurellosis, but that mediators with actions redundant to those of IL- 8 must also be present in the lesions...|$|E
40|$|Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A 1 {{produces}} several virulence {{factors that}} {{play an important}} role in the pathogenesis of <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> Foremost among these is a leukotoxin (LKT) that specifically kills ruminant leukocytes. Recent evidence suggests that M. haemolytica LKT binding to bovine leukocytes is mediated by the β 2 -integrin CD 11 a/CD 18 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 [LFA- 1]), which subsequently induces activation and cytolysis of these cells. Inflammatory cytokines, which are released during viral and bacterial infection, are reported to increase LFA- 1 expression and conformational activation. We investigated the effects of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) on the interaction of M. haemolytica LKT with bovine peripheral blood neutrophils (PMNs). In this study we demonstrated, by flow cytometry, that bovine PMNs increased their binding to an anti-bovine LFA- 1 monoclonal antibody (BAT 75 A) following in vitro incubation with IL- 1 β, TNF-α, or IFN-γ. Incubation with cytokines also increased CD 18 expression, as assessed by real-time PCR and by Western blotting. Increased LFA- 1 expression by PMNs exposed to cytokines was associated with increased LKT binding and cytotoxicity. The latter represented, at least in part, enhanced PMN apoptosis, as assessed by propidium iodine staining and caspase- 3 activation. The results of this study suggest that inflammatory cytokines may {{play an important role}} in enhancing the biological response of bovine PMNs to M. haemolytica LKT...|$|E
40|$|Vaccine {{development}} {{for the prevention of}} <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> remains a critical issue for the feedlot industry. Most currently available Pasteurella vaccines are formulated to stimulate immunity by either providing an adequate antigenic mass in the administered dose, or by relying on subsequent production of antigens by in vivo growth of live organisms. The ability of these different types of vaccines to stimulate rapid and high titres to key antigens is a key factor that will influence subsequent resistance to disease. The serologic and protective responses to a streptomycin-dependent, modified-live vaccine and a killed (bacterin-toxoid) vaccine against experimental <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> were compared. Calves were vaccinated with a single injection of either a test vaccine or phosphate-buffered saline, challenged 14 d later by transthoracic injection with Pasteurella haemolytica, and euthanized 3 d post-challenge to evaluate the severity of pneumonia. On days 0, 7, and 14, serologic responses to various P. haemolytica antigens, including cell-associated and soluble antigens, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and anti-leukotoxin antibody levels were determined by leukotoxin neutralization. The bacterin-toxoid elicited significantly greater serologic responses compared to controls for all antigens. The modified-live vaccine elicited a significantly greater response compared to controls for a whole-cell antigen preparation. Lesion scores were significantly smaller (greater protection) in calves that received the bacterin-toxoid, but not the modified-live vaccine, compared to controls...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economically infectious diseases of ruminants with a wide prevalence throughout the continents. The disease is characterized by an acute febrile course with severe fibrinous or fibrino-purulent bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleurisy, and septicaemia (Mohammed and Abdelsalam, 2008). M. haemolytica, P. trehalosi, and P. multocida are common commensal organisms of the tonsils and nasopharynx of healthy sheep and goats. They are non-motile gram-negative rods that cause cranioventral bronchopneumonia affecting sheep and goats of all ages worldwide (Cynthia and Scott, 2012).

40|$|Mannheimia haemolytica {{serotype}} S 1 {{is considered}} the predominant cause of <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis,</b> or shipping fever. Various virulence factors allow M haemolytica to colonize the lungs and establish infection. These virulence factors include leukotoxin (LKT), lipopolysaccharide, adhesins, capsule, outer membrane proteins, and various proteases. The effects of LKT are species specific for ruminants, which stem from its unique interaction with the bovine b 2 integrin receptor present on leukocytes. At low concentration, LKT can activate bovine leukocytes to undergo respiratory burst and degranulation and stimulate cytokine release from macrophages and histamine release from mast cells. At higher concentration, LKT induces formation of transmembrane pores and subsequent oncotic cell necrosis. The interaction of LKT with leukocytes is followed by activation of these leukocytes to undergo oxidative burst and release proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins 1, 6, and 8 and tumor necrosis factor a. Tumor necrosis factor a and other proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes in the lung. Formation of transmembrane pores and subsequent cytolysis of activated leukocytes possibly cause leakage of products of respiratory burst and other inflammatory mediators into the surrounding pulmonary parenchyma and so give rise to fibrinous and necrotizing lobar pneumonia. The effects of LKT are enhanced by lipopolysaccharide, which {{is associated with the}} release of proinflammatory cytokines from the leukocytes, activation of complement and coagulation cascade, and cell cytolysis. Similarly, adhesins, capsule, outer membrane proteins, and proteases assist in pulmonary colonization, evasion of immune response, and establishment of the infection. This review focuses on the roles of these virulence factors in the pathogenesis of shipping fever...|$|E
40|$|Bovine tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) cDNAs {{were generated}} by reverse transcription {{and then by}} PCR amplification from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated alveolar macrophage RNA. The amplified cDNAs were cloned into pPow and expressed in Escherichia coli DH 5 alpha. The expressed proteins were confirmed as TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis and bioassays. We then used the cloned genes as probes in Northern (RNA) blots and investigated the kinetics of TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta mRNA expression in bovine alveolar macrophages stimulated with purified LPS from Pasteurella haemolytica 12296. The effect of LPS on TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta gene expression was dose dependent, and induction was observed at a concentration of 0. 01 microgram/ml. Both TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta mRNA expression were detectable within 0. 5 h after stimulation with 1 microgram of LPS per ml, peaked at 1 to 2 h, steadily declined up to 16 h, and were undetectable by 24 h. Secreted TNF-alpha measured by bioassay peaked at 4 h and accumulated at a lesser concentration in conditioned medium throughout the 24 h. By contrast, secreted IL- 1 beta was induced at 8 h and reached a maximal concentration at 24 h after stimulation. The ability of LPS to induce TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta gene expression and secretion of bioactive proteins were suppressed by polymyxin B. Our findings support a role for LPS from P. haemolytica in the induction of inflammatory cytokines in <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Development of {{vaccines}} against bovine pneumonia pasteurellosis, or shipping fever, {{has focused}} mainly on Mannheimia haemolytica A 1 leukotoxin (Lkt). In this study, {{the feasibility of}} expressing Lkt in a forage plant for use as an edible vaccine was investigated. Derivatives of the M. haemolytica Lkt in which the hydrophobic transmembrane domains were removed were made. Lkt 66 retained its immunogenicity and was capable of eliciting an antibody response in rabbits that recognized and neutralized authentic Lkt. Genes encoding a shorter Lkt derivative, Lkt 50, fused to a modified green fluorescent protein (mGFP 5), were constructed for plant transformation. Constructs were screened by Western immunoblot analysis {{for their ability to}} express the fusion protein after agroinfiltration in tobacco. The fusion construct pBlkt 50 -mgfp 5, which employs the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter for transcription, was selected and introduced into white clover by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Transgenic lines of white clover were recovered, and expression of Lkt 50 -GFP was monitored and confirmed by laser confocal microscopy and Western immunoblot analysis. Lkt 50 -GFP was found to be stable in clover tissue after drying of the plant material at room temperature for 4 days. An extract containing Lkt 50 -GFP from white clover was able to induce an immune response in rabbits (via injection), and rabbit antisera recognized and neutralized authentic Lkt. This is the first demonstration of the expression of an M. haemolytica antigen in plants and paves the way for the development of transgenic plants expressing M. haemolytica antigens as an edible vaccine against <b>bovine</b> <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{clinical}} {{case reports}} {{the occurrence of}} stage I pinkeye with concurrent <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> in a goat. Materials and methods: A 2 -year-old Jamnapari goat weighing 25 Kg {{was presented to the}} Universiti Veterinary Hospital, Universiti Putra Malaysia with primary complain of eye problem and inappetence. Results: Upon clinical examination, the most prominent abnormality observed was corneal opacity of the right eye with presence of ulceration on the corneal surface and chemosis of the right conjunctiva with excessive lacrimation. On auscultation, there was the presence of crackle lung sounds with bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharges. Samples from the ocular swab yielded a positive growth for Mycoplasma spp., while the nasal swab yielded a positive growth for Mannheimia haemolytica. The goat was diagnosed with stage I pinkeye with concurrent <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis</b> infection. Treatment was instituted with 400 mL of 0. 9 % NaCl administered intravenously once for rehydration. Flunixin meglumine 2. 2 mg/kg bwt was given intramuscularly twice daily for three days as anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Oxytetracycline 20 mg/kg bwt was injected once intramuscularly as long acting broad spectrum antibiotic for treatment of pinkeye and pasteurellosis infections.

The experiment was designed on two phases as follows: In phase one, the experimental animals were divided into four groups, The first group of goats were infected with relatively high dose of P. haemolytica intratracheally, the second group received subtoxic dose of carbon tetrachloride, while the animals of group three were subjected to mixed treatment with carbon tetrachloride followed by intratracheal infection with P. haemolytica. The last group was uninfected control. In phase two, the experimental animals were also divided into four groups, one group of goats were infected with relatively high dose of P. haemolytica intratracheally, the second group received subclinical dose of different sporulated oocysts of Eimeria spp., while the animals of group three were infected with Eimeria spp. followed by intratracheal infection with P. haemolytica. The last group was uninfected control. 43 The results obtained {{in the present study}} confirmed the possibility of inducing the disease experimentally in healthy goats {{even in the absence of}} predisposing factors or stressing experience. On the other hand, it was evident that mild carbon tetrachloride toxicity and subclinical hepatic coccidiosis predispose experimental goats to <b>pneumonic</b> <b>pasteurellosis.</b> The clinical signs and pathological lesions of different animals were variable from mild to severe according to experimental protocol. The post mortem findings observed in the lungs of different experimental animals in this study were mainly in apical and cardiac lobes. The histopathological findings were typically of fibrinous bronchopneumonia. The haematological changes in the present study were mainly observed in animals infected with P. haemolytica after being inoculated either by carbon tetrachloride or by Eimeria spp. These changes were dominated by increase in total WBCS count and slight changes in haemoglobin and packed cell volume. The plasma biochemical parameters were mainly dominated by significant increase in albumin, little changes in total protein, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin. No change was observed in alkaline phosphatase in both experiments.
