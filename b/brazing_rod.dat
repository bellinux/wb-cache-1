50|$|In the 20th century, silicon was {{introduced}} {{as the primary}} alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary statuary. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze <b>brazing</b> <b>rod,</b> which allows colour-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal aluminium bronze.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Brazing copper or copper-steel {{structures}} imposes measurements regarding {{deposits and}} base materials, {{as well as}} gas content, hydrogen and oxygen that come from the deoxidizing coat. The deoxidizing coat {{is made out of}} complex salts, hydroxides and acids with high hygroscopicity. Research effected in order to improve the deoxidizer capacity of the coat and to reduce its hygroscopicity, taking into account the ratio at coating of the rods, has highlighted the possibility of equipping the material with powders that have chemical active proprieties for deoxidizing processes at brazing. We developed a precursor, type 48 %Cu– 47 %Sn– 4 %P– 1 %Si, powder, grain size 0. 05 mm. The product was used, with a participation of 8 % of the total coating mass, at manufacturing, by extruding the new copper <b>brazing</b> <b>rods</b> or the copper-steel semi-products. We defined and produced deep joints, type copper-copper and low alloyed steel-copper. Brazing process tests, detected by melted metal deposition test, the wetting angle and respectively the mechanical characteristics of tested joints has improved. Results have confirmed the above mentioned hypothesis; it highlighted superior values to those obtained with classic rods...|$|R
5000|$|Seymour Lipton (6 November 1903 [...] - [...] 15 December 1986) was an American {{abstract}} expressionist sculptor. He was {{a member}} of the New York School who gained widespread recognition in the 1950s. He initially trained as a dentist but focused on sculpture from 1932. His early choices of medium changed from wood to lead and then to bronze, and he is best known for his work in metal. He made several technical innovations, including <b>brazing</b> nickel-silver <b>rods</b> onto sheets of Monel to create rust resistant forms.|$|R
50|$|Unless brazing {{operations}} are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax {{is required to}} prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be applied {{in any number of}} forms including flux paste, liquid, powder or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal powder. Flux can also be applied using <b>brazing</b> <b>rods</b> with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper.Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active fluxes than short brazing operations.|$|R
5000|$|Braze alloy is {{generally}} available as rod, ribbon, powder, paste, cream, wire and preforms (such as stamped washers). Depending on the application, the filler material can be pre-placed at the desired location or applied during the heating cycle. For manual <b>brazing,</b> wire and <b>rod</b> forms are generally used {{as they are}} the easiest to apply while heating. In the case of furnace brazing, alloy is usually placed beforehand since the process is usually highly automated. Some of the more common types of filler metals used are ...|$|R
5000|$|The AUG has a {{rotating}} bolt that features 7 radial locking lugs and is unlocked {{by means of}} a pin on the bolt body and a recessed camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt carrier itself is guided by two guide <b>rods</b> <b>brazed</b> to it and these rods run inside steel bearings in the receiver. The guide rods are hollow and contain the return springs. The bolt also contains a claw extractor that forms the eighth locking lug and a spring-loaded [...] "bump"-type casing ejector.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not a}} {{pleasant}} sight that opened on the uninstructed view, for {{the lower end of}} the valley appeared to be filled by an army in position - real and actual regiments attired in red coats, and - of this there was no doubt - firing Martini-Henry bullets which cut up the ground a hundred yards in front of the leading company. Over that pock-marked ground the Regiment had to pass, and it opened the ball with a general and profound courtesy to the piping pickets; ducking in perfect time, as though it had been <b>brazed</b> on a <b>rod.</b> Being half capable of thinking for itself, it fired a volley by the simple process of pitching its rifle into its shoulder and pulling the trigger. The bullets may have accounted for some of the watchers on the hill side, but they certainly did not affect the mass of enemy in front, while the noise of the rifles drowned any orders that might have been given.|$|R
