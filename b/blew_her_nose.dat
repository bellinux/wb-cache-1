40|$|Orbital floor {{fractures}} {{are generally}} {{the result of}} blowout orbital and {{may be associated with}} orbital emphysema leading to proptosis and even to loss of vision. A 49 -year-old woman frac-tured the orbital floor in a fall. After <b>blowing</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> she developed exophthalmos and severe reduction in vision. She consulted our department and underwent emergency surgical management with orbital drainage. Decompression led to immediate resolution of the exoph-thalmos and postoperative improvement in visual acuity. Urgent decompression is indicated by the presence of proptosis, elevated intraocular pressure, and progressive loss of vision in cases of orbital trauma with additional emphysema. Surgical treatment of tension emphysema includes lateral canthotomy or cantholysis, needle aspiration, transconjunctival, or lateral blepharoplasty approach, and bone decompression depending on the severity of the case. Sneezing or blowing the nose can lead to proptosis and decreased visual acuity secondary to trauma to the orbit. Under such circumstances, emergency decompression is essential...|$|R

But Miss Gisborne only <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> with perfect composure, and rose to take her leave. Lydia, who, apart from her interest in Cashel's mother, was attracted and amused by the woman herself, induced her to stay for luncheon, and presently discovered from her conversation that she had read much romance of the Werther sort in her youth, and had, since then, employed her leisure in reading every book that came in her way without regard to its quality. Her acquirements were so odd, and her character so unreasonable, that Lydia, whose knowledge was unusually well organized, and who was eminently reasonable, concluded that she was a woman of genius. For Lydia knew the vanity of her own attainments, and believed herself to be merely a patient and well-taught plodder. Mrs. Byron happening to be pleased with the house, the luncheon, and Lydia's intelligent listening, her unaccountable natural charm became so intensified by her good-humor that Lydia became conscious of it, and began to wonder what its force might have been if some influence--that of a lover, for instance--had ever made Mrs. Byron ecstatically happy. She surprised herself at last in the act of speculating whether she could ever make Cashel love her as his father must, for a time at least, have loved her visitor.|$|E

5000|$|The womens next {{challenge}} was to give their clothes away to a local charity thrift store. The girls divided into teams of two: Becky and Saaphyri, Shay and Larissa, Brooke and Leilene, and Schatar and Darra. The team who showed the most generosity and donated the largest amount of money would be safe from expulsion. The teams went in one-by-one to have their items checked over and priced accordingly by two employees. When her clothes were given low sale prices, Saaphyri became visibly upset and cried {{in the back of}} the store and <b>blew</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> on clothes saying it made her feel worthless and devalued. She eventually composed herself and joined Becky to sell off the rest of their items. When the winners were announced, MoNique told Shay and Larissa they had the largest amount of money. However, because Leilene gave away her deceased mothers ring, she and Brooke ended up with the largest amount donated. Brooke and Leilene won the competition and a shopping spree at Forever 21. Another team would get to join them so they chose Schatar and Darra. While the girls were gone, Shay and Larissa placed Leilenes school picture along with her mother and childrens pictures under Schatars mattress in an attempt to frame Schatar. The girls returned home and discovered the pictures were missing. Larissa impatiently hinted at Leilene to look in her sheets. Leilene looked under Schatars mattress and found the pictures. She then confronted Schatar who became upset, saying that she thought Leilene did it to frame her. They both spoke with MoNique who did not know the whole story but took the information into consideration. After the conversation with MoNique, Schatar states that she hopes whoever set her up will [...] "get the boot tonight" [...] at elimination.

MoNique spoke with Schatar about the picture incident, and asked all the girls if they took it. MoNique called Leilene over and commended her generosity for giving away her mothers ring. MoNique then returned the ring to Leilene and said she would try to get Saaphyris UGG boots back, too.

Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal.

40|$|Intranasal {{pressures}} {{were measured}} in adults during nose blowing, sneezing, and coughing and {{were used for}} ¯uid dynamic modeling. Sinus CT scans were performed after instillation of radiopaque contrast medium into the nasopharynx followed by nose blowing, sneezing, and coughing. The mean (5 SD) maximal intranasal pressure was 66 (514) mm Hg during 35 nose blows, 4. 6 (53. 8) mm Hg during 13 sneezes, and 6. 6 (53. 8) mm Hg during 18 coughing bouts. A single nose blow can propel up to 1 mL of viscous ¯uid in the middle meatus into the maxillary sinus. Sneezing and coughing do not generate suf®cient pressure to propel viscous ¯uid into the sinus. Contrast medium from the nasopharynx appeared in> 1 sinuses in 4 of 4 subjects after a nose blow but not after sneezing or coughing. Adults with early common colds have erratically distributed viscous ¯uid in the paranasal sinuses, which impairs sinus drain-age and ventilation and may contribute to infectious sinusitis [1 ± 5]. The source of this ¯uid is unknown. This study was conceived after observing bubbles in the maxillary sinuses of adults with common colds [1, 3] and seeing a recent patient with a pronounced example of this ®nding (®gure 1).

She was not amusing or clever, her mind was common; she had a vulgar shrewdness which revolted him, she had no gentleness nor softness. As she would have put it herself, she was on the make.
