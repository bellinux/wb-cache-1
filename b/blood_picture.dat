50|$|Blood {{tests are}} also used in diagnosis. Primary myelofibrosis can begin with a <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> similar to that found in polycythemia vera or chronic myelogenous leukemia.

When viewed through a microscope, a blood smear will appear markedly abnormal, with presentation of pancytopenia, which is {{a reduction in the}} number of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells may show abnormalities including bizarre shapes, such as teardrop-shaped cells, and nucleated red blood cell precursors may appear in the blood smear. (Normally, mature red blood cells in adults do not have a cell nucleus, and the presence of nucleated red blood cells suggests that immature cells are being released into the bloodstream in response to a very high demand for the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells.) Immature white cells are also seen in blood samples, and basophil counts are increased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the correlation between heamatological parameters by Sysmex KX- 21 N automated hematology analyzer with the manual methods. Method Sixty (60) subjects were randomly selected from both apparently healthy subjects and those who have different blood disorders from the University of Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria. Three (3) mls of venous blood sample was collected aseptically from each subject into tri-potassium ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (K 3 EDTA) for the analysis of haematological parameters using the automated and the manual methods.

Tetanic convulsions in calves probably arise in association with rickets. None of the calves in the experiments reported in this bulletin developed tetany as they were protected against rickets by feeding cod-liver oil and bone meal. <b>Blood</b> <b>pictures</b> of the calves on a milk diet disclosed an anemic condition as measured by a reduced quantity of hemoglobin, a subnormal erythrocyte count and a lower specific gravity of the blood. The calves also became dyspneic, showed great weakness and lacked color around the tongue and muzzle. These conditions improved markedly upon feeding the roughages, alfalfa hay and straw. The blood also returned to normal. Feeding of alfalfa hay and grain for a period before feeding a diet of whole milk allowed storage of iron in sufficient quantities to prolong the time of apparent good health. <b>Blood</b> <b>pictures</b> {{at the end of}} the trial were subnormal even tho the animal appeared vigorous. When minimum amounts of milk were fed, supplemented with alfalfa flour, the calves retained the healthy appearance of hide and had no convulsions, which were displayed by calves in other experiments on a whole milk diet. The calves on the minimum milk-alfalfa flour diet were under-fed and many of them died of starvation. Calves on milk diets grew faster in skeletal development than normal and when allowed optional amounts of milk were above normal in weight.

It seems that factor such as thick keratincus layer, deep melanin pigment, the paucity of capillary vessels and changes in the adjacent connective tissue are responsible for making it impossible to reveal the capillary <b>blood</b> vessel <b>picture</b> at the root of finger nail. 2. The tissue picture and the capillary <b>blood</b> vessel <b>picture</b> show mo phologically a rather parallel relationship but the blood circulation, being quite a complex problem, does not reveal any distinct relationship with these pictures. 3. From the standpoint of age, the keratinous layer grows thicker, the melanin pigment deeper, changes of connective tissue greater, and the number of capillary blood vessels lesser with advance in age. Likewise the wall of capillary arteries grows sclerotic and the partition ing of lumen is less marked along with advance in age. 4. In those showing sclerosis of the arteries in the radius n y reveal the changes mentioned above. 5. As for the relationship with the blood pressure, although arterial sclerotic changes can be recognized in hypertension, no marked changes can be observed in the cases of hypertension due to renal diseases. 6.

The results obtained were as follows : 1) In rabbits with mild lesions of the hematopoietic "function (leukocytopenia, showing a reduction. rate of leukocyte count within 67 % as compared with normal), the response to these hormones was followed with recovery of the function, increasing granulocytes in the marrows and in the peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>pictures,</b> similar to that of normal rabbits.
