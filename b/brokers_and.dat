25|$|In March 2006, {{immediately}} after allegations emerged that Falun Gong prisoners were being targeted for organ harvesting, overseas investigators began placing {{phone calls to}} Chinese hospitals and police detention centers. The callers posed as prospective transplant recipients or organ <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> inquired about the availability of Falun Gong organs. In several instances, they obtained recorded admissions that organs could be procured from Falun Gong prisoners. A selection of these conversations were cited as evidence in the report by David Kilgour and David Matas.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{served in}} the U.S. Senate for the {{remainder}} of his life, turning down the offer of a new appointment as Secretary of the Treasury from President Roosevelt in 1933. When the Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1933, Glass became Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He was President pro tempore from 1941 to 1945. As a Senator, Glass's most notable achievement was passage of the Glassâ€“Steagall Act, which separated the activities of banks and securities <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, a $400M {{class-action lawsuit}} was filed against UberX and UberXL in Toronto, Ontario, Canada {{on behalf of}} Ontario taxi and limo drivers, <b>brokers,</b> <b>and</b> owners. The {{statement}} of claim alleged that UberX and UberXL violated section 39.1 of the province's Highway Traffic Act by having unlicensed drivers picking up passengers and transporting them for compensation. In March 2016, Sukhvir Tehethi, a local taxi driver, filed an injunction against Uber. Toronto's city council amended a bylaw in October 2015 and, according to Tehethi's lawyer, Uber drivers are in violation of it. Tehethi decided to take action saying {{that it could be}} months, or even years, if he waits for City Hall to act.|$|E

25|$|Up until 2011, {{trading hours}} {{comprised}} a pre-opening auction from 9:30 AM to 9:50 AM, followed by continuous trading from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM and 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM. The two-hour lunch break between {{the morning and}} afternoon sessions was the longest among the world's 20 major stock exchanges. A 2003 proposal to shorten the lunch break failed due to opposition from brokers. Another plan to shorten the lunch break to one hour was floated by the exchange in 2010; the morning session would then start earlier, run from 9:30am to 12:00pm, and the afternoon session from 1:00pm to 4:00pm, leaving the closing time the same as before. Justifications included bringing hours into line with China. Reactions from both <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> the restaurant industry were mixed.|$|E
25|$|There are twenty {{brokerage}} houses registered at the BVRD. Thirteen {{belong to}} financial groups and only seven are operative and belong to banking institutions. Almost 75 {{percent of the}} securities transactions are cross transactions in which both the buyer and the seller are clients of the same brokerage house. In recent years various laws were approved {{in an attempt to}} give new life to the Dominican securities market. In 2000, the Securities Market Law (SML), Law 19-00, was enacted, creating the Superintendence of Securities (Superintendencia de Valores, SIV) as the regulatory agency of the securities market. There are 24 securities <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> there are no registered securities agents. There is one commodities exchange in the country, the Bolsa Agroempresarial de la Republica Dominicana, S.A., which has 14 registered brokerage houses.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{simplicity}} {{depends on}} the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E
