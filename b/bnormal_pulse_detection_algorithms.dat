40|$|Abstract—Two {{algorithms}} used in microwave radiometry for radio-frequency interference (RFI) detection and mitigation are the <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> and the kurtosis <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm.</b> The relative {{performance of the}} algorithms is compared both ana-lytically and empirically. Their probabilities of false alarm under RFI-free conditions and of detection when RFI is present are ex-amined. The downlink data rate required to implement each algo-rithm in a spaceborne application is also considered. The kurtosis algorithm is compared to a <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> operating under optimal RFI detection conditions. The performance of both algorithms is also analyzed {{as a function of}} varying characteristics of the RFI. The RFI detection probabilities of both algorithms under varying subsampling conditions are compared and vali-dated using data obtained from a field campaign. Implementation details, resource usage, and postprocessing requirements are also addressed for both algorithms.

40|$|The {{detection}} of non-repeating {{events in the}} radio spectrum has become an important area of study in radio astronomy {{over the last decade}} due to the discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We have implemented a single <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm,</b> for NVIDIA GPUs, which use boxcar filters of varying widths. Our code performs the calculation of standard deviation, matched filtering by using boxcar filters and thresholding based on the signal-to-noise ratio.

Although the method is considered for application in several areas including telemedicine, sports and assisted living, its dependence on lighting conditions and camera performance is still not investigated enough. In this paper we report on research of various image acquisition aspects including the lighting spectrum, frame rate and compression.

40|$|Hormone {{signaling}} {{is often}} pulsatile, and multi-parameter deconvolution procedures {{have long been}} utilized to identify and characterize secretory events. However, the existing programs have serious limitations, including the subjective nature of initial peak selection, lack of statistical verification of presumed bursts, and user-unfriendliness of the application. Here, we describe a novel deconvolution program, AutoDecon, which addresses these concerns. We validate AutoDecon for application to serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration time series using synthetic data mimicking real data from normal women and then comparing the performance of AutoDecon {{to the performance of}} the widely-employed hormone pulsatility analysis program Cluster. The sensitivity of AutoDecon is higher than Cluster: ~ 96 % vs. ~ 80 % (p = 0. 001). However, Cluster had a lower false-positive detection rate than AutoDecon: 6 % vs 1 %, p = 0. 001. Further analysis demonstrated that the pulsatility parameters recovered by AutoDecon were indistinguishable from those characterizing the synthetic data and sampling at 5 - or 10 -minute intervals was optimal for maximizing the sensitivity rates for LH. Accordingly, AutoDecon presents a viable non-subjective alternative to previous <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms</b> for the analysis of LH data.

40|$|Some {{earlier work}} by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Science Working Group (SWG) on the {{derivation}} of spectrum analyzer thresholds for a <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> based on an analysis of false alarm rates is extended. The algorithm previously analyzed was intended to detect a finite sequence of i periodically spaced pulses that did not necessarily occupy the entire observation interval. This algorithm would recognize the presence of such a signal only if all i-received pulse powers exceeded a threshold T(i) : these thresholds were selected to achieve a desired false alarm rate, independent of i. To simplify the analysis, {{it was assumed that}} the pulses were synchronous with the spectrum sample times. This analysis extends the earlier effort to include infinite and/or asynchronous pulse trains. Furthermore, to decrease the possibility of missing an extraterrestrial intelligence signal, the algorithm was modified to detect a pulse train even if some of the received pulse powers fall below the threshold. The analysis employs geometrical arguments that make it conceptually easy to incorporate boundary conditions imposed on the derivation of the false alarm rates. While the exact results can be somewhat complex, simple closed form approximations are derived that produce a negligible loss of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Plasma panel sensors are micropattern gaseous {{radiation}} detectors {{which are}} based on the technology of plasma display panels. This thesis summarizes the research that had been done on commercially available plasma display panels that were converted to plasma panel sensor prototypes and describes the construction of a two-dimensional tracker consisting of four of those prototypes, with one-dimensional readout on each, used to detect tracks of cosmic muons. A large amount of 2 -point as well as 3 and 4 -point tracks were detected. Qualitative analyses as well as Pearson’s χ 2 tests are performed on the track angular distribution and on a histogram of the linearity measure of 3 -point tracks to reject the hypothesis that these tracks result from completely random panel hits. Some RF noise effects contributing to false positives are ruled out, while it is shown that other effects can be ruled out only with a high-intensity minimum ionizing particle source. A significant part of the tracker construction was the development of a software toolbox to acquire and analyze signals coming from plasma panel sensor devices, which enables long-term monitoring of various aspects of the experiment. The software can be used in future tracking experiments and in other scenarios of data acquisition from plasma panel sensor devices.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development of}} an x-ray detector system for the multispectral detection of x-rays used in a Bottle Scanner. This system is designed to identify liquid explosives concealed within bottles taken onto aircraft. The Bottle Scanner works by calculating the transmission spectrum for a given bottle and its contents. This is then used as a fingerprinting technique in order to identify the presence of liquid explosives. The main focus of this work is the design of the detector signal chain and particularly the <b>pulse</b> height <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms</b> for the acquisition of 32 bin x-ray spectra. The <b>pulse</b> height <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms</b> are implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The performance of such algorithms at high count rate is a key requirement for this application. Four such algorithms are discussed in this work, each with varying complexity and different approaches to pile up handling. The algorithms are simulated using a Monte Carlo approach where the random arrival rate of photons at the detector is modelled. Algorithms are then emulated using an Agilent DSO 90254 A oscilloscope before finally being programmed onto an FPGA and tested on a real system. The transmission curves produced in real Bottle Scanner systems show a deviation from those predicted by the underlying physics and exhibit a rollover at high energies. This is shown to be due to pulse pile up effects which are explored in detail. Depth of interaction effects are also investigated experimentally and by simulation using the Geant 4 software package. The results of this are used to design a biparametric type algorithm which is capable of simultaneous pile up rejection and depth of interaction correction. ...|$|R
40|$|ICP latency {{is defined}} as the time {{interval}} between the peak of QRS complex of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the corresponding onset of intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse. Due to its inherent relationship with arterial pulse wave velocity, ICP latency may allow continuous monitoring of pathophysiological changes in the cerebrovasculature. The objective of the present work was to develop and validate a computerized algorithm for extracting ICP latency in a beat-by-beat fashion. The proposed ICP latency extraction algorithm exploits the mature technique of ECG QRS detection and includes a new adaptive peak detection methodology. The results were validated by comparing the performance of two human observers versus the algorithm in terms of locating the onset points of ICP pulses for 59 recordings extracted from 25 adult patients. The average ICP latency was 72. 6 ± 19. 5 milliseconds (range 40. 0 – 159. 8). The ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> demonstrated a baseline sensitivity of 0. 97 and a positive predictivity of 0. 88.

Cannulation of superficial veins draining skin, abdominal subcutaneous WAT and deep forearm muscle combined with isotope turnover methodology and tissue blood flow estimation was used to investigate the behaviour of these tissues under varying experimental conditions. Glucose infusion study: This examined differential substrate uptake and utilisation in the three tissues. WAT was responsible for {{only a small amount}} of glucose disposal and deep forearm muscle took up but did not release NEFA. Skin was a net exporter of lactate. Results confirm the relative purity of the venous effluent from these tissues. Sympathetic Nervous System study: This examined whole body, WAT and forearm muscle SNS activity in lean and obese individuals under fasting and postprandial conditions. Whereas whole body SNS activity was increased in the obese, regional heterogeneity of SNS activity was evidenced by reduced SNS activity in WAT. Adipose tissue blood flow was significantly reduced in the obese. This may underlie abnormal lipolysis and/or blood flow regulation in obesity. 7 Pulsatility Studies: These studies examined whether lipolysis and leptin production in human WAT is uniform or pulsatile. Novel control datasets were used to test the robustness of a widely used <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Whereas NEFA release appeared truly pulsatile, apparent leptin â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 pulsesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 occurred with similar frequency in the control datasets and appear likely simply to reflect variability. Anatomical studies: Confocal immuno-fluorescence microscopy was used to demonstrate innervation of WAT in man for the first time. Such innervation appears confined to the microvasculature and suggests that the defective SNS activity within WAT is likely to affect adipose tissue biology primarily through defective regulation of adipose tissue blood flow...|$|R

A sensitive and specific immunoradiometric assay {{was used to measure}} plasma ACTH concentrations. An objective <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> (Cluster) was used to assess the pulsatility of ACTH and cortisol release. The temporally coincident release of ACTH and cortisol was also examined. Venous blood samples were collected (over < 15 s) every 2 min for 120 min beginning at 1300 h. The number of ACTH peaks (3. 2 peaks/h), interpulse intervals (19 +/- 2. 4 min), and pulse amplitudes (9. 7 +/- 1. 6 pmol/L) in rhesus monkey were similar to corresponding measures of ACTH release in humans (3. 3 peaks/h, 18 +/- 0. 8 min, and 4. 7 +/- 1. 0 pmol/L, respectively). The number of cortisol peaks (2. 3 peaks/h), interpulse interval (26 +/- 8. 6 min), and other characteristics of pulsatile cortisol release were also determined. There was a 32. 4 % exact concordance of ACTH with cortisol peaks (11 of 34; P < 0. 001). Fifty-six percent of ACTH peaks (19 of 34) were followed by a cortisol peak within 10 min (P < 0. 02). There was a significant correlation between the ACTH and coincident cortisol pulse amplitudes (P < 0. 0001). The amplitudes of ACTH peaks coincident with cortisol peaks at 0 min time lag were significantly higher than ACTH peaks not temporally coupled with cortisol peaks. Our data indicate that 1) high frequency, low amplitude micropulsatile ACTH secretion in rhesus monkeys is very similar to the high frequency ACTH rhythm in humans; 2) temporally concordant ACTH and cortisol release episodes may be amplitude coupled; and 3) an adequate incremental ACTH pulse amplitude may elicit a concurrent cortisol release episode from the adrenal cortex. These data suggest that the rhesus monkey is a potentially useful model for the study of neuroendocrine control of ACTH release...|$|R

The 5 -d fast resulted in a significant increase in discrete GH pulse frequency (5. 8 +/- 0. 7 vs. 9. 9 +/- 0. 7 pulses/ 24 h, P = 0. 028), 24 h integrated GH concentration (2. 82 +/- 0. 50 vs. 8. 75 +/- 0. 82 micrograms. min/ml; P = 0. 0002), and maximal pulse amplitude (5. 9 +/- 1. 1 vs. 12. 3 +/- 1. 6 ng/ml, P less than 0. 005). While multiple low-amplitude sinusoidal periodicities were present on the control fed day, time-series analysis revealed enhancement of circadian and ultradian cycles on the first and fifth days of fasting. Concomitantly, fasting resulted in a decline (day 1 vs. day 5) in serum concentrations of somatomedin C (1. 31 +/- 0. 22 vs. 0. 77 +/- 0. 18 U/ml) and glucose (4. 9 +/- 0. 2 vs. 3. 2 +/- 0. 2 mmol/liter), and a marked rise in free fatty acid (0. 43 +/- 0. 12 vs. 1. 55 +/- 0. 35 mmol/liter) and acetoacetate (35 +/- 6 vs. 507 +/- 80 nmol/liter). We conclude that the acute nutritional status is an important determinant of spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion in man. Fast-induced enhancement of GH release is achieved through combined frequency (discrete pulses) and amplitude (sinusoidal periodicities) modulation. Such alterations in somatotropic hormone release may play an important role in substrate homeostasis during starvation...|$|R

DESIGN: Case-control study of critically ill patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} was carried out. PATIENTS: Six critically ill patients (51 - 78 years) who required ventilation and parenteral nutrition and six age, weight, height, and sex-matched healthy adults were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The patients and controls were studied for two 24 -hour periods; the patients before and after starting parenteral feeding, and the controls during a 36 -hour fast and when taking meals equivalent in calories and protein to the patients' parenteral feed. Serum GH was measured at 20 -minute intervals and analysed by a <b>pulse</b> <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> (Pulsar) and Fourier transformation. IGF-I was measured at 0, 12, and 24 hours. RESULTS: Patients had low serum IGF-I levels compared with controls, whether fasted or fed, despite having mean GH levels similar to fasted controls. For fasted patients vs fasted controls the mean (+/- 1 SD) GH levels were 4. 5 +/- 2. 0 vs 4. 0 +/- 2. 4 mU/l respectively, and IGF-I levels {{at the end of the}} fast were 0. 17 +/- 0. 11 vs 0. 78 +/- 0. 29 U/ml (P = 0. 003). Patients showed elevated baseline GH levels compared with controls when fasted and during parenteral feeding (patients vs controls fasted 3. 1 +/- 1. 9 vs 0. 8 +/- 0. 5 mU/l, P = 0. 01; patients vs controls fed 4. 2 +/- 4. 5 vs 0. 5 +/- 0. 04 mU/l, P = 0. 028). Fourier transformation confirmed oscillatory GH levels in the controls, fasted or fed, but this activity was attenuated in the patients. Parenteral feeding had no effect on the GH profiles or IGF-I levels of patients, but controls showed greater mean GH levels during their fast than when fed. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that critically ill patients have low IGF-I levels associated with augmented baseline GH levels which show reduced oscillatory activity. The results would be compatible with the hypothesis that there is an adaptive change in critically ill patients away from the indirect effects of GH (stimulation of IGF-I production and anabolism) and toward the direct effects (lipolysis and insulin antagonism) which increase the availability of energy substrates. The pattern of GH levels seen in our patients may be important in this adaptation...|$|R

The comparative study determines the feasibility of the kurtosis detector for the SMAP radiometer, as a primary RFI <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> in terms of detectability and data bandwidth.

The proposed <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> has lower complexity than full candidates of QRM-ML <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm.</b> It also has no saturation on BER performance and better performance in high SNR than QRM-ML <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> of lower candidates, which has a similar complexity to proposed algorithm. We also set a new arbitrary parameter which can adjust the number of reduced stages, {{and it can be}} selected by considering a trade-off relationship between BER performance and computational complexity. A stage reduction <b>algorithm</b> and each <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> are presented in a row and compared in terms of BER performance and computational complexity by numerical results and experimentations. In the process of experimentations, the cross points of conventional QRM-ML <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> and modified QRM-ML <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> in BER performance graphs are also analyzed in diverse situations and compared in terms of efficiency of proposed algorithm according to the number of antennas and modulation order. ? ???? ?? ???(MIMO) ????

40|$|Abstract—Corners {{in images}} {{represent}} {{a lot of}} important information. Extracting corners accurately is significant to image processing, which can reduce much of the calculations. In this paper, two widely used corner <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms,</b> SUSAN and Harris corner <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms</b> which are both based on intensity, were compared in stability, noise immunity and complexity quantificationally via stability factor η, anti-noise factor ρ and the runtime of each algorithm. It concluded that Harris corner <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> was superior to SUSAN corner <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> on the whole. Moreover, SUSAN and Harris <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms</b> were improved by selecting an adaptive gray difference threshold and by changing directional differentials, respectively, and compared using these three criterions. In addition, SUSAN and Harris corner detectors were applied to an image matching experiment. It was verified that the quantitative evaluations of the corner <b>detection</b> <b>algorithms</b> were valid through calculating match efficiency, defined as correct matching corner pairs dividing by matching time, which can reflect the performances of a corner <b>detection</b> <b>algorithm</b> comprehensively.
