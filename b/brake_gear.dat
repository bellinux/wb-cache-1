25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> on the tender, power-operated reversing gear, American-style bar frame construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a self-cleaning smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying ashpan, side window cab and a simplified footplate together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>gear,</b> Detroit sight feed cylinder lubricator and a cast number plate.|$|E
25|$|Running gear {{includes}} the <b>brake</b> <b>gear,</b> wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface. Adhesive weight is {{the portion of the}} locomotive's weight bearing on the driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able {{to make the most of}} its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the adhesive weight. Locomotives with equalising beams connecting the ends of plate springs have often been deemed a complication, however locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip.|$|E
40|$|A robust ground {{traction}} (drive) assembly for {{remotely controlled}} vehicles, {{which not only}} operates smoothly on surfaces that are flat, but also upon surfaces that include rugged terrain, snow, mud, and sand, is provided. The assembly includes a sun <b>gear</b> and a <b>braking</b> <b>gear.</b> The sun gear is configured to cause rotational force {{to be applied to}} second planetary gears through a coupling of first planetary <b>gears.</b> The <b>braking</b> <b>gear</b> is configured to cause the assembly (or the second planetary gears) to rotate around the <b>braking</b> <b>gear</b> when an obstacle or braking force is applied...|$|R
25|$|Unicycles usually, but not always, lack <b>brakes,</b> <b>gears,</b> and {{the ability}} to freewheel.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{position}} of the engine was favourable for air cooling, while the oil cooler, battery and spare wheel were positioned {{in the front of}} the car. The frameless body was characterized by its central frame member, which was firmly welded to the floor panels and which covered the linkage to the <b>brakes,</b> <b>gears,</b> etc.|$|R
25|$|K 174: Moorooduc, {{with the}} Mornington Railway. This engine had been plinthed at the Edinburgh Gardens in Fitzroy (near the former Fitzroy Railway Station) until 18 May 1997, {{when it was}} {{acquired}} by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc by road. The engine was in generally terrible condition, with most fittings missing and the remainder of parts damaged, except the engine frames which were in surprisingly good condition by comparison. The tender tank had fittings removed and was scrapped at Moorooduc, being beyond repair, and the tender frame and the <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> for the locomotive demonstrated significant collision damage. The rest of the parts were placed in a pool {{to be used to}} reassemble a future engine; {{at the end of the}} project, the pool consisted of the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck from 159 and 177; the loco frames, coupled wheels, axle boxes, motion gear and smoke deflectors from 159 and 174; the tender frame and bogies from 174 and 177, and the tender tank from 177 only. In 2000, the coupled wheels and motion gear from 174 was swapped with that from 176 at Seymour as the tyres from 174 required replacement, while 176's tyres were almost new; though both locomotives had poor condition axle boxes and crankpins. A few years later, the tender bogies from 174 were swapped with those from 191. When completed, the locomotive using K 174's frame is to be numbered K 177 and named City of Ararat, as part of the deal for parts acquisition.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotives}} used {{saturated steam}} and had Walschaerts valve gear with slide valves. Like many other Central African locomotives of the day, they were wood-burners and some modifications {{were required to}} adapt them to coal-burning on the SAR. In addition, their tenders and <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> had been lost at sea {{and they had to}} be fitted with SAR tenders, which were pirated from unserviceable engines awaiting or undergoing repair. The required engine <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> was designed in the Pretoria drawing office and manufactured in the Salvokop workshops.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} <b>braking.</b> <b>Gear</b> selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|R

50|$|In Russia, in the 1780s, Ivan Kulibin {{developed}} a human-pedalled, three-wheeled carriage with modern {{features such as}} a flywheel, <b>brake,</b> <b>gear</b> box and bearings; however, it was not developed further.|$|E
50|$|The main cradle {{frame was}} carried on {{adjustable}} pivots. The front pivot was a spherical type, {{located on the}} front engine unit's frame between the driving and trailing coupled wheels, while the rear pivot was a flat oil-bath type, located on the rear engine unit's frame over the driving wheels. Each engine unitâ€™s frames were formed of two continuous bars, 33 ft long and extending from the buffer beams at the outer ends to the cross-beams over the Bissel wheels at the inner ends. The front engine unit was equipped with steam as well as vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>gear,</b> while the hind unit was equipped with steam <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> and handbrake gear.|$|E

50|$|Bicycles, {{tricycles}} and quadracycles share (with minor variations) several {{basic parts}} including wheels, pedals, cranks, forks, and the saddle with unicycles.Without a rider unicycles lack stability - however, a proficient unicyclist is usually {{more stable than}} a similarly proficient rider on a bicycle as the wheel is not constrained by the linear axis of a frame.Unicycles usually lack <b>brakes,</b> <b>gears,</b> {{and the ability to}} freewheel.|$|R
50|$|The 914/6 models used {{lower gear}} ratios and high <b>brake</b> <b>gearing</b> {{in order to}} try to {{overcome}} the greater weight of the 6 cylinder engine along with higher power output. Suspension, brakes, and handling were otherwise the same. A Volkswagen-Porsche joint venture, Volkswagen of America, handled export to the U.S., where both versions were badged and sold as Porsches. The four-cylinder cars were sold as Volkswagen-Porsches at European Volkswagen dealerships.|$|R
2500|$|While the Edsel's {{front end}} design was {{considered}} [...] "weird" [...] or [...] "too different" [...] by contemporary buyers and critics, many other car manufacturers (such as Pontiac, Jaguar, BMW, Subaru, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, and Saab) have employed similar vertical grilles successfully {{in their car}} designs. [...] Many of the Edsel's features, such as self-adjusting <b>brakes,</b> <b>gear</b> selection by steering wheel buttons, etc., which were considered [...] "too impractical" [...] in the late 1950s, are now standard features of sports cars.|$|R
50|$|Parallel to the hopper and <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> {{modifications}} a new {{arrangement of}} roof hatches was trialled. The early wagons were {{fitted with a}} pair of individual flip-open lids, while later wagons were fitted with a single, much longer rooftop hatch mounted on six hinges.|$|E

50|$|The JDM DC2 {{received}} significant upgrades in 1998 and {{is known}} as the '98 Spec R. Some of the main changes were a redesigned rear bumper, 16-inch wheel with 215/45R16 tires, 5-lug nut wheel hubs and bigger <b>brakes.</b> <b>Gear</b> ratios for the final drive were higher, making 1st to 3rd gears closer, while 4th and 5th were longer to maintain the '96 Spec cruising comfort. The engine power remained the same, but use of a new 4-1 long tube header brought torque lower down to 6200 rpm.|$|R

The special emphasis is placed on various approaches to the anti-lock braking systems. Taking into account the specificity of motorcy-cles, scooters and other two-wheeled vehicles, the variants of single and double-channel braking control are examined. Approbation of developed control strategy has been performed through simulation with AMESim software. This allowed to consider the very important factors like hysteresis losses in <b>brake</b> <b>gears</b> and re-sponse time of brake drive. In accordance with results of virtual testing, the paper proposes an evaluation of pre-extreme algorithms for motorcycle anti-lock braking systems...|$|R

50|$|A second free-turning pinion wheel {{which also}} meshed with the rack, was {{mounted on the}} leading driving axle. It had grooved brake drums bolted to each side and acted as a brake only, with the brakes being applied by a hand {{mechanism}} from the footplate. The brakes on the driving and free-turning pinion wheels were separately controlled, while the vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> on the engine was only used to control the brakes of the train.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, the {{construction}} company acquired a single 2-6-2 tank locomotive from Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States of America.
