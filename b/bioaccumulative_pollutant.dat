40|$|Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) is {{a persistent}} and <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>pollutant</b> ubiquitous in wildlife and humans. Although {{the distribution and}} fate of PFOS have been widely studied, its potential neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. In the present study, the acute and chronic effects of PFOS on the development and synaptic transmission of hippocampal neurons was examined. Perfusion with PFOS markedly increased the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) and slightly elevated the amplitude of mPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Perfusion with PFOS also increased the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recorded in the CA 1 region of hippocampal slices. Both of these effects were largely blocked by the L-type Cal(2 +) channel antagonist nifedipine. Further studies showed that PFOS enhanced inward Ca(2 +) currents and increased intracellular Ca(2 +) in cultured neurons; these effects were also substantially inhibited by nifedipine. Moreover, prolonged treatment with PFOS moderately inhibited neurite growth and dramatically suppressed synaptogenesis in cultured neurons in a nifedipine-sensitive manner. Thus, through enhancement of Ca(2 +) channels, PFOS may exhibit both acute excitotoxic effects on synaptic function and chronically inhibit synaptogenesis in the brain...|$|E

40|$|Domestic sewage is a {{major threat}} to {{receiving}} waters throughout the world. In Canada, a high proportion of the population (81 %) is served by municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Nevertheless, discharges from wastewater treatment plants, stormwater sewers and combined sewers have caused some adverse impacts on lakes, rivers and coastal waters.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we report the {{analytical}} results of pp'DDT, pp'DDE and pp'DDD determination in lake water, plankton and zooplanktivorous fish of Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy), rather recently polluted by DDT of industrial origin, {{in order to}} understand the bottom-up pollution transfer among the abiotic and biotic components of the lake ecosystem. Fourteen water sampling campaigns were carried out from March 2003 to January 2009 in the water column of the deepest point (Ghiffa) of Lake Maggiore. Suspended and dissolved pollutants were determined separately. Three sampling campaigns were carried out from July 2008 to January 2009 for zooplankton and pelagic fish, and DDT residues were analysed by HRGC coupled with ECD and MS. Moreover, food items were detected in fish stomachs. Starting from 2007, the DDT contamination along the water column became rather homogeneous, probably because no flooding or other relevant hydrological events occurred; although steady-state condition should be expected, lipid normalised concentrations of pp'DDE and pp'DDD in zooplankton exceeded the levels of the same compounds in zooplanktivorous fishes.

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /CE is to assess the {{ecological}} status of water bodies in Europe in relation to priority contaminants, including some persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Recognizing the benefits of measuring hydrophobic compounds in biota tissues rather than in water, we used the European eel Anguilla anguilla in the present study as a bioindicator species for monitoring POPs in freshwater/brackish environments. We present the results of a contamination analysis of eels carried out in three Italian sites representative of different pollution levels: the last part of Tevere River, which flows through a very urbanized and industrialized area, Caprolace Lake and Lesina Lagoon, inside two different protected national parks. A very high pollution variability was recorded within each group of eels, in particular for those caught at Caprolace Lake. Due to this high variability, inter-population comparisons were carried out only between eels collected in Tevere River and Lesina Lagoon. PCBs values in Lesina Lagoon were two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in Tevere River, while {{no significant differences were found}} for levels of DDT compounds.

40|$|Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) is an aliphatic {{fluorinated compound}} with eight carbon atoms that is extremely persistent {{in the environment}} and can adversely affect human and ecological health. The stability, low reactivity, and high water solubility of PFOS combined with the North American phase-out in production around the year 2000, make it a potentially useful new tracer for ocean circulation. Here we characterize processes affecting the lifetime and accumulation of PFOS in the North Atlantic Ocean and transport to sensitive Arctic regions by developing a 3 -D simulation within the MITgcm. The model captures variability in measurements across biogeographical provinces (R 2 = 0. 90, p= 0. 01). In 2015, the North Atlantic PFOS reservoir was equivalent to 60 % of cumulative inputs from the North American and European continents (1400 Mg). Cumulative inputs to the Arctic accounted for 30 % of continental discharges, while the remaining 10 % was transported to the tropical Atlantic and other regions. PFOS concentrations declined rapidly after 2002 in the surface mixed-layer (half-life: 1 - 2 years) but are still increasing below 1000 m depth. During peak production years (1980 - 2000), plumes of PFOS enriched seawater were transported to the Subarctic in energetic surface ocean currents. However, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and deep ocean transport returned a substantial fraction of this northward transport (20 %, 530 Mg) to southern latitudes and reduced cumulative inputs to the Arctic (730 Mg) by 70 %. Weakened AMOC due to climate change is thus likely to increase the magnitude of persistent <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>pollutants</b> entering the Arctic Ocean...|$|R

40|$|Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) Contaminants are toxic {{substances}} mainly {{released into the}} environment {{as a result of}} human activities (eg, industrial production, agro-animal husbandry practices, waste production/disposal). They are equipped with a high intrinsic stability that allows them to remain unchanged in the environment for a long time, undergoing a wide geographical spread between environmental compartments (air, water, soil and biota) and accumulating in living organisms to harmful levels for both human health and ecosystem (www. epa. gov/pbt). Population exposure to these PBT contaminants mainly takes place through food (Pazefall, 2002), therefore their monitoring is fundamental for Public Health. The research described in this doctoral thesis mainly concerned the identification of some of these contaminants in meals, as well as actually consumed by the population. The main objective of the research activity was the development of a method to determine the real contribution of the daily diet to the toxic and persistent contaminants exposure for people living in different geographical areas of Italy. In particular, the interest has been directed to the categories of substances in the families of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins and furans (PCDDs, PCDFs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Our attention was focused on Total diet studies (TDS) and Duplicate diet studies (DDS), through the analysis of canteens and restaurants meals from Italian adults and children and the analysis of double portions of all meals (24 h) prepared at home by some adults respectively. Sampling was carried out through the selection of six different types of meals, depending on the following different dietary habits: consumption of baby food by toddlers aged 9 - 12 months (Baby food, BF); consumption of meals in school canteens for children attending nursery and primary school (age 4 - 9 years), and canteens for adults (aged 18 - 64 years); consumption of fast food meals by adults (Fast Foods, FF); consumption of food prepared at home by adults (Duplicate diet, DD); consumption of meals by adults that observe a vegetarian lifestyle (Vegetarian diet, V); consumption of "Sundays meals " at the restaurant by adults (Restaurant meals, RM). In particular, canteen meals were collected in collaboration with four Italian primary schools (Ferrara, Perugia, Genoa- 1, Genoa- 2), a nursery school (Portici, NA) and an office canteen (Brescia). All the composites were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS for PCDD/F and PCB and by HRGC-LRMS for PBDE). Analysis of the obtained data revealed no exposure beyond the legal limits for the examined population, the estimates were lower even than those {{of the rest of the}} European population. Only for some restaurant meals RM higher values compared to the general trend were obtained, probably caused by the additional presence, in the above menu, of meat based dressing re-fill in the first courses (i. e. tagliatelle alla bolognese and agnolotti) and of dessert prepared with milk and dairy products. Foods of animal origin, in fact, generally show higher levels of <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>pollutants</b> compared to foods of plant origin (EFSA 2011 a, 2012 b EFSA). This explanation is supported by the lower levels of contaminants found in the vegetarian meal (V). For all three categories of PBT contaminants (dioxins, furans, PCBs and PBDEs) a higher value was obtained babies and children meals, in line with the general view which explains that they should be more exposed than the adults because of greater consumption of food relative to their body weight (EFSA 2012 A). Due to the complexity and expensiveness of conducting long-term studies, such as TDS, the analysis of composites as result of pooled meals may represent a first cost-effective screening useful to assess persistent organic pollutants intake through food as actually consumed. In order to refine the dietary exposure assessment it may be useful to perform such screening on regular basis thus reducing possible uncertainties related to the meals representativeness also on seasonal basis...|$|R

Using 2, 662 measurements collected from peer-reviewed literature spanning 1969 – 2012, we examined variability of five classes of PBTs, considering effects of geography, habitat, and trophic level on observed concentrations. While we see large-scale spatial patterning in some PBTs (chlordanes, polychlorinated biphenyls), habitat type and trophic level did not contribute to significant patterning, with the exception of mercury. We further examined patterns of change in PBT concentration as a function of sampling year. All PBTs showed significant declines in concentration levels through time, ranging from 15 – 30 % reduction per decade across PBT groups. Despite consistent evidence of reductions, variation in pollutant concentration remains high, indicating ongoing consumer risk of exposure to fish with pollutant levels exceeding EPA screening values. The temporal trends indicate that mitigation programs are effective, but that global levels decline slowly.

A biomonitoring survey with the epiphytic Tillandsia recurvata was conducted there to detect spatial patterns and potential sources of 20 airborne elements and 15 PAH. The natural δ 13 C and δ 15 N ratios of this plant helped in source identification. The regional mean concentration of most elements was two (Cr) to over 40 times (Ni, Pb, V) higher than reported for Tillandsia in other countries. Eleven elements, pyrene and chrysene had 18 – 214 % higher mean concentration at the industrial south than at the agricultural north of MV. The total quantified PAH (mean, 572 ng g − 1; range, 143 – 2568) were composed by medium (65 %, phenanthrene to chrysene), low (28 %, naphthalene to fluorene) and high molecular weight compounds (7 %, Benzo(b) fluoranthene to indeno(1, 2, 3 - cd) pyrene). The δ 13 C (mean, − 14. 6 ‰; range, − 15. 7 ‰ to − 13. 7 ‰) was consistently lower than − 15 ‰ near the major petroleum combustion sources. The δ 15 N (mean, − 3. 0 ‰; range, − 9. 9 ‰ to 3. 3 ‰) varied from positive at agriculture/industrial areas to negative at rural sites. Factor analysis provided a five-factor solution for 74 % of the data variance: 1) crustal rocks, 39. 5 % (Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Sr, Ti); 2) soils, 11. 3 %, contrasting contributions from natural (Mg, Mn, Zn) and saline agriculture soils (Na); 3) cement production and fossil fuel combustion, 9. 8 % (Ca, Ni, V, chrysene, pyrene); 4) probable agricultural biomass burning, 8. 1 % (K and benzo(g,h,i) perylene), and 5) agriculture with wastewater, 5. 2 % (δ 15 N and P).

It's important and urgent to develop effective technology to remove PFOS. The effect of coagulation pretreatment on the removal efficiency of PFOS by nanaltration (NF) was investigated. Two types of NF membranes were used to test the PFOS rejections in three different solutions including DI water, humic acid (HA) solution and coagulation solution. The characterizations such as HA and PFOS accumulation on the membranes, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface zeta potential analysis of virgin and fouled membranes were conducted to study the separation mechanism. The experimental results showed that PFOS can be partly removed by coagulation. The NF 270 membrane exhibited a higher PFOS rejection (> 95 %) than the HYDRACORE membrane (40 - 60 %) in single NF process. The surface negative charge density of both NF membranes reached a minimum value after filtering coagulation effluent, which might be a result of floc adsorption on the membrane surface. Coagulation pretreatment was effective to enhance the PFOS rejection of the NF membranes. In particular, the rejection efficiency of the HYDRACORE membrane increased from 55 % to 86 % at a trans-membrane pressure of 0. 4 MPa. The SEM images showed that the fouling layer formed by flocs was loose and highly permeable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study investigated the impact of wintering area on concentrations and patterns of organochlorines (OCs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in plasma of breeding great skuas Stercorarius skua from 3  colonies; Bjørnøya (Svalbard), southeast Iceland and Shetland (Scotland).

Nevertheless, the influence of wintering area differed between contaminants and between breeding colonies. We conclude that although wintering area had a significant effect on both concentrations and patterns of POPs, its influence was small in comparison to differences in exposure to these pollutants at breeding colonies, but that accumulation of POPs during the winter may be important for specific populations of seabirds...|$|R

They are globally spread and found in high concentrations in e. g. water and biota. The goal {{of this study was to}} analyze the results from a screening campaign of PFASs in Swedish waters. The aims were to identify the most polluted types of waters and identify the main emission sources. Further, the measured concentrations were compared with guideline values. This study also investigated the possibility of tracing PFAS sources from a water sample. In total 528 samples (including 30 triplicates and 26 blanks) were collected across Sweden and analyzed for 26 different PFASs. The types of water sampled were groundwater, surface water, landfill leachate and sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent. Also 10 reference lakes located in remote areas were sampled. The samples were analyzed by using a method including filtration, SPE (solid phase extraction) and LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry). The result showed PFAS concentrations ranging from zero to thousands of ng L- 1. The highest average concentration was measured in landfill leachate. The maximum concentrations were detected in samples collected from surface water and groundwater. The impact from different sources was investigated for surface- and groundwater. The results showed that fire training sites are causing the highest concentrations followed by landfills/waste disposal areas. An analysis of the concentration in drinking water showed that 5 of the sampled sites contained concentrations above the recommended guidelines from the Swedish National Food Agency (90 ng L- 1 for the sum of 11 PFASs). The conclusion drawn from this was that it is important to continue monitoring PFAS concentrations in drinking water sources, especially those potentially impacted by fire training sites or landfills. The possibility of source tracing PFASs from surface- and groundwater samples was investigated through PCA (Principal Component Analysis), cluster analysis and analysis of branched isomers. The results did not show any correlations between the sources and specific PFAS profiles, except for PFOS, PFBS, PFHxS and PFPeA in groundwater which showed some correlation with fire training sites. The conclusion was that source tracing needs to be investigated further, and the possibility of finding correlations might increase if more specific source categories are used...|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a 'persistent, <b>bioaccumulative</b> and toxic' <b>pollutant</b> with widespread impacts throughout North America and the world (EPA. 1997 a, 1997 b, 1998 a, 1998 b, 2000). Although most of the mercury in the environment is inorganic Hg, a small proportion of total Hg is transformed through the actions of aquatic microbes into methylmercury (MeHg). In contrast to virtually all other metals, MeHg biomagnifies or becomes increasingly concentrated as it is transferred through aquatic food chains so that the consumption of mercury contaminated fish is the primary route of this toxin to humans. For this reason, the ambient water quality criterion (AWQC) for mercury is based on a fish tissue endpoint rather than an aqueous Hg concentration, as the tissue concentration (e. g., < 0. 3 {mu}g/g fillet) {{is considered to be a}} more consistent indicator of exposure and risk (EPA, 2001). Effective mercury remediation at point-source contaminated sites requires an understanding of the nature and magnitude of mercury inputs, and also knowledge of how these inputs must be controlled in order to achieve the desired reduction of mercury contamination in biota necessary for compliance with AWQC targets. One of the challenges to remediation is that mercury body burdens in fish are more closely linked to aqueous MeHg than to inorganic Hg concentrations (Sveinsdottir and Mason 2005), but MeHg production is not easily predicted or controlled. At point-source contaminated sites, mercury methylation is not only affected by the absolute mercury load, but also by the form of mercury loaded. In addition, once MeHg is formed, the hydrology, trophic structure, and water chemistry of a given system affect how it is transformed and transferred through the food chain to fish. Decreasing inorganic Hg concentrations and loading may often therefore be a more achievable remediation goal, but has led to mixed results in terms of responses in fish bioaccumulation. A number of source control measures have resulted in rapid responses in lake or reservoir fisheries (Joslin 1994, Turner and Southworth 1999; Orihel et al., 2007), but examples of similar responses in Hg-contaminated stream ecosystems are less common. Recent work suggests that stream systems may actually be more susceptible to mercury bioaccumulation than lakes, highlighting the need to better understand the ecological drivers of mercury bioaccumulation in stream-dwelling fish (Chasar et al. 2009, Ward et al. 2010). In the present study we examine the response of fish to remedial actions in Tims Branch, a point-source contaminated stream on the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. This second order stream received inorganic mercury inputs at its headwaters from the 1950 s- 2000 s which contaminated the water, sediments, and biota downstream. In 2007, an innovative mercury removal system using tin (II) chloride (stannous chloride, SnCl{sub 2 }) was implemented at a pre-existing air stripper. Tin(II) reduces dissolved Hg (II) to Hg (0), which is removed by the air stripper. During this process, tin(II) is oxidized to tin (IV) which is expected to precipitate as colloidal tin(IV) oxides and hydroxides, particulate materials with relatively low toxicity (Hallas and Cooney, 1981, EPA 2002, ATSDR, 2005). The objectives of the present research are to provide an initial assessment of the net impacts of the tin(II) based mercury treatment on key biota and to document the distribution and fate of inorganic tin in this small stream ecosystem after the first several years of operating a full scale system. To support these objectives, we collected fish, sediment, water, invertebrates, and biofilm samples from Tims Branch to quantify the general behavior and accumulation patterns for mercury and tin in the ecosystem and to determine if the treatment process has resulted in: (1) a measurable beneficial impact on (i. e., decrease of) mercury concentration in upper trophic level fish and other biota; this is a key environmental endpoint since reducing mercury concentration in fish is a primary regulatory driver for controlling mercury in streams; and (2) the potential for negative impacts associated with inorganic tin, including, biological transformation and uptake, and/or undesirable accumulation/focusing of tin to in key ecosystem compartments...|$|R
