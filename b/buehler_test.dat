50|$|LLNA {{test has}} largely {{superseded}} the guinea pig maximisation {{test and the}} <b>Buehler</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Buehler</b> <b>test</b> is an in vivo test {{to screen}} for {{substances}} that cause human skin sensitisation (i.e. allergens). It was first proposed by Edwin Vernon Buehler in 1965 and further explained in 1980.|$|E
40|$|Three contact allergens; {{dinitrochlorobenzene}} (DNCB), {{nickel and}} formalin, were determined allergenicities. Contact allergies were induced in 24 dogs and 15 guinea pigs (used as a comparative animal species) {{by means of}} Draize test, Maximization test, Open Epicutaneous test and <b>Buehler</b> <b>test,</b> and evaluated by means of closed patch testing. Results showed that, in dogs, nickel produced allergic responses of the skin in the Open Epicutaneous test, but formalin did not produced it. In the Maximization test, however, both nickel and formalin failed to induce a contact allergy, although DNCB showed a high allergenicity. The appropriate concentration of test solutions for the closed patch test in dogs were 1. 0 % for DNCB, 0. 1 % for nickel and 1 : 10 dilution for formalin, respectively...|$|E
40|$|There is {{sufficient}} data from toxicokinetic studies in humans [Feldman and Maibach 1974; Wester et al. 1985; Franklin et al. 1989; McCurdy et al. 1994] and animals [Franklin et al. 1989; Thongsinthusack 1999] {{to demonstrate that}} azinphos-methyl can be absorbed through the skin and is systemically available. Acute dermal toxicity data from animals [Gains 1960; Sato 1959; Pasquet et al. 1976] and a case report [Quinby et al. 1958] indicate that azinphos-methyl can be fatal following exposure at low doses. No prolonged, repeated-dose dermal toxicity studies were identified, but azinphos-methyl inhibits AChE in the central and peripheral nervous systems, as is observed in oral toxicity studies in rats [Sheets 1994]. No case reports or standard skin irritation tests in animals were identified for determining the potential of azinphos-methyl to cause direct skin effects. No diagnostic tests in humans or case reports of sensitization were identified, but a well-conducted <b>Buehler</b> patch <b>test</b> on guinea pigs indicates that azinphos-methyl {{has the potential to}} cause skin sensitization [Bayer AG 1987]. Therefore, {{on the basis of these}} assessments, azinphos-methyl is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYS (FATAL) -SEN. Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for azinphos-methyl previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent dermal designations for azinphos-methyl, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, are Acute Toxicity Category 3 (Hazard statement: Toxic in contact with the skin) and Skin Sensitization Category 1 (Hazard statement: May cause an allergic skin reaction) [European Parliament 2008].

40|$|The skin irritating, sensitizing, {{and acute}} dermal {{toxicity}} potential of a novel combinational prophylactic transdermal patch, mainly composed of eserine and pralidoxime chloride as active pharmaceutical ingredients, against (+) anatoxin-a poisoning were investigated in rabbits, guinea pigs, and rats {{in compliance with the}} Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines. In primary skin irritation test, rabbits were dermally attached with the therapeutically active transdermal patch or with a placebo patch for 72 hours. The transdermal patches did not induce any adverse reactions such as erythema and edema on intact skin sites. The active patch was classified as a practically nonirritating material based on the score in the primary irritation index. In the <b>Buehler</b> <b>test,</b> guinea pigs were sensitized by the active or placebo transdermal patches attached for 24 hours. The patches did not induce any sensitization reactions in contrast to a severe sensitization reaction that occurred in the positive control. Therefore, the active patch and placebo patch were both graded as weak in sensitization score and rate. Acute dermal toxicity test in rats did not produce any overt signs of toxicity following a 14 -day treatment period. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transdermal patch does not cause skin irritation, skin sensitization, or dermal toxic effects following dermal application...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the {{histology}} of allergic contact dermatitis reactions to potent allergens in guinea pigs and humans have indicated that there is significant tissue infiltration with basophilic leukocytes. In this study we determined whether this histologic finding could be of value in distinguishing weak sensitization reactions from primary irritation, thereby aiding in the predictive identification of weak or moderate contact allergens. Guinea pigs were sensitized by the <b>Buehler</b> <b>test</b> method. Skin reactions were graded 24, 48, and 72 h post-challenge with duplicate patch sites biopsied at the 24 - or 72 -h grading timepoints. The biopsies were fixed, embedded in glycol methacrylate, thin sectioned, and Giemsa stained. The number of basophils per 400 leukocytes were counted along the upper dermis just below the dermal/ epidermal junction. Challenge patch sites from animals sensitized to a relatively low dose of the strong contact allergen, oxazolone, were compared with patch sites from animals challenged only with a strong irritant, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Compared to normal skin (7. 5 ± 1. 0 basophils/ 400 leukocytes ± SEM) only the oxazolone patch sites showed significant basophil infiltration (36. 8 ± 6. 5), {{despite the fact that}} the skin reactions to the low oxazolone challenge dose were relatively weak. SLS patch sites showed no basophil infiltration above normal skin levels (4. 8 ± 0. 9). Subsequent blinded studies compared weak/moderate presumptive sensitization reactions (as defined by accepted visual skin grading criteria) to various chemicals (citronellal, vanillin, cinnamic aldehyde, and ethylenediamine) to primary irritation reactions to the same chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Acute dermal {{toxicity}} {{study was conducted}} in rats. The parameters studied were body weight, serum biochemistry and gross pathology. The animals were also observed for clinical signs and mortality after the application of test film. The dermal irritation potential of silk protein film was examined using Draize test. In the initial test, three test patches were applied sequentially for 3 min, 1 and 4 hours, respectively, and skin reaction was graded. The irritant or negative response was confirmed using two additional animals, each with one patch, for an exposure period of 4 hours. The responses were scored at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the patch removal. Skin sensitization study was conducted according to <b>Buehler</b> <b>test</b> in guinea pigs, in which on day 0, 7 and 14, the animals were exposed to test material for 6 hours (Induction phase) and on day 28, the animals were exposed for a period of 24 hours (Challenge phase). The skin was observed and recorded at 24 and 48 hours after the patch removal. In acute {{dermal toxicity}} study, the rats dermally treated with silk film did not show any abnormal clinical signs and the body weight, biochemical parameters and gross pathological observations were not significantly different from the control group. In acute dermal irritation study, the treated rabbits showed no signs of erythema, edema and eschar, and the scoring was given as “ 0 ” for all time points of observations according to Draize scoring system. In skin sensitization study, there were no skin reactions 24 and 48 hours after the removal of challenge patch, which was scored “ 0 ” based on Magnusson/Kligman grading scale...|$|E
