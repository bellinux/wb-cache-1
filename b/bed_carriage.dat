50|$|The {{design of}} lathes can vary greatly {{depending}} on the intended application; however, basic features are common to most types. These machines consist of (at the least) a headstock, <b>bed,</b> <b>carriage,</b> and tailstock. Better machines are solidly constructed with broad bearing surfaces (slide-ways) for stability, and manufactured with great precision. This helps ensure the components manufactured on the machines can meet the required tolerances and repeatability.|$|E

25|$|Cars {{could also}} be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between Severn Tunnel Junction and Pilning. The {{vehicles}} were loaded onto open flat <b>bed</b> <b>carriages</b> and pulled by a small pannier tank locomotive, although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the steam locomotive tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (Â£1.50) in the early 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|On 27 November 1781, {{after the}} Spanish {{had set up}} their own siege lines, the artificers participated in a highly {{successful}} British raid to demolish the Spanish entrenchments and spike their cannon. The Governor, General George Eliott, subsequently praised in a despatch the role they had played in the sortie: they had [...] "made wonderful exertions, and spread their fire with such amazing rapidity, that in half an hour, two mortar batteries of ten 13-inch mortars, and three batteries of six guns each, with all the lines of approach, communication and traverses, &c. were in flames and reduced to ashes. Their mortars and cannon were spiked, and their <b>beds,</b> <b>carriages</b> and platforms destroyed. Their magazines blew up one after another, as the fire approached them." [...] The artificers were also responsible for providing the gunners with a supply of red-hot shot to be fired at the besieging forces, which they accomplished by building kilns around the fortress to heat 100 pieces of shot at a time.|$|R

2500|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock. [...] The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat <b>bed.</b> The <b>carriage</b> is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.|$|R
40|$|The system {{provides}} a constant travel speed along a contoured workpiece. It has a driven skate {{characterized by an}} elongated bed, {{with a pair of}} independently pivoted trucks connected to the bed for support. The trucks are mounted on a contoured track of arbitrary configuration in a mutually spaced relation. An axially extensible torch head manipulator arm is mounted on the <b>bed</b> of the <b>carriage</b> and projects perpendicular from the midportion. The torch head is mounted at its distal end. A real-time computerized control drive subsystem is used to advance the skate along the track of a variable rate for maintaining a constant speed for the torch head tip, and to position the torch axis relative to a preset angle to the workpiece...|$|R
50|$|For most of {{the film}} Bond and Anya have the same mission {{objectives}} and try {{to achieve the same}} goals often by attempting to outdo one another, during which they fall in love. While travelling to Sardinia by train they share a meal together and while Anya is preparing for <b>bed</b> in her <b>carriage,</b> having politely declined Bond's offer of a nightcap, she is attacked by Jaws. Bond hears the sounds of a struggle over the noise of the train and arrives just in time to save her from being killed. After a brief fight Jaws is despatched out of a window and Bond returns to Anya, who tends to a cut on his shoulder before they kiss and ultimately spend the night together. On Sardinia Anya accompanies Bond to meet Karl Stromberg posing as his wife. Afterwards Anya learns that 007 killed her lover. She then tells Bond that she will ultimately have revenge once their mission is complete.|$|R
2500|$|The {{train was}} NZR's attempt {{to compete with}} the {{introduction}} of jet aircraft for business traffic between Auckland and Wellington. It was intended to improve the Railways staff morale and image, and the concept was based on a shorter version of [...] NSW Railways,standard gauge, Southern Aurora,75ft, 20 Passenger berth, sleeping cars introduced in 1962, providing luxury equal to the last US trains Broadway Limited, Chief, Crescent and Panama Limited, providing sleeping berths and Pullman comfort for all. Planning of the new Auckland and Wellington overnight express began in 1963 and 1964, and the concept of the train, as involving, an order for 31 stainless steel carriages - with two trainsets each night, of 5 twinette carriages, 5 single berth sleepers (16 <b>beds</b> per <b>carriage),</b> a licensed buffet car and a power car, never changed. The public announcement of plans for the new train were announced in December 1965 [...] Extensive study was made of other early 1960's Australian overnight train sets, particularly the Sundlander and Overland and similar designs in the USA, the final Santa Fe High level and Burlington cars. New Zealand built cars were estimated to cost by NZR CME, J.Black in 1958, 25,000 pounds for a second class carriage and 35,000 pounds for a first class car. By 1960 NZR had concluded that stainless steel carriages, which lowered maintenance needs and avoided the need to paint were preferable, even with at a cost premium of 12-20%. That effectively meant, in 1970 a carriage cost of $100,000+ for Japanese or Australian stainless steel construction, cf with $60,000 to 70,000 for conventional Italian or Swedish built first class cars.( [...] In 1941 NZR built 31 seat 1st class cars cost 7140 pounds, 2nd class 56 seat carriages, 5920 pounds [...] ) In 1967 the new train was vigorously promoted by Minister of Railways, J.B. Gordon, on the grounds it would deliver a clear return, on its purchase cost and operation. Ironically most equivalent overseas services ceased that year and following US Mail ending its use of almost all US rail passenger services for 1st class mail, in Sept 1967, Santa Fe applied to ICC to withdraw 33 out of 39 of its long distance expresses. That is, all but the LA-Chicago Super Chief and its Frisco connection, the Texas Chief (Chicago-Houston), its Dallas connection and 2 LA San Diego locals. Nevertheless approval for NZR to release [...] tenders for the new train were belatedly made on 19 November 1968. The Silver Star service broke new ground in New Zealand by providing a full on-board crew of car stewards (sourced from the inter-island rail ferry service) who doubled as dining car staff at meal times. A great deal of study had been made of on train meal provision, particularly of German and British Rail. The high wage and other industrial demands of the ferry stewards used, were {{one of the reasons the}} service failed. [...] However, the product was effectively ten years too late. Travel by National Airways Corporation 737 took just over one hour; the Silver Star, by contrast, took around 12 hours and 30 minutes. Due to the freeze on rail fare and charges imposed by the Kirk Labour Government, which effectively meant the overnight price from Wellington to Auckland was held at $18 from late 1971 to early 1976, use of the train was high in 1974-5 and 1975-6. In the late 1970s the usual overnight patronage was only about 65 on most runs and only half the carriage stock was used for most of the year except during a few airline strikes.|$|R
6000|$|To {{the river}} Willems turned his eyes like a captive that looks fixedly {{at the door}} of his cell. If there was any hope in the world it would come from the river, by the river. For hours {{together}} he would stand in sunlight while the sea breeze sweeping over the lonely reach fluttered his ragged garments; the keen salt breeze that made him shiver now and then under the flood of intense heat. He looked at the brown and sparkling solitude of the flowing water, of the water flowing ceaseless and free in a soft, cool murmur of ripples at his feet. The world seemed to end there. The forests of the other bank appeared unattainable, enigmatical, for ever beyond reach like the stars of heaven--and as indifferent. Above and below, the forests on his side of the river came down to the water in a serried multitude of tall, immense trees towering in a great spread of twisted boughs above the thick undergrowth; great, solid trees, looking sombre, severe, and malevolently stolid, like a giant crowd of pitiless enemies pressing round silently to witness his slow agony. He was alone, small, crushed. He thought of escape--of something to be done. What? A raft! He imagined himself working at it, feverishly, desperately; cutting down trees, fastening the logs together and then drifting down with the current, down to the sea into the straits. There were ships there--ships, help, white men. Men like himself. Good men who would rescue him, take him away, take him far away where there was trade, and houses, and other men that could understand him exactly, appreciate his capabilities; where there was proper food, and money; where there were <b>beds,</b> knives, forks, <b>carriages,</b> brass bands, cool drinks, churches with well-dressed people praying in them. He would pray also. The superior land of refined delights where he could sit on a chair, eat his tiffin off a white tablecloth, nod to fellows--good fellows; he would be popular; always was--where he could be virtuous, correct, do business, draw a salary, smoke cigars, buy things in shops--have boots [...] . be happy, free, become rich. O God! What was wanted? Cut down a few trees. No! One would do. They used to make canoes by burning out a tree trunk, he had heard. Yes! One would do. One tree to cut down [...] . He rushed forward, and suddenly stood still as if rooted in the ground. He had a pocket-knife.|$|R
