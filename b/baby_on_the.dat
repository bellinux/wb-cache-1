5|$|Early {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Lucic {{recorded}} his first career NHL hat-trick and added an assist in a 5–4 win against the Atlanta Thrashers on October 25, 2008. Later that week, Lucic made a much-publicized {{return to his}} hometown {{in a game against}} the Vancouver Canucks, which featured a picture of him as a <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back page of Vancouver's The Province newspaper. Earlier in the year, Lucic's 2007 Memorial Cup ring had been stolen from his home in East Vancouver on July 10, 2008. In a private ceremony before the game against the Canucks, he was presented a replacement ring by Vancouver Giants ownership.|$|E
5|$|Quinn and Finn go {{together}} for her ultrasound appointment, and {{they learn that}} she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Dallaire {{was born}} in Denekamp, Netherlands, to Staff-Sergeant Roméo Louis Dallaire, a non-commissioned officer in the Canadian Army, and Catherine Vermaessen, a Dutch nurse.

25|$|Steven Disario was {{the chief}} of the {{part-time}} Kirkersville Police Department for three weeks, having gotten the job after its previous chief stepped down. He was also a sales worker for a home modeling company, and a father of six with a <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way.

25|$|In modern Eastern culture, the {{etiquette}} {{vary depending on}} the region. In West Asia, kissing on the lips between both men and women is a common form of greeting. In South and Eastern Asia, it might often be a greeting between women, however, between men, it is unusual. Kissing a <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cheeks is a common form of affection. Most kisses between men and women are on the cheeks and not on the lips unless they are romantically involved. And sexual forms of kissing between lovers encompass the whole range of global practices.|$|E

25|$|Zephyrettes {{played a}} variety of {{different}} roles, from hostess and tour guide to first aid responder and babysitter, giving attention to all passengers, often with an emphasis on the handicapped, elderly, and children. Sometimes what was required of them was as simple as providing directions; Smith joked that if she had written a memoir about her experiences as a Zephyrette, she would have entitled it Which Way is the Diner?, noting that was a frequent question even in the Dome-Observation car (the last car on the train). Other times it was much more difficult; in 1955, Zephyrette Helen Schwartz, with the assistance of porter Roosevelt Williams and two female passengers, successfully delivered a <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train outside of Grand Junction, Colorado. That child, Peter Zars, would return to the California Zephyr to celebrate his seventh birthday, again with the assistance of a Zephyrette. Due to the train's prestige, famous passengers were quite common, and Zephyrettes interacted with them directly, from Bernard Baruch and Pierre Monteux to Mamie Eisenhower and professional baseball players.|$|E

25|$|Hulsker {{called the}} signed drawing The Public Soup Kitchen (F1020a below) {{important}} and attractive. Van Gogh and his contemporary George Hendrik Breitner had sketched {{together at a}} soup kitchen in the Geest (it is not known which of the several possibilities it was). After going to the trouble and expense of installing shutters in his windows to adjust the light and to recreate the scene itself in his studio, van Gogh was able to study his models at leisure. In this way {{he was able to}} introduce more chiaroscuro (light and dark) in his drawing, which he executed with the natural ('mountain') chalk that Theo had sent him and whose properties he lauds in his letters. All the models are from Sien's family: her mother and <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, her sister, back turned, and her daughter, hair cropped as a precaution against lice, in the center, with Sien herself, superbly executed in profile, on the right. The watercolor F1020b (below) is much less successful as van Gogh himself acknowledged, blaming the paper in part for not being right for the job.|$|E
25|$|Images of {{children}} {{on the path to}} destruction also litter the scene: aside from the dead <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spike and the child falling to its death, a baby is quieted by its mother with a cup of gin, and in the background of the scene an orphaned infant bawls naked on the floor as the body of its mother is loaded into a coffin on orders of the beadle. Two young girls who are wards of the parish of St Giles—indicated by the badge on the arm of one of the girls—each take a glass. Hogarth also chose the slum of St Giles as setting for the first scene of The Four Stages of Cruelty, which he issued almost simultaneously with Beer Street and Gin Lane. Tom Nero, the central character of the Cruelty series wears an identical arm badge. In front of the pawnbroker's door a starving boy and a dog fight over a bone, while next to them a girl has fallen asleep; approaching her is a snail, emblematic of the sin of sloth.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|E
50|$|The {{film has}} the {{distinction}} of being the first full-length feature to use computer-generated imagery for the synthesis of human visual speech. 2D warping techniques were used to digitally animate the mouth viseme shapes of the babies which were originally shot with their mouths closed.

500|$|The {{committee}} {{refused to}} allow Blær Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdóttir (born in 1997) to be registered under the name given {{to her as a}} <b>baby,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that the masculine noun Blær ("gentle breeze" [...] in Icelandic) could be used only as a man's name. [...] Blær—identified in official records as Stúlka ("girl" [...] in Icelandic)—and her mother, Björk Eiðsdóttir, challenged the committee's decision in court, arguing that Blær had been used by Nobel Prize–winning Icelandic author Halldór Laxness as the name of a female character in his 1957 novel The Fish Can Sing (Brekkukotsannáll). [...] One other woman in Iceland was already registered at the time with the name Blær, and two declensions (sets of case forms)—one masculine and one feminine—exist for the name.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{gripping}} {{news story}} of the pre-Code era was the kidnapping of the Lindbergh <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening of 1 March 1932. As the child was already enormously famous before the kidnapping, the event created a media circus, with news coverage more intense than anything since World War I. Newsreels featuring family photos of the child (the first time private pictures had been [...] "conscripted for public service") asked spectators to report any sight of him. On May 12, 1932, the child's body was found less than five miles from the Lindbergh home. Although newsreels covered the most important topics of the day, they also presented human-interest stories (such as the immensely popular coverage of the Dionne quintuplets) and entertainment news, at times in greater detail than more pressing political and social matters.|$|E
500|$|In 1865–66, Gilbert {{collaborated with}} Charles Millward on several pantomimes, {{including}} one called Hush-a-Bye, <b>Baby,</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Tree Top, or, Harlequin Fortunia, King Frog of Frog Island, and the Magic Toys of Lowther Arcade (1866). Gilbert's first solo success came {{a few days}} after Hush-a-Bye Baby premiered. His friend and mentor, Tom Robertson, was asked to write a pantomime but did not think he could do it in the two weeks available, and so he recommended Gilbert instead. Written and rushed to the stage in 10 days, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack, a burlesque of Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, proved extremely popular. This led to a long series of further Gilbert opera burlesques, pantomimes and farces, full of awful puns (traditional in burlesques of the period), though showing, at times, signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of Gilbert's work. For instance: ...|$|E
500|$|Hayward is {{credited}} with putting his naval career [...] "on the line" [...] by bringing the <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship, which was against regulations, and he subsequently received orders to get the baby off the ship. However, having a baby on board boosted sailors' morale, and Hayward later said that a leader must [...] "know when to intelligently disregard regulations." [...] A visa was obtained by intervention of Richard Nixon's staffers, and a passport was secured by winning a poker game against the South Korean who issued passports. The baby, adopted by Navy surgeon Hugh Keenan, who was also in port at Inchon, was later named Daniel, and was transferred to a civilian ship in Japan. Daniel Keenan was raised in Seattle and began attending reunions of {{the crew of the}} Point Cruz in 1993. The story of Daniel Keenan was made into a television movie, A Thousand Men and a Baby, which aired on CBS in 1997.|$|E
