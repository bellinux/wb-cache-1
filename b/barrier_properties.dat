Nanocelluloses are expected to enhance the fiber-fiber bond strength and, hence, have a strong reinforcement effect on paper materials. Nanocellulose may be useful as a barrier in grease-proof type of papers and as a wet-end additive to enhance retention, dry and wet strength in commodity type of paper and board products. It has been shown that applying CNF as a coating material on the surface of paper and paperboard improves the <b>barrier</b> <b>properties,</b> especially air resistance.

40|$|We have {{successfully}} obtained surfactant-free latexes from anhydride-containing polymers, including poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PSMA), maleinized polybutadiene (PBDMA), and poly(octadecene-alt-maleic anhydride) (POMA). Here we report <b>barrier</b> and adhesion <b>properties</b> of the coatings made from these surfactant-free latexes, which were crosslinked with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH). The <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of these coatings was studied with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in NaCl solutions on pretreated aluminum substrates. PSMA and PBDMA-based coatings demonstrated good <b>barrier</b> <b>property,</b> {{indicated by the}} absence of corrosion after 1 -month immersion in NaCl solutions, which was comparable to that of a commercially available polyester coating. The polyester coating, however, was found to hydrolytically degrade when immersed in a NaCl solution, which was not observed for our latex-based coatings. The POMA-based coating showed inferior <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> on un-pretreated aluminum, likely due to inhomogeneous film formation and poor adhesion to the substrate, but the adhesion could be improved by an alkali pretreatment of the substrate. In comparison, PBDMA and PSMA-based coatings showed much better adhesion toward the aluminum substrates. The anti-corrosion behavior appeared to be closely related to both the <b>barrier</b> and adhesion <b>properties</b> of the coatings on the metal substrate. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|In semi-{{crystalline}} polymers, the crystalline {{regions are}} considered to be gas impermeable. Due to relatively high crystallinity, in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), {{it has been suggested that}} nanocellulose might act as a barrier material. Although the number of reported oxygen permeability values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> to nanocellulose films. One study reported an oxygen permeability of 0.0006 (cm3µm)/(m2daykPa) for a ca. 5µm thin nanocellulose film at 23°C and 0% RH. In a related study, a more than 700-fold decrease in oxygen permeability of a polylactide (PLA) film when a nanocellulose layer was added to the PLA surface was reported.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its <b>barrier</b> <b>properties).</b> Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E
25|$|A decade later, Davson and Danielli {{proposed}} a modification to this concept. In their model, the lipid bilayer was coated {{on either side}} {{with a layer of}} globular proteins. According to their view, this protein coat had no particular structure and was simply formed by adsorption from solution. Their theory was also incorrect in that it ascribed the <b>barrier</b> <b>properties</b> of the membrane to electrostatic repulsion from the protein layer rather than the energetic cost of crossing the hydrophobic core. A more direct investigation of the membrane was made possible through the use of electron microscopy in the late 1950s. After staining with heavy metal labels, Sjöstrand et al. noted two thin dark bands separated by a light region, which they incorrectly interpreted as a single molecular layer of protein. A more accurate interpretation was made by J. David Robertson, who determined that the dark electron-dense bands were the headgroups and associated proteins of two apposed lipid monolayers. In this body of work, Robertson put forward the concept of the “unit membrane.” This {{was the first time the}} bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes.|$|E
30|$|For water {{activity}} (Fig. 1 b), fried shrimp cracker {{covered with}} EF showed lower water activity than those covered with GF during 3 – 9  days of storage (p <  0.05). Initial water activity of fried crackers was 0.22. Much lower water activity {{was also found}} in sample packaged with nylon/LLDPE film throughout the 15  days of storage (p <  0.05). The result indicated that water vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film was {{lower than that of}} nylon/LLDPE film. Generally, water vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film was poorer than that of other biopolymer films, especially for non-hydrophilic material or synthetic polymer, due to the hydrophilic nature of gelatin and hydrophilic plasticiser required for film preparation (Limpisophon et al. 2009). The increase in moisture content and water activity of fried shrimp cracker was due to the diffusion of water vapour from the surrounding atmosphere through the packaging material. Generally, the incorporation of hydrophobic substances such as oil improved the water vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film (Tongnuanchan et al. 2015). Therefore, the incorporation of palm oil could improve the water vapour <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of gelatin film, as evidenced by the lower moisture content and water activity of fried shrimp cracker during the storage. Amongst all samples, that stored in air (without film covering) had the higher moisture content and water activity. Therefore, films, either synthetic or gelatin films, were able to serve as the barrier against water vapour migration, in which the quality changes of cracker could be retarded.|$|R

2500|$|Barrier {{packaging}} {{can often}} help control or extend shelf life.

A theoretical model is proposed, featuring an infinitely long cylindrical PDMS pore model, free molecular flow and time-varying pore geometry during the deposition. There is only one unknown parameter in the model: the PDMS pore diameter. By fitting the numerical solutions of the theoretical model to the parylene depth profiling curves, the PDMS pore diameter is estimated to be ~ 6. 02 nm...|$|R

40|$|The gas <b>barrier</b> <b>property</b> of a {{silicon oxide}} (SiOx) film {{synthesized}} from plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} using the tetramethysilane (TMS) -oxygen gas mixture was modified by introducing ammonia gas in the glow discharge. The change in the glow discharge with the ammonia gas incorporation was monitored by an optical emission spectrometer (OES).

The introduced ammonia gas in the TMS-oxygen plasma resulted in emission lines dominated by the N 2 and CN species with {{the suppression of the}} OH and oxygen-related radicals, thereby introducing nitrogen and carbon atoms in the deposited film. A silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) film had the best surface morphology and the lowest residual internal stress was achievable by controlling the reactant gas flow ratio of the ammonia and oxygen.

GFRP composite with epoxy/organoclay nanocomposite matrix has been fabricated in this study. The {{main purpose of}} our work is to investigate the effect of epoxy/organoclay nanocomposite matrix on durability improvement of GFRP composites. GFRP composite laminates with neat epoxy matrix or 3 wt% epoxy/organoclay nanocomposite matrix are conditioned in the following environments: (i) standard laboratory condition; (ii) heating for 1 h at 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C; (iii) immersion in alkaline solution at 60 °C. After pre-determined periods of conditioning, aged specimens are tested in uniaxial tension to obtain the tensile strength, tensile modulus and failure strain of GFRP composites. Results show that the tensile strength of aged GFRP composites is reduced to different degrees for different environmental exposure condition. However, the degradation rate is reduced when epoxy/organoclay nanocomposite is used as GFRP matrix.
