40|$|Failure of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> by S- and V- induced hot {{corrosion}} {{has been quite}} a common phenomenon in boilers burning heavy oil like Bunker C. The phenomenon is usually noted on fire side of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> Due to presence of sulfur in the combustion gases at high temperature, Ni, Cr, Fe or Al present in the <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> material undergo sulfidation {{which resulted in the}} formation of sulfide/sulfate. Vanadium compounds present in the combustion gases undergo fluxing reaction with oxide and/or sulfate scales on metal causing accelerated corrosion. The accelerated corrosion can cause pitting, cracking, fissure or rupture of the tubes.

40|$|Abstract: This mini-dissertation {{investigates the}} impact that Long Term Overheating and Creep (LTOC) has on coal fired power {{stations}} and the availability implications thereof. The need for the investigation arose from a single coal fired power station, with multiple boilers with a total generating capacity of greater than 400 MW, of which LTOC is the dominant <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure mechanism. For {{the purposes of the}} mini-dissertation, the power station was simply titled Power Station X. A summary is provided of the various <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure mechanisms as well as a brief description of availability. The mini-dissertation makes use of case studies in researching the matter of LTOC. It was seen that LTOC is a global matter, which is typically seen in ageing power stations. The major discussion points arising from the mini-dissertation is that of a <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure management program as well as correctly understanding the causes of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. With an adequate and correctly functioning <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failure management program one can reduce and manage the occurrence of <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. The second major discussion point arising from the mini-dissertation is that of correctly understanding the contributing factors to <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the actual mechanisms and identification of failures, however the contributing factors and root cause has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally one also has to identify the various areas prone to creep and the necessary remedial and mitigating actions for the removal and or replacement of such components, while keeping in mind the financial implication thereof. The mini-dissertation concludes with possible areas of future research as well as possible remedial actions that can be taken. M. Ing. (Engineering Management...|$|R

40|$|The <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{operated}} continuously at {{high temperature}} and pressure. Hence at high pressure for forces {{acting on the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> will be high. This research paper focuses on the analysis {{of one of the}} long term effect of continued application of high pressure on <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> which causes creeping. By utilizing finite element modelling software, AUTODESK INVENTOR the effect of pressure with the increase in temperature distribution across the steam generator tube was evaluated. The increase of heat transfer rate across the wall caused the oxide scale thickness to grow more rapidly than normal condition. The thermal conductivity in the <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes,</b> life of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> and creep damage is also analyzed in this research paper. The AUTODESK INVENTOR result is analyzed to determine the main and interactive effects of operating conditions.

Every occurrence of ruptured tubes leads to emergency shutdown {{of the entire}} plant. This paper describes the joint international effort to develop faster and more efficient methods for condition assessment and remaining life prediction for <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> The work was performed under the grant from Kazakhstan Ministry of Education and Science. The authors have visited a number of coal-fired electric plants throughout Central Asia and found {{that a combination of}} wall thinning and overheating were major damage mechanisms contributing to <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> failures. The periodic inspection of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> include ultrasonic measurement of remaining wall thickness and in many cases, it involves <b>cutting</b> <b>tube</b> segments and performing metallurgical analysis for loss of original strength due to overheating. Systematic research was undertaken with the objective to correlate the results of combined non-destructive testing (NDT) with condition assessment of <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> The evaluation included non-contact wall thickness measurement with EMAT technology plus internal oxide layer measurement with specialized ultrasonics. The first method shows the remaining tube wall thickness, thus allowing to calculate total stress, and the latter one has the potential to indirectly characterize microstructure degradation, which up to now could only be determined by destructive analysis. The existing tube removal criteria are treating each damage mechanism separately while in reality, a combined effect of wall thinning and the “degree of overheating” decides about true condition of a tube. The procedure that utilizes the results of both described NDT methods was developed for improved methodology to assess tube condition and to predict its remaining life...|$|R

It is {{developed}} as {{the second of the}} three major historical types of boilers which are low-pressure tank, fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> and high-pressure water <b>tube</b> <b>boiler.</b> Sometimes fired <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> is called as a smoke <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> or shell <b>boiler.</b> A fired <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> is use for production of steam. The efficiency of steam production {{is directly related to the}} temperature, residence time of water flow and the water turbulence inside the fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler.</b> With the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this study presents the effort performed in modelling work on the water turbulence using design of fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> without baffles and fire <b>tube</b> <b>boiler</b> with baffles.

40|$|The {{failures}} of superheater and reheater <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> {{operating in a}} power plant utilizing natural gas or mazut as a fuel have been analysed and the fire-side corrosion has been suggested as {{the main reason for}} the failure in <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> The tubes have been provided by a fossil fuel power plant in Iran and optical and electron microscopy investigations have been performed on the tubes as well as the corrosion products on their surfaces. The results showed that the thickness of the failed tubes is not uniform which suggests that fire-side corrosion has happened on the tubes. Fire-side corrosion is caused by the reaction of combustion products with oxide layers on the tube surface resulting in metal loss and consequently tubes fracture. However, the tubes corrosion behaviour did not follow the conventional models of the fire-side corrosion. Given that, using the corrosion monitoring techniques for these <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> seems essential. As a result, the thickness of the <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> {{in different parts of the}} boiler has been recorded and critical points are selected accordingly. Such critical points are selected for installation of corrosion monitoring probes...|$|R
