25|$|For Air New Zealand, {{purchasing}} TNT's half of Ansett {{represented a}} way to <b>buy</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rich Australian domestic market. The deal had been under discussion with both of Ansett's owners since October 1994, and required some complex manoeuvring to meet regulatory requirements {{on both sides of}} the Tasman, including the sale of Ansett New Zealand, Air New Zealand's only significant home market competitor (to News Limited) to satisfy New Zealand Commerce Commission requirements, and the sale of 51% of Ansett International (to a consortium of Australian institutional investors) to satisfy Australian Foreign Investment Review Board requirements that, if not met, would have meant the loss of Ansett International's bilateral air service agreement rights. The terms of the agreement saw Air New Zealand pay A$475 million for half of Ansett, including a A$150 million capital injection, and the transaction was completed on 1 October 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{city had}} one of the first municipally owned {{streetcar}} systems. The Department of Street Railways had taken over in 1922 since when it had been run by a three-man Detroit Street Railways Commission appointed by the mayor of Detroit. On June 14, 1930, the DSR launched a trolleybus route along Plymouth Road but the route had seen little use by 1936 due to the Great Depression and was discontinued on August 11, 1937. By 1934 the general manager, Fred A. Nolan, said that he wanted to convert the Detroit streetcar system to all buses operation by 1953 and the last streetcar actually ran in 1956. It remained in public ownership until 1974. Some sources claim that the Detroit streetcar system was purchased and dismantled by National City Lines as part of the 'Great American streetcar scandal', however, {{this was not the case}} as the company could not <b>buy</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> public system and lack of use of the streetcar system has to be explained by other reasons.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the season, Cliff had J.R. {{facing a}} {{financial}} mess, when J.R.'s plan to blackmail the Farlows into handing over John Ross, by stockpiling 5 {{million barrels of}} the Farlows' crude oil, backfired on J.R., when the market {{price of crude oil}} started to fall and fall. In order to stockpile the Farlows' crude oil, J.R. had taken out a $200,000,000 loan and used $50,000,000 worth of Ewing Oil assets as collateral. Cliff, along with Jordan Lee, Andy Bradley and Wade Luce, then worked with Vaughn Leland in order to <b>buy</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> notes owed by J.R., and they planned to foreclose. With Cliff seemingly putting one over on J.R., Miss Ellie bailed Ewing Oil out of this mess by agreeing to a deal with Clayton that Clayton would pay the price that he would have paid {{at the time that the}} oil was stockpiled. By the season's end, J.R. and Cliff's situations had turned sharply in the opposite direction, as Sue Ellen, with whom Cliff had had an off-and-on relationship, decided to return to J.R., planning to marry him again. In addition, J.R. had set a trap for Cliff by making sure that a fake geological report would convince Cliff to invest millions of dollars in buying property on supposedly oil rich land which was actually bone dry. Cliff was then fired by his mother from running Wentworth Tool & Die, due to Cliff's embezzlement of company funds. Cliff attempts suicide with an overdose of pills, and a guilt-ridden Sue Ellen rushes to his bedside as Cliff lies in a coma. J.R. tries to convince Sue Ellen that it was not anybody's fault but Cliff's for what happened, but Sue Ellen disagrees and says she does not know if she can remarry J.R. if Cliff dies. Cliff's life hangs in the balance as the season ends.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Carnegie {{decided to}} stop relying solely on his company's own {{furnaces}} for coke, and began seeking to buy the fuel on the open market. Thomas and Henry Phipps had alerted Andrew {{to the need for}} a greater and steadier supply for coke for the growing steel works. In 1881, Andrew sent Thomas to meet with Henry Clay Frick, owner of H.C. Frick & Co.—the largest coke producing company in the U.S. Thomas' goal was to induce Frick to buy the Carnegie coke ovens. In November 1881, Thomas proposed selling the Monastery Coke Works near Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to Frick, or at least have Frick take over the marketing and selling of the coke produced there. Thomas' offer came as Frick was planning his wedding, and it fell to Andrew to meet with Frick and his new bride as they honeymooned in New York City. By this time, Thomas had negotiated most of an agreement with Frick, as well as planned the meeting with Andrew. Carnegie took a 10 percent interest in H.C. Frick & Co., Frick took a 50 percent interest in the Monastery coke works, and H.C. Frick & Co. would become the exclusive supplier of coke to Carnegie Bros. & Co. and the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. Thomas was assigned to negotiate the price of coke on an annual basis with Frick, and {{over the next two years}} H.C. Frick & Co. made a 23 percent profit on the coke sold. By 1885, Andrew Carnegie had purchased enough stock in H.C. Frick & Co. to own 50 percent of the company. Frick now attempted to <b>buy</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Carnegie steel companies by selling 12 of the remaining 16 percent of the H.C. Frick which he still owned, but Thomas warned him not to try and to instead seek a position as a manager within the company.|$|E

He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and wondered why he had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. Rob then sent a visiting order to Robert. He told him about Tracy wanting to start a new relationship with him. Robert was disgusted and stormed out. He then split up with Tracy. Rob reveals to Tracy that everything was a lie and that he still hated her. Johnny reveals all to a disgusted Carla. Carla is furious, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell Aidan and Kate. Carla Sleeps with Robert. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell Nick. Carla continues to threaten to tell Johnny's children the truth unless he moves away, which he does not. Carla reveals that she is their half-sister to Kate and Aidan, who are distraught. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their affair to Nick if she does not let him <b>buy</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit under wraps. She also begins bonding with Kate. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, but changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the bistro to confront him. Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend, Lee, burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the car drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious. She survived and Tracy pressures her to persuade Nick to sell the Bistro. He eventually sells to Robert, and Carla and Nick make plans to move to Devon.|$|E
