5|$|Disraeli's first premiership was {{dominated}} by the heated debate over the Church of Ireland. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with Archbishop Manning {{the establishment of a}} Roman Catholic university in Dublin foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the Liberals under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.|$|E

The status of the Faroese language in education was a significant issue for decades, until it was accepted as a language of instruction in 1938.

A total of 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages. Of the remaining children, 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.

5|$|The {{denomination}} {{with the}} longest history of objection to Freemasonry is the Catholic Church. The objections raised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church {{are based on}} the allegation that Masonry teaches a naturalistic deistic religion which is in conflict with Church doctrine. A number of Papal pronouncements have been issued against Freemasonry. The first was Pope Clement XII's In eminenti apostolatus, 28 April 1738; the most recent was Pope Leo XIII's Ab apostolici, 15 October 1890. The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly declared that joining Freemasonry entailed automatic excommunication, and banned books favouring Freemasonry.|$|E

5|$|The {{unity of}} the Church had been {{restored}} only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor of Victor IV) abandoned his claims to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle.|$|E

The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.|$|E
5|$|As viewed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, Baptism is {{the first}} of three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
