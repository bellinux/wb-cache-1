40|$|One {{consequence}} of the increasingly transnational nature of civil litigation is that U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts</b> must frequently address the interests of foreign sovereigns. These interactions arise primarily in three contexts: when a foreign government is the defendant in a U. S. court; when a claim requires a U. <b>S.</b> <b>court</b> to scrutinize actions taken by a foreign government; and when a U. <b>S.</b> <b>court</b> seeks to apply U. S. law to persons or conduct within a foreign government’s borders. Each of these contexts invokes a narrative in which the engagement of U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts</b> interferes or conflicts with the prerogatives of a foreign sovereign. As a result, we typically consider the foreign relations implications of domestic adjudication within a paradigm that is oriented toward constraining the engagement of U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts</b> in matters involving foreign sovereign interests. What this approach ignores, however, is that foreign sovereigns are also plaintiffs in U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts.</b> A full account of the interactions between U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts</b> and foreign sovereigns must address cases in which foreign governments actively seek to engage U. S. judicial resources. This article sets out the first systematic analysis of claims filed in U. <b>S.</b> domestic <b>courts</b> by foreign sovereigns, drawing on an examination of almost 300 claims. It establishes a basic typology of such claims, and then uses three case studies to explore and challenge the paradigm outlined above. The final section of the article relies {{on the results of}} this examination to analyze developments in one particular context: the extraterritorial application of U. S. law. It argues that the narrative of “judicial imperialism” that has come to frame discussion in that area is neither accurate nor useful...|$|R

40|$|In late 2005 China {{adopted a}} largely rewritten Company Law that radically {{increased}} {{the role of}} courts. This study, based on a review of more than 1000 Company Law-related disputes reported between 1992 and 2008 and extensive interactions with PRC officials and sitting judges, evaluates how the Shanghai People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Court</b> system has fared over 15 years in corporate law adjudication. Although the Shanghai People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Courts</b> show generally increasing technical competence and even intimations of political independence, their path toward institutional autonomy is inconsistent. Through 2006, the Shanghai Court system demonstrated significantly increased autonomy. After 2006 and enactment of the new Company Law, a new, if partial, limitation on institutional autonomy {{seems to be at}} work, as the Shanghai People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Courts</b> refused to accept or adjudicate claims explicitly permitted in the revised 2006 statute but not yet elaborated in Supreme People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Court</b> Regulation. This reaction is perverse, as the same Courts had liberally adjudicated the same claims before 2006 without any statutory or Supreme People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Court</b> Regulatory authorization. That strange dynamic illustrates the bureaucratic embedding of the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Courts</b> in China 2 ̆ 7 s modified authoritarian system and how such entrenchment can divert or constrain the progressive autonomy won by the same Courts in the formal legal system. The conclusions have positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, there is significant momentum toward ever-increasing competence and autonomy of the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Courts</b> in Shanghai, at least for the application of corporate and commercial law. On the negative side, a familiar paradox may be at work: with formal substantive law and institutional 2 ̆ 2 modernization 2 ̆ 2 promised and even partially delivered alongside equally apparent failures in the exercise of judicial autonomy, the result may be to de-legitimize the very institutions offered by the state and ruling Party as twin pillars of 2 ̆ 2 modern 2 ̆ 2 governance and 2 ̆ 2 rule of law. 2 ̆...|$|R

40|$|This Article uses {{empirical}} {{analysis to}} provide {{a new understanding of}} transnational litigation in U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts.</b> According to conventional wisdom, the United States has a forum shopping system with two features that encourage plaintiffs to file claims in U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts,</b> even when those claims involve foreign parties or foreign activity: a permissive approach to personal jurisdiction, giving plaintiffs broad court access, and a strong tendency of U. S. judges to apply plaintiff-favoring domestic law. This forum shopping system purportedly contributes to a rising tide of transnational litigation in the United States. Scholars and interest groups have therefore proposed new anti-forum shopping measures aimed at curtailing transnational litigation in U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts.</b> This Article shows that the forum shopping system has evolved and that it no longer encourages plaintiffs to pursue transnational claims in U. <b>S.</b> <b>courts</b> to the extent it supposedly once did. It also presents empirical evidence that transnational litigation in the United States may have actually decreased, not increased, over the last two decades. The analysis suggests that new anti-forum shopping measures may not be as urgent or necessary as their advocates claim. If adopted, such measures could unduly limit access to justice for both American and foreign citizens who, in our era of globalization, are increasingly affected by transnational activity...|$|R

40|$|On June 4, 2015, in Yale-New Haven Hospital v.

This Comment argues that the Second Circuit’s interpretation of ERISA is correct.
