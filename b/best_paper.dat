The complete 2015 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics has been searched in PubMed and Web of Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 14 candidate <b>best</b> <b>papers.</b> These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to allow the editorial team an enlightened selection of the <b>best</b> <b>papers.</b> Among the 1, 272 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, three were finally selected as <b>best</b> <b>papers.</b> The first one presents a language agnostic approach for epidemic event detection in news articles. The second paper describes a system using big health data gathered by a statewide system to forecast emergency department visits. The last paper proposes a rather original approach that uses machine learning to solve the old issue of outbreak detection and prediction. The increasing availability of data, now directly from health systems, will probably lead to a boom in public health surveillance systems and in large-scale epidemiologic studies...|$|R

500|$|Later {{opinions}} {{have been}} divided. In a 1988 article, art and photography historian Ellen Handy described A. Farsari & Co. as having become [...] "well-known for issuing albums of landscape views in great quantity, but {{without regard for}} print quality and delicacy of hand-colouring". Terry Bennett, a specialist in the early photography of Asia, refers to Farsari's work as [...] "inconsistent and lacking the quality found in the photography of Beato, Stillfried or Kusakabe." [...] But Bennett also notes that Farsari employed excellent artists, used the <b>best</b> <b>paper</b> and produced some [...] "stunningly coloured photographs". For historian Sebastian Dobson, the artistic and historical significance {{of the work of}} Farsari (and other Yokohama photographers of his era, particularly Kusakabe and Tamamura) is rightly undergoing re-evaluation after many years in which it was dismissed as tourist kitsch and [...] "perceived by some as pandering to nineteenth-century Western notions of exoticism". Farsari's photographs and albums are included in numerous museums and private collections around the world, and a selection of his works was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Wooden {{boards are}} sized {{to the paper}} being made. They are rubbed with soap so that the fibers do not stick. The fibers are {{arranged}} on wooden boards and beaten together into a thin flat mass. The <b>best</b> <b>paper</b> is made with long fibers arranged in a grid pattern to fit the board. Lesser quality paper is made from short masses arranged more haphazardly, but still beaten to the same effect. This maceration process liberates soluble carbohydrates {{that are in the}} cavities of the cell fibers and act as a kind of glue. The Ficus tree bark contains a high quantity of this substance allowing to make for firm [...] but flexible paper. During the process, the stones are kept moist to keep the paper from sticking to it. The finished flat mass is then usually smoothed over with rounded orange peels. If there are any gaps after the maceration process, these are usually filled in by gluing small pieces of paper.|$|E
