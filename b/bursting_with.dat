40|$|Fused silica surface {{structuring}} {{has been}} performed using temporally shaped femtosecond laser pulses. For this purpose we have designed pulse <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> a triangular intensity envelope and different slope sign and interpulse separation that were experimentally generated using a home-made temporal pulse shaper. We {{have found that}} pulse <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> decreasing intensity envelopes are remarkably more efficient in terms of surface ablation than <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> increasing intensity envelopes. The results reveal that laser energy coupling in the material is enhanced as the interpulse spacing decreases.

The expulsion of the Turks, who had occupied much of the Balkans for 500 years, seemed to fill Bojić with optimism about the future.

[...] Among Richardson's other parts in his first Old Vic season, Enobarbus in Antony and Cleopatra gained particularly good notices. The Morning Post commented that it placed him in the first rank of Shakespearean actors.

40|$|We {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} total energy emitted by gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> for <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> fluences and distance information. Our core sample consists of eight <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> BATSE spectra and spectroscopic redshifts. We extend this sample by adding four <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> BATSE spectra and host galaxy R magnitudes. From these R magnitudes we calculate a redshift probability distribution; this method requires {{a model of the}} host galaxy population. From a sample of ten <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> both spectroscopic redshifts and host galaxy R magnitudes (some do not have BATSE spectra) we find that the burst rate is proportional to the galaxy luminosity at the epoch of the burst. Assuming that the total energy emitted has a log-normal distribution, we find that the average emitted energy (assumed to be radiated isotropically) is = 1. 3 ^+ 1. 2 _- 1. 0 × 10 ^ 53 ergs (for H_ 0 = 65 km s^- 1 Mpc^- 1, Ω_m= 0. 3 and Ω_Λ= 0. 7); the distribution has a logarithmic width of σ_γ= 1. 7 ^+ 0. 7 _- 0. 3. The corresponding distribution of X-ray afterglow energy (for seven bursts) has = 4. 0 ^+ 1. 6 _- 1. 8 × 10 ^ 51 ergs and σ_X = 1. 3 ^+ 0. 4 _- 0. 3. For completeness, we also provide spectral fits for all <b>bursts</b> <b>with</b> BATSE spectra for which there were afterglow searches. Comment: Submitted to Ap...|$|R
