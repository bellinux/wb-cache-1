5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a God that answers prayers, and <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E
