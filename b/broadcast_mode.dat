5000|$|WINMOR is a radio {{transmission}} protocol {{intended to be}} used in the Winlink 2000 Global Radio E-mail System by amateur radio operators, marine radio stations, and radio stations in isolated areas. [...] WINMOR will complement the PACTOR modes in the high frequency portion of the Winlink system. WINMOR debuted at the 2008 ARRL / TAPR Digital Communications Conference. Unlike PACTOR II & III, only a simple computer soundcard-to-radio interface is required, as compared to PACTOR's relatively expensive external terminal node controller. It has two modes, either 500 or 1600 Hertz in bandwidth, and provides ARQ speeds ranging from 67 to at least 1300 bits per second, similar to PACTOR's various modes. It is fully documented and without restrictions or license issues preventing anyone from using the protocol in other software. WINMOR supports both connected (ARQ) and FEC (<b>broadcast)</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R

The reason of this growth {{is related to the}} increasing popularity of linear services such as mobile TV, live and sports events, which may lead to the delivery of the same contents to a large audience. Recent studies have shown that network cooperation is a promising candidate to deal with such an issue. This paper investigates, from a planning perspective, the optimization of a hybrid unicast/broadcast network for linear services. We introduce an analytical approach with the aim of stating an optimization problem on the hybrid network configuration, namely in terms of the sharing between the unicast and <b>broadcast</b> <b>modes</b> to deliver a particular service. We show by simulation the existence of an optimal operation point which leads to the maximization of the overall throughput of the hybrid network under the constraint of a minimum service success rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{autonomy of}} Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) has enabled {{a great many}} large-scale unguided missions, such as agricultural planning, conservation and similar surveying tasks. Commercial and military institutions have expressed great interest in such ventures, raising the question of security as the application of such systems in potentially hostile environments. Preventing theft, disruption or destruction of such MANETs through cyber-attacks has become a focus for many researchers as a result. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) {{have been shown to}} enhance the security of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). VPNs do not normally support broadcast communication, reducing their effectiveness in high-traffic MANETs which have many broadcast communication requirements. To support routing, broadcast updates and efficient MANET communication a Virtual Closed Network (VCN) architecture is proposed. By supporting private, secure communication in unicast, multicast and <b>broadcast</b> <b>modes,</b> VCNs provide an efficient alternative to VPNs when securing MANETs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Incentive-based Sharing (iShare) protocol that blends cellular and ad hoc networks for content dissemination services. With iShare, mobile users download content {{from a source}} via cellular links {{and at the same}} time form a mesh ad hoc network for peer-to-peer exchange of content data. The mesh remains robust to network dynamics, minimizes ad hoc communication overhead, and parallelizes the downloading process among mesh members. In order to counter selfish behavior, we apply an efficient and practical "tit-for-tat" incentive mechanism, which exploits proximity and mutual content interest of mobile users. This mechanism becomes particularly effective in the case of network dynamics since we utilize promiscuous and <b>broadcast</b> <b>modes</b> of the ad hoc channel. As a result, our protocol effectively helps to free resources in the cellular network and accelerates the content download for its users. Furthermore, it enables users to continuously obtain data via ad hoc connections during cellular handoff periods and provides multi-homing downloads for groups spanning adjacent cells. We evaluate the performance of iShare by means of simulations and compare it to other content dissemination schemes using cellular broadcast channels, cellular unicast channels, and tree-based protocols. The obtained results show that iShare significantly outperforms alternative approaches and creates a win-win situation by improving performance of both iShare and other mobile users...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{commonly}} used system is called Selective Calling or Selcall. This also uses audio tones, {{but these are not}} restricted to sub-audio tones and are sent as a short burst in sequence. The receiver will be programmed to respond only to a unique set of tones in a precise sequence, and only then will it open the audio circuits for open-channel conversation with the base station. This system is much more versatile than CTCSS, as relatively few tones yield a far greater number of [...] "addresses". In addition, special features (such as <b>broadcast</b> <b>modes</b> and emergency overrides) can be designed in, using special addresses set aside for the purpose. A mobile unit can also broadcast a Selcall sequence with its unique address to the base, so the user can know before the call is picked up which unit is calling. In practice many selcall systems also have automatic transponding built in, which allows the base station to [...] "interrogate" [...] a mobile even if the operator is not present. Such transponding systems usually have a status code that the user can set to indicate what they are doing. Features like this, while very simple, are one reason why they are very popular with organisations that need to manage a large number of remote mobile units. Selcall is widely used, though is becoming superseded by much more sophisticated digital systems.|$|R
