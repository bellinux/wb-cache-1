5|$|The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, {{including}} the Emmy Award-winning children's series Time for Beany.

The network signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up {{on the idea of}} a television network, and continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the <b>broadcast</b> <b>network</b> field when the company and Chris-Craft Industries launched the United Paramount Network (UPN), a television network that operated until 2006.

By the end of the 1990s, both syndication distributors and <b>broadcast</b> <b>networks</b> ended up losing most of its children's market to the rise of cable television channels aimed at that audience such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, which provided appealing children's entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours.|$|R
