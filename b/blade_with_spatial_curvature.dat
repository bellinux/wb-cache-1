40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results of}} {{constraining}} the holographic dark energy model <b>with</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> and massive neutrinos, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo global fit technique. The cosmic observational data include the full WMAP 7 -yr temperature and polarization data, the type Ia supernova data from Union 2. 1 sample, the baryon acoustic oscillation data from SDSS DR 7 and WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey, and the latest measurements of H_ 0 from HST. To deal with the perturbations of dark energy, we adopt the parameterized post-Friedmann method. We find that, for the simplest holographic dark energy model without <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> and massive neutrinos, the phenomenological parameter c< 1 at more than 4 σ confidence level. The inclusion of <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> enlarges the error bars and leads to c< 1 only in about 2. 5 σ range; in contrast, the inclusion of massive neutrinos does not have significant influence on c. We also find that, for the holographic dark energy model <b>with</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> but without massive neutrinos, the 3 σ error bars of the current fractional curvature density Ω_k 0 are still in order of 10 ^- 2; for the model with massive neutrinos but without <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature,</b> the 2 σ upper bound of the total mass of neutrinos is ∑ m_ν < 0. 48 eV. Moreover, there exists clear degeneracy between <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> and massive neutrinos in the holographic dark energy model, which enlarges the upper bound of ∑ m_ν by more than 2 times. In addition, we demonstrate that, making use of the full WMAP data can give better constraints on the holographic dark energy model, compared with the case using the WMAP "distance priors".

40|$|Motivated by {{the cosmological}} {{constant}} and the coincidence problems, we consider a cosmological model where the dark sectors are interacting together through a phenomenological decay law ρ̇_Λ=Qρ_Λ^n in a FRW spacetime <b>with</b> <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature.</b> We {{show that the}} only value of n for which the late-time matter energy density to dark energy density ratio (r_m=ρ_m/ρ_Λ) is constant (which could provide an explanation to the coincidence problem) is n= 3 / 2. For each value of Q, there are two distinct solutions. One of them involves a <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> approaching zero at late times (ρ_k≈ 0) and is stable when the interaction is weaker than a critical value Q_ 0 =-√(32 π G/c^ 2). The other one allows for a non-negligible <b>spatial</b> <b>curvature</b> (ρ_k 0) at late times and is stable when the interaction is stronger than Q_ 0. We constrain the model parameters using various observational data (SNeIa, GRB, CMB, BAO, OHD).
