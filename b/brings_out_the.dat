5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E

A notable carving inside the cave is a sculpted panel which <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> myth of Krishna lifting the Govaradhan hill to protect the cow herds and gopis (milk maids) from heavy rains and floods, and also scenes of Krishna frolicking with the milk maids.|$|E
25|$|A {{geocomposite}} {{consists of}} a combination of geotextiles, geogrids, geonets and/or geomembranes in a factory fabricated unit. Also, any one of these four materials can be combined with another synthetic material (e.g., deformed plastic sheets or steel cables) or even with soil. As examples, a geonet or geospacer with geotextiles on both surfaces and a GCL consisting of a geotextile/bentonite/geotextile sandwich are both geocomposites. This specific category <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best creative efforts of the engineer and manufacturer. The application areas are numerous and constantly growing. The major functions encompass the entire range of functions listed for geosynthetics discussed previously: separation, reinforcement, filtration, drainage, and containment.|$|E

25|$|The English {{music critic}} John Steane, {{reviewing}} Simon Keenlyside's performance of this aria, wrote:Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it {{draws on the}} graceful French lyricism {{we know from the}} tenor solos in Mignon, adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.|$|E
25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words {{are as important as}} the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E

Zhdanov asks com. Dange to explain why the Congress managed to strengthen its authority.Comrade Dange opines that during the war the Congress, taking into account the anti-English sentiments of the wide masses, opposed the English and by this action acquired a semblance of a national organisation fighting for the national sovereignty.The Communist Party during the war supported the allies, including the English and by this action weakened its influence as a lot of people could not correctly understand the position of the Party. A considerable part of the supporters of the Communist Party during the war shifted to the Congress.|$|E

25|$|Photolithography {{involves}} {{exposing a}} light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is {{place between the}} light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the photoresist. Further development of the wafer <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> pattern in the photoresist. Photolithography performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale. However, because the lower limit for size {{is a function of}} the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features. In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of polyimide channels (11µm in height and 20–60µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography. Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient. There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.|$|E

500|$|Ammonia fuming is a wood {{finishing}} process that darkens wood and <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> grain pattern. [...] It consists of exposing the wood to fumes from a strong aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide which reacts with the tannins in the wood. [...] The process works best on white oak {{because of the}} high tannin content of this wood. [...] Fumed oak is also called smoked oak. [...] Other species may also be fumed but usually will not darken as much as white oak. [...] The introduction of the process is usually associated with the American furniture maker Gustav Stickley {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century, but fuming was certainly known in Europe some time before this.|$|E
