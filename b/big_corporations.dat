Progressives sought to reform corrupt political practices of the ruling Martin machine and to regulate railroads and <b>big</b> <b>corporations.</b> Martin delegates agreed to restrict suffrage of African-Americans and illiterate whites, and a State Corporation Commission was established. When the railroads challenged the State Corporation Commission's constitutionality on the grounds it violated separation of powers, the commission was upheld in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Downey {{announced}} that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the <b>big</b> <b>corporations</b> did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.|$|E

They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935–37. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had {{a negative impact on}} major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on <b>big</b> <b>corporations.</b> But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The CIO and AFL unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.|$|E

He became {{a partner in the}} legal firm of Snow, McCamant, and Bronaugh, {{replacing}} Wallace McCamantm who had just been appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court. When Thompson arrived in Portland, the firm was renamed Snow, Bronaugh, and Thompson. Later, when McCamant left the Supreme Court and returned to the practice, the firm was renamed McCamant, Bronaugh, and Thompson. Eventually, the firm became McCamant and Thompson. Over the years in Portland, Thompson handled many high-profile cases, becoming one of Oregon's most prominent trial attorneys. While many of his clients were <b>big</b> <b>corporations,</b> including Portland shipyards and steel companies and large lumber and natural resources companies throughout the Pacific Northwest, he also defended individuals facing criminal charges. For example, he defended a wealthy individual for violating Oregon's Prohibition law in 1918. A year later, he defended an individual against cattle rustling charges in eastern Oregon. On the civil side of the law, Thompson sued six residents of Toledo, Oregon, on behalf of Japanese labors employed by the Pacific Spruce Company, who were driven out of town by a mob of white residents. He also handled the probate for Bernard Daly's substantial estate, which was used to establish the Bernard Daly Educational Fund to provide college scholarships for Lake County students. In 1926, he was elected president of the Oregon State Bar Association.|$|E
