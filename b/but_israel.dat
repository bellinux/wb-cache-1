5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, <b>but</b> <b>Israel</b> had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra {{was founded}} in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and {{subsequently}} became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it {{became part of the}} independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate. On 10 June 1967, {{the last day of the}} Six-Day War, Quneitra came under Israeli control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, <b>but</b> <b>Israel</b> regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city's destruction, while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra. During the Syrian civil war, Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army. , it became controlled by the Syrian opposition.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} tribes {{of the kingdom}} of Judah, the tribe of Judah is entirely absent from the ancient Song of Deborah, rather than present but {{described}} as unwilling to assist in the battle between Israelites and their enemy.

The United Nations has not determined the final status of Shebaa Farms but has determined that Israel has complied with UNSC resolution 425.

25|$|Because {{the coastal}} plain of Judea and Samaria had few water resources, Theodor Herzl already envisioned the {{transfer}} {{of water from the}} Jordan River to the coast for irrigation and drinking water supply. In 1937 the national water company Mekorot was created, more than a decade before the creation of the state of Israel. Among its achievements was the Shiloach Pipeline along the Burma Road to Jerusalem built during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and a first pipeline to the Negev in 1955. Between 1953 and 1955 the United States Special Representative for Water in the Middle East, Eric Johnston, had negotiated the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan to jointly develop the water resources of the Jordan River Basin between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Johnston Plan was rejected by the Arab League, <b>but</b> <b>Israel</b> nevertheless abided by its water allocation under the plan. Mekorot began a Rain Enhancement program in 1961, increasing rainfall by 13–18%. A Brackish Water Pipeline to divert brackish ground water from the Sea of Galilee to the Lower Jordan was completed in 1965. The main water resources project at the time, however, was the transfer of water from the Sea of Galilee to the coast through the National Water Carrier in 1965. As a reaction to the construction of the pipeline, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan tried to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River. This was one of the events that increased tensions leading to the Six-Day War of 1967 during which Israel captured the West Bank and the Golan Heights.|$|E
500|$|In early 1986 the {{squadron}} introduced the AGM-142 Popeye into IAF service, and {{for nearly a}} decade was the only IAF squadron to operate the missile. In 1987 its Phantoms played the role of Soviet [...] "MiG-29s" [...] in the film [...] "Iron Eagle II". Filming coincided with the receipt of several birds from 105 Squadron, which appropriately appeared in the film bearing that unit's distinctive red flash on the fuselage (although the IAF markings were replaced with the Soviet red star insignia). The squadron trained extensively for possible participation in the 1990 Gulf War, <b>but</b> <b>Israel</b> eventually stayed out of that conflict. In June 1991 {{the squadron}} relocated to the air base at Hatzerim, from which it flew 79 sorties during Operation Accountability of April 1993. In the wake of the Oslo Accords the US finally agreed to supply the IAF with the F-15E Strike Eagle, and 69 Squadron was disbanded in early 1994 in expectation of its re-equipment with the new aircraft.|$|E

500|$|A donkey (or ass) and an ox {{typically}} {{appear in}} nativity scenes.
