40|$|To {{test the}} “traction fiber ” model for {{metaphase}} positioning of <b>bivalents</b> during meiosis, kinetochore fibers of maloriented <b>bivalents,</b> induced during recovery from cold arrest, were analyzed with a liquid crystal polarizing microscope. The measured birefringence retardation of kinetochore fibers {{is proportional to}} the number of microtubules in a fiber. Five of the 11 maloriented <b>bivalents</b> analyzed exhibited bipolar malorientations that had at least four times more kinetochore microtubules to one pole than to the other pole, and two had microtubules directed to only one pole. Yet all maloriented <b>bivalents</b> had positions at or near the spindle equator. The traction fiber model predicts such maloriented <b>bivalents</b> should be positioned closer to the pole with more kinetochore microtubules. A metaphase position at the spindle equator, according to the model, requires equal numbers of kinetochore microtubules to both poles. Data from polarizing microscope images were not in accord with those predictions, leading to the conclusion that other factors, in addition to traction forces, must be involved in metaphase positioning in crane-fly spermatocytes. Although the identity of additional factors has not been established, one possibility is that polar ejection forces operate to exert away-from-the-pole forces that could counteract pole-directed traction forces. Another is that kinetochores are “smart, ” meaning they embody a position-sensitive mechanism that controls their activity...|$|R

25|$|At the meiotic {{metaphase}} I, the cytoskeleton put the bivalents under tension by pulling each homolog in opposite direction (contrary to mitotic division where the forces are exerted on each chromatid).

Impressively, human female primary oocytes remains in this tension state for decades (from the establishment of the oocyte in metaphase I during embryonic development, to the ovulation event in adulthood that resume the meiotic division), highlighting the robustness of the chiasma and the cohesion that hold the bivalents together.|$|E
40|$|Longiflorum and Asiatic lilies of {{the genus}} Lilium of the family Liliaceae are two {{important}} groups of modem lily cultivars. One of {{the main trends of}} lily breeding is to realize introgression between these groups. With cut style pollination and embryo rescue, distant hybrids between the two groups have been obtained. However, the F- 1 hybrids are highly sterile or some of them could produce a small number of 2 n gametes, and their BC 1 progenies are usually triploids. Dutch lily breeders have selected many cultivars from these BC 1 progenies based on their variation. It is presumably suggested that such variation could be caused by intergenomic recombination and abnormal meiosis during gamete formation in F- 1 hybrids of Longiflorum, x Asiatic (LA) hybrids in Lilium. Therefore, the meiotic process of ten F- 1 LA hybrids was cytologically investigated using genomic in situ hybridization and traditional cytological methods in the present research. The results showed that: at metaphase I, the homoeologous chromosome pairing among different F- 1 hybrids ranged from 2. 0 to 11. 4 <b>bivalents</b> formed by homoeologous chromosomes per pollen mother cell (PMC), and very few multivalents, and even very few <b>bivalents</b> were formed by two chromosomes within one genome rather than homoeologous chromosomes in some PMCs; at anaphase I, all <b>bivalents</b> were disjoined and most univalents were divided. Both the disjoined <b>bivalents</b> (half-bivalents) and the divided univalents (sister chromatids) moved to the opposite poles, and then formed two groups of chromosomes; because the two resulting half-bivalents retained their axes in the cell undisturbed, many crossover types, including single crossovers, three strand double crossovers, four strand double crossovers, four strand triple crossovers, and four strand multiple crossovers between the non-sister chromatids in the tetrads of <b>bivalents,</b> were clearly inferred by analyzing the breakpoints on the disjoined <b>bivalents.</b> The present investigation not only explained the reason for sterility of the F- 1 LA hybrids and the variation of their BC 1 progenies, but also provided a new method to analyze crossover types in other F- 1 interspecific hybrids as well...|$|R

25|$|Chromatin {{undergoes}} various {{structural changes}} during a cell cycle. Histone proteins {{are the basic}} packer and arranger of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing (Histone modification). Most of the modifications occur on the histone tail. The consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified {{and the type of}} modification. For example, Histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription. Lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 or 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously.

25|$|Autopolyploids possess {{at least}} three {{homologous}} chromosome sets, {{which can lead to}} high rates of multivalent pairing during meiosis (particularly in recently formed autopolyploids, a.k.a. neopolyploids) and an associated decrease in fertility due to the production of aneuploid gametes. Natural or artificial selection for fertility can quickly stabilize meiosis in autopolyploids by restoring <b>bivalent</b> pairing during meiosis, but the high degree of homology among duplicated chromosomes causes autopolyploids to display polysomic inheritance. This trait is often used as a diagnostic criterion to distinguish autopolyploids from allopolyploids, which commonly display disomic inheritance after they progress past the neopolyploid stage. While most polyploid species are unambiguously characterized as either autopolyploid or allopolyploid, these categories represent the ends of a spectrum between of divergence between parental subgenomes. Polyploids that fall between these two extremes, which are often referred to as segmental allopolyploids, may display intermediate levels of polysomic inheritance that vary by locus.|$|E

Aneuploid eggs result from chromosome segregation errors when an egg develops from a progenitor cell, called an oocyte. The mechanisms that lead to an increase in aneuploidy with advanced maternal age are largely unclear. Here, we show that many sister kinetochores in human oocytes are separated and do not behave as a single functional unit during the first meiotic division. Having separated sister kinetochores allowed <b>bivalents</b> to rotate by 90 degrees on the spindle and increased the risk of merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Advanced maternal age led to an increase in sister kinetochore separation, rotated <b>bivalents</b> and merotelic attachments.

In this work, we consider Mus domesticus spermatocytes with diploid chromosome number 2 n = 40, all telocentric, and investigate a possible modification of the ancestral nuclear architecture due {{to the emergence of}} derived Rb chromosomes, which may be present in the homozygous or heterozygous condition. Results: In the 2 n = 40 spermatocyte nuclei random associations mediated by pericentromeric heterochromatin among the 19 telocentric <b>bivalents</b> ocurr at the nuclear periphery. The observed frequency of associations among them, made distinguishable by specific probes and FISH, seems to be the same for pairs {{that may or may not}} form Rb chromosomes.

To develop EGA-resistant varieties, introducing the desirable genes from related species is regarded as an efficient avenue. In this study, the F 1, F 2 and F 3 plants derived from the cross of EGA-susceptible wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng ex Kuo amphiploid (PHW-SA, AABBDDNsNs) and EGA-resistant triticale (Zhongsi 828, AABBRR) were analyzed for EGA resistance. Consequently, PHW-SA was moderately susceptible while Zhongsi 828 and their F 1 hybrids were immune, suggesting that the resistance is dominant. All the F 2 plants showed high resistance or immunity over two years, indicating that EGA resistance genes are more likely carried by the rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosomes rather than the genomes A or B of Zhongsi 828. In the F 3 generation, 25 of 239 lines became susceptible.
