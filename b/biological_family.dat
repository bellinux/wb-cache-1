40|$|Introduction Children {{deprived}} of parental care are a vulnerable population with complex needs and health problems. The aim {{of our study}} was to assess health status of this population and compare it with children living in their <b>biological</b> <b>families.</b> Material and methods Our study included 41 adolescents living in foster families (22 boys and 19 girls, mean age 14. 66 ± 1. 39 and 43 adolescents living in child foster homes (16 boys and 27 girls, mean age 14. 99 ± 1. 3). The control group consisted of their classmates living with their <b>biological</b> <b>families</b> (45 adolescents, 20 boys and 25 girls, mean age 14. 69 ± 1. 43). Health status was assessed by analyzing their medical records. Results There were no differences in regard to anthropometric characteristics (body weight, body height, body mass index) and prevalence of body deformities in studied groups. Acute bronchitis was significantly more frequent in children living in foster families (41. 5 %) than in other two groups (16. 3 % - foster homes; 17. 8 % - <b>biological</b> <b>families).</b> Headaches were significantly more common in groups living in foster families (31. 7 %) and foster homes (25. 6 %) than in children living with their <b>biological</b> <b>families.</b> The same was established for myopia (46. 3 % - foster families; 32. 6 % - foster homes; 17. 8 % - <b>biological</b> <b>families).</b> Conclusion Even though {{there were no differences}} in regard to characteristics which are indicators of general health, it is apparent that children {{deprived of}} parental care present with particularities of health status.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} the current study is to examine the {{relationship}} and difference between sociodemographic data of families (adoptive- and foster <b>families</b> versus <b>biological</b> <b>families,</b> reconstituted <b>families</b> versus <b>biological</b> <b>families,</b> one-parent families versus two-parent families and big families versus small families) and the risk of child abuse (physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect) for toddlers between the ages of 2 to 4 years old in the Netherlands. The family's experienced burden was chosen as a mediator in this relationship. It was expected that adoptive- and foster families, reconstituted families, one-parent families and big families would experience a higher risk of child abuse, with the family’s burden as a mediator in this relationship. Method: Adoptive- and foster families, sexual abuse and physical abuse {{were not included in the}} research due to limited data. 230 Participants, consisting of the pedagogical assistants of preschools and one parent for every toddler, took part in several questionnaires. MANOVA and multiple regression-analyses were used. Results: Only toddlers living in big families are significantly more at risk of neglect and emotional abuse as opposed to toddlers living in small families. There was no difference between reconstituted and <b>biological</b> <b>families,</b> nor between one-parent and two-parent families regarding the risk of child abuse. The family’s burden was not a significant mediator. Conclusion: Future research should consider a bigger sample of reconstituted and single-parent families and should take into account the parents' bias towards giving socially acceptable answers...|$|R

25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a <b>biological</b> <b>family</b> or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} into the risk factors that {{are more prone to}} Japanese Americans, {{specifically}} in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent) second-generation pro-bands (A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry). The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals {{of the study was to}} create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported <b>biological</b> <b>family</b> information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands. Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer’s disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based off a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60nbsp&mg/dl. With research and investigations, the possibility of finding “bad genes” denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.|$|E
