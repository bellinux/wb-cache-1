40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>baffle</b> <b>block</b> (sill) on a radial {{hydraulic}} jump (R. H. J.) {{has been investigated}} and analyzed, in order to derive the limiting design parameters {{for this type of}} jump in expanding channels. The limiting design conditions refer to the radial hydraulic jump, when it occurs entirely on the horizontal bed, with a sill liable to move in both horizontal and vertical directions. This study was carried out in the laboratory for Froude number ranged from 2 to 6. 5 to find non-dimensional relationships between the design parameters of radial hydraulic jump for different height of local baffle blocks. Generally the obtained results showed a good fitting between the different ' parameters. Also results indicated that the energy loss and the sequent depth for a radial hydraulic jump are affected by baffle blocks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes {{structural}} hydraulic {{models to}} control supercritical flows in culverts. Baffle blocks {{are designed to}} be placed in the culvert with the purpose of transforming supercritical into subcritical flow. The supercritical flow needs to be controlled so that scour will not occur at the downstream section of the culvert which is normally made of loose particles of the existing channel. The uncontrolled scour would eventually lead to failure in the embankment. Three <b>baffle</b> <b>block</b> designs were proposed in the experiments with different shapes and arrangement. It was noticed that the occurrence of baffle blocks significantly dampen the supercritical flow, for which Froude number of the approaching flow becomes smaller and velocity becomes slower. This signifies that the supercritical flow has been entirely transformed to subcritical flow. Energy losses were also computed for all designs and the results were compared...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{development of}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) models that were applied to The Dalles spillway for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District. The models have been successfully validated against physical models and prototype data, and are suitable to support biological research and operations management. The CFD models have been proven to provide reliable information in the turbulent high-velocity flow field downstream of the spillway face that is typically difficult to monitor in the prototype. In addition, CFD data provides hydraulic information throughout the solution domain {{that can be easily}} extracted from archived simulations for later use if necessary. This project is part of an ongoing program at the Portland District to improve spillway survival conditions for juvenile salmon at The Dalles. Biological data collected at The Dalles spillway have shown that for the original spillway configuration juvenile salmon passage survival is lower than desired. Therefore, the Portland District is seeking to identify operational and/or structural changes that might be implemented to improve fish passage survival. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) went through a sequence of steps to develop a CFD model of The Dalles spillway and tailrace. The first step was to identify a preferred CFD modeling package. In the case of The Dalles spillway, Flow- 3 D was as selected because of its ability to simulate the turbulent free-surface flows that occur downstream of each spilling bay. The second step in development of The Dalles CFD model was to assemble bathymetric datasets and structural drawings sufficient to describe the dam (powerhouse, non-overflow dam, spillway, fish ladder entrances, etc.) and tailrace. These datasets are documented in this report as are various 3 -D graphical representations of The Dalles spillway and tailrace. The performance of the CFD model was then validated for several cases as the third step. The validated model was then applied to address specific SIS design questions. Specifically, the CFD models were used to evaluate flow deflectors, <b>baffle</b> <b>block</b> removal and the effects of spillwalls. The CFD models were also used to evaluate downstream differences at other locations, such as at the Highway 197 bridge piers and Oregon shore islands, due to alterations in spill pattern. CFD model results were analyzed to quantitatively compare impacts of the spillwall that has subsequently been constructed between bays 6 and 7. CFD model results provided detailed information about how the spillwall would impact downstream flow patterns that complemented results from the 1 : 80 scale physical model. The CFD model was also used to examine relative differences between the juvenile spill pattern used in previous years and the anticipated spill pattern that will be applied once the wall is complete. In addition, the CFD model examined velocity magnitudes over the downstream basalt shelf to investigate potential for erosion under high flow conditions (e. g., 21 kcfs/bay for bays 1 through 6) with the spillwall in place. Several appendices follow the results and discussion sections of this report. These appendices document the large number of CFD simulations that have been performed by PNNL; both spillway improvement study (SIS) related and those performed for related biological tests...|$|E

40|$|A partial field {{optical system}} baffle was {{designed}} and optimized. Partial field was non-symmetry along one direction, so a large number light tracing was needed to design the centric, which {{made it difficult to}} design. A method of footprint diagram was used to get the coordinate of special light in the space, the size of effective field and the part of <b>baffle</b> <b>blocking</b> light. The part blocking light was removed and a "duck mouth shaped" baffle was got, which can decrease the difficulty of design. By optimizing the design, length of final designed baffle was half of the former one, and reduced the size along Y direction, which can reduce more stray light to enter the later optical system directly. Baffle was modeled and simulated by Solidworks and TracePro software, the PST is about 10 - 9 when the off-axis angle is 30 °, which is less than 5. 59 × 10 - 7, the requirement of the system.

In efforts to assist the hydraulic and biological communities in managing this hydroelectric project, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was applied to the spillway, stilling basin, and tailrace zones downstream of the dam. To simulate the highly transient and turbulent flow conditions in this region, a free-surface computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical model has been applied. This model is based on the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method, and is capable of simulating sudden discontinuities in the free surface, including wave breakup. The model solves the non-hydrostatic Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations over variable-sized hexahedral cells. To validate the ability of the numerical model to simulate flows downstream of the spillway, the model was validated against data from three different physical models at scales of 1 : 36, 1 : 40, and 1 : 80. Results from these physical models allow for validation of the numerical model at various scales of motion from the small scale highly dynamic variations near the <b>baffle</b> <b>blocks</b> (1 : 36 and 1 : 40 scale) to the larger scale general circulation patterns that encompass the tailrace (1 : 80 scale) ...|$|R

In this project GexCon carried out 200 small-scale experiments on dispersion and explosion with H 2 and mixtures with H 2 and CO or N 2. Experiments with varying confinement, congestion, concentration, and ignition location were performed. Since the main purpose of the tests was to produce good validation data, all tests were simulated with the FLACS-HYDROGEN tool. The simulations confirmed the ability to predict explosions effects for the wide range of scenarios studied. A few examples of comparisons will be shown. To build confidence in a consequence prediction model, {{it is important that the}} scales used for validation are as close as possible to reality. Since the hazard to people and facilities, and the risk, will generally increase with scale, validation against large-scale experiments is important.

40|$|Introduction: The {{hydraulic}} jump happens when flow transfers from supercritical regime to subcritical regime. The {{hydraulic jump}} on smooth bed {{is called the}} classic hydraulic jump. One way to increase the energy dissipation in a hydraulic jump is to roughen the bed. Elements including stabilizers and <b>baffle</b> <b>blocks</b> are commonly used as the energy dissipators in stilling basins to stabilize the location and decrease the length and conjugate depths of the hydraulic jumps. If roughness elements are placed uniformly {{on the bed and}} orthogonal to the flow direction, the formed jump is addressed as the hydraulic jump on rough bed. Recently, implementing short energy dissipaters and environment friendly rough beds have attracted attention and justify more research in these fields. Recent studies have addressed hydraulic jump on rough beds ([14], [5], and [12]). Relative roughness parameter first defined by Rajaratnam to investigate the jump characteristics and other researchers then used this parameter to investigate the characteristics of jump on rough bed. In this research, similar experiments to Pagliara et al (5) are designed to study continuous and natural rough beds. Materials and Methods: All the experiments have been arranged and carried out in the hydraulic laboratory of Ferdowsi University, Mashhad Iran. Hydraulic jump characteristicswere measured in a horizontal rectangular flume, 0. 30 m wide, 0. 50 m deep, and 11 m long, with smooth glass side walls. The rough bed was simulated by gluing a layer of uniform gravel material with middle diameter 3. 5 mm and 11 mm on a glass plate which was placed on the flume, throughout its length. In the physical model, to simulate a supercritical flow with three constant initial depths including, 1. 5 and,a steel sluice gate is installed. Furthermore, to stabilize the location ofhydraulic jump and create a free-surface jump, a sharp-crested weir with the same width as the channel width is installed {{at the end of the}} flume. Water contraction usually occurs after the sluice gate is avoided by a steel plate welded on the sluice gate. So, the initial depth equals the gate opening. According to the experimental procedure, after placing theuniform roughness heights on channel bed, the pump runs and water flows slowly into the flume. Then, discharge increases to reach the desired value and the sluice gate opening is set up to have the hydraulic jump formed at a distance of ahead of the gate. These circumstances maintain enough for data recording. The parameter of gravel particles considered as the most sensible characteristic. The subcritical depth y 2 was measured from the profile survey, where the water surface began to be essentially level. Results and discussions: In the smooth and rough beds experiments show that variation in initial depth does not have any effect on decreasing the conjugate depths ratio. The conjugate depths ratio decreases as the roughness increases. The difference between conjugate depths ratio of rough beds with middle diameter 3. 5 mm (B) and 11 mm (C) appears when the Froude number exceeds 7. 5 and for Froude numbers greater than 10, a significant drop can be observed in the conjugate depths ratio diagrams from rough bed B to C. The horizontal distance between the beginning and end point of a hydraulic jump is considered as the length of the hydraulic jump. Dimensionless length of the hydraulic jump is presented as which is usually considered as a function of. For Froude number greater than 10, the dimensionless length of the hydraulic jump is nearly constant. Then, the ratio of for Froude numbers greater than 10 seems to be independent of supercritical Froude number and is just a function of roughness. In all experiments the length of the hydraulic jump decreases compared with the smooth bed under conditions that bed roughness is not subjected to water jet. Conclusions: Experiments demonstrated that in the rough bed by increasing roughness, the conjugated depths ratio decreased compared with the classical hydraulic jump. The variation of initial depth of flow does not have any effect on reducing conjugate depths ratio and dimensionless length of the hydraulic jump. The length of the hydraulic jump in rough beds on average reduced between 28. 5...|$|R
5000|$|The compete-on-cost {{strategy}} {{also led}} Boeing {{to pick a}} direct-lift thrust vectoring system, for the Marines' short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) requirement, as this would only necessitate {{the addition of a}} thrust vectoring module around the main engine. However, this choice required the engine to be mounted directly behind the cockpit, and moved the center of gravity forward from its usual position in jet fighters (towards the rear of the airplane) to enable a neutral-attitude hover. Boeing had proposed, in the 1960s, a similar supersonic fighter with a mid-center-of-gravity mounted engine with vectored thrust nozzles, but this never proceeded beyond pictures published in Aviation Week. By comparison, the Lockheed entry looked like, if anything, a smaller version of the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. The Boeing in-house nickname of the X-32 was the [...] "Monica". Yet another effect of the selection of the direct-lift system was the large chin-mounted air intake, akin to the Vought F-8 Crusader and LTV A-7 Corsair II. This was required to feed sufficient air to the main engine (to provide the thrust necessary to hover) during the zero horizontal velocity phase, when it could not exploit ram-air pressure. A knock on effect of this large intake, was the potential direct visibility of the compressor blades to radar (see radar cross-section). Mitigation possibilities included variable <b>baffles</b> designed to <b>block</b> incoming radio waves without adversely affecting airflow.|$|R
40|$|During the 19 th century, {{overflow}} stepped spillways {{were selected}} frequently with nearly {{one third of}} dams built in USA equipped with a stepped cascade. More recently, the 1980 s and 1990 s were marked by a regain of interest for that type of spillway design. During the last two decades, a number of embankment dam spillways were designed with concrete overtopping protection shaped in a stepped fashion (Chanson, 2002; Chanson and Gonzalez, 2004; Chanson and Toombes, 2001). Although some overflow systems were made of timber cribs, sheet-piles, riprap gabions and reinforced earth, recent structures were designed with concrete slabs and formed concrete. During the 1990 s, the construction of secondary stepped spillways for embankments accounted for nearly two-thirds of dam construction in USA (Ditchey and Campbell, 2000). The preferred construction method was roller compacted concrete overlays placed on the downstream slope. Most stepped spillway structures had flat horizontal steps, but some were equipped with devices to enhance energy dissipation. Some spillways had pooled steps with vertical walls (Sorpe dam, 1932) or rounded edges (Le Pont dam, 1882). Recently, Andre et al. (2001) suggested an alternation of pooled and flat steps for maximum energy dissipation. Peyras et al. (1992) demonstrated greater energy dissipation with inclined upward steps. Newer designs were introduced and tested in laboratory by adding <b>baffle</b> row or <b>blocks</b> at the downstream end of step, or by using turbulence manipulators (Andre et al., 2004; Chanson and Gonzalez, 2004). In the present study, detailed air-water flow measurements on 16 deg. and 22 deg. stepped slopes (h = 0. 1 m) are re-analysed, {{and the rate of}} energy dissipation is presented. Results obtained in flat, smooth steps are compared with results corresponding to rough faced step chutes and chutes with added turbulence manipulators.

40|$|Fault {{zones in}} siliciclastic rocks form {{distinct}} volumetric entities and typically exhibit great structural complexity. While {{it has been}} considered that the main impact of fault zones to fluid flow is to <b>baffle</b> or <b>block</b> the flow, observations suggest that fault zones can (i) act as dual baffle-conduit conduit systems, (ii) host long-distance flow in both along-dip and along-strike directions, (iii) act as pure conduit systems exhibiting higher flow rates than the surrounding host rock. However, the complex flow behaviours inside fault zones cannot be readily captured or forecast in traditional reservoir models, as faults are conventionally implemented as 2 D modelling objects. A comprehensive and integrated approach has been adapted for providing a new feasible method, i. e. “fault facies modelling”, for volumetric fault representation in industrial reservoir models. To date, research on fault facies modelling {{is in many ways}} still in its early stages of development, with emphasis being placed on establishing frameworks for fault zone characterization suitable for modelling purposes and modelling algorithms for implementing them. The principal aims of the present study are to: 1. Improve the key aspects of fault facies modelling, i. e. the use of outcrop-based facies maps, 3 D gridding, property modelling, upscaling, and application on field-scale models. 2. Advance current knowledge on the impact of fault zone structure on reservoir fluid flow. To increase the capability of fault facies modelling with regard to reproducing outcrop observations, a new way of utilizing outcrop observations is introduced. Prior to modelling, outcrop-based fault facies maps are created by discretising outcrop observations using grid resolutions that are deemed to be high enough to resolve fault facies units depending on flow scale considered. The maps form conceptual templates for (i) selecting the most suitable stochastic modelling techniques and workflows, (ii) establishing representative geostatistical properties of fault facies and fault facies associations, (iii) assessing the quality of the resulting fault facies models. With respect to fault zone property (facies and petrophysical) modelling, the present study focuses on the applications of fault zone displacement functions and stochastic modelling methods. Automated scripts are employed to define fault zone displacement functions to allow more flexibility in the application of the functions. This, in turn, makes it easier to handle outcrop-based statistics such as (i) damage zone width as a function of fault throw, (ii) fault core thickness as a function of fault throw (iii) the fractions of total fault throw accommodated by fault core and damage zones, and (iv) the types of displacement function (quadratic, cubic, and quartic) in fault core and damage zones. Truncated Gaussian simulation (TGS) is used for modelling damage zone features. This has not been tried before. In different fault system configurations, i. e. : (i) single isolated faults, (ii) single-tip interacting faults (branching of two fault segments), and (iii) double-tip interacting faults forming a relay ramp, the applications of TGS are constrained by conceptual and outcrop-based conditioning parameters. Comparison between the resulting models and the discretized damage zone observations show that important observed characteristics such as variations of fault facies thickness, -length, - adjacency, and compartment geometries are reproduced by the models. For fault core modelling, a hierarchical approach employing object-based simulation technique is demonstrated. To reproduce a complex fault core lens configuration where lenses are stacked one to another, lensoid objects are populated by setting very high volumetric proportion of the simulated objects (hence, very low background volumetric proportion). Subsequently, the lens models are refined non-proportionally (for creating thin and thick cells) and slip zones are implemented in thin cells separating two different lensoid objects. Comparison between the resulting models and the discretized fault core observation show that the models reproduce important fault core characteristics such as (i) lenses with varied thickness and aspect ratio and (ii) lens size distribution that shows a higher number of smaller lenses, and (iii) the distribution of slip zones, i. e. flow baffles/conduits, that 9 is closely related to the lenses distribution. Moreover, combined with flow-based upscaling, the hierarchical approach makes it possible for employing reliable and accurate fault facies modelling on a full-field scale within the framework of existing reservoir modelling tools. Work performed on flow simulation and sensitivity testing and analysis have provided new insights into the impact of different fault zone parameters on reservoir fluid flow. When both fault core and surrounding damage zones are considered, fault facies modelling parameters can be ranked according to their impact on reservoir responses in the following descending order: (i) fault core thickness, (ii) the type of displacement function, (iii) sedimentary facies configuration, (iv) fault core throw percentage, (v) fault system configuration, (vi) maximum damage zone width. When considering the damage zone separately, the impact of fault facies modelling factors can be ranked in descending order as: (i) fault facies volumetric proportion, (ii) deformation band frequency, (iii) damage zone width, (iv) deformation band permeability, and (v) fault facies cluster extent. Flow simulation study performed on outcrop-based relay zone models corroborates conclusions from earlier studies that the main factor controlling fluid flow in relay zones is deformation band permeability. Observations on variations in shape and migration velocities of fluid fronts in the relay zone show that, within khr/kdb range of 101 to 105 (where khr and kdb are host rock and deformation band permeability, respectively), increasing khr/kdb causes increased fluid flow complexity as indicated by amplified deviation from piston-like fluid displacement. High deformation band permeability allows injected water to saturate the entire oil column with ease and hence relay zones with high permeability bands provide good vertical sweep efficiency. For lateral sweep efficiency, however, relay zones with medium deformation band permeability show better performance due to enhanced flow tortuosity in the presence of pervasive but weak flow baffles. Field-scale flow simulations indicate that fault cores with membrane slip zone clusters act as dual baffle-conduit systems. Sweep efficiency in reservoirs with baffle-conduit fault cores is closely related to injector-producer configuration. Baffle-conduit fault cores subparallel to injector-producer pairs focus injected fluids, hence decreasing sweep efficiency. Baffle-conduit fault cores perpendicular to injector-producer pairs partition and distribute the injected fluids and therefore increase overall sweep efficiency. Reservoirs with baffle-conduit fault cores exhibit two behaviours: (i) water breakthrough occurrence, time, and sequence are not sensitive to the choice of injectionproduction scheme and (ii) sweep efficiency decreases when field production rate is lowered. Fault cores with conduit slip zones, however, act as thief pathways. Sweep efficiency in reservoirs with conduit fault cores is less dependent on injector-producer configuration. Two distinct behaviours of reservoirs with conduit fault cores are: (i) water breakthrough occurrence, time, and sequence are highly sensitive to the choice of injection-production scheme and (ii) sweep efficiency increases when field production rate is lowered. These simulation results show that the improved realism added by incorporating volumetrically expressed fault cores substantially influences forecasts of field behaviour, and consequently should be considered during oil/gas production planning. </p...|$|R
