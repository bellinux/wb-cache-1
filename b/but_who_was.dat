5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because they hoped to finish their {{education}} or because they were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> easily duped by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E

5|$|His {{allegiance}} to the Lancastrian regime remained strong {{enough for him to}} take arms against the House of York, and eventually cost him his life. Commanding the central battle of the king's army he fell, with the duke of Buckingham and Lord Egremont whilst forming a human shield in defence of the king, against the victorious Yorkists in the battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460. Even though the king had fallen into Yorkist hands, Beaumont was not attainted, and his son was allowed to enter into his inheritance. Presumably in an attempt to reconcile his family to the new regime. This failed, and Beaumont's second son (<b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> his heir) – the by now second Viscount fought against the victorious army of the Yorkist king, Edward IV at the battle of Towton in April the next year.|$|E
5|$|In February 1905, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier introduced legislation to create two new provinces—Alberta and Saskatchewan—from the Northwest Territories. Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same non-partisan basis as the Territories had been, {{it was expected that}} the Liberal Laurier would recommend a Liberal to serve as Lieutenant-Governor, and it was further assumed that the Lieutenant-Governor would call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government. Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but had just been named federal Minister of the Interior, and was not interested in leaving Ottawa. Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the Senate and found the prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta. Both men supported Rutherford, though neither was enthusiastic about doing so. In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the Alberta Liberals selected Rutherford as their first leader. A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain, who was a Conservative federally <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> thought to be a potential leader of a coalition government, announced that he would stay in Regina to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives. On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E

5|$|Upon Harun's death, al-Amin {{ascended the}} throne in Baghdad, where his {{popularity}} was great, while al-Ma'mun remained at Marv, {{from where he}} planned to campaign against the remaining rebels. However, al-Amin recalled the army and treasury from the east, leaving al-Ma'mun with {{little in the way}} of military forces. It was in this time that al-Ma'mun came to rely upon his wazir, the former Barmakid protégé al-Fadl ibn Sahl, who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with the local elites, whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed. The covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over Baghdad's centralizing ambitions and the dispute over the status of Khurasan: the abnaʾ, led by Ali ibn Isa, whom Harun had imprisoned <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> now set free and appointed head of the Caliph's bodyguard, were joined by other influential officials, chief amongst them al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, in demanding that Khurasan and its revenue return to the direct control of the central government, even if that meant breaking the stipulations of the Mecca agreement.|$|E
