40|$|AbstractThe pH-dependence of redox {{properties}} and of CO binding to <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase</b> {{has been investigated}} over the range between 2 and 11. The pH-dependence of redox potentials shows a biphasic behavior, suggesting the existence of (at least) two redox-linked groups, which change their pKa values upon reduction. These values are {{in close agreement with}} those observed to play a relevant role in the modulation of CO binding to ferrous <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase.</b> They have been tentatively attributed to Arg- 372 and His- 226, which are located on the distal side of the heme pocket of lactoperoxidase. A complete and unequivocal description of the proton-linked behavior of <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase</b> requires, however, three residues, which are redox linked and relevant for the modulation of CO binding. The rate constant for CO binding to <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase</b> is slower than what is reported for most hemoproteins, suggesting that these two residues, Arg- 372 and His- 226, are representing a severe barrier for the access of exogenous ligands to the heme.

This system could be distinguished from lysozyme (3 - 7) and IgA (8). Antilactobacillus activity was present in sterile, cell-free parotid or submaxillary saliva (6, 9), suggesting {{that the source of}} the antimicrobial system was the salivary glands and that the phagocytes and microorganisms of saliva were not essential under the conditions employed. Attempts to define the nature of this antimicrobial system were unsuccessful until it was found to contain at least two components: a heat-stable, dialyzable component and a heat-labile, nondialyzable component (7, 10, 11). The heat-stable, dialyzable component could be replaced by thiocyanate ions in the concentrations present in saliva (11, 12).

40|$|Bovine milk {{possesses}} a protein system constituted by two major families of proteins: caseins (insoluble) and whey proteins (soluble). Caseins (αS 1, αS 2, β, and κ) are the predominant phosphoproteins {{in the milk}} of ruminants, accounting for about 80 % of total protein, while the whey proteins, representing approximately 20 % of milk protein fraction, include β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, immunoglobulins, bovine serum albumin, <b>bovine</b> lactoferrin, and <b>lactoperoxidase,</b> together with other minor components.

The binding of ASA occurs without perturbing the position of conserved heme water molecule W- 1, whereas both SHA and BHA displace it by the hydroxyl group of their hydroxamic acid moieties. The acetyl group carbonyl oxygen atom of ASA forms a hydrogen bond with W- 1, which in turn makes three other hydrogen-bonds, one each with heme iron, His- 109 Nϵ 2, and Gln- 105 Nϵ 2. In contrast, in the complexes of SHA and BHA, the OH group of hydroxamic acid moiety in both complexes interacts with heme iron directly with Fe-OH distances of 3. 0 and 3. 2 Å respectively. The OH is also hydrogen bonded to His- 109 Nϵ 2 and Gln- 105 Nϵ 2.

Therefore, the development of ideal saliva substitutes requires understanding of the rheological as well as biological properties of human saliva. In the present study, we investigated the changes of salivary enzymatic activities by saliva substitutes and compared viscosity of saliva substitutes with human saliva. Five kinds of saliva substitutes such as Moi-Stir, Stoppers 4, MouthKote, Saliva Orthana, and SNU were used. Lysozyme activity was determined by the turbidimetric method. Peroxidase activity was determined with an NbsSCN assay. α-Amylase activity was determined using a chromogenic substrate, 2 -chloro-p-nitrophenol linked with maltotriose. The pH values of saliva substitutes were measured and their viscosity values were measured with a cone-and-plate digital viscometer at six different shear rates. Various types of saliva substitutes affected the activities of salivary enzymes in different ways. Stoppers 4 enhanced the enzymatic activities of hen egg-white lysozyme, <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase</b> (bLP), and α-amylase. Saliva Orthana and SNU inhibited bLP activity and enhanced α-amylase activity. MouthKote inhibited α-amylase activity. Moi-Stir inhibited the enzymatic activities of bLP and α-amylase. The pH values were very different according to the types of saliva substitutes. Stoppers 4, MouthKote, and Saliva Orthana showed lower values of viscosity at low shear rates and higher values of viscosity at high shear rates compared with unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva.

The structure determination shows that isoniazid binds to LPO at the substrate binding site on the distal heme side. The substrate binding site is connected to the protein surface through a long hydrophobic channel. The acyl hydrazide moiety of isoniazid interacts with Phe 422 O, Gln 423 Oϵ 1, and Phe 254 O. In this arrangement, pyridinyl nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule, W- 1, which in turn forms three hydrogen bonds with Fe 3 +, His 109 Nϵ 2, and Gln 105 Nϵ 2. The remaining two sides of isoniazid form hydrophobic interactions with the atoms of heme pyrrole ring A, Cβ and Cγ atoms of Glu 258, and Cγ and Cδ atoms of Arg 255. The binding studies indicate that INH binds to LPO with a value of 0. 9 × 10 − 6 m for the dissociation constant. The nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay shows that INH {{is activated}} by the reaction of LPO-H 2 O 2 with INH. This suggests that LPO can be used for INH activation.

40|$|Streptococcus is a {{dominant}} genus {{in the human}} oral cavity, making up about 20  % {{of the more than}} 800 species of bacteria that have been identified, and about 80  % of the early biofilm colonizers. Oral streptococci include both health-compatible (e. g. Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis) and pathogenic strains (e. g. the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans). Because the streptococci have similar metabolic requirements, they have developed defence strategies that lead to antagonism (also known as bacterial interference). S. mutans expresses bacteriocins that are cytotoxic toward S. gordonii and S. sanguinis, whereas S. gordonii and S. sanguinis differentially produce H 2 O 2 (under aerobic growth conditions), which is relatively toxic toward S. mutans. Superimposed on the inter-bacterial combat are the effects of the host defensive mechanisms. We report here on the multifarious effects of <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase</b> (bLPO) on the antagonism between S. gordonii and S. sanguinis versus S. mutans. Some of the effects are apparently counterproductive with respect to maintaining a health-compatible population of streptococci. For example, the bLPO system (comprised of bLPO+SCN−+H 2 O 2) destroys H 2 O 2, thereby abolishing the ability of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis to inhibit the growth of S. mutans. Furthermore, bLPO protein (with or without its substrate) inhibits bacterial growth in a biofilm assay, but sucrose negates the inhibitory effects of the bLPO protein, thereby facilitating adherence of S. mutans in lieu of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis.

The determination of structure revealed the presence of an OSCN− ion at the distal heme cavity. The presence of OSCN− ions in crystal samples was also confirmed by chemical and spectroscopic analysis. The OSCN− ion interacts with the heme iron, Gln- 105 Nɛ 1, His- 109 Nɛ 2, and a water molecule W 96. The sulfur atom of the OSCN− ion forms a hypervalent bond with a nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring D of the heme moiety at an S–N distance of 2. 8 Å.

Boiling of enzymes, which suppressed their capacity to peroxidize guaiacol, also destroyed their capacity to convert arachidonate into PG-like compounds. The rates of formation of PG-like compounds rapidly declined with time, approaching zero after 10 and 20 min for PGE 2 alpha- and PGE 2 -like compounds, respectively. Addition of more enzyme further promoted the reaction. Horseradish and lacto-peroxidases showed optimum pH values of 9. 0 and 10. 0, respectively. Both enzymes exhibited apparent Km values of about 5 x 10 (- 5) M for arachidonate. Some reducing agents such as ascorbic acid, NADH and adrenaline dose-dependently inhibited this reaction. The haem poison, phenylhydrazine, also inhibited, with an IC 50 of 1 x 10 (- 7) M. Indomethacin inhibited only the formation of PGE 2 -like compounds with an IC 50 of about 3 x 10 (- 6) M. As compared to a standard commercial preparation of horseradish peroxidase, the purified horseradish basic and acidic isoenzymes exhibited a higher activity, towards arachidonate whereas other haemoproteins, possessing peroxidase activity, were less active. TLC and GC-MS analyses performed on the reaction products led to the identification of PGF 2 alpha, PGE 2 and PG 6 K 1 alpha and other unidentified arachidonate derivatives. At 25 degrees, pH 9. 5, horseradish peroxidase, acting on saturating concentration of arachidonate, catalysed the formation of 60 mumol/min/mmole enzyme of PGE 2 + PGF 2 alpha.

40|$|Introduction Enzymatic {{activity}} in solution is largely influenced by environmental {{factors such as}} the physical properties of the system. Viscosity is referred to as an index of the mobility of a system since it is related to the translational diffusion by the Stokes relationship. Kramers’ theory [1] predicts that the rate for the dynamics should have an inverse relationship with viscosity. Even if a large body of work indicates that Kramers’ theory does not always predict protein dynamics properly [2], large amplitude (global) protein motions and, in particular, those involving exterior portions of the protein, appear to follow Kramers’ relation at viscosities above ≈ 1 cP [3, 4] whilst diffusive motions involving smaller portions of the protein are less likely to follow Kramers’ relation at high viscosities [2]. Deviations from Kramers’ relation for exterior protein motions has been attributed to solvent composition and viscosity in the immediate vicinity of the protein. Independently of viscosity, other physical variables could affect the enzyme kinetics in solutions. In particular, in highly viscous concentrated solutions, water activity, which is a thermodynamical variable extensively used to describe the chemical potential of water in binary and complex systems, could play a significant role [5]. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and compare the effect of viscosity and water activity (aw) on the activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and <b>bovine</b> <b>lactoperoxidase</b> (LPO) in buffered solutions. HRP (44, 173. 9 Da) is an enzyme with an highly accessible active site whilst LPO is a larger enzyme (78, 431 Da) with a deeply buried active site with a restrictive substrate access channel which should limit the influence of physical properties of the solution (such as viscosity and water activity) on enzymatic catalysis. ExperimentalConcentrated binary and ternary buffered solutions with were prepared by using 0. 1 M potassium phosphate buffer, maltose, trehalose and maltodextrins (: 30. 000). HRP and LPO activity was tested in buffered solutions using the method of Keesey [6]. Viscosity was measured using a falling ball viscometer while water activity was measured using a dew point hygrometer. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry was used for the T’g determination. Thermograms were obtained after annealing at T’g + 10 °C. ResultsIn viscous solutions characterized by different composition, the inhibition of the HRP activity was dependent both on the thermodynamical properties of the solution, as described by water activity, and on the mobility of the system, as described by the inverse of viscosity and T-T’g. Viscosity was the most important factor in the inhibition of enzymatic {{activity in}} solutions characterized by the same T’g value, but when T’g was changed, due to changes in the solutes composition, the latter became the key factor in the regulation of the enzyme activity. HRP activity was much more influenced by changes in the water activity than LPO activity which, in turn, was much more influenced by changes in viscosity. The results of this study suggest that for large enzymes the translational diffusivity which, according to the Stokes-Einstein law, is inversely related to viscosity and molecular weight, is a far more critical factor than the accessibility of the active site. On the other hand, the water status of the solution seems to be a far more critical factor for the activity of enzymes with an active site highly accessible and expose to the external environment...|$|E
