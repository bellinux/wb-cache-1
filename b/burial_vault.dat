5|$|Colross {{served as}} the venue for several {{significant}} Mason family events, including the wedding ceremonies of Thomson Francis Mason's daughters Sarah Elizabeth Mason (1819–1907) and Virginia Mason (1830–1919). According to local tradition, two children in the Mason family died on the property and were interred in the estate's <b>burial</b> <b>vault.</b> Successive owners of the Colross estate claimed it was haunted by the deceased Mason children.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians {{said the}} dig offered a clearer view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern {{that served as a}} water purification system and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a herringbone bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, the foundations of the smokehouse, stables, and a <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium buyers to abandon their purchases.|$|E
5|$|In 1985–86 Cleveland County Archaeology Section {{carried out}} a major {{excavation}} of {{the west end of}} the nave to consolidate an area of subsidence. Its cause was the collapse of an unrecorded <b>burial</b> <b>vault.</b> The excavations found more evidence of the fire of 1289 including scorched masonry, a shattered bell and broken grave-slabs. The remains of 47 people – 21 men, 17 women, 6 children and 3 of undetermined gender – were discovered, some of whom had been buried with grave goods including a gold finger ring and jet crosses. Two chalices and patens were found alongside the remains of two priests. The skeletons were cremated and the ashes scattered in the Monks' Walk in the Priory Gardens. A geophysical survey carried out to the west and east of the west range indicated the existence of the remains of other monastic buildings which have yet to be excavated.|$|E

5|$|Further {{excavations}} were {{undertaken in}} the 1920s by C. R. Peers, who found that the nave of the original church had external doors on the north, south and west sides, and that the chancel had doors leading into {{the north and south}} porticus, which in turn had external doors on their eastern sides. Regarding the floor described by Dowker, Peers noted that the surface consisted of a thin layer of pounded brick, and believed that it was of the same date as the stone which Dowker described as the foundations for the stone cross. Excavations also revealed steps leading down to the <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> reported by Dowker, although Peers did not refer to either the steps or the vault in his report. Extensions of the porticus to the west and around the original west front were dated to no more than 100years after the church was first built, and Peers observed that these extensions had been given the same type of floor as the original church. Drawing comparisons with the 7th-century chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, and the abbey of St Augustine at Canterbury, Peers suggested that the original church at Reculver probably had windows set high in the northern and southern walls of the nave. Areas of wall found by archaeologists but now missing above ground are marked on the site by strips of concrete edged with flint.|$|E

25|$|The South Tomb {{has been}} likened to the {{satellite}} pyramids of later Dynasties, {{and has been}} proposed to house the ka in the afterlife. Another proposal {{is that it may}} have held the canopic jar with the king’s organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body. These proposals stem {{from the fact that the}} granite <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial.|$|E

50|$|Jewish {{law does}} not bar the use of <b>burial</b> <b>vaults</b> or liners, and their use is {{permitted}} where law or a cemetery requires them. But Morrison David Bial argues that <b>burial</b> <b>vaults</b> are antithetical to traditional Judaism, {{in part because they}} deny the reality of death (e.g., inhibit decomposition of the body) and in part because they are ostentatious and undercut the equality of all people at death.|$|R
5000|$|By {{adhering}} to culture, {{women in the}} Cook Islands are buried inside <b>burial</b> <b>vaults</b> located {{in front of the}} yards of houses, particularly the woman who is known to be the builder of the said home.

25|$|The flint {{walls of}} the churchyard were listed Grade II in 1970. On {{the north and west}} sides they are {{believed}} to follow the line of the former town walls, the churchyard being in the north-west corner of the walled part of the town, and may contain material from those walls. In the churchyard are several carved gravestones, including that of one Mark Sharp, carpenter, who made the head- and footstones himself, depicting a set of carpenter's tools. The paved floor of the old chancel covers the <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> of the Crofts family.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} saints Peter and Paul, {{bestowed}} upon original city's citadel and its cathedral (from 1725—a <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> of Russian emperors) coincidentally were {{the names of}} the first two assassinated Russian Emperors, PeterIII (1762, supposedly killed in a conspiracy led by his wife, Catherine the Great) and PaulI (1801, Nicholas Zubov and other conspirators who brought to power AlexanderI, the son of their victim). The third emperor's assassination took place in Petersburg in 1881 when AlexanderII fell victim to narodniki (see the Church of the Savior on Blood).|$|E

25|$|In 1890, Mullaly {{proposed}} {{using the}} site for the 1893 World's Fair due to its size; however, the fair was eventually awarded to Chicago instead. The Pell family's <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> was also marked for preservation that year, and in July 1891, the descendants of the Pell family were given permission to maintain and restore the plot. After the park opened, several individuals were allowed to reside in the mansions within the park. In 1892, the New York City Department of Public Parks separately allowed the occupation of the Hunter, Hoyt, and Twin Island houses. The next year, two buildings near Pelham Bridge were auctioned off.|$|E
25|$|Camp Nelson National Cemetery is {{overseen by}} one {{cemetery}} director. The director and one administrative assistant {{work in the}} office, communicating with families and funeral homes to schedule funeral services and burials, coordinate with various agencies for the annual ceremonies, maintain records, and to answer questions or address concerns made by the general public. The staff includes six full-time cemetery caretakers, though the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hires temporary workers almost every summer to augment the staff by about fifty percent. These caretakers prepare graves with a backhoe or hand held tools (pick and shovel), take custody of and transport a casket to its grave, lower the casket into the grave, seal it within a <b>burial</b> <b>vault,</b> and fill in the grave. Caretakers also receive delivered headstones, set and align them {{at the head of}} the appropriate graves, and maintain the grounds; duties include cutting the grass, pruning trees, clearing the roads of leaves in the autumn and snow in the winter, preparing the funeral shelter for services, disposing of litter, and interacting with the public to answer questions or find graves.|$|E
25|$|The {{permanent}} John F. Kennedy {{grave site}} opened with little announcement or fanfare on March 15, 1967. A few days before, the eternal flame {{had been moved}} from its temporary location to the new site. The reburial of the bodies occurred {{on the evening of}} March 14, after Arlington National Cemetery had closed. Earth over the existing grave was removed, and a small crane was used to lift the <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> (which remained unopened) from the old grave and place it in the new one. The event was unannounced. The transfer was witnessed by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston. Exhumation began at 6:19 PM and was complete at 9:00 PM. Consecration of the new burial site occurred at 7:00 AM on March 15, 1967, in a driving rain. The ceremony, which took 20 minutes, was attended by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mrs. Kennedy, and members of the Kennedy family. Cardinal Cushing presided over the consecration. The final cost of the entire project was $2.2 million.|$|E

50|$|Data {{on the use}} of <b>burial</b> <b>vaults</b> and liners {{outside the}} United States is very {{difficult}} to come by, and usage rates are not known. <b>Burial</b> <b>vaults</b> and liners are almost unheard of in China and Japan. Cremation is required in China, and is used in 90 percent of burials in Japan. They are also uncommon in Italy. In modern Italy, burial plots (either below-ground or in wall loculi) are re-used after a period of years, usually 10 to 25. At that time, most of the soft body parts have decomposed, and the bones are removed to an ossuary.|$|R
25|$|In 1905, {{the remains}} of Michigan's first {{governor}} Stevens T. Mason were transferred from New York City where he died 1843 and interred in Capitol Park in a ceremony attended by sitting governor Fred M. Warner and mayor George P. Codd among other officials. A statue of Mason by sculptor Albert Weinert was later erected over the grave. When plans were announced in 2009 to reconfigure the park, they included relocating the monument and grave. However, the <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> was not where earlier plans indicated and crews searched for four days before it was located on June 29, 2010. It was believed the grave was moved from its 1905 location in 1955 {{to make room for}} a bus terminal. On the 199th anniversary of his birth, October 27, 2010, Mason was reburied for 4th time in a newly built vault in the pedestal the bronze statue. The current Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, where funeral services were held for Mason in 1843, officiated at the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of the mansion was a garden, which was purportedly well known for its boxwoods, lilacs, and roses. The garden {{remained}} through the ownership of the Smoot family. A winding path led from the mansion to a large <b>burial</b> <b>vault,</b> which was closed by a great iron lock. According to members of the Smoot family, the lock to the <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> would [...] "never stay locked more than three days" [...] at a time. A vase of urn stood in the front lawn of the mansion; according to tradition this marked the location where Pocahontas was baptized. The urn remained in its location throughout the American Civil War and was later acquired by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities.|$|E
500|$|According {{to local}} tradition, two small Mason {{children}}, William and Ann, were {{playing in the}} estate's yard when a storm arrived. William took shelter in the estate's chicken coop but the wind toppled the structure, killing him. Soon after William's death, his sister Ann drowned in a bathtub at Colross. Both children were interred in the estate's <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> in the garden. Successive residents at Colross, including members of the Smoot family, claimed the estate was haunted by the deceased Mason children; they reported hearing children [...] "giggling, singing, and talking", and witnessed apparitions of children in pre-Civil War attire.|$|E

500|$|A {{small stone}} porch towards {{the east end}} of the south wall leads to the Fleetwood family <b>burial</b> <b>vault.</b> The doorway is inscribed with [...] "Insignia Rici Fleetwood an hujus eccliae patronis, Anno Dni 1699". There are two more doorways {{on the south side of}} the nave, both have been {{restored}} and have Tuscan columns, triglyphs and pediments. Above the doorways are oval windows, added in the 19th century which, according to Clare Hartwell, [...] "add a touch of sophistication". There are large round-headed pairs of arched windows with Y-tracery, (possibly added later) and plain architraves. There are three such windows on the north side and four on the south side with more round-headed windows in the apse.|$|E
500|$|McCrea's remains {{have been}} moved three times. [...] The first time was in 1822, and the second was in 1852, when they were moved to the Union Cemetery in Fort Edward. The body was exhumed again in 2003 in hopes of solving the mystery of her death. Unexpectedly, two bodies—those of McCrea and Sara McNeil—were found in the grave. [...] The 1822 move had placed McCrea's remains atop the <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> of McNeil (who died in 1799 of natural causes). [...] The skeletons of both were largely complete, except that McCrea's skull was missing, {{possibly}} due to reported grave-looting in the 19th century. The bodies were exhumed again in 2005 for further analysis, and were this time reburied in separate graves.|$|E
500|$|One curious side-effect of the {{constant}} spray of sea-water over Stroma – apart from making the drinking water brackish and giving the air a constant salt taste – was that it mummified the corpses {{of some of the}} island's inhabitants. They were housed in a mausoleum in the south-east corner of Stroma, built by the Kennedy family in 1677. The building still stands, although it is now unroofed; it comprises a two-storey structure which incorporates a <b>burial</b> <b>vault</b> and a doocot. The building was constructed from grey flagstones and pink sandstone quoins, measuring [...] by [...] externally and standing [...] high. The lintel of the door has the inscription [...] "I.K."
