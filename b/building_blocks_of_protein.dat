25|$|Ammonia {{is both a}} {{metabolic}} {{waste and}} a metabolic input throughout the biosphere. It is {{an important source of}} nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N2 gas. Therefore, nitrogen fixation is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter.

In 2000, Trifonov with Berezovsky and Grosberg studied protein sequences and tried to identify simple sequential elements in proteins.

We show that geometrical constraints imposed by chain connectivity, compactness, and the avoidance of steric clashes can be encompassed in a natural way using a three-body potential and lead to a selection in structure space, independent of chemical details. Strikingly, secondary motifs such as hairpins, sheets, and helices, which are the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> folds, emerge as the chosen structures for segments of the protein backbone based just on elementary geometrical considerations...|$|E

A significant num-ber of these form macromolecular complexes, among them the ribosome, proteasome, and thermosome, which are expressed at high levels.

40|$|Protein {{function}} prediction, i. e. {{classification of}} proteins {{according to their}} biological function, is an important task in bioinformatics.

This is in agreement with the biological thinking that considers motifs to be the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> sequences. We focus on proteins annotated as enzymes, and show that despite the fact that motif composition is a very high dimensional representation of a sequence, that most classes of enzymes can be classified using a handful of motifs, yielding accurate and interpretable classifiers.

40|$|Activation of a naïve T cell is {{a highly}} {{energetic}} event, which requires an increase in metabolism.

We have found that glutamine in particular is required for both proliferative as well as effector function. We have evidence that glutamine regulates ERK signaling and that ERK in turn may also regulate glutamine transport.

50|$|In a {{small number}} of {{reported}} familial dysautonomia cases, researchers have identified other mutations that cause a change in amino acids (the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins).</b> In these cases, arginine is replaced by proline at position 696 in the IKAP protein's chain of amino acids (also written as Arg696Pro), or proline is replaced by leucine at position 914 (also written as Pro914Leu). People with one of these improper amino acid substitutions also have the skipping mutation. Together, these mutations cause the resulting IKAP protein to malfunction.|$|R
