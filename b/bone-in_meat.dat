50|$|In January 1982 it was {{announced}} that Anglo Irish Beef Group had won a £25.5m contract to supply beef to Iraq. The contract involved supplying 9,000 tonnes of boneless consumer cuts and frozen <b>bone-in</b> <b>meat</b> and was part of an overall order for 54,000 tonnes of beef placed by Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Meat on the bone, {{also called}} <b>bone-in</b> <b>meat</b> is meat that is sold with {{some or all}} of the bones {{included}} in the cut or portion, i.e. meat that has not been filleted. The phrase [...] "on the bone" [...] can also be applied to specific types of meat, most commonly ham on the bone, and to fish. Meat or fish on the bone may be cooked and served with the bones still included or the bones may be removed at some stage in the preparation.|$|E
40|$|The meat sub-sector {{is among}} the most {{important}} agricultural sub-sectors in Morocco. Since the middle of the 1980 s, red meat and poultry underwent deep reforms, all related to trade and price liberalization. Nowadays, with the prospects of growing market liberalization in the context of multilateral (WTO) and bilateral (FTA with the US, the Association Agreement with the EU) agreements, the question of the domestic meat competitiveness is being raised more than before. The objective {{of this paper is to}} contribute to answering that question using appropriate quantitative tools. The methodology is based on the value-chain concept and uses nominal and effective coefficients along with the domestic resource coefficient (DRC) to assess domestic comparative advantage. Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) allows us to implement alternative policy experiments related to bilateral and multilateral commitments. The calculation of the cost-competitiveness index shows that Moroccan beef (Standard <b>bone-in</b> <b>meat)</b> and poultry could not compete with French and American products. However, Moroccan beef remains relatively more competitive than poultry. Besides, the DRC is 1 for beef and 1. 34 for poultry meaning that Morocco seems to have no comparative advantage in producing poultry while neutrality is registered for beef. Lastly, among interesting policy experiments, the combined scenario of an import tariff reduction, currency devaluation and a technical progress shows the best impact on the domestic meat competitiveness. In fact, with this scenario which aims at larger Moroccan market openness, the DRC improves by 21 % for beef and 31 % for poultry. This is also the only experiment that allows probable comparative advantage for poultry in Morocco...|$|E
50|$|The {{bone marrow}} of animals {{is widely used}} by humans as food. It {{consists}} of yellow marrow contained in long bones. There is also red marrow, this contains more nutrients than yellow marrow. It {{may be found in}} <b>bone-in</b> cuts of <b>meat</b> purchased from a butcher or supermarket.|$|R
40|$|Avaliou-se a suplementação de ractopamina associada à restrição alimentar em rações com elevado teor de lisina sobre a composição de cortes suínos. Foram utilizados 30 suínos machos castrados (peso 107, 2 ± 6, 2 kg), recebendo as dietas experimentais durante 28 dias pré-abate. Foi utilizado um delineamento em blocos casualizados em fatorial 2 x 2 + 1 (dois níveis de ractopamina – 0 ou 5 ppm – em rações com 1, 03 % de lisina total; fornecidas à vontade ou 15 % de restrição, e um tratamento controle, ad libitum, sem ractopamina, contendo 0, 8 % de lisina total) com seis repetições. Os cortes foram obtidos da carcaça esquerda resfriada. Foram avaliados o rendimento do filezinho (RFIL), as porcentagens de carne no pernil (PCPER), a paleta (PCPAL), a sobrepaleta (PCSOP) e o carré (PCCAR) e a espessura (EB), a flexibilidade (FB), a quantidade de carne (QCB), a gordura (QGB) e a relação carne:gordura (RCGB) da barrriga. A ractopamina aumentou o RFIL, PCPER, PCPAL, PCSOP, PCCAR e RCGB quando comparada com rações sem ractopamina e 1, 03 % de lisina. Comparado ao controle, a ractopamina aumentou o PCCAR e a RCGB; diminuiu o QGB e, quando associada à restrição, aumentou a PCPER. A restrição diminuiu a FB. O uso de ractopamina aumenta a porcentagem de carne nos cortes suínos e a restrição alimentar diminui a FB. This study {{evaluated}} the supplementation of ractopamine associated with feeding restriction in diets with high lysine content on {{the composition of}} pork cuts. Thirty barrows (107. 2 ± 6. 2 kg) were utilized, receiving the experimental diets during 28 days before slaughter. The randomized block design was applied in a 2 x 2 + 1 factorial (two levels of ractopamine – 0 or 5 ppm – in rations with 1. 03 % of total lysine; ad libitum or 15 % feed restriction; and a control treatment, ad libitum, without ractopamine, with 0. 8 % of total lysine) with six replicates. The cuts {{were obtained from the}} left chilled carcass. The tenderloin percentage (RFIL), the ham (PCPER), shoulder (PCPAL), boneless shoulder (PCSOP) and <b>bone-in</b> loin (PCCAR) <b>meat</b> percentage, the average thickness (EB), flexibility (FB), amount of meat (QCB), fat (QGB) and meat:fat ratio of the belly (RCGB) were evaluated. The ractopamine increased RFIL, PCPER, PCPAL, PCSOP, PCCAR and RCGB when compared to diets without ractopamine and 1. 03 % of lysine. Compared to the control, ractopamine increased PCCAR and RCGB; decreased QGB; and when associated with the feed restriction, increased PCPER. Feed restriction decreased FB. The use of ractopamine increases the meat percentage in pork cuts and feed restriction decreases FB...|$|R
40|$|The study {{discusses}} {{and presents}} the archaeological phenomena of burial practices {{observed in the}} graves of the Early Avar Age cemetery of Szegvár-Oromdűlő. Besides orientation, these are {{the three types of}} differently formed graves, the stumped variant of fractional animal burials, the spatial separation of the deceased and the accompanying animal remains, and the custom of interring pottery and <b>bone-in</b> <b>meat</b> (lamb rump bone) into graves. It analyses these important but so far not thoroughly exploited groups of sources in regard of the 6 - 7 th century burials of a larger geographical unit, the Trans-Tisa (Tiszántúl) region, since the population of this region can be better characterized by their funerary practices than their tangible cultural heritage. In addition, it refers to {{the presence or absence of}} these characteristics in the burials of a smaller area within the investigated region — the territory bordered by the Körös, Tisza and Maros Rivers — dating to the second half of the Avar Age, and through this, to their continuity. It delineates the grave goods of female and male burials which represent the inheritance of the first generation among the graves of the Trans-Tisa region. Their common feature is their different provenance. Thus there are grave goods with Eastern European, steppe connections, grave goods of Byzantine taste or origin, as well as grave goods of local, Gepidic provenance among them. Communities of the Trans-Tisa region in the 6 - 7 th century Carpathian Basin are characterized by a chain of significant archaeological phenomena of burial customs exclusively attributed to them, which were commonly spread within a certain area and continuously practiced for generations. Based on these features, the population that settled here can be well outlined in respect of origin, traditions and cultural affiliation. In the author’s opinion it can be presumed by the sparse reports of Byzantine sources that this region was occupied and inhabited by a population referred to as Kutrigurs by contemporary sources and steppe people led by them...|$|E
