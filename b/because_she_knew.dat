25|$|On April 17 in Mexico City, {{the police}} raided one of Constanzo's {{properties}} in Atizapán. They discovered piles of homosexual pornography and a hidden ritual chamber with an altar. This prompted {{the police to}} question people in Mexico City's homosexual community {{to see if they}} had any leads on Constanzo's whereabouts. The Mexican police stated that no evidence was found at the scene to link Constanzo or his men to any murders committed there. They said they saw altars and other ritualistic belongings, but did not find any traces of blood. No men were arrested at the scene, but the police managed to arrest a lady called María Teresa Quintana Rodríguez, sister of one of Constanzo's lovers and henchmen. The police also discovered that Aldrete's purse and other belongings were left behind, which prompted them to conclude that Constanzo probably murdered her <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> too much about the inner workings of his cult group. The police stated that they did not see Aldrete with the group when they arrived in Mexico City. They thought that Constanzo might have buried her somewhere in the city. U.S. authorities, however, believed that Aldrete purposely left her belongings behind to confuse investigators and make it appear that she was dead. On April 24, the police arrested Víctor Manuel Antúnez Flores and Salvador Antonio Villaluz, who were hiding in one of Constanzo's properties in Juárez neighborhood.|$|E

Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message.

500|$|Although Safran {{initially}} {{intended the}} series {{to be an}} ensemble, with Alex the lead protagonist, this changed after Chopra was cast.

Although the character was initially written as Caucasian, Safran completely rewrote her character with Chopra in his mind, tweaking her background as she became half-Indian and spent ten years in Mumbai. Her casting also helped change Alex's personality; in one change, the [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] Alex became [...] "fun and warm". Safran initially focused on the character's dark side, {{saying that he had}} never imagined a positive side: [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control.

500|$|Following Chopra's casting, {{the series}} {{underwent}} a significant change. Safran had initially {{intended to make}} the show as an ensemble drama with no obvious lead, but after Chopra's casting, Alex became the main character and the show was re-structured around her. The character was initially written to be white, which was also re-written, keeping Chopra in mind. The background of the character was tweaked by making her half-Indian, with an additional backstory of Alex having spent ten years in Mumbai, India. Apart from changing her ethnicity, Safran completely re-envisioned the character. For example, Alex was initially written as [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] but was re-written as [...] "fun and warm". Earlier, the series was supposed {{to focus on the}} character's dark side because Safran had never imagined Alex having a positive side, which changed after Chopra stepped in the role.

Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that he was gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that she could be a good single mother. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult.|$|E

500|$|Beckinsale's second film {{appearance}} of 2001 {{was in the}} romantic comedy Serendipity as the love interest of John Cusack. It was filmed directly after Pearl Harbor and Beckinsale found it [...] "a real relief to return to something slightly more familiar." [...] Turan praised the [...] "appealing and believable" [...] leads, adding that Beckinsale [...] "reinforces the strong impression she made in Cold Comfort Farm, The Golden Bowl, and The Last Days of Disco" [...] after [...] "recovering nicely" [...] from her appearance in the much-maligned Pearl Harbor. Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that [...] "Beckinsale's talents haven't been mined as effectively in any other film since Cold Comfort Farm." [...] McCarthy found her [...] "energetic and appealing" [...] while Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times described her as [...] "luminous but determined." [...] In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Ebert described her as [...] "a good actress, but {{not good enough to}} play this dumb." [...] The film has grossed over $77 million at the worldwide box office. In 2002 Beckinsale starred in Lisa Cholodenko's Laurel Canyon as a strait-laced academic who finds herself increasingly attracted to her free-spirited future mother-in-law. The independent film was another opportunity for Beckinsale to work with Christian Bale, her Prince of Jutland co‑star. She found their sex scene awkward <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> Bale well: [...] "If it was a stranger, it would have been easier." [...] While Frances McDormand's performance as Bale's mother was widely praised, Beckinsale received negative reviews. Holden found the film [...] "superbly acted, with the exception of Ms.Beckinsale, whose tense, colourless Alex conveys no inner life." [...] Schwarzbaum was unimpressed by the [...] "tedious" [...] characters and criticized [...] "the fussy performances of Bale and Beckinsale" [...] in particular. The film has grossed over $4million worldwide.|$|E
