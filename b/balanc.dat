Hiring,. promotion, tenure, and salary differentials have been discriminatory against women. Women are not fairly represented on art studies, art education, or art history faculties. Lack of visibility in exhibitions, publications, and on college faculties has madeit difficult for women to present themselves as serious artists and teachers. The influence of the women's movement on attitudes and social change, laws which prohibitdiscrimination in education and employment, and affirmative action programs are discussed.

Condensation and {{sublimation}} {{of water}} vapors (and CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O vapors also) in the Earth atmosphere {{must be accompanied}} by emission of latent heats on characteristic frequencies marked in absorption spectra. Calculated wave lengths completely explain all peaks observed for these gases in the near IR. Established phenomena require further investigations, re-estimation of atmospheric heat balances and so on. Investigation of analogical peaks in atmospheres of other planets can be used for analyses of their structures. PACS: 68. 03. Fg; 92. 60. Jq; 92. 60.
