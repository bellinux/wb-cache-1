5|$|Beatty's first {{newspaper}} was the Beatty <b>Bullfrog</b> Miner, which began publishing in 1905 {{and went out}} of business in 1909. The Rhyolite Herald was the region's most important paper, starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10,000 by 1909. It ceased publication in 1912, and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947. The Beatty Bulletin, a supplement to the Goldfield News, was published from then through 1956.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bullfrog</b> Productions {{developed}} Dungeon Keeper 2 {{with a team}} {{of around}} fifty people. The team included people involved in the original Dungeon Keeper, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted to capitalize on the original game's success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of the original game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{they were}} {{supplied}} from local wild populations, but overexploitation {{led to a}} diminution in the supply. This resulted {{in the development of}} frog farming and a global trade in frogs. The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China. The annual global trade in the American <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.|$|E

5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large <b>bullfrog,</b> a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 is a {{strategy}} game developed by <b>Bullfrog</b> Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1999 for Microsoft Windows. The sequel to Dungeon Keeper, the player takes {{the role of a}} 'dungeon keeper', building and defending an underground dungeon from the would-be heroes that invade it, as well as from other keepers. In the campaign mode, the player is charged with recovering the portal gems from each area in order to open a portal to the surface. The player can also construct a dungeon without strict objectives, and multiplayer is supported over a network.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Keeper {{took over}} two years to develop, and an {{expansion}} pack, a Direct3D version, and a level editor were released. Midway through development, Molyneux decided to leave <b>Bullfrog</b> when the game was complete, which was the motivation for its success. Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the uniqueness and depth. Dungeon Keeper was re-released on gog.com in 2011, and on Origin in 2016. A fan-made mod, KeeperFX, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. Dungeon Keeper {{was followed by a}} sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2, in 1999, and influenced games such as Lego Rock Raiders and Ghost Master.|$|E

5|$|Populous: The Beginning is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} {{and is the}} third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by <b>Bullfrog</b> Productions. The game was released in 1998 on Microsoft Windows, and in 1999 for the PlayStation. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player {{in the role of}} a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation port was {{developed}} by Krisalis Software, and released in 1995. The Mega CD port features CD soundtrack, and {{was developed}} by Domark and released in the same year. <b>Bullfrog</b> developed the Mega Drive port, which was mostly complete by April 1995, and the Saturn port, released in October 1995. Other ports include the Amiga CD32, Atari Jaguar, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Macintosh. Mark Healey handled the graphics for the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo Entertainment System versions. The graphics were completed in three days. The PC version was released on gog.com on 9 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E

30|$|Invasive American <b>bullfrogs</b> [Rana catesbeiana (Lithobates catesbeianus)] are outcompeting and predating {{on native}} biota and {{contributing}} to reductions in biodiversity worldwide. Current methods for controlling American <b>bullfrogs</b> are incapable of stopping their expansion, thus more cost-effective and broadly applicable methods are needed. Although chemical control compounds {{have been identified as}} effective for removing other invasive amphibians, none have been tested for American <b>bullfrogs.</b> Our objective was to expand on previous research and test the efficacy of 10 potential chemical control compounds for removing invasive American <b>bullfrogs.</b> After a dermal spray-application of 4 Â ml, we found 3 compounds (i.e., chloroxylenol, rotenone with permethrin, and caffeine) at 5 â€“ 10 Â % concentrations in water were 100 Â % lethal for adult American <b>bullfrogs.</b> Chloroxylenol and rotenone with permethrin were fast acting with time-to-death < 2 Â h. This research presents a first-step toward incorporating chemical control as part of integrated pest management strategy for controlling invasive American <b>bullfrogs.</b> Follow-up studies on delivery systems and reducing non-target hazards should ensue with these compounds to confirm their effectiveness and safety for removing invasive American <b>bullfrogs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American <b>bullfrog</b> (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the <b>bullfrog,</b> was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the <b>bullfrog,</b> the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

30|$|From 1940 â€“ 1990, American <b>bullfrogs</b> were {{introduced}} {{as a food}} source worldwide and populations now exist throughout western North America, Oceania (Pacific Ocean islands), Asia, Europe, the Caribbean, and South America (Staples and Cowie 2001; Witmer and Lewis 2001; Lever 2003; Govindarajulu 2004; Boersma et al. 2006; Palen 2006). Since their introduction, many populations have expanded their range. American <b>bullfrogs</b> are responsible for negative ecological effects, including declines in native biota from intense predation and competition (Kats and Ferrer 2003; Snow and Witmer 2010). American <b>bullfrogs</b> {{have been difficult to}} control because of their high mobility, generalized eating habits, and high reproductive capacity (Moyle 1973; Adams and Pearl 2007). Both tadpoles and adult <b>bullfrogs</b> are voracious feeders and can consume benthic algae and the eggs and young of native invertebrates and vertebrates (Bury and Whelan 1984). Once established, invasive American <b>bullfrogs</b> directly compete with native birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes for resources (Bury and Whelan 1984; Dâ€™Amore 2012). Additionally, the tadpoles of American <b>bullfrogs</b> alter aquatic vegetation by regulating primary production and nutrient cycling (e.g., Pryor 2003).|$|R
