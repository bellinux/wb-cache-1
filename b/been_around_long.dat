Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>long</b> enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited. It is great." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Distant Worlds II {{concert in}} Stockholm, the {{additional}} pieces performed {{were added to}} the setlist, and for every concert afterward different songs out of that rotation have been chosen for each performance. [...] "Kiss Me Goodbye" [...] from Final Fantasy XII was played at the June 18, 2010 Detroit show, though it was not officially added to the general setlist. It was played again at the April 1, 2011 concert in New York City, which featured an expanded setlist over two concerts. In April 2011 Square Enix announced that the concert series was expected to run for at least three more years. Uematsu has said that he prefers for the tour to add arrangements of older pieces from the series, as he feels that they are what fans are more interested in; he and Roth intend to continue to add more arrangements to the setlist. He was hesitant for pieces from Final Fantasy XIII and XIV to be added, as he did not feel that they had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>long</b> enough to build a strong following like the older songs.|$|E

[...] On February 2, 2011, accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed like she had not rehearsed her moves enough. Both her representatives and the director denied the rumors, and Åkerlund commenting, [...] " [...] been great throughout the entire process. [...] I've <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>long</b> enough to know when an artist gives it their all, and to me it doesn't get better than this. This video is gonna be fucking awesome! It's all Britney." [...] Her manager Larry Rudolph later confirmed that a body double was actually used, but only for the scenes in which Spears fights herself. The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho. He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals, but also incorporated [...] "her own flavor", by adding a small shuffle of steps in her heels. The length of the dresses also presented a problem, and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues. They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, [...] "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them." ...|$|E

50|$|A certain uneasiness {{regarding}} BWV 565 had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>long</b> {{before the}} 1980s. From Hilgenfeldt in 1850 to Elgar in the 1920s to Basso {{in the late}} 1970s the extraordinary popularity of the piece {{seems to have taken}} scholars and musicians by surprise. From Mendelssohn's prophetic words, that it was something for both the erudite and the masses, only the latter part had really worked out. But scholars were getting involved: they analysed the composition's counterpoint as substandard. They said it was stylistically too close to the galant style to be an early 18th century composition. Its presumed time of composition had been shifted around: the composition was too modern to have been composed by a young Bach, and too simplistic to have been composed by a middle-aged Bach. Bach's genius could be invoked to explain the dislocated modernity in an immature composition, as commentators had done most of the time, but more and more scholars felt unsatisfied with such intangible explanation.|$|E

Despite being a new and obscure band, critics welcomed Supergrass as a voice of youth, {{in part because they}} were so young, but also because their music was fresh, exuberant and fast-paced. Even before being signed to a major label [...] "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] had been put at number five on John Peel's Festive 50 of 1994.
