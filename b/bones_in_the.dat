5|$|The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera Diplodocus and Barosaurus {{had very}} similar limb <b>bones.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, many {{isolated}} limb bones were automatically attributed to Diplodocus, but may, in fact, {{have belonged to}} Barosaurus. Fossil remains of Diplodocus have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison Formation.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear of the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge {{on the surface of}} the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} paramedics {{had found her}} and gave chase. The pursuit was ended at Heron Cross when Sabina jumped from a 12-metre (40ft) high bridge onto the A50. Having broken <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall, she was taken to hospital. On 6 June 2008 she was arrested while {{recovering}} at University Hospital of North Staffordshire, and was later discharged from hospital on 11 September, at which point she was charged with murder.|$|E
50|$|The femur is <b>the</b> only <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{thigh and}} serves for an {{attachment}} site for all muscles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thigh. The {{head of the}} femur articulates with <b>the</b> acetabulum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pelvic <b>bone</b> forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint.

5|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull of Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (<b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|The next {{ruler of}} Calakmul, Split Earth, is {{mentioned}} {{on a pair}} of carved <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Tikal king Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. He was ruling by November 695 but it is not known if he was a legitimate member of the Calakmul dynasty or whether he was a pretender placed on the throne by Tikal.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth {{metatarsal}} bone {{is a long}} <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foot.

5|$|The {{three small}} <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit {{sound from the}} eardrum to the inner ear. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{secondary}} burial {{were arranged}} without respect for anatomical order; {{it is plausible}} {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to the secondary burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. <b>Bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E
5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the excess heat through their skin.|$|E

5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with its taxonomically close relative, the blue wildebeest. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The jaws {{contained}} {{sharp teeth}} which were compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty. The teeth on the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of the upper jaw) were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw) which had a straight posterior edge. The upper jaw bore 30 teeth, with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower jaw held 22 teeth.|$|E
5|$|The only extant {{remains of}} dodos taken to Europe in the 17th century are a dried head and {{foot in the}} Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a foot once housed in the British Museum but now lost, a skull in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum, and an upper jaw and leg <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Museum, Prague. The last two were rediscovered and {{identified}} as dodo remains in the mid-19th century. Several stuffed dodos were also mentioned in old museum inventories, but none {{are known to have}} survived. Apart from these remains, a dried foot, which belonged to the Dutch professor Pieter Pauw, was mentioned by Carolus Clusius in 1605. Its provenance is unknown, and it is now lost, but it may have been collected during the Van Neck voyage.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this work showed higher values of removal torque in 9 M than in IR specimens. It was {{expected}} since the longer healing time (9 M) promotes better osseointegration than immediate implant removal.

5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with hyoid <b>bones,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of the {{wildebeest}} are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa.

In some animals, the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E

5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the fossils}} {{discovered}} in the Mussentuchit are scattered and disarticulated, with intact skeletons being relatively rare. Although the lakes did not actively destroy bones, it was not particularly conducive to good preservation either due to the long duration of the burial process. Before burial, scavengers could have disrupted the skeletal material, which {{is evident in the}} severed Eolambia tibiae bearing tooth marks {{discovered in the}} Cifelli #2 quarry. The regression of the lake could have occasionally created bogs, but they would not have been permanent enough to entrap and preserve larger vertebrates. Action by water currents seems to {{have played a role in}} the deposition of Eolambia <b>bones</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cifelli #2 quarry, where the bones are largely deposited at 28°, 69°, 93°, 131° and 161° azimuth (i.e. relative to north). These directions would have been parallel or sub-parallel to the edges of the lake, indicating orientation by lake currents, except for the 69° and 93° azimuths, which probably represent river currents.|$|E
