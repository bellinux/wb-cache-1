40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{different}} types of provisions explicitly addressing small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including micro firms (MSMEs), in regional trade agreements (RTAs). The analysis covers the 270 RTAs currently in force and notified to the WTO as of April 2016. The analysis shows that half of all the notified RTAs, namely 136 agreements, incorporate at least one provision mentioning explicitly SMEs. These SMEs-related provisions are highly heterogeneous and differ in terms of location in the RTA, language, scope and commitments. Many of the SMEsrelated provisions are only found in a single or couple of RTAs. A limited but increasing number of RTAs incorporate specific provisions in dedicated articles or even chapters on SMEs. Although the number of detailed SMEs-related provisions included in a given RTA has tended to increase in recent years, most SMEs-related provisions remain couched in <b>best</b> <b>endeavour</b> language. The two most common categories of SMEs-related provisions found in RTAs are provisions (1) promoting cooperation on SMEs and (2) specifying that SMEs and/or programs supporting SMEs are not covered by the RTAs' obligations provisions. Other types of SMEs-related provisions, incorporated in a limited number of RTAs, refer, inter alia, to government procurement, trade facilitation, electronic commerce, intellectual property, or transparency...|$|R

To the best of my judgment, the original photograph is a very exact average of its components; not one feature in it appears identical with that of any one of them, but it contains a resemblance to all, and is not more like to one of them than to another. However, the judgment of the wood engraver is different. His rendering of the composite has made it exactly like one of its components, which it must be borne in mind he had never seen. It is just as though an artist drawing a child had produced a portrait closely resembling its deceased father, having overlooked an equally strong likeness to its deceased mother, which was apparent to its relatives.

As a matter of fact, I believe stealthy wood-cutters from Tanugamanono were above me in the wood and answerable for the blows; as for the laughter, a woman and two children had come and asked Fanny's leave to go up shrimp-fishing in the burn; beyond doubt, it was these I heard.

40|$|Maldives is a {{small island}} nation which has high {{prospects}} for ports development as it {{is located at the}} heart of the world's main container region (i. e.

Therefore the country has yet to make its <b>best</b> <b>endeavour</b> to develop its Sen/ice Ports into Landlord Ports (mainly through privatisation) to effectively and efficiently, cater to the vast potential of rapid economic growth of Maldives, due to the tremendous upsurge of international trade, that has been revealed during the last two decades. Ports development is importance to the economic development of the country as it increases revenue and enhance social welfare through employment. In the past ports developed have been on "ad hoc" basis (with no plan or direction) and port infrastructure development decisions depend on various ministries and organisations for various port projects, although the judicial system of the country states that all ports should be regulated by the Maldives Ports Authority which led to flaws in port governance structure and created ambiguity and conflict of interest that undoubtedly harm the stability of the port development process. Therefore this thesis provide justified recommendations, based of triangulated views from governmental and non-governmental ministries and organisations (obtained through interviews and questionnaires), to develop a comprehensive Ports Development policy, which would specify the port development objectives, process and strategies to foster competition and hinder monopoly in order to attain high efficiency. Hence the implementation of a stringent Port Development Policy is bound to maximise profit from ports sector to the national economy and to strengthen the port related legal base. Furthermore recommendations are provided to improve Port Governance structure (i. e. Port management, legislation, monopoly and competition, privatisation, and efficiency) to enhance private sector participation in order to develop, regulate and manage future ports in a systematic mannerFaculty of Social Science & Busines...|$|R

When Mansoul and Diabolus had heard this relation of things, they with one consent concluded to use their <b>best</b> <b>endeavour</b> to keep Emmanuel out of Mansoul, and sent old Ill-Pause, of whom you have heard before, to tell the Prince and his captains so.

So some went and told to Emmanuel what old Ill-Pause, a Diabolonian in Mansoul, had said. Then said the Prince, 'I must try the power of my sword, for I will not (for all the rebellions and repulses that Mansoul has made against me) raise my siege and depart, but will assuredly take my Mansoul, and deliver it from the hand of her enemy.' And with that he gave out a commandment that Captain Boanerges, Captain Conviction, Captain Judgment, and Captain Execution should forthwith march up to Ear-gate with trumpets sounding, colours flying, and with shouting for the battle. Also he would that Captain Credence should join himself with them. Emmanuel, moreover, gave order that Captain Good-Hope and Captain Charity should draw themselves up before Eye-gate. He bid also that the rest of his captains and their men should place themselves for the best of their advantage against the enemy round about the town; and all was done as he had commanded.|$|R
