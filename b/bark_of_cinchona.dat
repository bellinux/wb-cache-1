The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the fever tree bark.

50|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known pathogens, and began having a major impact on human {{survival}} about 10,000 years ago with the birth of agriculture. The development of virulence in the parasite has been demonstrated using genomic mapping of samples from this period, confirming the emergence of genes conferring a reduced risk of developing the malaria infection. References to the disease can be found in manuscripts from ancient Egypt, India and China, illustrating its wide geographical distribution. The first treatment identified is thought to be Quinine, one of four alkaloids from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Cinchona</b> tree. Originally it was used by the tribes of Ecuador and Peru for treating fevers. Its role in treating malaria was recognised and recorded first by an Augustine monk from Lima, Peru in 1633. Seven years later the drug had reached Europe and was being used widely with the name 'the Jesuit's bark'. From this point onwards the use of Quinine and the public interest in malaria increased, although the compound was not isolated and identified as the active ingredient until 1820. By the mid-1880s the Dutch had grown vast plantations <b>of</b> <b>cinchona</b> trees and monopolised the world market.|$|R

40|$|Quinine is an {{alkaloid}} {{with powerful}} antimalarial activity, {{isolated from the}} <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> Peru’s <b>cinchona</b> trees. Quinidine is an erythro diastereoisomer of quinine also exhibiting antimalarial activity.

The results suggest that the stabilising effect of this IHB is weaker or comparable with respect to the stabilising effect of the preferred mutual orientation of the two moieties.

[...] Quinine has been used in unextracted form by Europeans since at least the early 17th century. It was first used to treat malaria in Rome in 1631. During the 17th century, malaria was endemic to the swamps and marshes surrounding the city of Rome. Malaria was {{responsible for the deaths of}} several popes, many cardinals and countless common Roman citizens. Most of the priests trained in Rome had seen malaria victims and were familiar with the shivering brought on by the febrile phase of the disease. The Jesuit brother Agostino Salumbrino (1564-1642), an apothecary by training who lived in Lima, observed the Quechua using the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cinchona</b> tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from rigors, it was still a successful medicine for malaria. At the first opportunity, Salumbrino sent a small quantity to Rome to test as a malaria treatment. In the years that followed, cinchona bark, known as Jesuit's bark or Peruvian <b>bark,</b> became one <b>of</b> the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe. When King Charles II was cured of malaria at the end of the 17th Century with quinine, it became popular in London. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs took over.|$|R

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{infectious}} diseases in tropical and subtropical countries, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Each year, it affects nearly 400 - 900 million people and causes approximately one to three million deaths annually. 1 Human malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax, however, P. falciparum is the most prevalent for the disease and it is responsible for about 80 % of infections and 90 % of deaths. 2 The first effective treatment (17 th century) against the P. falciparum parasite was the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> <b>cinchona</b> tree, which contains quinine, a quinoline alkaloid. A number of medicines have been developed to treat malaria with chloroquine and its derivatives 3 as the mainstay therapy.

40|$|Quinine {{is widely}} used for the common symptom of leg cramps. Quinine tablets require a prescription, but quinine and the product from which it is derived, cinchona, are also {{available}} without prescription. They are components of over-the-counter remedies for many common symptoms, of nutrition products, and of beverages such as tonic water and bitter lemon. Although quinine {{has been used for}} centuries, initially as an extract from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cinchona</b> tree, allergic reactions to quinine can be severe and can affect multiple organs. These allergic reactions can cause thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, liver toxicity, and neurological abnormalities. Because quinine use is often intermittent, defining quinine as a cause of an acute disorder may be difficult. Moreover, since quinine use is often self-regulated, patients may not mention it in response to direct questions about medication use, adding to diagnostic difficulty. The diversity and severity of quinine-associated disorders and the difficulties of diagnosis are illustrated by the presentation of 4 case histories. Awareness of the variety of potential quinine-associated reactions is important for accurate diagnosis and critical for prevention of recurrent illness...|$|R
50|$|John Sappington {{provided}} medical services, was {{a financial}} lender, and imported and exported {{goods to the}} Missouri area. He established two stores near Arrow Rock that sold goods, loaned money, processed salt, and milled lumber. Once he had achieved financial success, Sappington {{was able to be}} more experimental with his medical practice. He focused his energy on the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cinchona</b> tree, the substance used to create quinine. Malaria, scarlet fever, yellow fever, and influenza, were prominent along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Sappington developed a preventative pill using quinine that was soon in demand across the country. It was marketed as an anti-fever pill, but Sappington also instructed some of his relatives to take the pills to prevent malaria. Most physicians were still treating malaria by bloodletting the patient and administering calomel. Sappington’s pill to prevent malaria—and also used to cure malaria—was controversial due to its novelty and unfamiliarity. The pill remained in high demand, however, and many other physicians began to develop their own anti-malaria pills after Sappington published the formula in his medical treatise, “Theory and Treatment of Fevers.” He is often regarded as the first physician to successfully and effectively use quinine to treat malaria.|$|R
30|$|It {{therefore}} {{remains unclear}} how Foscolo, his doctors and his biographers missed this point. Given the long-stand- ness of the urethral structure treatment {{it is less}} likely that obstruction was spontaneously resolved. The fact that references to urological problems do not appear in Foscolo’s correspondence from 1819 onward could be associated to an improvement of his lower urinary tract symptoms. It should be noticed that the management of urinary tract infections at that time included hospitalization, bed rest, attention to diet, plasters, narcotics, herbal enemas and douches and judicious bleeding (direct bleeding, cupping and leeches). Most of the above mentioned treatments are practically ineffective. Foscolo was treated with baths and hydrotherapy, bloodletting and Chinese Quinine as well. Quinine is an alkaloid derived from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cinchona</b> tree. It {{has been used as}} an antimalarial drug since before 1633. It has also antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties and at that time it has been used in common cold preparations for that purpose. It reduce the sensitivity of muscle cells to stimuli that cause them to contract, and prolong the time it takes for the muscle to contract. The above properties of Quinine suggest effectiveness in the treatment of prostatitis related pain and storage lower urinary tract symptoms, however reduced contraction rate may progress to chronic urinary retention (especially when bladder outlet obstruction occurs). Moreover, Foscolo used to eat excessive quantities of rhubarb and drink its extract in order to treat his illness. The leaves of this vegetable contain high levels of oxalic acid, which causes serious problems in the liver and kidney and even a small amount is sufficient for someone to get sick.|$|R
