25|$|On May 5, {{two days}} after the murder, Saadon was {{declared}} absent. That same day, the white Subaru was found abandoned in an orchard near Beit Lahiya. Investigators discovered a large <b>blood</b> <b>stain</b> in the car, as well as Saadon's fingerprints. As a result, extensive searches were conducted, but they produced nothing. A month later the searches were halted.|$|E
25|$|Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall {{was treated}} for a {{concussion}} and facial injuries, and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in his book published in 2012 that the FBI had located {{a bullet in the}} soil ten inches below the <b>blood</b> <b>stain</b> where Irvin had lain wounded, supporting Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from near point blank range.|$|E
40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{detection}} and identification of <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> rely largely on visual examination followed by presumptive tests such as Kastle-Meyer, Leuco-malachite green or luminol. Although these tests are useful, they can produce false positives {{and can also}} {{have a negative impact}} on subsequent DNA tests. A novel application of visible wavelength reflectance hyperspectral imaging has been used for the detection and positive identification of <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> in a non contact and non destructive manner on a range of coloured substrates. The identification of <b>blood</b> <b>staining</b> was based on the unique visible absorption spectrum of haemoglobin between 400 and 500 nm. Images illustrating successful discrimination of <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> from nine red substances are included. It has also been possible to distinguish between blood and approximately 40 other reddish stains. The technique was also successfully used to detect latent <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> deposited on white filter paper at dilutions of up to 1 in 512 folds and on red tissue at dilutions of up to 1 in 32 folds. Finally, in a blind trial, the method successfully detected and identified a total of 9 <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> on a red T-shirt...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Moyne regained consciousness, {{and in a}} few minutes, {{a doctor}} and {{ambulance}} arrived. Moyne was rushed to a British military hospital in Cairo, and admitted at 1:40p.m., in critical condition, having lost a great deal of blood through gross hemorrhaging and suffering from shock. Five minutes later, he was given the first of three blood transfusions, causing his condition to improve. After he complained of a burning sensation down his right leg and an inability to move it, X-rays revealed an injury to his thoracic vertebrae. Later, his right arm also became paralyzed {{as a result of the}} neck wound. Doctors were reluctant to operate until his condition improved, but at 5:30, a lumbar puncture revealed a <b>blood</b> <b>stain,</b> and it was decided to operate. He was given another blood transfusion, and in the operation that followed, surgeons removed the bullet lodged near the second lumbar vertebra and discovered the injuries to the colon and large intestine, while the neck wound and finger wounds were cleaned. Soon after the operation, his condition began to deteriorate, and he died at 8:40 pm, aged 64.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large <b>blood</b> <b>stain</b> on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would see him at home.|$|E
25|$|Kathy returns a {{few days}} later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh <b>blood</b> <b>stain</b> is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>stains</b> are an {{important}} part of forensic statistics, as the analysis of blood drop collisions may help to picture the event that had previously gone on. Commonly <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> are an elliptical shape, because of this <b>blood</b> <b>stains</b> are usually easy to determine the blood droplets angle through the formula “α = arcsin d/a”. In this formula 'a' and 'd' are simply estimations of the axis of the ellipse. From these calculations, a visualization of the event causing the stains is able to be drawn, and alongside further information such as the velocity of the entity that caused such stains.|$|R

2500|$|Writer Isaac Babel {{was arrested}} in May 1939, and {{according}} to his confession paper (which contained a <b>blood</b> <b>stain)</b> he [...] "confessed" [...] to {{being a member of}} Trotskyist organization and being recruited by French writer André Malraux to spy for France. In the final interrogation, he retracted his confession and wrote letters to the prosecutor's office stating that he had implicated innocent people, but to no avail. Babel was tried before an NKVD troika and convicted of simultaneously spying for the French, Austrians, and Leon Trotsky, as well as [...] "membership in a terrorist organization." [...] On 27 January 1940, he was shot in Butyrka prison.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the series}} {{returning}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 6, the improbable comeback continued, with Curt Schilling pitching on an ankle that had three sutures {{wrapped in a}} bloody [...] white sock (red with a <b>blood</b> <b>stain).</b> Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings to lead the team to victory. Mark Bellhorn also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run {{home run in the}} fourth inning. Originally called a double, the umpires conferred and agreed that the ball had actually gone into the stands before falling back into the field of play, which was apparent to the television audience but angered Yankees fans. A key play came {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning with Derek Jeter on first and Alex Rodríguez facing Bronson Arroyo. Rodríguez hit a ground ball down the first base line. Arroyo fielded it and reached out to tag him as he raced down the line. Rodríguez slapped at the ball and it came loose, rolling down the line. Jeter scored and Rodríguez ended up on second. After conferring, however, the umpires called Rodríguez out on interference and returned Jeter to first base, the second time in the game they reversed a call. Yankees fans, upset with the calls, littered the field with debris. The umpires called police clad in riot gear to line the field in the top of the 9th inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player Tony Clark, who had played well against the Red Sox since leaving the team, to the plate as the potential winning run. Closer Keith Foulke however, struck out Clark to end the game and force a Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback on the strength of Derek Lowe's one-hit, one-run pitching and Johnny Damon's two home runs, including a grand slam in the second inning off the first pitch of reliever Javier Vázquez, and defeated the New York Yankees, 10–3. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.|$|E

60|$|Detective Robson stepped forward, and was sworn. On the 15th of June last, he said, {{he searched}} the prisoner's cottage on the Thurwell Court estate. He there {{found in the}} secret recess of a cabinet, which had {{apparently}} not been opened for some time, a dagger, produced, in a case evidently intended to hold two, and which was an exact facsimile of the one, also produced, with which the murder was committed. He found also a towel, produced, which was stained with blood, and several letters. With regard to the towel, he here added, that {{in one corner of}} the room was fixed a small basin, and on the floor just beneath, covered over by a carpet, and bearing several signs of attempted obliteration, was a large <b>blood</b> <b>stain.</b> The woman who had cleaned the cottage prior to Mr. Maddison's occupation, was in court, and would swear that the stain in question was not there at that time. He mentioned these details first, he went on to say, but the more important part of his evidence had reference to these letters, and his subsequent action with regard to them. He would call attention to one of them, he remarked, producing it, and allow the bench to draw their own conclusions. He would read it to them, and they could then examine it for themselves.|$|E
