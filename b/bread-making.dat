5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the bread kosher (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher of both the Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers that bind water and oil in the <b>bread-making</b> process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not kosher. Ovadia Angel and his team produced emulsifiers from hydrogenated fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this new knowledge to other companies.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{improved}} the <b>bread-making</b> operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines. He often slept overnight at the bakery {{during the week}} {{and returned to his}} home in Talpiot when the bakery was closed on Shabbat. Later he built an apartment over the bakery to house his family. In the 1930s, the bakery employed 25 workers and had one production line that turned out 8,500 loaves per day. It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and a horse and wagon. During World War II, the bakery contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens that could turn out 540 loaves per hour.|$|E

25|$|For long periods, {{urban areas}} such as Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Córdoba welcomed European {{immigrants}}, including, above all, those of Italian and Spanish descent. Nevertheless, {{there was also a}} migratory flow of German, Swiss, and Middle-Eastern immigrants arriving in Argentina. Among the countless changes this melting pot brought was the enrichment of the culinary art. Dishes such as pasta, pizza, pucheros (stews), croquetas (fritter)s, sauces, embutidos (sausages), and chicken and meat courses brought a wider scope of options to daily menus. Furthermore, the <b>bread-making,</b> dessert, pastry, and dairy industries have achieved considerable development in this region.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, she {{published}} a simple manual about <b>bread-making.</b> In the same year, {{the department of}} the Iowa college was enlarged, renamed the “School of Domestic Economy,” and placed upon a level with the other schools comprising the college. At {{the same time it}} was ordered by the trustees that Ewing should be given the title of Professor of Domestic Economy. In the same year, at the solicitation of Bishop John H. Vincent, Ewing opened a summer cooking school at Chautauqua, New York, which she conducted as its dean every July and August, until 1900; every season she delivered a series of lectures there on household topics. Salad and Salad Making and Vegetables and Vegetable Cooking were published in 1884.|$|E
25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for <b>bread-making</b> and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.|$|E

2500|$|After Dauglish {{had spent}} four years {{introducing}} his <b>bread-making</b> system his health worsened; this has been said {{to be due to}} the labour and excitement involved, and he visited various health resorts throughout Europe.

2500|$|Cookery Manuals was {{published}} in 1890. During 1891, she gave nearly 250 lectures and lessons on the preparation of food. In the following year, an association was formed in Chicago, called the National Household Economic Association. In 1893, this organization was enlarged. Under its auspices, Ewing gave free lessons in <b>bread-making</b> in the “model kitchen" [...] of the women's building at the World's Fair.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{activities}} in the civil parishes within the park are poorly diversified and support familial businesses. Civil construction, although {{one of the larger}} economic supporters, has little effect on local incomes, since a majority of the employed come from outside the region. Although there are a few larger operations (<b>bread-making,</b> construction and saw-milling/carpentry) most are small owner-operators, that support local consumption or occasional sales. Frequently, artesnal producers have disappeared, and have not been replaced by mass-produced or comparable vendors.|$|E
2500|$|Bahrain's local Persian {{community}} have heavily influenced the country's local food dishes. One {{of the most}} notable local delicacies {{of the people in}} Bahrain is mahyawa, consumed in Southern Iran as well, is a watery earth brick coloured sauce made from sardines and consumed with bread or other food. Bahrain's Persians are also famous in Bahrain for <b>bread-making.</b> Another local delicacy is [...] "pishoo" [...] made from rose water (golab) and agar agar. Other food items consumed are similar to Persian cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were some}} {{differences}} {{for those who}} stayed in the highlands. Men started working with the new businesses and industries, while women {{were not able to}} work as wage laborers. Women earned cash in other ways as street vendors or as maids in ladino homes. Some of the street vendors sold handmade crafts to tourist in the cities, and these women organized into artisan collectives. They also formed other types of economic collectives such as for <b>bread-making</b> and vegetable gardening. [...] Rural women could also remain in their village and still contribute to the collective. This was an early instance of women organizing and working to better themselves. The maids earned cash, but suffered abuse in the ladino plantations. Physical and sexual abuse were commonly committed by the ladino landowners against the women who worked in their homes. Independence, new skills, and grievances gained from these experiences led women to join the EZLN.|$|E

60|$|Of all {{processes}} of aeration in <b>bread-making,</b> {{the oldest and}} most time-honored is by fermentation.

"Moreover, I {{am glad to}} {{see that}} in New Bedford, recently, a public course of {{instruction}} in the art of <b>bread-making</b> has been commenced by a lady, and that classes of the most respectable young and married ladies in the place are attending them. These are steps in the right direction, and show that our fair countrywomen, with the grand good sense which is their leading characteristic, are resolved to supply whatever in our national life is wanting.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was some}} time before the perfect loaf appeared, for <b>bread-making</b> is an art not easily learned, and Aunt Plenty was very {{thorough}} in her teaching; so Rose studied yeast first, and through various stages of cake and biscuit came at last to the crowning glory of the [...] "handsome, wholesome loaf."

60|$|<b>Bread-making</b> can be {{cultivated}} to any extent {{as a fine}} art; and {{the various}} kinds of biscuit, tea-rusks, twists, rolls, into which bread may be made, are much better worth a housekeeper's ambition than the getting up of rich and expensive cake or confections. There are also varieties of material which are rich in good effects. Unbolted flour, altogether more wholesome than the fine wheat, and when properly prepared more palatable, rye-flour and corn-meal, each affording a thousand attractive possibilities,--each {{and all of these}} come under the general laws of breadstuffs, and are worth a careful attention.|$|E
60|$|With {{little to}} do, time became an {{intolerable}} burden to them. This naturally made them still lazier. They sank into a physical lethargy {{which there was}} no escaping, and which made them rebel at the performance of the smallest chore. One morning when {{it was his turn to}} cook the common breakfast, Weatherbee rolled out of his blankets, and to the snoring of his companion, lighted first the slush lamp and then the fire. The kettles were frozen hard, and there was no water in the cabin with which to wash. But he did not mind that. Waiting for it to thaw, he sliced the bacon and plunged into the hateful task of <b>bread-making.</b> Cuthfert had been slyly watching through his half-closed lids.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should not}} the {{professor}} lecture on home chemistry, devoting his first lecture to <b>bread-making?</b> and why might not {{a batch of}} bread be made and baked and exhibited to the class, together with specimens of morbid anatomy in the bread line,--the sour cotton bread of the baker; the rough, big-holed bread; the heavy, fossil bread; the bitter bread of too much yeast,--and the causes of their defects pointed out? And so {{with regard to the}} various articles of food,--why might not chemical lectures be given on all of them, one after another? In short, {{it would be easy to}} trace out a course of lectures on common things to occupy a whole year, and for which the pupils, whenever they come to have homes of their own, will thank the lecturer to the last day of their life.|$|E
60|$|For a {{whole week}} Madeline held clinics where she expounded the {{scientific}} method of modern <b>bread-making.</b> She got {{a good deal of}} enjoyment out of her lectures. What boys these great hulking fellows were! She saw through their simple ruses. Some of them were grave as deacons; others wore expressions important enough to have fitted the faces of statesmen signing government treaties. These cowboys were children; they needed to be governed; but in order to govern them they had to be humored. A more light-hearted, fun-loving crowd of boys could not have been found. And they were grown men. Stillwell explained that the exuberance of spirits lay in the difference in their fortunes. Twenty-seven cowboys, in relays of nine, worked eight hours a day. That had never been heard of before in the West. Stillwell declared that cowboys from all points of the compass would head their horses toward Her Majesty's Rancho.|$|E
6000|$|She turned, {{and called}} in a voice more clear than soft. It rang through the thick oak of the hall and kitchen doors more effectually than a bell's summons. Mrs. Gill, who was deep in <b>bread-making,</b> came with hands and apron in culinary case, not having dared to stop to rub the dough from the one or to shake the flour from the other. Her {{mistress}} had never called a servant in that voice save once before, {{and that was when}} she had seen from the window Tartar in full tug with two carriers' dogs, each of them a match for him in size, if not in courage, and their masters standing by, encouraging their animals, while hers was unbefriended. Then indeed she had summoned John as if the Day of Judgment were at hand. Nor had she waited for the said John's coming, but had walked out into the lane bonnetless, and after informing the carriers that she held them far less of men than the three brutes whirling and worrying in the dust before them, had put her hands round the thick neck of the largest of the curs, and given her whole strength to the essay of choking it from Tartar's torn and bleeding eye, just above and below which organ the vengeful fangs were inserted. Five or six men were presently on the spot to help her, but she never thanked one of them. [...] "They might have come before if their will had been good," [...] she said. She had not a word for anybody {{during the rest of the}} day, but sat near the hall fire till evening watching and tending Tartar, who lay all gory, stiff, and swelled on a mat at her feet. She wept furtively over him sometimes, and murmured the softest words of pity and endearment, in tones whose music the old, scarred, canine warrior acknowledged by licking her hand or her sandal alternately with his own red wounds. As to John, his lady turned a cold shoulder on him for a week afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|Bread I {{at first}} made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire {{out of doors}} on a shingle {{or the end of}} a stick of timber sawed off in {{building}} my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of <b>bread-making,</b> consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I came to [...] "good, sweet, wholesome bread," [...] the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire--some precious bottleful, I suppose, first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land--this seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable--for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process--and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still {{in the land of the}} living; and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket, which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal-soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. [...] "Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquae paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu." [...] Which I take to mean,--"Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover," [...] that is, in a baking kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.|$|E
