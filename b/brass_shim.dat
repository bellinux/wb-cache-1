40|$|Abstract. Surface {{mobility}} is used {{to describe}} the dynamic characteristics of the power transmission over the contact area between two connected structures. Due to the complexity of structures, it is difficult to build analytical models for various structures to calculate surface mobility theoretically. Therefore, without well established theoretical model to apply, the best way is to measure the surface mobility of each structure separately to obtain its dynamic characteristics of the power transmission. This paper proposes a method to experimentally measure the surface mobility over a two-dimensional contact area subject to a uniform velocity excitation. An experimental model of a rectangular thin plate with two opposite simply-supported edges is built up to validate the method. A <b>brass</b> <b>shim</b> {{is used to}} simulate the condition of the simply-supported edge. The results show that the method of the measurement derived is practicable and the reason causing the errors of the measurement is also investigated...|$|E

They must be installed perpendicular to the strings and their height is adjusted using thin <b>brass</b> <b>shims.</b> They are sometimes difficult to remove and a broken agraffe usually requires a lengthy repair (especially if they are broken into the plate). Worn string holes sometimes cause a buzzing sound which can be corrected by filing inside the agraffe string hole to remove the imperfection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract approved: Friction dampers {{have been}} used {{successfully}} to dissipate seismic energy in steel and concrete structures. The application is new to timber structures. The objectives of this research were to design a slotted bolted connection (SBC) and evaluate its potential as a passive energy damper in timber brace. The research was conducted in three phases: (1) preliminary tests, (2) single and dual SBC tests, and (3) tests of the dual SBC mounted to a timber brace. The preliminary tests showed that <b>brass</b> <b>shims</b> and compression spring washers contributed to repeatable performance, validated the SBC design using results from the literature, and demonstrated that an SBC with predictable hysteresis characteristics could be designed and fabricated. The expected slip force of 33. 4 kN per bolt was reached. In Phase II, tests with six single SBC specimens were conducted following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) cyclic test protocol. The six SBCs were later assembled in pairs to make three dua...|$|R
5000|$|Until the mid-1950s, poured Babbitt {{bearings}} {{were common}} in automotive applications. The Babbitt was {{poured into the}} block or caps using a form. Tin-based Babbitts were used as they could {{stand up to the}} impact loads found on the connecting rods and crankshaft. The poured Babbitt bearings were kept thin. The rods and caps would have shims that could be peeled off as the Babbitt wore. Ford was known to use two [...]002" [...] on each cap and Babbitt that was 86% tin, 7% copper, 7% antimony (see the KRW catalogs for the Model T). Steel shims were used as the <b>brass</b> <b>shims</b> used today tend to compress over time contributing to shorter bearing life. The poured Babbitt bearings commonly get over 50,000 miles of use before needing replacement. Poured Babbitt bearings are also known to fail gracefully allowing the car to be driven for extended periods of time. The failed bearing is not likely to damage the crankshaft.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the limits}} to {{characterization}} of tissues at the microscopic level is the substantial {{costs associated with the}} instrumentation required for such investigations. The use of strain gages for displacement or force measurements can be adapted to this microscopic scale provided the gages are incorporated into a transducer consisting of a curved geometry. Materials and Methods: Uniaxial strain gages 13 mm (L) × 6 mm (W) were secured to 0. 2 -mm thick <b>brass</b> <b>shim</b> stock fabricated to yield a 12. 5 -mm diameter semicircle with mounting tabs on either end. The terminal ends of the strain gage mounting pads were connected to an adjustable strain gage amplifier with adjustable gain and offset. For displacement calibration, the transducer was secured to the jaws of a digital caliper. Caliper displacement was set to ± 0. 25 mm increments from 0 to a maximum of ± 1. 5 mm. In this configuration, positive represents tension. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000, and 5000 to observe nonlinearity. For each of three displacement calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded at each distance with the mean output at absolute distances averaged across each of three runs for each of six transducers. Using the same transducers, a mass balance was used to identify the unique individual mass associated with a total of 10 masses to within ± 10 μg. The masses were sequentially secured to the transducer and the respective output voltage recorded. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000 and 5000. For each of three force calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded with respect to the force generated by the suspended masses. The mean output across each of three runs for each of six transducers was subjected to linear regression. Results and Discussion: All transducers displayed good linearity when calibrated for displacement with regression R 2 values of 0. 9994, 0. 9967, and 0. 9941 for amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. Further, in displacement mode, the transducers provided a mean output of 0. 66, 1. 01, and 3. 86 V/mm at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. In force mode, regression R 2 in excess of 0. 9995 were observed over all amplifier gain settings examined. When employed as force transducers, the devices provided mean outputs of 0. 60, 1. 15, and 5. 85 V/N at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. The response of these devices to either applied displacement or force permits the use of a single device type to be used as either a displacement or force transducer. The electrical output in either mode at modest amplification gains of 5000 combined with excellent linearity affords the use of these devices for studies where characterization of tissues requires mN and μm level resolution. Conclusions: A transducer employing a strain gage had been configured so as to function as either a displacement or force measuring instrument. The resulting device displays high linearity and electrical output even at modest amplifier gains...|$|E
