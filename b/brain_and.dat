5|$|Dopamine (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the <b>brain,</b> <b>and</b> absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E

5|$|Clearing waste: CSF {{allows for}} the removal of waste {{products}} from the <b>brain,</b> <b>and</b> is critical in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} subunit of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα. Cβ is found abundantly in the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> in lower levels in other tissues, while Cγ is most likely expressed in the testis.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can cause}} severe {{damage to the}} <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> kidneys and, ultimately, death. By {{mimicking}} calcium, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier. It degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons, reduces their numbers, interferes with neurotransmission routes, and decreases neuronal growth.|$|E

5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E

5|$|The OF Tape Vol. 2 is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop {{collective}} Odd Future, released March 20, 2012, on Odd Future Records and RED Distribution. It {{serves as the}} sequel from their debut mixtape, The Odd Future Tape (2008). The album features appearances from Odd Future members Hodgy Beats, Tyler, The Creator, Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Mike G, The Internet, Taco, Jasper Dolphin, Left <b>Brain</b> <b>and</b> L-Boy, {{as well as an}} uncredited appearance from Earl Sweatshirt. Production on the album was primarily handled by Left <b>Brain</b> <b>and</b> Tyler, The Creator, with Frank Ocean, Hal Williams and Matt Martians also receiving production credits. Lyrically the album ranges from being serious to being satirical, with some tracks offering an overly absurdist take on rap.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} most cases of {{epilepsy}} is unknown. Some cases occur {{as the result}} of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the <b>brain,</b> <b>and</b> birth defects, through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, {{consisting}} of the cerebral hemispheres, forms the largest part of the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> is situated above the other brain structures. The outer region of the hemispheres, the cerebral cortex, is grey matter, {{consisting of}} cortical layers of neurons. Each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes.|$|E
