50|$|The name <b>biomimetics</b> {{was coined}} by Otto Schmitt in the 1950s. The term bionics was coined by Jack E. Steele in 1958 {{while working at}} the Aeronautics Division House at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. However, terms like {{biomimicry}} or <b>biomimetics</b> are more preferred in the technology world in efforts to avoid confusion between the medical term bionics. Coincidentally, Martin Caidin used the word for his 1972 novel Cyborg, which inspired the series The Six Million Dollar Man. Caidin was a long-time aviation industry writer before turning to fiction full-time.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Biomimetics</b> or {{biomimicry}} is the {{imitation of}} the models, systems, and elements of nature {{for the purpose of}} solving complex human problems. The terms [...] "biomimetics" [...] and [...] "biomimicry" [...] derive from βίος (bios), life, and μίμησις (mīmēsis), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (mīmeisthai), to imitate, from μῖμος (mimos), actor. A closely related field is bionics.Living organisms have evolved well-adapted structures and materials over geological time through natural selection. <b>Biomimetics</b> has given rise to new technologies inspired by biological solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, hydrophobicity, self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biomimetics</b> {{could in}} {{principle}} {{be applied in}} many fields. Because {{of the complexity of}} biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes.|$|E
