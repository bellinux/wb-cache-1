In reality tensions remained, and only under Emperor Joseph II was a climate of religious tolerance brought in with the Edict of 8 November 1781.

40|$|An {{extension}} of Dijkstra's guarded command language is studied, including unbounded demonic choice and a backtrack operator.

All operators are monotonic in Nelson's ordering, but backtracking is not monotonic in <b>Back's</b> <b>ordering</b> and sequential composition is not monotonic for the deadlock ordering.
