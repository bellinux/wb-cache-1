In order {{to take advantage of}} the properties of modern clustered SMP architectures a hybrid method using a combination of OpenMP nested in MPI is advocated. The development of the reference implementation is proposed. Furthermore, a few load balancing strategies are introduced: time scheduling at the annealing process level, clustering at the <b>basic</b> <b>annealing</b> step level and suspending—inside of the <b>basic</b> <b>annealing</b> step. The application of the algorithm to VRPTW—a generally accepted benchmark problem—is used to illustrate their positive influence on execution time and the quality of results.

A basic form of the algorithm is shown to produce matchings with nearly maximum cardinality such that the average time required grows as a polynomial {{in the number of}} nodes in the graph. In contrast, it is also shown that for a certain family of graphs, neither the <b>basic</b> <b>annealing</b> algorithm, nor any other algorithm in a fairly large related class of algorithms, can find maximum cardinality matchings in polynomial average time...|$|E

40|$|Capabilities of {{enhanced}} simulated-annealing-based algorithms {{in solving}} process planning problems in reconfigurable manufacturing are investigated. The algorithms are enhanced by combining variants of the simulated annealing technique with other algorithm {{concepts such as}} (i) knowledge exploitation and (ii) parallelism. Four configurations of simulated annealing algorithms are devised and engaged to solve an instance of a process planning problem in reconfigurable manufacturing systems. These configurations include; a <b>basic</b> simulated <b>annealing</b> algorithm, {{a variant of the}} <b>basic</b> simulated <b>annealing</b> algorithm, a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm coupled with auxiliary knowledge and a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm implemented in a quasi-parallel architecture. Although differences in performances were observed, the implemented algorithms are capable of obtaining good solutions in reasonable time. Experimental results show that the performances of the variants of simulated annealing based algorithms are better in comparison to a <b>basic</b> simulated <b>annealing</b> algorithm. A computational analysis and comparison using ANOVA indicates that improvements towards a better optimal solution can be gained by implementing variants of the simulated annealing algorithm. In addition, little speed gains can be obtained by implementing variants of the simulated annealing algorithms that are coupled with other algorithmic concepts...|$|R

40|$|Experimentally, thermal {{annealing}} {{is known to}} be a factor which enables a number of different integrated circuits (IC's) to recover their operating characteristics after suffering radiation damage in the space radiation environment; thus, decreasing and limiting long term cumulative total-dose effects. This annealing is also known to be accelerated at elevated temperatures both during and after irradiation. Linear response theory (LRT) was applied, and a linear response function (LRF) to predict the radiation/annealing response of sensitive parameters of IC's for long term (several months or years) exposure to the space radiation environment were constructed. Compressing the annealing process from several years in orbit to just a few hours or days in the laboratory is achieved by subjecting the IC to elevated temperatures or by increasing the typical spaceflight dose rate by several orders of magnitude for simultaneous radiation/annealing only. The accomplishments are as follows: (1) the test procedure to make predictions of the radiation response was developed; (2) the calculation of the shift in the threshold potential due to the charge distribution in the oxide was written; (3) electron tunneling processes from the bulk Si to the oxide region in an MOS IC were estimated; (4) in order to connect the experimental annealing data to the theoretical model, constants of the model of the <b>basic</b> <b>annealing</b> process were established; (5) experimental data obtained at elevated temperatures were analyzed; (6) time compression and reliability of predictions for the long term region were shown; (7) a method to compress test time and to make predictions of response for the nonlinear region was proposed; and (8) nonlinearity of the LRF with respect to log(t) was calculated theoretically from a model...|$|E

30|$|The {{simulated}} annealing algorithm {{was first introduced}} into reservoir engineering. Farmer (1992) applied this algorithm to generate rock models with two-point geostatistics properties. Qian (1993) introduced Markov random field theory into the <b>basic</b> simulated <b>annealing</b> algorithm and thus transformed it into a probabilistic uphill algorithm. When solving automatic history matching problems, Ouenes et al. (1993) applied a {{simulated annealing}} algorithm directly while Carter and Romero (2002) combined it with other techniques such as geostatistics, a pilot point method, and a genetic algorithm. The convergence of the simulated annealing algorithm is sensitive to the choice of initial temperature and reduction factor. If the reduction factor is too large, many extreme points will be missed. However, if the reduction factor is too small, the simulated annealing algorithm will converge very slowly.|$|R
40|$|When {{faced with}} a {{combinatorial}} optimization problem, practitioners often turn to black-box search heuristics such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. In black-box optimization, the problem-specific components are limited to functions that (1) generate candidate solutions, and (2) evaluate {{the quality of a}} given solution. A primary reason for the popularity of black-box optimization is its ease of implementation. The <b>basic</b> simulated <b>annealing</b> search algorithm can be implemented in roughly 30 - 50 lines of any modern programming language, not counting the problem-specific local-move and cost-evaluation functions. This search algorithm is so simple that it is often rewritten from scratch for each new application rather than being reused.

The framework and the main result 1. 1. The set–up (I) : linear chain models. A number of disordered models of linear chains undergoing localization or pinning effects can be put into the following general framework. Let S: = {Sn} n= 0, 1, [...] . be a process with Sn taking values in Z d, d ∈ N:= { 1, 2, [...] . } and law P. The disorder in the system is given by a sequence ω: = {ωn} n of IID random variables of law P, with ωn taking values in Γ ⊆ R. As a matter of fact we could simply set Γ = R, however several examples that we will present deal with the case in which Γ is a finite set and in this situation our results require no measurability conditions.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we discuss the design of {{optimization}} algorithms for cognitive wireless networks (CWNs). Maximizing the perceived network performance towards applications by selecting appropriate protocols and carrying out cross-layer optimization on the resulting stack is a key functionality of any CWN. We take a “black box ” approach to the problem and study the use of simulated annealing for solving it. To improve the convergence rate of the basic algorithm we apply machine learning techniques to construct graphical models on the perceived relations between network stack parameters and application-specific network utilities. We test our optimizer design both in a simulation environment {{as well as on}} a network testbed with low-power radios. Our results show that even <b>basic</b> simulated <b>annealing</b> works well, but simple graphical models can further increase the convergence rate. However, use of sophisticated models such as Bayesian networks does not always lead to substantially better performance. The results indicate that enhanced simulated annealing indeed appears to be a promising foundation for future cognitive engine designs. I...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{synthesis}} of platinum nitride opens {{the possibility of}} novel platinum-group metal nitrides to exist.

Several plausible structures have been evaluated by ab initio calculations using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method, in order to investigate the ruthenium nitride structural and electronic properties. In fact, the predicted symmetry of stoichiometric RuN matches the experimental diffraction data. RuN crystallizes with NaCl-type structure at room temperature with cell-parameter somewhat larger than predicted by calculations. However we found a marginal chemical strength in these nitrides.

40|$|The {{standard}} cell placement (SCP) {{problem is a}} well-studied placement problem, as {{it is an important}} step in the VLSI design process.

The SCP problem is solved using mainly four <b>basic</b> methods: simulated <b>annealing,</b> quadratic placement, min-cut placement, and force-directed placement. These methods are adequate for small chip sizes. Nowadays, chip sizes are very large, and hence, hybrid methods are employed to solve the SCP problem instead of the original methods by themselves. This paper presents a new hybrid method for the SCP problem using a swarm intelligence-based (SI) method, called SwarmRW (swarm random walk), on top of a min-cut based partitioner. The resulting placer, called sPL (swarm placer), was tested on the PEKU benchmark suite and compared with several related placers.

Simultaneously, the experimental phenomenon of incomplete electrical activation of boron atoms in the "tail" region is naturally explained. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
