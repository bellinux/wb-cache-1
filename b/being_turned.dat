5|$|After the conflict, Portland Castle was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of Works in 1949 and opened to the public in 1955. The Ministry decided to present the interior as it might have looked in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th-century additions and changes. The Captain's House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999, but with the facility's closure, this part of the fort was also opened to visitors, the house <b>being</b> <b>turned</b> into a visitor facility.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. <b>Being</b> <b>turned</b> several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by <b>being</b> <b>turned</b> inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E

5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture.

The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from <b>being</b> <b>turned</b> into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E

25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human <b>beings</b> <b>turn</b> their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human <b>beings</b> <b>turn</b> their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|R

Before they could launch an assault, however, {{the battalion}} was relieved by the 19th Battalion and on 28 February the 19th crossed the Mavelo. Following this the Japanese withdrew back towards the mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations, and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the Wulwut river.

5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were <b>being</b> <b>turned</b> out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became {{prosector}} for the Zoological Society of London and remained there for twelve years. When he left the London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting {{from the time of}} Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, primatologist Jane Goodall studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees. In 1962, he was hired as the assistant director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) in Atlanta after <b>being</b> <b>turned</b> down for the position of director.|$|E

After <b>being</b> <b>turned</b> down for the job he announced his intention to retire as a player {{at the end of his}} contract in summer 1978.
