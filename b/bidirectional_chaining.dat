40|$|We {{present a}} {{protocol}} for authenticating Mobile IPv 6 connections, addressing requirements {{established in the}} relevant Internet Draft [2]. The protocol imposes minimal computational requirements on mobile nodes, uses as few messages as possible, and may be adapted to resist denial of service attacks. Our protocol has two parts, an initialization phase and an update phase. The initialization phase {{can take advantage of}} local public-key infrastructure, a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>chain</b> of trust, or operate without prior authenticating information. Each execution of the update phase uses the shared secret established in the previous phase to maintain security of the mobile connection. We have formally verified the correctness of the protocol using the finite-state analysis tool Murϕ, which has been used previously to analyze hardware designs and security properties of several protocols...|$|R
40|$|This article conceptualizes service supply chains {{according}} to the Unified Service Theory, which defines services as <b>bidirectional</b> supply <b>chains</b> that have customers both providing resources to and receiving resources from service providers. We establish how eight traditional roles in manufacturing supply chains are assumed by customers in service supply chains. Those service–customer roles include component supplier, labor, design engineer, production manager, product, quality assurance, inventory, and competitor. We describe how these eight roles are manifested in both business-to-consumer and business-to-business service contexts. We confirm the distinctiveness of these eight customer roles through an initial empirical study and show how the roles are manifested across different types of services. We then demonstrate how these distinctive customer roles can {{form the basis for}} service supply chain innovation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} verify {{different}} SCP hypothesizes of industrial organization, relations among market structure, R&D conduct {{and performance in}} world telecom manufacturing are empirically tested. As found in research, in middle-low oligopoly market of telecom manufacturing, there are significant influence of market concentration and R&D conduct on performance, vice versa. The result shows that S (concentration degree), P (gross profit rate and revenue), C (R&D intensity) represent <b>bidirectional</b> causality <b>chain</b> in middle-low oligopoly market, which partly supports conduct determination hypothesis and structure determination hypothesis respectively. As also found, technology standard regulation evidently influences performance and market structure, macro economy remarkably influences market structure, performance and R&D intensity, and R&D intensity significantly promotes macro economy. It’s suggested to utilize advantage of scale from market concentration and avoid its disadvantage, and to promote R&D input for long-term performance and macro economy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a new inventory control technique for large-scale supply chains including repairs. The part flow is bidirectional with broken parts propagated upstream for repair. It {{is well known}} that available optimization techniques for inventory control for <b>bidirectional</b> stochastic supply <b>chains</b> are computationally intractable and also necessitate several simplify-ing assumptions. In contrast, the proposed approach is an adaptive scheme that scales well to practically interesting large-scale multi-item supply chains. Furthermore, practical issues such as stochas-tic transport delays, manufacturing times, and repair times and probabilistic characterization of part repair success are handled in a unified framework. The control scheme is based on a hierar-chical two-level architecture that comprises an adaptive set point generator and a lower-level order-up-to policy. An application to aircraft supply chains involving multiple original equipment man-ufacturers (OEMs), depots, bases, squadrons, and planes is also investigated.

40|$|For remote areas, {{small-scale}} local biodiesel {{production is}} particularly attractive if producers and consumers are the same. Such supply chains are labeled as bidirectional. However, {{little is known}} on how raw material supply, transportation, logistics, production and operations uncertainties impact the operational performance of such <b>Bidirectional</b> Biodiesel Supply <b>Chains.</b> This paper contributes by exploring these uncertainties in a multiple case study, directed at mobile processing of rubber seeds, in a remote area. Scientifically, the paper contributes by identifying several novel sources of uncertainty: a short-term perspective, lack of knowledge and the previously unrecognized influence of the local government. Additionally, based on these findings, an extended theoretical framework is proposed which links sources of uncertainty to operational performance. The study provides also insights for stakeholders aiming to increase local biofuel production and provides a stepping-stone to investigate adequate measures to manage the identified uncertainties.

Dipolar interactions between nano- and micron sized colloids lead to their assembly into domains with well-defined local order. The particles with a single dipole induced by an external field assemble into linear chains and clusters. However, to achieve the formation of multidirectionally organized nano-or microassemblies with tunable physical characteristics, more sophisticated interaction tools are needed. Here we demonstrate that such complex interactions can be introduced {{in the form of}} two independent, non-interacting dipoles (double-dipoles) within a microparticle. We show how this can be achieved by the simultaneous application of alternating current (AC) -electric field and uniform magnetic field to dispersions of superparamagnetic microspheres. Depending on their timing and intensity, concurrent electric and magnetic fields lead to the formation of <b>bidirectional</b> particle <b>chains,</b> colloidal networks, and discrete crystals. We investigate the mechanistic details of the assembly process, and identify and classify the non-equilibrium states formed. The morphologies of different experimental states are in excellent correlation with our theoretical predictions based on Brownian dynamics simulations combined with a structural analysis based on local energy parameters. This novel methodology of introducing and interpreting double-dipolar particle interactions may assist in the assembly of colloidal coatings, dynamically reconfigurable particle networks, and bidirectional active structures.

40|$|Due to the {{functional}} importance of bovine milk protein polymorphisms, their correct discrimination {{is of great}} interest both from a scientific and practical point of view. Nowadays {{a large number of}} commercial platforms are available for semiautomated or fully automated SNP geno-typing. However, in some cases the use of simple and rather cheap methods is an effective tool to be implemented within one’s own laboratory for the routine analysis of a specific SNP. The present paper describes two simple tests based on the <b>bidirectional</b> allele-specific polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction (BAS-PCR) developed for the identification of β -casein (CSN 2) B and I genetic variants. The practical application of the two methods on a panel of 84 Italian Brown bulls and 100 Italian Friesian cows is also discussed, including the biological significance of the two genetic variants and the importance of taking their occurrence into account when linkage analyses are performed on milk functional properties. A combined system for analysing milk protein variants by isoelectrofocusing (IEF) and the BAS-PCR assay developed for CSN 2 * I is described. </span...|$|R
40|$|Under {{third-party}} power intervention (TPPI), {{which increases}} uncertainty in task environments, complex channel power interplays and restructuring are indispensable among green supply chain members {{as they move}} toward sustainable collaborative relationships for increased viability and competitive advantage. From the resource dependence perspective, this work presents a novel conceptual model to investigate the influence {{of political and social}} power on channel power restructuring and induced green supply chain collaboration in brander-retailer <b>bidirectional</b> green supply <b>chains</b> of fashionable consumer electronics products (FCEPs). An FCEP refers to the consumer electronics product (e. g., personal computers, mobile phones, computer notebooks, and game consoles) with the features of a well-known brand associated, a short product lifecycle, timely and fashionable design fit for market trends, and quick responsiveness to the variations of market demands. The proposed model is tested empirically using questionnaire data obtained from retailers in the FCEP brander-retailer distribution channels. Analytical results reveal that as an extension of political and social power, TPPI positively affects the reciprocal interdependence of dyadic members and reduces power asymmetry, thereby enhancing the collaborative relationship of dyadic members and leading to improved green supply chain performance. Therein, reciprocal interdependence underlying collaborative relationship is the key to reducing the external environmental uncertainties in the TPPI context...|$|R
40|$|Probabilistic time {{geography}} (PTG) {{is suggested}} {{as an extension}} of (classical) time geography, in order to present the uncertainty of an agent located at the accessible position by probability. This may provide a quantitative basis for most likely finding an agent at a location. In recent years, PTG based on normal distribution or Brown bridge has been proposed, its variance, however, is irrelevant with the agent's speed or divergent with the increase of the speed; so they are difficult to take into account application pertinence and stability. In this paper, a new method is proposed to model PTG based on Markov <b>chain.</b> Firstly, a <b>bidirectional</b> conditions Markov <b>chain</b> is modeled, the limit of which, when the moving speed is large enough, can be regarded as the Brown bridge, thus has the characteristics of digital stability. Then, the directed movement is mapped to Markov chains. The essential part is to build step length, the state space and transfer matrix of Markov chain according to the space and time position of directional movement, movement speed information, to make sure the Markov chain related to the movement speed. Finally, calculating continuously the probability distribution of the directed movement at any time by the Markov chains, it can be get the possibility of an agent located at the accessible position. Experimental results show that, the variance based on Markov chains not only is related to speed, but also is tending towards stability with increasing the agent's maximum speed...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on these}} {{observations}} and analysis, we propose a joint discriminative probabilistic framework to optimize all relevant subtasks simultaneously. This framework defines a joint probability distribution for both segmentations in sequence data and relations of segments {{in the form}} of an exponential family. This model allows tight interactions between segmentations and relations of segments and it offers a natural way for IE tasks. Since exact parameter estimation and inference are prohibitively intractable, a structured variational inference algorithm is developed to perform parameter estimation approximately. For inference, we propose a strong bi-directional MH approach to find the MAP assignments for joint segmentations and relations to explore mutual benefits on both directions, such that segmentations can aid relations, and vice-versa. Information Extraction (IE) aims at identifying specific pieces of information (data) in a unstructured or semi-structured textual document and transforming unstructured information in a corpus of documents or Web pages into a structured database. There are several representative tasks in IE: named entity recognition (NER), which aims at identifying phrases that denote types of named entities, entity relation extraction, which aims at discovering the events or relations related to the entities, and the task of coreference resolution, aims at determining whether two extracted mentions of entities refer to the same object. IE is useful for a wide variety of applications. The end-to-end performance of high-level IE systems for compound tasks is often hampered by the use of cascaded frameworks. The integrated model we proposed can alleviate some of these problems, but it is only loosely coupled. Parameter estimation is performed independently and it only allows information to flow in one direction. In this top-down integration model, the decision of the bottom sub-model could guide the decision of the upper sub-model, but not vice-versa. Thus, deep interactions and dependencies between different tasks can hardly be well captured. We have investigated and developed a cascaded framework in an attempt to consider entity extraction and qualitative domain knowledge based on undirected, discriminatively-trained probabilistic graphical models. This framework consists of two stages and it is the combination of statistical learning and first-order logic. As a pipeline model, the first stage is a base model and the second stage is used to validate and correct the errors made in the base model. We incorporated domain knowledge that can be well formulated into first-order logic to extract entity candidates from the base model. We have applied this framework and achieved encouraging results in Chinese NER on the People's Daily corpus. We perform extensive experiments on three important IE tasks using real-world datasets, namely Chinese NER, entity identification and relationship extraction from Wikipedia's encyclopedic articles, and citation matching, to test our proposed models, including the bidirectional model, the integrated model, and the joint model. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform current state-of-the-art probabilistic models, such as decoupled and joint models, illustrating the feasibility and promise of our proposed approaches. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) We present a general, strongly-coupled, and bidirectional architecture based on discriminatively trained factor graphs for information extraction, which consists of two components [...] -segmentation and relation. First we introduce joint factors connecting variables of relevant subtasks to capture dependencies and interactions between them. We then propose a strong <b>bidirectional</b> Markov <b>chain</b> Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm which allows information to flow in both directions to find the approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for all subtasks. Notably, our framework is considerably simpler to implement, and outperforms previous ones. Yu, Xiaofeng. Adviser: Zam Wai.
