5|$|On June 5, 2009, an {{apartment}} building at 1772 Second Avenue was evacuated by the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) after {{it was determined that}} the building was in danger of collapse. The evacuation of the building, as well as a mixed use building at 1768 Second Avenue/301 East 92nd Street on June 29, 2009, had delayed the contractor's plan to use controlled <b>blasting</b> to remove bedrock in the southern section of the launch box. Until the <b>blasting</b> permits could be issued, MTA required contractors to use mechanical equipment to remove the bedrock, which is slower than <b>blasting</b> out the rock. , one building had been shored up, and work was in progress on the second; MTA had rescheduled <b>blasting</b> to begin during the week of November 2.|$|E
5|$|An {{innovative}} {{drilling and}} <b>blasting</b> technique called Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the remedial works process. PCF was chosen over conventional drilling and/or <b>blasting</b> techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels.|$|E

50|$|As <b>blast</b> beats have evolved, {{different}} types and interpretations have emerged. There are four main {{variations of the}} <b>blast</b> beat: the traditional <b>blast,</b> the bomb <b>blast,</b> the hammer <b>blast</b> and the freehand <b>blast.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Blast</b> shelters are a vital form of {{protection}} from nuclear attack and {{are employed in}} civil defense. There are above-ground, below-ground, dedicated, dual-purpose, and potential <b>blast</b> shelters. Dedicated <b>blast</b> shelters are built specifically {{for the purpose of}} <b>blast</b> protection (see bunker). Dual-purpose <b>blast</b> shelters are existing structures with blast-protective properties that have been modified to accommodate people seeking protection from <b>blasts.</b> Potential <b>blast</b> shelters are existing structures or geological features exhibiting blast-protective properties that have potential to be used for protection from <b>blasts.</b>|$|R

5|$|On October 1, 2010, MTA {{awarded a}} $431 million {{contract}} to SSK Constructors (a joint venture) for the mining of the tunnels connecting the 72nd Street station {{to the existing}} 63rd Street station, and for the excavation and heavy civil structures of the 72nd Street Station. Construction was to be done through two shafts at 69th and 72nd Streets, {{the locations of the}} future entrances; shaft sinking work was started in late 2010. Projected completion of the contract was estimated at November 2013. The rock around the area is mostly Manhattan schist, and was generally considered to be a stable location for <b>blasting,</b> so <b>blasting</b> for the station commenced on January 18, 2011.|$|E
5|$|After {{the appeals}} had been exhausted, Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby {{commuted}} Fielden's and Schwab's sentences {{to life in}} prison on November 10, 1887. On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled <b>blasting</b> cap which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast blew off half his face and he survived in agony for six hours).|$|E
50|$|The first {{example is}} a hammer <b>blast.</b> The second example shows a {{traditional}} <b>blast</b> beat - essentially a skank beat played at a high tempo (this particular one leads with the bass drum, but the snare can lead as well). Example #3 shows a <b>blast</b> beat with double bass, known as a bomb <b>blast.</b> Example #4 illustrates a freehand <b>blast,</b> {{also known as a}} gravity <b>blast.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} models of <b>blast</b> brain injury {{have been implemented}} in rodents and larger animals. However, the variety of <b>blast</b> sources and the complexity of <b>blast</b> wave biophysics have made data on injury mechanisms and biomarkers difficult to analyze and compare. Recently, we showed the importance of rat position toward <b>blast</b> generated by an external shock tube. In this study, we further characterized <b>blast</b> producing moderate traumatic brain injury and defined “composite” <b>blast</b> and primary <b>blast</b> exposure set-ups. Schlieren optics visualized interaction between the head and a shock wave generated by external shock tube, revealing strong head acceleration upon positioning the rat on-axis with the shock tube (composite <b>blast),</b> but negligible skull movement upon peak overpressure exposure off-axis (primary <b>blast).</b> Brain injury signatures of a primary <b>blast</b> hitting the frontal head were assessed and compared to damage produced by composite <b>blast.</b> Low to negligible levels of neurodegeneration were found following primary <b>blast</b> compared to composite <b>blast</b> by silver staining. However, persistent gliosis in hippocampus and accumulation of GFAP/CNPase in circulation was detected after both primary and composite <b>blast.</b> Also, markers of vascular/endothelial inflammation integrin alpha/beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and L-selectin along with neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor-beta were increased in serum within 6 [*]h post-blasts and persisted for 7 [*]days thereafter. In contrast, systemic IL- 1, IL- 10, fractalkine, neuroendocrine peptide Orexin A, and VEGF receptor Neuropilin- 2 (NRP- 2) were raised predominantly after primary <b>blast</b> exposure. In conclusion, biomarkers of major pathological pathways were elevated at all <b>blast</b> set-ups. The most significant and persistent changes in neuro-glial markers were found after composite <b>blast,</b> while primary <b>blast</b> instigated prominent systemic cytokine/chemokine, Orexin A, and Neuropilin- 2 release, particularly when primary <b>blast</b> impacted rats with unprotected body...|$|R

5000|$|The bomb <b>blast</b> is {{essentially}} a combination of <b>blast</b> beat and double bass drumming. When measured in 16th notes a bomb <b>blast</b> consists of 8th notes on the snare played above a 16th notes kick drum line. Most drummers play this beat by leading with the snare, while the traditional <b>blast</b> beat is usually led with the kick. The bomb <b>blast</b> became popular among 1990s death metal bands such as Cannibal Corpse, {{which is why the}} bomb <b>blast</b> is also referred to as the [...] "Cannibal" [...] <b>blast.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Mekong River {{remained}} free of dams until 1993 {{because of}} its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course {{of some of its}} branches. In 2004, the Thai government made an agreement with China to open the river to commercial navigation by destroying rapids, which Thai Baan research had identified as important fish spawning grounds. On the Chinese side, dams were constructed. Living River Siam gathered additional Thai Baan surveys from 146 villagers in Amphoe Chiang Khong, which determined that the <b>blasting</b> of rapids had made the river water unsuitable for drinking and bathing, washed away many local riverside gardens, and decimated the populations of local plants and fish. In response to the 2004 studies, the Thai government suspended <b>blasting</b> on one of the rapids, the Khon Pi Luang.|$|E

30|$|In {{the main}} task, {{participants}} first completed a training stage to familiarize themselves with <b>blast</b> cells (both novices and experts completed the training for consistency). The training focused on teaching participants to identify <b>blast</b> cells and was patterned on the {{training in the}} NOMT. There were four blocks of training trials. Each block started with participants studying five images of <b>blast</b> cells one at a time. After studying these five images, participants then completed 15 trials where they were presented three images (one <b>blast</b> image and two non-blast images) and asked to choose the image they thought was the <b>blast</b> cell. The four training blocks had the following structure of <b>blast</b> and non-blast images: block 1 was easy <b>blast</b> versus easy non-blast, block 2 was easy <b>blast</b> versus hard non-blast, block 3 was hard <b>blast</b> versus easy non-blast, and block 4 was hard <b>blast</b> versus hard non-blast. Note that the image training used a total of 180 unique images (60 <b>blast</b> images and 120 non-blast images) from the original set of 300.|$|R
40|$|Predicting non-ideal {{airblast}} loads {{is presently}} a complex computational art requiring {{many hours of}} high-performance computing to evaluate a single <b>blast</b> scenario. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a method for predicting <b>blast</b> loads in a non-ideal environment in real time. The proposed method is incorporated in a fast-running model for rapid assessment of <b>blast</b> loads in complex configurations such as a dense urban environment or a <b>blast</b> environment behind a <b>blast</b> barrier. This paper is concerned with an accurate prediction of the <b>blast</b> loads from a bomb detonation using a neural networkbased model. The approach is demonstrated in application to the problem of predicting the <b>blast</b> loads in city streets. To train and validate the neural networks, a database of <b>blast</b> effects was developed using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) <b>blast</b> simulations.

5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand <b>blasting</b> mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E

Construction started in late 1901 and was led by Engineer E. Richter. No <b>blasting</b> was done, but difficulties arose because of the large amounts of clay, which contributed to increase costs to NOK800,000.|$|E

50|$|In some Sephardic and Ashkenazi traditions, the quavering <b>blast</b> (Teru'ah) is {{believed}} to be a string of many short-lived, broken <b>blasts</b> made by the tongue (e.g. tut-tut-tut-tut, etc.), rather than a long, trembling <b>blast</b> originating from the stomach as practised by the Yemenite and Babylonian Jewish communities. Moreover, according to Maimonides, the quavering <b>blast</b> (Teru'ah) is actually twice the length of a sustained <b>blast</b> (Teki'ah), while Rabbi Joseph Karo holds the view that the quavering <b>blast</b> is identical in length to that of a sustained <b>blast.</b> Each community is admonished to persist in the tradition which his fathers received.|$|R
