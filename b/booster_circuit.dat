A conventional booster {{such as a}} charge pump type booster or a switched capacitor booster operates with a fixed frequency clock and it's output voltage is not constant by load variation. In order to improve this problem, new converter circuit consisting of VCO, output voltage detector and DC-DC converter block is introduced.

40|$|A System-on-a-Chip (SoC) has {{millions}} of transistors connected by wires or so called Interconnects. As CMOS technologies scale down, SoC becomes {{more complex and}} denser. The delays of basic cells decrease, hereby improving logic gate and logic block delay.

In this thesis, we take a practical approach towards reducing propagation delay in long wire (Interconnect). A dynamic repeater with <b>Booster</b> enhancement <b>circuit</b> is presented and analyzed in this regard. Both switching speed and Interconnect propagation delay are significantly improved upon locally enabling the Booster to operate as a pull-up and pull-down circuit for every repeater stage.

40|$|Abstract — Current Mode Signaling Scheme-Bias {{is one of}} the {{efficient}} schemes to achieve high-speed and low power communica-tion over long On-Chip interconnects. In early days the repeaters and <b>boosters</b> <b>circuits</b> [4] are used to drive the on-chip interconnects. In this paper CMS scheme with various types of delay elements which is inserted in the circuit is used to analyze the performance in terms of power and tolerant variation. CMS scheme has an impor-tance that it has a trade-off between speed and power as in[1]. In addition, the voltage swing on the line is reduced in our proposed scheme as in [2]. By the inserting a conventional buffer as delay element the improvement in energy/bit is 87 % as in [1].

40|$|A novel {{current control}} {{technique}} is proposed to control power flow from a {{renewable energy source}} feeding a microgrid system through a three-phase parallel-connected inverter. The parallel-connected inverter ensures that the power flow from the grid with low-current total harmonic distortion even {{in the presence of}} nonlinear load. The renewable energy sources are paralleled, and the average of this constant supply is given to <b>Booster</b> <b>circuit</b> and is used to improve the power level of renewable energy sources. The current controlled voltage source inverter is used to convert DC supply into AC supply. The CCVSI is controlled by PWM techniques and the current flows are controlled. A p–q theory-based approach is used to find the reference current of the parallel-connected converter and the stability of the proposed controller is ensured by direct Lyapunov method. By applying this concept, selected harmonic can be eliminated, and the output voltage THD can be improved. The proposed project is to be simulated by using MATLAB and the results are to be compared with experimental setup. The PIC microcontroller is to be used for generating required pulses to the parallel inverter. KEYWORDS:...|$|E
40|$|An energy {{harvester}} is {{a system}} consisting of several components from different physical domains including mechanical, magnetic and electrical {{as well as the}} external circuits which regulate and store the generated energy. To design highly efficient energy harvesters, we believe that the various components of the energy harvesters need to be modelled together and in systematic manner using one simulation platform. We propose an accurate HDL model for the energy harvester and demonstrate its accuracy by validating it experimentally and comparing it with recently reported models. It is crucial to consider the various parts of the energy harvester {{in the context of a}} complete system, or else the gain at one part may come at the price of efficiency loss else where, rending the energy harvester much less efficient than before. The close mechanical-electrical interaction that takes place in energy harvesters, often lead to significant performance loss when the various parts of the energy harvesters are combined. Therefore, to address the performance loss, we propose an integrated approach to the energy harvester modelling and performance optimisation and demonstrate the effectiveness of employing such an approach by showing that it is possible to improve the performance of vibrationbased energy harvester, in terms of the effective energy stored in the super-capacitor, by 33 % through optimising the micro-generator mechanical parameters and the voltage <b>booster</b> <b>circuit</b> components...|$|E
40|$|To meet high {{performance}} 1. 5 GeV injection requirement, the white circuit {{system of the}} booster synchrotron in SRRC must be working {{in accordance with the}} 1. 5 GeV injection current state. If the booster operation current of the white circuit system deviates from the normal working point too much, the injection efficiency will be deteriorated and the white circuit bypass capacitor will be damaged. A protection system of the <b>booster</b> white <b>circuit</b> bypass capacitor dynamic current and voltage must be monitored and detected to prevent this capacitor from being damaged. The new white circuit bypass capacitor protection system was designed to detect the bypass capacitors dynamic characteristic. The interlock protection is active when the bypass capacitors work in over current or voltage reverse state, and afterward the white circuit bypass capacitor protection function is achieved.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering and the Dept. of Physics & Astronomy. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 This dissertation {{focuses on the}} problem of increasing the lifetime of wireless sensors. This problem is addressed from two different angles: energy harvesting and data compression. Energy harvesting enables a sensor to extract energy from its environment and use it to power itself or recharge its batteries. Data compression, on the other hand, allows a sensor to save energy by reducing the radio transmission bandwidth. This dissertation proposes a fractal-based photodiode fabricated on standard CMOS process as an energy harvesting device with increased efficiency. Experiments show that, the fractal based photodiodes are 6 % more efficient compared to the conventional square shaped photodiode. The fractal shape photodiode has more perimeter-to-area ratio which increases the lateral response, improving its efficiency. With increased efficiency, more current is generated but the open-circuit voltage still remains low (0 : 3 V - 0 : 45 V depending on illumination condition). These voltages have to be boosted up to higher values {{if they are going to}} be used to power up any sensory circuit or recharge a battery. We propose a switched-inductor DC-DC converter to boost the low voltage of the photodiodes to higher voltages. The proposed circuit uses two onchip switches and two off-chip components: an inductor and a capacitor. Experiments show a voltage up to 2 : 81 V can be generated from a single photodiode of 1 mm 2 area. The voltage <b>booster</b> <b>circuit</b> achieved a conversion efficiency of 59 %. Data compression was also explored in an effort to reduce energy consumption during radio transmission. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which can jointly perform the tasks of digital conversion and entropy encoding, has also been proposed in this dissertation. The joint data conversion/compression help savings in area and power resources, making it suitable for on-sensor compression. The proposed converter combines a cyclic converter architecture and Golomb-Rice entropy encoder. The converter hardware design is based on current-mode circuits and it was fabricated on a 0 : 5 m CMOS process and tested. Experiment results show a lossless compression ratio of 1 : 52 and a near-lossless compression of 5 : 2 can be achieved for 32 32 pixel imageAbstract [...] Illustrations [...] Tables [...] Acknowledgements [...] Introduction [...] Background [...] Photodiode theory and experiment [...] Lateral capacitance [...] Boost converter [...] Cyclic ADC and entropy encoder [...] Conclusion [...] Reference lis...|$|E
40|$|A {{booster fan}} is an {{underground}} fan installed {{in series with}} a main surface fan and used to boost the air pressure of the ventilation air passing through it. To accomplish this objective, the fan is installed in a permanent stopping and equipped with airlock doors, a monitoring system, and interlocking devices between main and booster fan controls. The stopping and doors are used to prevent flow recirculation, and the monitors to ensure safe operation of the fan. A booster fan, properly sized and sited, {{can be used to}} create safe work conditions and allow the extraction of minerals from areas that would otherwise be uneconomic to mine. In deep and large mines with heavy emissions of air contaminants, the required quantities of air can only be supplied by using high pressure fans. These fans will inevitably induce significant losses of fresh airflow through the stoppings and doors. For well defined ventilation <b>circuits,</b> <b>booster</b> fans can be used to decrease the main fan pressures and reduce the leakage flows. However, this will require a good understanding of the correct ventilation practice, from planning to operation and maintenance of booster fans. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the conditions under which booster fans can be used safely and efficiently in underground coal mines. Specifically, the study is directed at (1) collecting reliable information on airway resistances and flow requirements from two large U. S coal mines, (2) collecting fan performance data from one or more existing coal mine where booster fans are used regularly, (3) monitoring the performance of booster fans in a laboratory model and an experimental mine, (4) developing a booster fan selection method to assist the ventilation engineer at the planning stage, and (5) training six M.
