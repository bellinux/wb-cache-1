5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried <b>being</b> <b>nice,</b> but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E
25|$|Noten's design I Am <b>Being</b> <b>Nice</b> to My Colleagues (2001) {{consists}} of an A4 silver plate that is blank except for two indented concentric circles. This first ring is ready to wear. When the buyer wishes {{to have a new}} ring made, they can commission another designer to create another ring from the plate. Eventually only the silhouettes of previous rings will be left. Noten invites other designers to share his concept and create their own work within the concept's parameters.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Sharona Melly (Carole Boyd) - The bossy, bad-tempered Tourist Information {{officer from}} Series 9. She was also nicknamed 'Mrs Smelly' and 'Smelly Melly', {{due to her}} {{forename}} beginning with 'S', and appearing as 'Mrs S Melly'. She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally covered her in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having fun on the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office. She often looks for quick ways to make money, such as when she attempts to catch a valuable bird and charge people to see it, and when she believes Bodger has won the lottery she buys him lunch and starts <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to him in the hope that he will share some of his winnings with her.|$|E
500|$|Meredith Blake, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, found that {{television}} Christmas episodes generally tended to bring [...] "an awkward shift in tone: All of a sudden, everyone's <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to each other." [...] She also complained about the invented holiday, which she found to be an overused cliché of Christmas programming: [...] "See also: 'Chrismukkah' or 'Festivus.'" [...] Also, television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger found that the episode compared unfavorably with the preceding one, but still enjoyed the showcasing of several minor characters, and the [...] "tender holiday spirit". What he appreciated most of all, however, was the Alec Baldwin–Julianne Moore angle. Mark Graham of New York magazine opined that the three plots in [...] "Secret Santa" [...] could not be considered as [...] "A-material" [...] for 30 Rock. Michael Anthony for TV Guide worried about the kiss between Jack and Nancy, as Nancy is married, and experiencing marital troubles. [...] "The Nancy kiss kind of troubles me; is Jack going to become the 'other woman?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Morris plays Brittany as [...] "literally insane", {{but also}} entirely well-meaning and goodhearted. She {{has said that}} Brittany [...] "love everybody, no matter who they are"; she is {{frequently}} smiling and <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to people. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat, Lord Tubbington, is reading her diary, and not knowing her right hand from her left. These facts are often presented in one-liners delivered by Morris, many of which she has ad-libbed. Brittany's one-liners are regularly celebrated in reviews of Glee. The character's lack of intelligence and forthright manner of speaking means, as Morris puts it, that [...] "Brittany {{is used by the}} series' writers to say things no other character would". The character has also received positive reviews related to her romantic storyline with her closeted best friend Santana (Naya Rivera). While Brittany is bisexual, and is unashamed of that, Santana has trouble accepting her lesbianism. Brittany has continued to support Santana and urged her to be true to herself.|$|E

500|$|The {{entire town}} bets on Jesus {{to win the}} fight, but begin to lose faith when Satan appears for the weigh-in. He is huge and weighs a little over , while Jesus weighs a mere , and the {{citizens}} of South Park begin changing their bets. Jesus confronts the South Park residents about their changed betting slips after learning only one person is still betting on Jesus to win. Distraught, Jesus asks Stan, Kyle and Chef to help him train. Damien gets counseling from Mr. Mackey, who recommends he just try <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> {{no matter what the}} other children do, just like with unpopular British child Pip. Damien tries to apologize to the boys for setting fire to the playground and turning Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, stating that he was [...] "doing his father's bidding" [...] and {{he did not have a}} choice. The boys, however, still continue to act negatively towards Damien. Cartman's birthday party begins, as does the fight. Damien and Pip arrive uninvited to the party, but the children finally accept Damien after he hurls Pip in the air and makes him explode in a shower of fireworks. However, a furious Cartman ends his party early after opening Kyle's present to discover that it's not what he had in mind.|$|E
500|$|Some of Brittany's {{most memorable}} lines are unscripted, and are instead devised by Murphy during filming, or improvised by Morris. Morris portrays Brittany as being [...] "literally insane." [...] She {{is used by}} the series' writers to say things no other {{character}} would, to the point that Morris considers some of her lines nonsensical. Brittany's character traits include her finding recipes confusing, cheating off intellectually disabled classmates, thinking her cat is reading her diary, and not knowing her right hand from her left. She is friendly towards all the other characters, and Morris has explained that Brittany [...] "love everybody, no matter who they are", so she is frequently smiling and <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to people. Morris bases her portrayal of Brittany on the character Karen Smith from the film Mean Girls. She plays Brittany as being very innocent, rather than stupid. In the episode [...] "A Night of Neglect", Brittany participates in an academic decathlon as a seat warmer, but surprisingly ends up contributing to the win {{due to the fact that}} she is somewhat of an idiot savant on the topic of cat diseases. It is also revealed in [...] "Britney/Brittany" [...] that Brittany is also [...] "Britney Spears" [...] as her middle initial is [...] "S" [...] making her [...] "Brittany S. Pierce." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept for}} using an {{underwater}} theme park as the game's setting {{came from a}} conversation Uchikoshi had with a friend, who mentioned it <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to be in Disneyland parks when it is raining, as very few people are there then, making it feel like the park is reserved to oneself. Uchikoshi agreed that empty theme parks are nice, and considered setting the game in an empty theme park on land, but moved it underwater after realizing that the characters could escape by climbing the fence and that some further obstacle was needed. This setting, described by Uchikoshi as [...] "you're trapped somewhere and trying to escape", was made to embody two of humanity's instinctive desires: the unconscious desire {{to return to the}} safety of one's mother's womb and shut oneself away from the world, and the desire to escape from and overcome one's current condition. German elements were used a lot in the game's setting, including German terminology. This was decided on for multiple reasons: the developers thought that English was [...] "too ordinary", and when they decided to use the pharmaceutical company Leiblich in the story, they also thought that Germany and Switzerland were known for pharmaceuticals. Additionally, Uchikoshi had visited Germany and was influenced by the 1999 animated film , and how the friend he had the theme park conversation with spoke German. Each of the game's heroines were assigned a related attraction in the park, where their [...] "impactful events" [...] would occur. The one exception was Coco, as [...] "her speech and conduct was already as delightful as an attraction".|$|E
50|$|Moreland's Tavern sat at {{the corner}} of modern-day Georgia and Missouri avenues before the Civil War. The {{building}} later became the Brightwood Club House, known for <b>being</b> a <b>nice</b> place to ride a horse and enjoy a drink. It eventually became the site of a Masonic Temple.|$|R

2500|$|In an {{obituary}} {{following his}} death, the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery said, [...] "Paul {{will be remembered}} {{not only for the}} development of the Harrington instruments, but for his straightforward frankness, his bowties, his par golf, his smile, his trumpet, and above all for <b>being</b> a <b>nice</b> person." ...|$|R
500|$|However, {{at other}} times, Kyle is an {{enthusiastic}} participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen actually <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to Kyle in some instances; {{although this is}} generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal, or for manipulation. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael [...] "Meathead" [...] Stivic on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family. Kyle {{has a tendency to}} make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation in this regard is not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode [...] "" [...] (season 11, 2007). This obsession has also proven itself to actually trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in [...] "Christian Rock Hard" [...] Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a platinum album before Kyle can. After recruiting Butters and Token, Cartman creates a Christian rock band called [...] "Faith+1" [...] and [...] "writes" [...] Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as [...] "baby" [...] with [...] "Jesus" [...] (which humorously implicates sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large fan base as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the [...] "Myrrh" [...] album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an Anti-Christian rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. Cartman has also been shown to have a high sadistic streak when concerning Kyle. He has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer.|$|E
2500|$|Mia makes many {{references}} to [...] "the movie", {{which in the}} book {{is supposed to be a}} movie made about her life. She refers to things that relate to the real movie, for example: her dead dad, Grandmere <b>being</b> <b>NICE,</b> and breaking up with Michael in the sequel (which she thought would never happen). Lilly complains that in the movie, the portrayal of her is mean and untrue, and Tina Hakim Baba was not allowed to be in it as her overprotective father forbade it for security reasons.|$|E
2500|$|British comedian Russell Brand also {{occasionally}} mentions {{his support}} for the movement on his BBC Radio 2 show. [...] Richard Gere {{is one of the most}} outspoken supporters of the movement and is chairman of the Board of Directors for the International Campaign for Tibet. Actress Sharon Stone caused significant controversy when she suggested that the 2008 Sichuan earthquake may have been the result of [...] "bad karma," [...] because the Chinese [...] "are not <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to the Dalai Lama, who is a good friend of mine." [...] The Dalai Lama confirmed that he did not share Stone's views, although he confirmed that he had [...] "met the lady".|$|E

2500|$|A {{writer from}} Inside Soap liked the {{extremes}} Grace went {{to in order}} to destroy Esther's wedding. They added [...] "You have to hand it to Grace Black, she doesn't do things by half." [...] They also [...] "rooted" [...] for the character to win the feud with Freddie and observed that she walks around Hollyoaks village [...] "like she owns it". Michael Cregan from the publication enjoyed Hollyoaks portraying a [...] "softer side" [...] to Grace during the hospital siege story. But the writer had become bored of Grace <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to Esther, and were glad [...] "the bitch is back". They added [...] "we love seeing Tamara Wall having fun, as Grace returns to her evil old ways." ...|$|E

With Ben's famous dental patients, Susan's election ambitions and an unheathly obsession with Inspector Morse – {{not to mention the}} unlikely perils of house-sitting in a luxury modern apartment – domestic life will soon be back to Harper-Normal. So when Ben and Susan start <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> to each other, it's no wonder Abi's suspicious; they could not be getting a divorce, could they? ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{promoting}} the storyline, Nicholas {{said he had}} enjoyed working on EastEnders but {{did not know if}} he would return again. Nicholas also said that Gavin is [...] "trying to get [...] back and he is trying to stay in control. He is very much how the mood takes him—whether he tips over to <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> or being nasty. It could go very badly wrong". Following the episode on 5 July 2016 in which Gavin lures Kathy to his mansion under false pretences, Sarah Deen from the Metro said that Gavin [...] "must have a head made of concrete" [...] after surviving being hit on the head with a vase, and called the episode [...] "tense and creepy" [...] and like a [...] "horror movie". Lindsay said that Gavin made a [...] "shock exit" [...] in the following episode, and said [...] "he remained a villain to the very end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once <b>being</b> <b>nice,</b> blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When <b>being</b> <b>nice</b> and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
