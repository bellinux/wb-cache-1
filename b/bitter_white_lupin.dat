40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{traditional}} Ethiopian lupin processing method on the chemical composition of lupin seed samples was studied. Two sampling districts, namely Mecha and Sekela, representing the mid- and high-altitude areas of north-western Ethiopia, respectively, were randomly selected. Different types of traditionally processed and marketed lupin seed samples (raw, roasted, and fi nished) were collected in six replications from each district. Raw samples are unprocessed, and roasted samples are roasted using fi rewood. Finished samples are those ready for human consumption as snack. Thousand seed weight for raw and roasted samples within a study district was similar (P > 0. 05), but it was lower (P 0. 05). The crude protein and crude fat contents of fi nished samples within a study district were higher (P < 0. 01) than those of raw and roasted samples, respectively. Roasting {{had no effect on}} the crude protein content of lupin seed samples. The crude ash content of raw and roasted lupin samples within a study district was higher (P < 0. 01) than that of fi nished lupin samples of the respective study districts. The content of quinolizidine alkaloids of fi nished lupin samples was lower than that of raw and roasted samples. There was also an interaction effect between location and lupin sample type. The traditional processing method of lupin seeds in Ethiopia has a positive contribution improving the crude protein and crude fat content, and lowering the alkaloid content of the fi nished product. The study showed the possibility of adopting the traditional processing method to process <b>bitter</b> <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> for the use as protein supplement in livestock feed in Ethiopia, but further work has to be done on the processing method and animal evaluation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the feeding value of <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus albus) and triticale for Nicholas Large White turkeys using a corn-soybean meal type diet as a control. Diets were formulated to have equal amounts of specified nutrients per unit of meta-bolizable energy. Growth of male turkeys 0 to 3 weeks of age {{was similar to the}} control group when 15 % <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> were included in the diet. When <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> were included at 30, 45, or 60 % of the diet, growth was significantly depressed to 94, 89, or 85 % of control, respectively. When triticale replaced corn there was a 6 % increase in growth, which was nearly significant. Growth of female turkeys 8 to 12 weeks of age fed diets where <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> supplied 20 % of supplemental (soybean) protein was similar to turkeys fed control diets.

40|$|Wild <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> {{have high}} levels of alkaloids, which cause a bitter taste, whereas domesticated <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> {{varieties}} have a very low content of alkaloids in seeds. Genes for bitterness from wild <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> are a contamination threat to domesticated <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> via cross-pollination. The gene(s) for alkaloid synthesis have not been clearly identified, and the associated molecular background among wild <b>white</b> <b>lupin,</b> domesticated and contaminated domesticated plant materials is unknown. So far, only tigloyl-CoA:(−) - 13 alpha-hydroxymultiflorine/(+) - 13 alpha-hydroxylupanine O-tigloyltransferase (HMT/HLTase) cDNA has been cloned based on protein analysis, which was suggested as encoding a quinolizidine alkaloid transferase regulating quinolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{economically}} important species of the Lupinus genus and is an important grain legume in the Ethiopian farming system. However, there has been limited research effort to characterize the Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> landraces. Fifteen polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of 212 Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus albus) landraces and two genotypes from different species (Lupinus angustifolius and Lupinus mutabilis) were used as out-group. The SSR markers revealed 108 different alleles, 98 of them from 212 landraces and 10 from out-group genotypes, with an average of 6. 5 alleles per locus. The average gene diversity was 0. 31. Twenty eight landraces harbored one or more private alleles from the total of 28 private alleles identified in the 212 <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> accessions. Seventy-seven rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5 % were identified and accounted for 78. 6 % of the total alleles detected. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 92 % of allelic diversity was attributed to individual accessions within populations while only 8 % was distributed among populations. At 70 % similarity level, the UPGMA dendrogram resulted in the formation of 13 clusters comprised of 2 to 136 landraces, with the out-group genotypes and five landraces remaining distinct and ungrouped. Population differentiation and genetic distance were relatively high between Gondar and Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> populations collected by Australians. A model-based population structure analysis divided the <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> landraces into two populations. All Ethiopian <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> landrace populations, except most of the landraces collected by Australians (77 %) and about 44 % from Awi, were grouped together with significant admixtures.

A rotation study was carried out to assess the concentrations of rhizosphere P pools of three grain legumes and wheat (phase 1) and their effects on P uptake and P pools in the rhizosphere of the following wheat (phase 2). Faba bean, chickpea, <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> and wheat were grown for 10 weeks in a loamy sand soil with low P availability. The following wheat was grown in the pre-crop soil with and without addition of pre-crop residues. Among the pre-crops, <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> had the strongest effect on the P pools; it depleted the labile P pools, resin P and NaHCO 3 -Pi and also the less labile P pools, NaOH-Pi and residual P; whereas the concentration of NaHCO 3 -Po was higher than that in the rhizosphere of the other pre-crops. <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> had a smaller biomass compared to faba bean which depleted the P pools to a lesser extent. Phosphorus uptake of the following wheat was greatest in <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> pre-crop soil. Chickpea increased P uptake of the following wheat when residues were added. In the presence of residues, wheat after legumes depleted labile P pools {{to a greater extent}} than wheat after wheat, but this coincided with greater P uptake only in wheat after chickpea and <b>white</b> <b>lupin,</b> which may be explained by the small root biomass of wheat after faba bean. The results show that the greater P uptake of the following wheat induced by pre-crops may be due to two mechanisms: P mobilisation (<b>white</b> <b>lupin)</b> or P addition with legume residues (chickpea).

We employed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC MS) for metabolic profiling of P-deficient <b>white</b> <b>lupins,</b> to investigate biochemical pathways {{involved in the}} P-acquiring strategy. After 14 days of P-deficiency, plants showed reduced levels of fructose, glucose and sucrose in shoots. Phosphorylated metabolites such as glucose- 6 -phosphate, fructose- 6 -phosphate, myo-inositol-phosphate and glycerol- 3 -phosphate were reduced in both shoots and roots. After 22 days of P-deficiency, no effect on shoot or root sugar metabolite levels was found, but the levels of phosphorylated metabolites were further reduced. Organic acids, amino acids and several shikimate pathway products showed enhanced levels in 22 -day-old P-deficient roots and shoots. These results indicate that P-deficient <b>white</b> <b>lupins</b> adapt their carbohydrate partitioning between shoot and root in order to supply their growing root system as an early response to P-deficiency. Organic acids are released into the rhizosphere to mobilize phosphorus from soil particles.

The plants were grown for 60 days, when they were harvested and the soil was sampled. Dry matter yields of both species were increased with P rates. Soil bioactive P is increased with P fertilization, but is not affected by the plant species. <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> is more effective in taking up the organic soil P, but Brachiaria was more effective in reducing the soil maximum P adsorption capacity...|$|R

Plant tolerance to Al toxicity has been widely studied even if the mechanisms involved in the plant response are yet not fully elucidated. <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> is well known to release organic acids and flavonoids under nutrient deficiency, while less is known about its response to elevated Al concentrations. The aim of this work was therefore to shed light to the adaptive response of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> to Al toxicity, analysing the root exudate pattern. A pH buffer (MES) or inhibitor compounds were used in order to further investigate the mechanisms adopted by <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> to release root exudates as response to Al toxicity. The results showed that not only organic acids but also phenolic compounds are involved in the response to elevated concentrations of Al together with the alkalinisation of the growth medium...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus, in its {{orthophosphate}} form (P-i), {{is one of}} {{the most}} limiting macronutrients in soils for plant growth and development. However, the whole-genome molecular mechanisms contributing to plant acclimation to P-i deficiency remain largely unknown. <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus albus) has evolved unique adaptations for growth in P-i-deficient soils, including the development of cluster roots to increase root surface area. In this study, we utilized RNA-Seq technology to assess global gene expression in <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> cluster roots, normal roots, and leaves in response to P-i supply. We de novo assembled 277, 224, 180 Illumina reads from 12 complementary DNA libraries to build what is to our knowledge the first <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> gene index (LAGI 1. 0). This index contains 125, 821 unique sequences with an average length of 1, 155 bp. Of these sequences, 50, 734 were transcriptionally active (reads per kilobase per million reads >= 3), representing approximately 7. 8 % of the <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> genome, using the predicted genome size of Lupinus angustifolius as a reference. We identified a total of 2, 128 sequences differentially expressed in response to P-i deficiency with a 2 -fold or greater change and P <= 0. 05. Twelve sequences were consistently differentially expressed due to P-i deficiency stress in three species, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and <b>white</b> <b>lupin,</b> making them ideal candidates to monitor the P-i status of plants. Additionally, classic physiological experiments were coupled with RNA-Seq data to examine the role of cytokinin and gibberellic acid in P-i deficiency-induced cluster root development.

30|$|In {{intercropping}} cowpea–maize, Latati et al. [50] {{found an}} increase in P availability at rhizosphere level associated with significant acidification (− 0.73  U) than in sole cropping. Wang et al. [115], assessing properties related to N and P cycling in the rhizosphere of wheat and grain legumes (faba bean and <b>white</b> <b>lupin)</b> grown in monoculture or in wheat/legume mixtures, found that the less-labile organic P pools (i.e. NaOH-extractable P pools and acid-extractable P pools) significantly accumulated in the rhizosphere of legumes. However, the P uptake and the changes in rhizosphere soil P pools seem to depend also on legume species. Compared with the unplanted soil, the depletion of labile P pools (resin P and NaHCO 3 -P inorganic) was the greatest in the rhizosphere of faba bean (54 and 39 %) with respect to chickpea, <b>white</b> <b>lupin,</b> yellow lupin and narrow-leafed lupin [31]. Of the less-labile P pools, NaOH-P inorganic was depleted in the rhizosphere of faba bean, while NaOH-P organic and residual P were most strongly depleted in the rhizosphere of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> [31].|$|R

30|$|Some grain legumes, {{including}} chickpea, {{pigeon pea}} and <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> can mobilize fixed forms of soil P through the secretion of organic acids such as citrate and malate and other P mobilizing compounds from their roots [36]. Among grain legumes, <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> most strongly solubilize P, a function {{that can be}} facilitated by its proteoid roots that may englobe small portions of soil [2]. Glasshouse experiments using a highly P-fixing soil showed better wheat growth following <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> than soybean [37], suggesting that the cereal was able to access P made available by the previous <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> break crop. ‘Break crop’ effects also include increased soil water content, since the break-crop stubble can affect retention of soil water and infiltration and retention of rain water [47]. A species-specific response has also been documented. Soil profiles after pea field can be wetter than after a wheat crop [2]. In Saskatchewan, Canada, Miller et al. [68] reported that post-harvest soil water status up to 122  cm-depth was 31 and 49  mm greater for all legumes (field pea, lentil and chick pea) with respect of wheat under loam and clay soils, respectively. This was primarily due to increased plant water use efficiency. Lentil in rotation with cereals {{has been shown to}} increase total grain production by increasing residual soil water in dry areas of Saskatchewan [25].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>White</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus albus L.) roots {{efficiently}} take up and accumulate (heavy) metals, {{adapt to}} phosphate deficiency by forming cluster roots, and secrete antimicrobial prenylated isoflavones during development. Genomic and proteomic approaches {{were applied to}} identify candidate genes and proteins involved in antimicrobial defense and (heavy) metal uptake and translocation. Results A cDNA library was constructed from roots of <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> seedlings. Eight thousand clones were randomly sequenced and assembled into 2, 455 unigenes, which were annotated based on homologous matches in the NCBInr protein database. A reference map of developing <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> root proteins was established through 2 -D gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. High quality peptide mass spectra were obtained for 170 proteins. Microsomal membrane proteins were separated by 1 -D gel electrophoresis and identified by LC-MS/MS. A total of 74 proteins were putatively identified by the peptide mass fingerprinting and the LC-MS/MS methods. Genomic and proteomic analyses identified candidate genes and proteins encoding metal binding and/or transport proteins, transcription factors, ABC transporters and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes. Conclusion The combined EST and protein datasets will facilitate the understanding of white lupin's response to biotic and abiotic stresses and its utility for phytoremediation. The root ESTs provided 82 perfect simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers with potential utility in breeding <b>white</b> <b>lupin</b> for enhanced agronomic traits. </p...|$|R
