We {{on this side of the}} House are not particularly enamoured of Second Chambers, and I do not know that our love for these institutions will grow sweeter as the years pass by. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> governed by colonial practice; and there is no colony in the Empire that has not a Second Chamber. The greater number of these Second Chambers are nominated; and I think that the quality of nominated Second Chambers, and their use in practice, have not been found to be inferior to those of the elective bodies. His Majesty's Government desire to secure, if they can, some special protection for native interests which is not likely to be afforded by any electoral arrangement, I am sorry to say. We are unable however to countenance the creation in a permanent form of a nominated Second Chamber. But in view of the position of native affairs, in view of the disadvantage of complicating the elections, to which all classes in the Transvaal have been so long looking forward, and most particularly because of the extra delays that would be involved in the creation of a new elective body, the Cabinet have resolved for this Parliament only, and as a purely provisional arrangement, to institute a nominated Legislative Council of fifteen members. They will be nominated by the Crown, that is to say at home, and vacancies, if any, by death or resignation, will be filled by the High Commissioner, on the advice of the responsible Ministers. During the course of the first Parliament in the Transvaal arrangements will be completed for the establishment of an elective Second Chamber, and if necessary further Letters Patent will be issued to constitute it.|$|E

Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects.

5000|$|Prosecutors {{acting on}} their own {{initiative}} have used Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code prohibiting [...] "insulting Turkishness" [...] to silence a number of prominent Turkish intellectuals who spoke of atrocities suffered by Armenians {{in the last days}} of the Ottoman Empire (most of these cases have been dismissed). During a February 2005 interview with Das Magazin, novelist Orhan Pamuk made statements implicating Turkey in massacres against Armenians and persecution of the Kurds, declaring: [...] "Thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it". Subjected to a hate campaign, he left Turkey, before returning in 2005 to defend his right to freedom of speech: [...] "What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to talk about the past". Lawyers of two Turkish ultranationalist professional associations led by Kemal Kerinçsiz then brought criminal charges against Pamuk. However, on 23 January 2006 the charges of [...] "insulting Turkishness" [...] were dropped (for reasons not necessarily tied to the case), a move welcomed by the EU.|$|E

5000|$|The {{scientist}} and statesman Shen Kuo's 1088 Dream Pool Essays suggested that mercury compounds might be medicinally valuable and needed further study—foreshadowing {{the use of}} metallic compounds in modem medicine, such as mercury in salvarsan for syphilis or antimony for visceral leishmaniasis. Shen says his cousin once transformed cinnabar into an elixir, {{but one of his}} students mistakenly ate a leftover piece, became delirious, and died the next day.Now cinnabar is an extremely good drug and can be taken even by a newborn baby, but once it has been changed by heat it can kill an (adult) person. If we consider the change and transformation of opposites into one another, since (cinnabar) can be changed into a deadly poison why should it not also be changed into something of extreme benefit? Since it can change into something which kills, {{there is good reason to}} believe that it may have the pattern-principle li of saving life; it is simply that we have not yet found out the art (of doing this). Thus we cannot deny the possibility of the existence of methods for transforming people into feathered immortals, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very careful about what we do.

To Toronto Sun, Pena talked about the group's impact on both music and television: [...] "I think the music could stand alone, but I don't know if it would be as powerful. The show has definitely been our main audience. We have four million kids watching. So when you put a song out, four million kids hear it. When you put a song on the radio, you're not going to have four million people listening.

5000|$|On 28 June, James scored both {{goals to}} defeat Uruguay 2-0 at the Maracanã {{in the round}} of 16, taking Colombia to its first ever World Cup quarter-finals. These goals made him {{the first player to}} score in all of his team's opening matches since Ronaldo and Rivaldo in 2002. His volleyed opening goal was {{described}} as [...] "one of the greatest goals the World Cup has ever seen" [...] by opposing manager Óscar Tabárez, who also called James [...] "the best player in the World Cup." [...] Because of his performance against the Uruguayans, James was named by FIFA as man of the match {{for the third time in}} four matches. The volley was later voted as the best goal in the tournament by more than four million people on FIFA's website and won the FIFA Puskás Award for the best goal of the year. In the quarter-final against Brazil, he scored his sixth goal of the tournament, a penalty in Colombia's 2-1 defeat. A tearful James was consoled by Brazil's David Luiz and stated, [...] "He (David) told me I was a good player. The truth is that having so many superstars hug me did make me happy. We have to raise our heads now and thank Colombia for their support. We are sad because we wanted to keep going and set new records. We gave everything to reach the semi-final, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud because we played a great side. I'm crying because we gave everything. We're sad but we also have to feel proud because we left our skin out there." [...] Luiz and Rodriguez also exchanged jerseys. James received a standing ovation from the home crowd, ending his first World Cup campaign with six goals and two assists in five matches. On 11 July, he was named on the 10-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player. He then won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top goalscorer despite being eliminated in the quarter finals. Due to his performances, he was named in the World Cup All Star XI and was also listed in the Cup's star XI by Castrol's index rating system in FIFA's website. Argentina legend Diego Maradona argued that James, rather than Lionel Messi, that should have won the tournament's Golden Ball award.|$|E

Furthermore, the silver lining confirms all exposed anatomy is shown in the final image, and thus may also serve as a quality assurance instrument as the patient has the right to all acquired information.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} based on a general {{conceptual}} supply chain flow risk model developed in an earlier paper, a literature review and case studies. The paper has the title "Developing a supply chain risk model" and is reported as a final paper at the NOFOMA 2005 conference. The literature review has been focusing articles and reports/books on supply chain management. Some of its findings have earlier been reported in a book chapter in Brindley (2004). There is one main case-study, presented here as case Beta and two minor cases (Alfa and Gamma). The author spent five weeks during the autumn of 2004 on the floor in two of the factories of Beta. That resulted in three internal reports to Beta and a lot of experience and ideas about supply chain flow related risks including the valuation of risks through indexing. Earlier drafts of this paper have on some occasions been tested on risk managers of Beta and developed further based on their feedback. The three cases illustrate the use of the valuation model. Finally is concluded that using indexes can be a way of quickly and with limited resources getting a broad grip of the total risks in the supply chain – not least in new risk situations. The alternative is often not to have any figure at all for the supply chain risks. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful because indexes create a new risk – the risk that we believe too much in them...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{losses in}} {{telephony}} caused by fraud represent {{four to six}} percents of telecommunication industry income. An answer to this threat is increasing research of fraud management systems. One of the less researched branches of this field is the usage of visualization in fraud detection and prevention. The purpose of this work is to research and give an estimate for the usability of it. Taxonomic classification of fraud and fraud management system {{was the first step}} {{in order to get a}} clear picture of the tasks that fraud management system has to carry out. With that and visualization theory in mind we then searched for the suitable visual representations for each task. The conclusion was that visualization is not a critical part of the system but a valuable additional tool that will increase the productivity of the analyst. In the fraud prevention phase visualization will help to analyze information received from elements that are used to protect the system, detection phase will benefit as visualization is efficient for huge dataset analysis and in the last processing phase visualization will help to filter the alarms reported from the previous phase. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful, as visualization is only useful if properly implemented, with presentation appearance and functionality in mind. The contribution of this work is a systematical overview of the addressed topic, application model and visualization prototypes based on real life examples. The theoretical findings were confirmed with practical examples. Further work should include a closer cooperation with fraud analysts and research with empirical methods. That would most likely bring us closer to new ideas and better results...|$|E
