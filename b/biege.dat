Abbot Herman of Holten of Werden Abbey enfeoffed Philip with fishing rights on the lower Ruhr on 21 March 1548. On 28 August of the same year, Duke William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg enfoeffed him with Boich and <b>Biege</b> manor in Angermund district. Finally, on 21 April 1550, he was enfoeffed [...] with Bürgel by Archbishop Adolph III of Cologne.|$|E
40|$|The {{approximate}} {{size of the}} stress criterion of a bar on two supports stressed beyond the elastic range is as-sessed bY an approximation. The calculation proceeds from the premise of “substitute flexural stiffness ” so defined that the part stressed beyond the elastiic range may be considered as following Hooke!s law when determining the flexural deformation quantities. F. o r {{the determination of the}} substitute flexural stiffness, it is presumed that the material is already stressed so much beyond the yield point as to be strain-hardened. The data are directly ap-plicable to materials having no definite yield point. For the rest, von Karmanl s method for compressed and subse-quently deflected bars serves as basis for the calculation. The action of bars on reaching the yield point is not discussed; it is to form the subject of a speciai report. As regards the magnitude of the stress criterion of tension bars outside of the elastic range within the stress region- yield point and ultimate stress, wherein the sub-stitute flexural stiffness is quite small and finally ap-proaches zero, the following may be stated: If the whole bar is stressed beyond the elastic range, the stress cri-terion itself is very small and approaches zero near the ultimate load. *llDie Spannziffer eines Zugstabes mit abgestufter <b>Biege...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pineoblastoma is a rare, {{but highly}} {{malignant}} tumor {{of the central}} nervous system (CNS) in children and is classified as a central primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Despite notable recent advances in understanding the molecular genetic basis of malignancies, the pathogenesis of PNETs remains enigmatic. There is scant information on the cytogenetics of PNETs arising in the pineal gland and the only three reported cases did not show any common aberrations. Here we report the establishment and characterization of a new pineoblastoma cell line, PER- 480. The biopsy material and the cell line were characterized using light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses. The cell line was examined for expression of cell surface markers using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and by cytogenetic analysis. MYC family genes were studied at the DNA, RNA, and protein level. Cell line PER- 480 showed neuronal differentiation and the karyotype demonstrated two abnormalities, a der(10) t(10; 17) and a der(16) t(1; 16). An intriguing finding is that all three pineoblastoma cell lines established in our laboratory, PER- 452, PER- 453, and PER- 480, showed enhanced expression but not amplification of a member of the MYC family of proto-oncogenes. Cell line PER- 480 reported here will be useful for the further investigation of the molecular genetic basis of central PNETs. Ursula R. Kees, Dominic Spagnolo, Lavinia A.

40|$|Introduction Observations of {{molecules}} in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of late-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars provide a natural laboratory {{in which to}} apply and test astrochemical models. Such regions, particularly C-rich (i. e. C/O ? 1) CSEs, are rich in molecular species, have a known, usually spherically symmetric, geometry, are bathed in the interstellar radiation field, and undergo a simple expansion at constant velocity in the outer CSE, so that single-dish observations are able to give some information about the spatial location {{of molecules}} from the line profiles (Olofsson 1997). In addition, for {{an increasing number of}} molecules, interferometer measurements are available and give detailed maps of the molecular distributions in the CSE (<b>Bieging</b> and Tafalla 1993; Gensheimer et al. 1995; Lucas et al. 1995; Gu'elin et al. 1996). Observations and models of the CSEs can be used as an input int...|$|R
40|$|We present high {{resolution}} {{images of the}} entire galactic HI spectrum of Cas A and display the whole data cube in various ways; the spatial resolution is 30 arcsec and the velocity resolution is 0. 62 km s(- 1). In previous studies, observations are described either with lower velocity resolution or with a limited velocity range (below - 30 km s(- 1)), (<b>Bieging</b> et al. 1991; Reynoso et al. 1997). Here we concentrate the discussion on the local HI gas, with velocities between - 10 and + 10 km s(- 1). At a velocity of - 1. 5 km s(- 1) we find a cold HI feature with a kinetic temperature of typically 25 K, with a small region of 1 by 2 arcmin with a kinetic temperature below 10 K. This feature {{can be associated with}} a (CO) -C- 13 feature observed by Wilson et al. (1993). Based on the new HI absorption results we derive the ratio N-HI/N(H- 2) approximate to 0. 05...|$|R
