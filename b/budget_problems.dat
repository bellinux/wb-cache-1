Hubble was funded in the 1970s, with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, <b>budget</b> <b>problems,</b> and the Challenger disaster (1986). When finally launched in 1990, Hubble's main mirror {{was found to have}} been ground incorrectly, compromising the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Chesapeake was a 38-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She {{was one of}} the {{original}} six frigates whose construction was authorized by the Naval Act of 1794. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young navy's capital ships. Chesapeake was originally designed as a 44-gun frigate but construction delays, material shortages, and <b>budget</b> <b>problems</b> caused builder Josiah Fox to alter her design to 38guns. Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2December 1799, Chesapeake began her career during the Quasi-War with France and saw service in the First Barbary War.|$|E

5|$|SR 149 was {{relocated}} onto a new two-lane alignment in the mid-1970s, {{leaving behind}} Openshaw Road. Caltrans began studies for interchanges {{at each end}} in September 1992. The California Transportation Commission approved funding for four-laning SR 149 in April 1994 and the two interchanges in May 1996, with construction to begin in 1998 and cost $47 million. Due to state <b>budget</b> <b>problems</b> {{and the need to}} study environmental impacts, the project was repeatedly pushed back; these impacts and inflation had more than doubled the cost to $120 million in 2004. In particular, an endangered species of meadowfoam was discovered on the south embankent, forcing a redesign. Construction began in September 2005 on a new freshwater marsh near the State Route 70 intersection to replace beaver ponds {{in the path of the}} highway, and it was completed in March 2006.|$|E
5|$|Several {{original}} video animations (OVAs) {{based on}} Lupin III have been produced. The Plot of the Fuma Clan {{was shown in}} theaters in Japan on December 26, 1987 before being released to video on April 5, 1988. Because of <b>budget</b> <b>problems,</b> TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast from the television series and theatrical movies; instead, they hired a different cast to save money. The second OVA, Return of the Magician was released on April 3, 2002 {{as part of the}} 30th anniversary of the first television series and features the return of one of the original villains of the series, the magician Pycal.

40|$|Decoupling {{capacitor}} (decap) placement {{has been}} widely adopted as {{an effective way to}} suppress dynamic power supply noise. Traditional decap budgeting algorithms usually explore the sensitivity-based nonlinear optimizations or conjugate gradient methods, which can be prohibitively expensive for large-scale decap <b>budgeting</b> <b>problems.</b> We present a hierarchical cross entropy (CE) optimization technique for solving the decap <b>budgeting</b> <b>problem.</b> CE is an advanced optimization framework which explores the power of rare-event probability theory and importance sampling. To achieve high efficiency, a sensitivity-guided cross entropy (SCE) algorithm is proposed which integrates CE with a partitioningbased sampling strategy to effectively reduce the dimensionality in solving the large scale decap <b>budgeting</b> <b>problems.</b> Extensive experiments on industrial power grid benchmarks show that the proposed SCE method converges 2 X faster than the prior methods and 10 X faster than the standard CE method, while gaining up to 25 % improvement on power grid supply noise. Importantly, the proposed SCE algorithm is parallel-friendly since the simulation samples of each SCE iteration can be independently obtained in parallel. We obtain up to 1. 9 X speedup when running the SCE decap budgeting algorithm on a dual-core-dual-GPU system...|$|R
40|$|We study {{problems}} that are motivated by the real-life problem of e√Ücient recovery from a wide scale electric power outage caused by a major disaster such as a hurricane or an equipment failure. In most of these cases an optimized scheduling of the workforce is required since the work crews on hand are not enough for immediate recovery of the whole network. We model two variants of this problem: the <b>budgeted</b> <b>problem,</b> and the minimum weighted latency problem. We consider the problems for the general case {{as well as for}} two special cases: trees, and bipartite networks. All but one of the problems (the bud-geted tree problem) are NP-Hard and the algorithms given for them are approximation algorithms. For the <b>budgeted</b> tree <b>problem</b> we give an optimal solution. Interestingly, the <b>budgeted</b> <b>problem</b> for bipartite networks is exactly the budgeted maximum set cover problem, for which we give the best ratio approximation algorithm...|$|R

5|$|The 1995 race {{featured}} 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished. <b>Budget</b> <b>problems</b> {{caused the}} first prize {{to drop by}} 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation. This problem was fixed for the 1996 race, with a first-place prize of $25,000. The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money {{be used to pay}} debts accumulated in Alaska, members of the Alaska board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by <b>budget</b> <b>problems</b> and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E
5|$|The state {{experienced}} budget shortages {{because of}} low tax revenues, which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects. The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands. The state's spending and borrowing led to short-term <b>budget</b> <b>problems,</b> but despite early setbacks (poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold {{because of lack of}} funds), the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state. By 1810 the Indiana Territory's population within the boundaries of the new state was 24, 520. In the decades following his governorship, Indiana's population grew from sixty-five thousand in 1816 to 147,178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850.|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is to address the capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>problem</b> {{in order to establish}} a framework for the measurement and evaluation of alternative capital allocation decisions which are compatible with the mission of the company. The solution method follows three major avenues of optimization: multiple criteria, multiple constraints and interactivity. The problem is solved using the Analytic Hierarchy Process to obtain an initial solution which is then improved by an interactive method allowing users to direct the search for an acceptable allocation. The method is implemented by a decision support system hinging on a graphic user interface. The support system has been used by practitioners to evaluate alternatives of a real problem.

40|$|We {{address the}} nursing service <b>budgeting</b> <b>problem</b> from the {{department}} manager‚Äôs point of view. The model allocates the budget dynamically to three types of nursing care capacities: 1) permanent nurses, 2) temporary nurses, and 3) overtime. The quarterly tactical decisions are the aggregate weekly shift pattern of permanent nurses and the policy for hiring temporary nurses and using overtime. The decisions are optimized with respect to nursing care shortage and a soft-constraint on the annual budget. For the aggregate weekly shift pattern, permanent nurses require a notification lead-time of one quarter to prepare the personal rosters. Our model offers {{a solution to the}} nursing service <b>budgeting</b> <b>problem</b> that extends the existing literature by using a Markovian demand model, resolving the anticipation of the operational decisions, and applying general budget as well as shortage penalty functions...|$|R
