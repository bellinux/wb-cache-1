30|$|In {{common design}} practice, the beam {{reinforcement}} ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top usually ranges between 0.5 and 1.0. If the top reinforcement area (A_s,top) exceeds the bottom reinforcement area (A_s,bot) at a beam-column joint, relatively larger flexural compression would be {{developed at the}} bottom beam ends in order to balance the greater flexural tension developed from the top beam bars at the same section. Thus, the compressive stress of the bottom beam bars at the joint face would be {{greater than that of}} the top beam bars at the opposite face. In other words, the stress gradient along the <b>bottom</b> <b>bars</b> is larger than that along the top bars in the joint, indicating a relatively severe bond demand for the <b>bottom</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E

30|$|Contrary to {{previous}} research results for CC, a top bar effect didn’t occur for the specimens studied, both CC and SCC. In fact, for all specimens except the NSCC specimens, the top bars had higher bond strength than the <b>bottom</b> <b>bars,</b> {{which may have}} been due to the very low w/c ratios (0.37 and 0.24 for the normal and high strength mixes, respectively) and the use of fly ash in the high strength mixes. In addition, the beams were not overly deep and were only slightly above the cutoff for when to consider top bar effects. These factors may have resulted in a decrease in the amount of bleed water accumulating beneath the top bars, which is the primary cause of the top bar effect. Some previous studies have also found a decrease in the top bar effect for SCC (Dehn et al. 2000; Chan et al. 2003; Castel et al. 2006; Valcuende and Parra 2009), while others have not (Turk et al. 2008; Castel et al. 2010). Due to the limited number of top bar specimens used in this study—one for each concrete type—further research is needed to reach a definitive conclusion.|$|E

To evaluate the performance for non-contact lapped splice, experimental and analytical work were conducted, for major variables {{of the length}} of lap and the diameter of connection reinforcing bars(D 19, D 22, and D 25). Results of experimental and analytical works show that these variables have much influence on flexural strength and ductility, and deformation of lapped joint.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation are presented which examine the seismic adequacy of pre- 1970 reinforced concrete (RC) corner beam-column joints and the efficacy of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for both pre- and post-earthquake retrofit of such joints. Four full-scale corner beam-column-slab subassemblages built with identical dimensions and pre- 1970 reinforcement details were subjected to a reverse-cycle bidirectional displacement history consisting of alternate and simultaneous cycles in the two primary frame directions before and/or after retrofit. Two of the specimens were first subjected to severe and moderate levels of damage, respectively, then repaired by epoxy injection, and strengthened by adding a # 7 reinforcing bar within the clear cover at the column inside corner and by externally bonding multiple layers of carbon fabric to form a carbon-epoxy retrofit system. Two other specimens, one of which had a significantly lower concrete compressive strength, were strengthened in their as-built condition. The CFRP scheme was improved {{in light of the}} findings as the experimental program progressed. Pre- 1970 RC corner beam-column joints were found to be severely inadequate in meeting seismic demands because of column bar yielding, joint shear failure, loss of anchorage of beam <b>bottom</b> <b>bars,</b> failure of column lap-splices, and the resulting loss of stiffness and strength that dominate their behavior even at relatively low interstory drift levels. Bidirectional loading {{played a significant role in}} such response. It was shown, however, that such joints can be strengthened easily both before and after earthquake damage by using CFRP composite schemes. Regardless of the level of existing damage and concrete strength, a "rigid" joint behavior up to interstory drift ratios of at least 2. 4 % and joint shear strength factors ranging from 1. 06 to 1. 41 √MPa were achieved; such shear strength factors are larger than the value of 1. 00 √MPa recommended for use with seismically designed, code-conforming corner beam-column joints. A ductile beam hinging mechanism was achieved and energy dissipation capacity was improved efficiently for joints with concrete strengths ranging from 26 to 34 MPa. The subassemblage with significantly low-strength concrete (15 MPa) had low overall lateral stiffness and reduced reinforcement anchorages which prevented the formation of beam hinging. In cases of such low-strength concrete, more invasive operations may be required so that the improved joint shear strength can be mobilized. It is recommended that bidirectional loading be always considered in both pre- and post-retrofit evaluation of corner joints. Ph. D.

40|$|Ductile {{plastic hinge}} zones in beams of {{reinforced}} concrete frames {{are known to}} incur extensive damage and elongate. This ‘beam elongation’ can inflict serious damage to adjacent floor diaphragms, raising concerns of life safety. In light of this, the slotted reinforced concrete beam was investigated as a promising non-tearing floor substitute for conventional design. It consists of a conventional reinforced concrete beam, modified with a narrow vertical slot adjacent to the column face, running approximately three-quarters of the beam depth. Seismic rotations occur about the remaining concrete “top-hinge”, such that deformations are concentrated in the <b>bottom</b> <b>bars</b> of the beam, away from the floor slab, and beam elongation is minimised. The inclusion of the slot raised several design issues which needed to be addressed. These were the shear transfer across the top-hinge, buckling of bottom longitudinal reinforcement, low cycle fatigue, bond anchorage of reinforcement in interior joints, interior joint design, detailing with floor units and beam torsion resulting from eccentric floor gravity loads. These issues were conceptually investigated in this project. It was found that most issues could be resolved by providing additional reinforcement and/or specifying alternative detailing. As part of the experimental investigation, quasi-static cyclic tests were performed on in-plane beam-column joint subassemblies. Specimens tested included exterior and interior joint subassemblies with slotted-beams and a conventional exterior joint as a benchmark. This {{was followed by a}} test on a slotted-beam interior joint subassembly with precast floor units and imposed gravity load. Experimental tests revealed significant reductions in damage to both the beam and floor when compared to conventional beams. Issues of bar buckling, bond-slip and altered joint behaviour were also highlighted, but were resolved in the final test. A simple analytical procedure to predict the moment-rotation response of slotted-beams was developed and verified with experimental results. This was used to perform sensitivity studies to determine appropriate limits for the concrete top-hinge depth, top-to-bottom reinforcement ratio and depth of diagonal shear reinforcement. For the numerical investigation, a multi-spring model was developed to represent the flexural response of slotted-beams. This was verified with experimental tests and implemented into a five-storey, three-bay frame for earthquake time history analyses. To provide a benchmark, a conventional frame was also setup using the plastic hinge element developed by Peng (2009). Time history analyses showed that the slotted-beam frame response was very similar to the response of a conventional frame. Due to greater hysteretic damping, there was a slight reduction in the average interstorey drift and lateral displacement envelopes. The slotted-beam frame also exhibited 40 % smaller residual drifts than the conventional frame. The research carried out in this thesis showed slotted reinforced concrete beams to be an effective non-tearing floor solution, which could provide a simple and practical substitute for conventional reinforced concrete design...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} techniques allow for bridges to be constructed or replaced more quickly {{in order to}} save commuter time and money. One of these techniques involved the use of prefabricated bridge deck panels, which are connected to each other by high strength closure strips. This thesis report investigates the performance of a closure strip filled with ultra-high performance concrete under fatigue loads at service levels as well as at failure loads. Four nearly full-scale (150 mm deep) bridge deck specimens were constructed, each consisting of two panels connected by a UHPC filled closure strip. Two of the specimens were reinforced with ribbed glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bars and the remaining two were reinforced with sand-coated GFRP bars. One specimen fabricated with each bar type was loaded under fatigue (cyclic) loading equivalent to the maximum wheel load specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code for 2, 000, 000 cycles at three locations: the centre of a precast concrete panel, the centre of the closure strip, and adjacent to the closure strip. The remaining specimen of each bar type was only fatigue tested adjacent to the closure strip at the same load level for 2, 000, 000 cycles. The slabs were then loaded monotonically to failure. It was found that the specimens generally exhibited noticeably increased deflections during initial fatigue loading followed by a more gradual deflection increase {{for the remainder of the}} fatigue loading. The slabs reinforced with the ribbed GFRP bars were found to exhibit significantly larger deflections than the sand-coated bars. The slab with ribbed bars, which was intended to undergo fatigue loading at three locations, experienced failure of the <b>bottom</b> <b>bars</b> during testing at the second fatigue location. Similarly, the specimen with ribbed bars only loaded adjacent to the closure strip also did not complete the planned 2, 000, 000 cycles due to premature failure of the bottom transverse reinforcement. When loaded to failure adjacent to the closure strip, both of the specimens reinforced with the sand-coated GFRP bars experienced a punching shear failure. The punching shear failure surface typically has a cone or pyramidal shape. However, the punching cone for both specimens was truncated by the UHPC closure strip, resulting in a three sided failure cone, with slip occurring along the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPC. The specimens reinforced with ribbed bars were also loaded to failure. However, these specimens failed due to the top fibre of the concrete crushing along the length of the slab due to the lack of bottom reinforcement continuity resulting from the rebar failures during fatigue loading. Finite element models were generated in ABAQUS to provide an understanding of the general stress patterns experienced throughout the slab. The initial load comparison (model vs. measured) yielded similar results, with the model showing slightly more initial stiffness, but cracking at approximately the same load. In addition, the failure loads were compared to two building and bridge code specifications: CSA S 6 and CSA A 23. 3, and it was found that the punching shear failure for the two sand-coated GFRP reinforced specimens was less than the specified values for each of these design codes due to the punching failure occurring on only three sides of the load instead of the four sides assumed by the codes. In conclusion, the specimens with sand-coated reinforcement maintained stiffness throughout fatigue loading and failed in a three-plane punching shear mode, and the specimens with ribbed reinforcement failed during fatigue loading when the bottom transverse reinforcement broke, resulting in significant deflections and pre-empting failure by punching shear...|$|E
