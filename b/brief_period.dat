5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E

Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular.
