5|$|The Palazzo Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting <b>balconies</b> of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide <b>balconies</b> bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The <b>balconies,</b> a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade are the three central <b>balconies,</b> divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the <b>balconies</b> are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E

40|$|<b>Balcony</b> {{acoustic}} treatments can {{mitigate the}} effects of community road traffic noise. To further investigate, a theoretical study into {{the effects of}} <b>balcony</b> acoustic treatment combinations on speech interference and transmission is conducted for various street geometries. Nine different <b>balcony</b> types are investigated using a combined specular and diffuse reflection computer model. Diffusion in the model is calculated using the radiosity technique. The <b>balcony</b> types include a standard <b>balcony</b> {{with or without a}} ceiling and with various combinations of parapet, ceiling absorption and ceiling shield. A total of 70 <b>balcony</b> and street geometrical configurations are analyzed with each <b>balcony</b> type, resulting in 630 scenarios. In each scenario the reverberation time, speech interference level (SIL) and speech transmission index (STI) are calculated. These indicators are compared to determine trends based on the effects of propagation path, inclusion of opposite buildings and difference with a reference position outside the <b>balcony.</b> The results demonstrate trends in SIL and STI with different <b>balcony</b> types. It is found that an acoustically treated <b>balcony</b> reduces speech interference. A parapet provides the largest improvement, followed by absorption on the ceiling. The largest reductions in speech interference arise when a combination of <b>balcony</b> acoustic treatments are applied...|$|R
5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other <b>balconies</b> below. The first, second, and third floor <b>balconies</b> all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the <b>balconies,</b> and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior <b>balconies</b> over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden <b>balconies</b> with stone walls three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} noise {{reducing}} {{effect of a}} <b>balcony</b> and describes {{the development of a}} simple theory pertaining to the propagation of traffic noise from a road into a <b>balcony.</b> A new methodology is proposed that is based on the well-known prediction scheme—“Calculation of Road Traffic Noise” (CRTN) —developed in the UK. A geometrical ray theory is developed for the prediction of noise levels inside a <b>balcony</b> due to road traffic. The source level of road traffic noise is obtained as per the standard CRTN methodology. However, road sub-segmentations and new approaches for the prediction of noise levels at illuminated and shadow zones inside a <b>balcony</b> are proposed. Field measurements have been conducted on four different types of <b>balcony</b> to validate the proposed methodology. The insertion loss, defined as the difference in the noise levels with and without the presence of a <b>balcony,</b> has been used to assess the shielding effectiveness of a <b>balcony</b> against road traffic noise. The simple theory is validated by outdoor field measurements. It is also found that a properly designed <b>balcony</b> can provide considerable screening effects in protecting dwellings against road traffic noise. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
