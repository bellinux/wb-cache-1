5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and <b>bush</b> <b>dog,</b> and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

25|$|The wild canids {{found in}} Brazil are the maned wolf, <b>bush</b> <b>dog,</b> hoary fox, short-eared dog, crab-eating fox and pampas fox. The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the margay, the ocelot, the oncilla, and the jaguarundi. Other notable animals include the giant anteater, several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, marsh deer, Pampas deer, and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent). There are around 75 primate species, including the howler monkey, the capuchin monkey, and the squirrel monkey, the marmoset, and the tamarin.|$|E
25|$|The dhole's {{distinctive}} morphology {{has been}} a source of much confusion in determining the species' systematic position among the Canidae. George Simpson placed the dhole in the subfamily Simocyoninae alongside the African wild dog and the <b>bush</b> <b>dog,</b> on account of all three species' similar dentition. Subsequent authors, including Juliet Clutton-Brock, noted greater morphological similarities to canids of the genera Canis, Dusicyon, and Alopex than to either Speothos or Lycaon, with any resemblance to the latter two being due to convergent evolution. Some authors consider the extinct Canis subgenus named Xenocyon as ancestral of both genus Lycaon and genus Cuon. Subsequent studies on the canid genome revealed that the dhole and African wild dog are closely related to members of the genus Canis. This closeness to Canis may have been confirmed in a menagerie in Madras, where according to zoologist Reginald Pocock, a dhole interbred with a golden jackal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{carnivores}} {{and hunt}} during the day. Their typical prey are pacas, agouti, and capybaras, all large rodents. Although they can hunt alone, <b>bush</b> <b>dogs</b> are usually found in small packs. The dogs can bring down much larger prey, including peccaries and rheas, and {{a pack of}} six dogs has even been reported hunting a 250 kg tapir. When hunting paca, part of the pack chases it on land, and part wait {{for it in the}} water, where it often retreats.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bush</b> <b>dog</b> (Speothos venaticus) is a canid {{found in}} Central and South America.

The <b>bush</b> <b>dog</b> is the only living species in the genus Speothos, and genetic evidence suggests that its closest living relative is the maned wolf of central South America or the African wild dog.

40|$|AbstractLeishmania (Leishmania) infantum is {{the cause}} of visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in the Americas. The disease is transmitted mostly through the bite of the invertebrate vector, the phlebotomine Lutzomyia longipalpis in the New World. Although the domestic dog is considered the most important reservoir of the disease, other mammalian, including wildlife, are susceptible to infection. The goal {{of this study was to}} perform xenodiagnosis to evaluate the capacity of naturally infected maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and <b>bush</b> <b>dogs</b> (Speothos venaticus) to transmit Leishmania infantum to female sand flies (L. longipalpis). Xenodiagnoses were performed in February and August, 2013, when 77. 7 % (three maned wolves and four <b>bush</b> <b>dogs)</b> or 100 % of the animals were positive, respectively. However, parasite loads in the engorged sand flies was low (< 200 promastigotes and < 150. 2 parasites/μg of DNA). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two species or the two time points (February and August). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that maned wolves (C. brachyurus) and <b>bush</b> <b>dogs</b> (S. venaticus) asymptomatically infected with L. infantum are capable of transmitting L. infantum to the invertebrate host L. longipalpis, although the parasite loads in engorged phlebotomines exposed to these animals were very low...|$|R
