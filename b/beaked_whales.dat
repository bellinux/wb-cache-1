5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the <b>beaked</b> <b>whales).</b>|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E
50|$|Gray's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon grayi), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Haast's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> the Scamperdown whale, or the southern <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> {{is one of}} the better-known members of the genus Mesoplodon. This species is fairly gregarious and strands relatively frequently for a <b>beaked</b> <b>whale.</b> It is notable for being the only <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> other than Shepherd's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (not a mesoplodont), that has upper teeth. In the Māori language, this species is called hakurā or iheihe.|$|R

5|$|Whales {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Japanese whalers have hunted Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> on the Bōsō Peninsula, Wada, {{since the}} 17th century. Once landed {{just off the}} coast of Japan, the <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are pulled onto a landing station with ropes and then butchered for sale. The meat is sold as food and the rest is sold to be used as organic fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Many other oceanic {{species such}} as Sperm whales, pilot whales, and several species of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> {{including}} the first sightings of Shepherd's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> within the nation and dolphins such as southern right whale dolphins can be found further offshore around the rich, deep sea canyon about 20km off the peninsula coast which maybe as significant as Kaikoura and rarely strand.|$|E

25|$|Whale {{watching}} {{has become}} very popular in recent years. Many species of dolphins such as common dolphin, spotted dolphin, striped dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, short-finned pilot whale, and whales such as Bryde's whale, Sei whale, fin whale, sperm whale, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> can be spotted near the coast or offshore.|$|E
25|$|The toothed whales (systematic name Odontoceti) are a parvorder of {{cetaceans}} {{that includes}} dolphins, porpoises, {{and all other}} whales possessing teeth, such as the <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> and sperm whales. Seventy-three species of toothed whales (also called odontocetes) are described. They are one of two living groups of cetaceans, the other being the baleen whales (Mysticeti), which have baleen instead of teeth. The two groups {{are thought to have}} diverged around 34 million years ago (mya).|$|E
50|$|The pygmy <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon peruvianus), {{also known}} as the bandolero <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> Peruvian <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> and lesser <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> is the {{smallest}} of the mesoplodonts and one of the newest discoveries. There were at least two dozen sightings of an unknown <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> named Mesoplodon sp. A before the initial classification, and those are now believed to be synonymous with the species. The species was formally described in 1991, based on ten specimens obtained from Peru between 1976 and 1989, including a 3.72 m (12.2 ft) adult male as the type specimen. A specimen that stranded at Paracas, Peru in 1955 (first tentatively identified as Andrews' <b>beaked</b> <b>whale)</b> has since been identified as a pygmy <b>beaked</b> <b>whale.</b> Since 1987, there have been an additional 40 sightings of the species, for a total of 65 (as of 2001).|$|R
50|$|Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Ziphius cavirostris) Offshore Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> is a {{cosmopolitan}} ziphiid found in pelagic tropical to warm temperate waters. A juvenile landed at Axim in 1994 {{is the first}} documented <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> in the Gulf of Guinea. The status of Cuvier’s <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> is unknown, but no threats are identified. The single capture in Ghana among hundreds of other small cetaceans suggests that impact from bycatch is probably negligible.|$|R
50|$|Perrin's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon perrini) is {{the newest}} species of <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> to be described. The first two {{specimens}} were found in May 1975 stranded on the California coast, with two more specimens being found in 1978 and 1979, and the last in September 1997. They were initially identified as Hector's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon hectori), except for the most recent one, which {{was assumed to be}} a neonate Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cetaceans in Baltic Sea {{have been}} {{monitored}} by the ASCOBANS. Critically endangered populations of Atlantic white-sided dolphins and harbor porpoises inhabit the sea where white-colored porpoises have been recorded, and occasionally oceanic and out-of-range species such as minke whales, bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales, orcas, and <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> visit the waters. In recent years, very small, but with increasing rates, fin whales and humpback whales migrate into Baltic sea including mother and calf pair. Now extinct Atlantic grey whales (remains found from Gräsö along Bothnian Sea/southern Bothnian Gulf and Ystad) and eastern population of North Atlantic right whales that is facing functional extinction once migrated into Baltic Sea.|$|E
25|$|The Sea of Japan {{was once}} thought {{not to have}} been a {{migration}} route, until several entanglements were recorded. Any records of the species had not been confirmed since after 1921 on Kyushu. However, there were numerous records of whales along the Genkai Sea off Yamaguchi Prefecture, in Ine Bay in the Gulf of Wakasa, and in Tsushima. Gray whales, along with other species such as right whales and Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> were common features off the north eastern coast of Hokkaido near Teshio, Ishikari Bay near Otaru, the Shakotan Peninsula, and islands in the La Pérouse Strait such as Rebun Island and Rishiri Island. These areas may also have included feeding grounds. There are shallow, muddy areas favorable for feeding whales off Shiretoko, such as at Shibetsu, the Notsuke Peninsula, Cape Ochiishi on Nemuro Peninsula, Mutsu Bay, along the Tottori Sand Dunes, in the Suou-nada Sea, and Omura Bay.|$|E
500|$|Fucaia buelli is the {{earliest}} mysticete, {{dating back to}} 33 million years ago (mya). Measuring only , it is the smallest baleen whale discovered. It is only known from its teeth; they suggest a suction feeding behavior, much like that of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Like other early toothed mysticetes, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", F. buelli had heterodont dentition. Archaeomysticetes from the Oligocene are the Mammalodontidae (Mammalodon and Janjucetus) from Australia. They were small with shortened rostra, and a primitive dental formula (...) [...] In baleen whales, enlarged mouths adapted for suction feeding evolved before specializations for bulk filter feeding. In the toothed Oligocene mammalodontid Janjucetus, the symphysis is short and the mouth enlarged, the rostrum is wide, and {{the edges of the}} maxillae are thin, indicating an adaptation for suction feeding. The aetiocetid Chonecetus still had teeth, but the presence of a groove on the interior side of each mandible indicates the symphysis was elastic, which would have enabled rotation of each mandible, an initial adaptation for bulk feeding like in modern mysticetes.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the marine}} life, the harbor seal {{is the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of seal and found along the east coast, while the hooded seal, bearded seal, grey seal, ringed seal, and harp seal {{are found in the}} northwest. Whales are common along Atlantic coastline. Whale species found along the entire coastline includes the Gervais' <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> common minke whale, fin whale, sei whale, blue whale, humpback whale, sperm whale, dwarf sperm whale, pygmy sperm whale, killer <b>whale,</b> Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> True's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> and the Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{superficial}} similarities to the (entirely allopatric) Hector's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> this species {{is closely related}} to the pygmy <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> the next most-recently described species, and probably represents its Northern Hemisphere sister species.|$|R
50|$|Some data {{supposedly}} {{referring to}} this species, especially juveniles and males, {{turned out to}} be based on the misidentified specimens of Perrin's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> - especially since the adult male of Hector's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> was only more recently described.|$|R
500|$|White sharks also attack {{dolphins}} and porpoises from above, behind {{or below}} {{to avoid being}} detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.), Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a [...] juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed. When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), {{has been found in}} great white shark stomachs.|$|E
500|$|Scientist Ken Balcomb has {{extensively}} studied {{killer whales}} since 1976; {{he is the}} research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was also able to study killer whales from [...] "his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed [...] "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" [...] to escape {{the sound of the}} sonars. [...] "Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said." [...] The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.|$|E
500|$|Odontocetes {{are known}} as toothed whales; they have teeth and only one blowhole. They rely on their {{well-developed}} sonar {{to find their way}} in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as [...] "blackfish", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).|$|E
50|$|Longman's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Indopacetus pacificus, {{also known}} as the Indo-Pacific <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> or the {{tropical}} bottlenose whale) was originally assigned to Mesoplodon, but Joseph Curtis Moore placed it in its own genus, Indopacetus, a taxonomic assignment which has been followed by all researchers.|$|R
50|$|Andrews' <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon bowdoini), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the deep-crest <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> or splay-toothed whale, {{is one of the}} most poorly known members of a poorly known genus. This species is noteworthy for not having yet been observed in the wild (as of 2008).|$|R
50|$|The ginkgo-toothed <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon ginkgodens) is {{a poorly}} known species of whale {{even for a}} <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> and was named for the unusual shape of its dual teeth. It is a fairly typical-looking species, but is notable for the males not having any scarring.|$|R
2500|$|The {{toothed whale}} is a {{suborder}} of the cetaceans characterized by having teeth. [...] The teeth differ considerably among the species. They may be numerous, with some dolphins bearing over 100 teeth in their jaws. [...] On the other hand, the narwhals have a giant unicorn-like tusk, {{which is a}} tooth containing millions of sensory pathways and used for sensing during feeding, navigation, and mating. It is the most neurologically complex tooth known. [...] <b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are almost toothless, with only bizarre teeth found in males. [...] These teeth {{may be used for}} feeding but also for demonstrating aggression and showmanship.|$|E
2500|$|Mammals {{found on}} the island include: subantarctic fur seals, Antarctic fur seals, New Zealand fur seals and {{southern}} elephant seals– over 80,000 individuals of this species. Diversities and distributions of cetaceans are less known; southern right whales and orcas are more common followed by other migratory baleen and toothed whales especially sperm and <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> prefer deep waters. So called [...] "Upland Seals" [...] once found on Antipodes Islands and Macquarie Island have been claimed as a distinct subspecies of fur seals with thicker furs by scientists although {{it is unclear whether}} these seals were genetically distinct.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{has shown}} that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals. [...] <b>Beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> the most common {{casualty}} of the strandings, {{have been shown to}} be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar. Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar, while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins. The US Navy, which part-funded some of studies, said that the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but they [...] "will evaluate the effectiveness of [...] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings".|$|E
