The CPV espouses Marxism–Leninism and Hồ Chí Minh Thought, the thoughts of the late Hồ Chí Minh. The two ideologies function as a firm ideological basis and serve as guidance for {{the activities of the}} Party and state. According to the Constitution, Vietnam is [...] "in the period of transition to socialism". Marxism–Leninism was introduced to Vietnam in the 1920s and 1930s, and Vietnamese culture has been led under the <b>banner</b> <b>of</b> <b>patriotism</b> and Marxism–Leninism. Hồ Chí Minh's beliefs were not systematised during his life, nor quickly following his death. Trường Chinh's biography of [...] "Chairman Hồ" [...] in 1973 emphasised his revolutionary policies. The thoughts of Hồ Chí Minh were systematised in 1989, under the leadership of Nguyễn Văn Linh. Hồ Chí Minh Thought, alongside Marxism–Leninism, became the official ideology of the CPV and the state in 1991. The CPV's claim to legitimacy was retained following the collapse of communism in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 by its commitment to the thoughts of Hồ Chí Minh, according to Sophie Quinn-Judge. According to Pierre Brocheux, the author of Ho Chi Minh: a Biography, the current state ideology is Hồ Chí Minh Thought, with Marxism–Leninism playing a secondary role. While some claim that Hồ Chí Minh Thought is used as a veil for the Party leadership since they, according to this version, have stopped believing in communism, however this is false when considering that Hồ Chí Minh was an avid supporter of Vladimir Lenin and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Others see Hồ Chí Minh Thought as a political umbrella term whose main function is to smuggle in non-socialist ideas and policies without challenging socialist legality.|$|E

5000|$|The Fourth Party Congress {{reviewed}} Pen Sovan's {{political report}} and defined the party's {{strategy for the}} next several years. The Congress adopted five [...] "basic principles of the party line," [...] which were to uphold the <b>banners</b> <b>of</b> <b>patriotism</b> and <b>of</b> international proletarian solidarity; to defend the country (the primary and sacred task of all people); to restore and to develop the economy and the culture in the course of gradual transition toward socialism; to strengthen military solidarity with Vietnam, Laos, the Soviet Union, and other socialist nations; and to develop [...] "a firm Marxist-Leninist party." [...] At the Congress it was decided that henceforth the party would be known as the KPRP, in order to distinguish it from [...] "the reactionary Pol Pot party and to underline and reassert the community of the party's best traditions." [...] The Fourth Party Congress also proclaimed its resolve to stamp out the [...] "reactionary ultra-nationalist doctrine of Pol Pot," [...] to emphasize a centralized government and collective leadership, and to reject personality cults. The [...] "ultra-nationalist doctrine" [...] issue was an allusion to Pol Pot's racist, anti-Vietnamese stance. The Congress, attended by 162 delegates, elected twenty-one members of the party Central Committee, who in turn elected Pen Sovan as general secretary and the eight members of the party inner circle to the Political Bureau (Heng Samrin - No. 2 member, Chea Sim - No. 4 member, Hun Sen - No. 6 member, Chan Sy, minister of defense and prime minister from December 1981 - No. 7, including Chea Soth - deputy prime minister, Bou Thang - chair of the Party’s Central Propaganda Committee, deputy prime minister from 1982 to 1992, and minister of defense from 1982 to 1986, and Chan Sy), seven member of Secretariat (including Hun Sen).

Wallace during the 1948 presidential election, Copland was investigated by the FBI during the Red scare of the 1950s. [...] He was included on an FBI list of 151 artists thought to have Communist associations and found himself blacklisted, with A Lincoln Portrait withdrawn from the 1953 inaugural concert for President Eisenhower. Called later that year to a private hearing at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., Copland was questioned by Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn about his lecturing abroad and his affiliations with various organizations and events. In the process, McCarthy and Cohn neglected completely Copland's works, which made a virtue of American values. Outraged by the accusations, {{many members of the}} musical community held up Copland's music as a <b>banner</b> <b>of</b> his <b>patriotism.</b> The investigations ceased in 1955 and were closed in 1975.|$|R
40|$|This essay aims to read Shaw’s “Common Sense About the War” (1914) {{within the}} context of the British and German intellectual’s public {{declarations}} on the war. Both British and German governments demanded their intellectuals to defend their war to the public and to the world. Declarations made by significant figures of both nations affirm the narrative told by the political body. This is a Gramscian reading which takes Gramsci’s observation on the role of intellectuals: “intellectuals play a major role in the struggle for hegemony”. Shaw’s “Common Sense About the War” was just that act “in the struggle for hegemony. ” Challenging the “common sense” views of his times, Shaw attempted to urge the public to be more critical and questioning about their patriotic and ethnocentric positions on most vital issues such as war. In Gramscian terms, he invites the public to use “good sense” rather than the taken for granted “common sense”. Shaw uses the phrase “common sense” in his title to invite the public to “common sense” leaving aside their romantic, idealised views on the war and its causes. Despite their ideological differences, British public figures such as Kipling, Bennett, Wells, Christabel Pankhurst and Doyle among others seemed all to be united at that time of war under the <b>banner</b> <b>of</b> <b>patriotism.</b> Shaw’s text in this sense contests the hegemonic discourse of the time.

40|$|The {{accession}} to power of Vladimir Putin in 2000 {{was followed by}} a policy of national revival that crystallised under the <b>banner</b> <b>of</b> <b>patriotism.</b> Several government-sponsored programmes of ‘patriotic education for the citizens of the Russian Federation’ were adopted to promote the glorification of the fatherland, its greatness, and its distinctiveness. This policy has been conveyed by official institutions such as the educational system, the military, and the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as by United Russia and pro-presidential youth movements such as Nashi and Molodaya Gvardiya. Patriotic symbols have emerged in public space and historical commemorations now set the agenda. Television and cinema have been significant in staging this revival of Russia's national identity. Reference to the fatherland is used as a means of mobilising a detached public around the state and giving renewed prestige to a country whose international status has been questioned. This widespread discursive and symbolic patriotic turn has been extensively addressed by scholars, especially in the fields of history, culture, and consumption. Nevertheless, nearly 15 years after the first patriotic education programme, the question remains of how this Kremlin-backed patriotism has impacted on Russian society. The ‘patriotism’ argument is often presented by scholars as a tool to explain Moscow's foreign policy objectives, especially since the Ukrainian crisis, and the regime's popularity in relation to its liberal opposition. However, we know little about how patriotism has transformed individual and collective practices. Observing from diverse points of departure, the essays presented in this collection provide sociological insight into the practices that have developed in Russia in the 2000 s and 2010 s under the patriotic umbrella. More than the designs and designers of the patriotic programmes, we are interested here in the users of patriotism. Based on empirical studies carried out in several Russian regions, this collection highlights the diversity of the social practices that qualify as patriotism. It demonstrates the individual and collective appropriation of patriotism and contributes to the examination of the relationship of social actors and the state, showing the limits of the political loyalty driven by patriotism...|$|E

According to sympathetic views <b>of</b> Burke’s <b>patriotism,</b> and the theory <b>of</b> emotions that underlies it, the latter has resources to ground a cosmopolitanism of a particular kind. The paper contests these views by highlighting the affinities of Burkean patriotism to some objectionable forms <b>of</b> <b>patriotism,</b> such as Alasdair MacIntyre’s version of it, and its incompatibility with less objectionable forms, such as Jürgen Habermas’s...|$|R
