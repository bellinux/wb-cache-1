40|$|The failure {{mechanism}} and maximum collapse load <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> structures may change significantly under static and dynamic excitations {{depending on their}} internal arrangement and material properties.

The discrete element method (DEM) can play an important role in these studies. This paper discusses possible collapse mechanisms and provides a set of parametric analyses by considering the influence of material properties and cross section morphologies on the out of plane strength <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> walls. Detailed modeling <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> structures may affect their mechanical strength and displacement capacity.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study on flexural bond strength <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> using various blocks {{in combination with}} different mortars. Flexural bond strength <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> has been determined by testing stack-bonded prisms using a modified bond wrench test set-up. The effect of mortar composition and strength on the masonry's. flexural bond strength using three types <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> units (stabilized mud blocks, stabilized soil-sand blocks and burnt brick) has been examined. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>masonry</b> unit's moisture content on flexural bond strength has also been studied. Increases in mortar strength lead to increased flexural bond strength for cement mortar, irrespective of the type <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> unit. It {{has been found that}} combination mortars, such as soil-cement mortar and cement-lime mortar, lead to better bond strength compared to cement mortars. The moisture content <b>of</b> the <b>masonry</b> unit at the time of casting has displayed significant influence on the flexural bond strength <b>of</b> the <b>masonry.</b> It has been found that for each type <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> unit, an optimum moisture content exists, beyond which the flexural bond strength falls off quickly...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on shear bond strength–masonry {{compressive}} strength relationships {{and the influence of}} bond strength on stress–strain characteristics <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> using soil–cement blocks and cement–lime mortar. Methods of enhancing shear bond strength <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> couplets without altering the strength and modulus <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> unit and the mortar are discussed in detail. Application of surface coatings and manipulation of surface texture <b>of</b> the <b>masonry</b> unit resulted in 3 – 4 times increase in shear bond strength. After adopting various bond enhancing techniques masonry prism strength and stress–strain relations were obtained for the three cases <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> unit modulus to mortar modulus ratio of one, less than one and greater than one. Major conclusions of this extensive experimental study are: (1) when the masonry unit modulus is less than that <b>of</b> the mortar, <b>masonry</b> compressive strength increases as the bond strength increases and the relationship between masonry compressive strength and the bond strength is linear and (2) shear bond strength influences modulus <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> depending upon relative stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>masonry</b> unit and mortar...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Masonry is {{a complex}} {{multicomponent}} composite consisting of dissimilar materials (brick / stone and mortar). Masonry deformation process under loading depends on the mechanical characteristics of the basic composite materials, {{as well as of}} the parameters of the elements defining binding between brick and mortar being the interface elements. Traditional methods <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> modeling are based on the use of generalized ("effective") mechanical properties of the composite as a continuant homogeneous continuant medium. This paper presents an overview and analysis <b>of</b> continuant <b>masonry</b> models adequately reflecting the process of elastic, and in some cases elastic-plastic masonry deformation within the composition of stone structural elements. The paper provides analysis of the experimental research results <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> behaviour in a biaxial stress state at primary stresses of opposite signs; identifies masonry destruction mechanisms complying with the conditions of stress state. The work demonstrates the key role played by interface elements in the formation <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> destruction processes. Based on destruction mechanisms deduced from experiments, there was developed a discrete model <b>of</b> <b>masonry.</b> A system <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> strength criteria was proposed corresponding to the biaxial stress state conditions at primary stresses of opposite signs.

40|$|Due to {{the advent}} of varied types <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> systems a {{comprehensive}} failure mechanism <b>of</b> <b>masonry</b> essential for the understanding of its behaviour is impossible to be determined from experimental testing. As masonry is predominantly used in wall structures a biaxial stress state dominates its failure mechanism. Biaxial testing will therefore be necessary for each type <b>of</b> <b>masonry,</b> which is expensive and time consuming.
