40|$|The {{active process}} in a short length of steel wire {{passivated}} by 65 per cent nitric acid has been observed {{under the influence of}} a polarizing current, and the form of the potential recorded by the cathode ray oscillograph. In the passive wire, 80 per cent of the total potential drop takes place at the anode, 20 per cent at the cathode. The change from active to passive states, as measured by the potential change, is very abrupt compared to the duration of activity and the potential curve at a point on the wire is probably almost rectangular. The duration of the refractory state is decreased at the anode and increased at the cathode, as in nerve. This fact is against the idea that reactivity after passivation results from a partial reduction of an oxide layer. Soft iron wire passivated by anodal polarization repassivates after activation in acid of a dilution that fails to passivate it initially. It soon becomes rhythmic with a very short refractory phase, and then reacts continuously. Such a wire exhibits a very sharp alternation between a dark brown oxide coat during activity, and a <b>bright</b> <b>clean</b> <b>surface</b> during passivation. A passive steel wire in nitric acid shows many of the characteristics of an inert electrode such as platinum, and it may be inferred that, superposed upon the primary passivation potential, there exists an electrode or oxidation-reduction potential equilibrium between the effects of the various constituents of the solution. It is suggested that the phenomena of nerve-like reactivity in this system may involve an alternation between two protective coatings of the steel wire. During activity, the surface becomes mechanically coated with a brown oxide. If this coating does not adhere, due to gas convection or to rapid solution of the oxide, passivation does not result. Under sufficiently intense oxidizing conditions, a second oxide coat may form in the interstices of the first, and cover the surface as the first coating dissolves off. This furnishes the electrochemical protection of passivation, which is followed by the gradual attainment of electrode equilibrium with the solution...|$|E

40|$|Several reconstructions of the Pb(110) {{surface and}} their transformations have been {{investigated}} with {{low energy electron microscopy}} and diffraction. Although the c(2 x 4) order-disorder transition of the <b>clean</b> <b>surface</b> was seen clearly to be first order, variation of the transition temperature, T sub(tl) approximately 420 K, by at least 25 K across the surface indicates the presence of significant heterogeneity. Locally varying stress of sufficient magnitude to effect the c(2 x 4) phase transition broadening may be ultimately responsible for driving this reconstruction and its evolution into a (2 x n) form. Potassium-induced c(5 x 2) and c(2 x 4) structures, which we attribute to substrate reconstruction, have also been discovered here. These impurity-induced structures are distinguished from the <b>clean</b> <b>surface</b> reconstruction by their periodicities and/or disordering temperatures.

At least three different structures of O 2 on these metals are produced as coverage is increased. Unfortunately, dissolution of the O 2 into the bulk prevents accurate determination of surface coverage and this, coupled with the inability to handle intensity‐distribution curves effectively, has made complete structure determinations of these oxides impossible...|$|R

40|$|Cobalt {{silicide}} (CoSi 2) islands {{have been}} formed by the deposition of thin films (~ 0. 1 to 0. 3 nm) of cobalt on clean Si(111) and Si(100) substrates in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) followed by annealing to ~ 880 degrees C. Conducting atomic force microscopy has been performed on these islands to characterize and measure their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Current-voltage curves were analyzed using thermionic emission theory to obtain the Schottky barrier heights and ideality factors between the silicide islands and the silicon substrates. Current-voltage measurements were performed ex situ for samples ("passivated surfaces") where the silicon surface surrounding the islands was passivated with a native oxide. Other samples ("clean surfaces") remained in UHV while I-V curves were recorded. By comparing barrier heights and ideality factors for islands on both surfaces, {{the effects of the}} non-passivated surfaces on conduction were studied. The <b>clean</b> <b>surface</b> barrier heights were found to be ~ 0. 2 to 0. 3 eV below barrier heights measured from similar islands on passivated surfaces. The reduced Schottky barrier is mainly attributed to Fermi level pinning by non-passivated surface states of the <b>clean</b> silicon <b>surface.</b> However, the measured barrier heights of the <b>clean</b> <b>surface</b> islands are equivalent on both Si(111) and Si(100), suggesting that the non-passivated surfaces are influenced by cobalt impurities. Furthermore, the barrier heights of islands on the <b>clean</b> <b>surfaces</b> are lower than due to Fermi level pinning alone and the additional barrier height lowering is primarily attributed to spreading resistance effects. Schottky barrier inhomogeneity may also cause additional barrier height lowering and non-ideality in the contacts. The <b>clean</b> <b>surface</b> barrier heights decreased and the ideality factors increased with decreasing temperature, which is attributed to the temperature variation of the Fermi level.
