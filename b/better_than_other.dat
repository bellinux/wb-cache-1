Two crossings were developed, Vanderbilt’s steamship and stage line in Nicaragua and the New York-based Panama Railroad. Both enterprises used imported labor, largely Jamaican. Some 5,000 eventually worked on the Panama railroad line. The projects proved that the West Indian blacks resisted tropical diseases <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>other</b> workers and they were available in large numbers due to the islands’ depressed economies.|$|E
