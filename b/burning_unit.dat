40|$|In many landscapes, an {{important}} {{fire management objective}} {{is to reduce the}} negative impacts from unplanned fires on people, property and ecological values. In Australia, there exists an inherent assumption that high spatial variability in fire ages and hence fuel loads will have negative effects on both the incidence and spread of subsequent fires, and will enhance ecological values. A recent study using the process-based computer simulation model FIRESCAPE-SWTAS predicted several relationships between prescribed burn treatment levels and spatial patterning and management objectives in south-west Tasmania, Australia. The present study extended this investigation to additionally explore the effects of prescribed burning treatment unit size on unplanned fire incidence and area burned both in the general landscape and specifically in fire-intolerant vegetation. Simulation results suggest that treatment level had the greatest influence on modifying fire effects, whereas treatment unit size had the least effect. The model predicted that all three parameters interacted to determine the mean annual area burnt by unplanned fires. In fire-intolerant vegetation, treatment unit size did not influence the incidence of unplanned fires and the area burnt by unplanned fires in these communities. Where significant differences were evident, fire risk was reduced by higher treatment levels, deterministic spatial patterns of burning units, and smaller <b>burning</b> <b>unit</b> sizes...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinearities {{exist in}} all process control systems. The use of linear control {{techniques}} is valid {{only in a}} narrow range of operation. Therefore, in this thesis, multivariable nonlinear control techniques are considered. The target process is the single effect evaporative process of the liquor <b>burning</b> <b>unit</b> in Alcoa's alumina refinery in Kwinana and the proposed triple effects unit in the Wagerup refinery. Two types of nonlinear control strategies using differential geometry were studied, namely, the input output linearization (Kravaris and Soroush, 1990) and the input state linearization (Hunt et al, 1983 a). The research has successfully demonstrated the superiority and simplicity of the nonlinear controller through simulations and plant implementations. An integrated software package using MAPLE V. 3 as the computing environment was developed to automate the solution algorithms and to graphically simulate the closed loop dynamics of different processes using the two nonlinear control strategies. The issue of robustness of the nonlinear controller was addressed by developing a procedure called uncertainty vector adjustment. The effectiveness of the new strategy was successfully demonstrated on the simulated liquor burning process. Furthermore, {{the stability of the}} adjustment technique was proved and its theoretical bounds were established using Lyapunov function analysis. A comparative study of geometric nonlinear filter and extended Kalman filter was conducted to reduce the requirement of full state feedback necessary for nonlinear control using either input output linearization or input state linearization. The simulation of the single effect evaporation unit of the liquor burning process showed that the geometric nonlinear filter is superior to the extended Kalman filter in terms of nonlinear tracking performances. The plant trials of the input output linearization ++in Alcoa's Kwinana alumina refinery demonstrated the practicability and feasibility of implementing nonlinear control in an industrial setting and also fostered a closer gap between academia and industry. The trials established guidelines for implementing a global linearizing controller on site, including conversion of the relevant constraints and the output of an industrial proportional and integral controller to the equivalent proportional and integral action required by the nonlinear controller. The results showed that the performance of the nonlinear controller was better than the current linear controller on site in terms of responsiveness and resistance to disturbances. Hence, the nonlinear control strategy enables the process to settle faster. All in all, efforts have been made in this thesis to minimise the use of abstract mathematical language and, in some cases, simplify the language so that nonlinear control theory can be understood by a wider range of audience, especially industrial practitioners. It is hoped that the insights provided in the dissertation will encourage more industrial implementations of nonlinear controllers and forge more interaction to close the widening gap between academic and industrial practice in process control.

For these vehicles, hybrid power trains can offer significantly improved fuel economy and exhaust emissions.

Most hybrid vehicles today use chemical energy storage batteries to supplement the power from the fuel <b>burning</b> generator <b>unit.</b> Chemical storage batteries however, present several difficulties in power management and control.

40|$|Fires bum many vegetated {{regions of}} the world to a variety of degrees and {{frequency}} depending on season. Extensive biomass burning occurs in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa, posing great threat to ecosystem stability among other real and potential adverse impacts. In Africa, such landscape-scale fires are used for various agricultural purposes, including land clearing and hunting, although there may be a limited number of cases of fires ignited by accident or due to arson. Satellite remote sensing provides the most practical means of mapping fires, because of their sudden and aggressive nature coupled with the tremendous heat they generate. Recent advancements in satellite technology has enabled, not only the identification of fire locations, but also the measurement of fire radiative energy (FRE) release rate or power (FRP), which has been found to have a direct linear relationship with the rate of biomass combustion. A recent study based on FRP measurements from the Moderate-resolution imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites revealed that, among all the {{regions of the}} world where fires occur, African regions rank the highest in the intensity of biomass <b>burning</b> per <b>unit</b> area of land during the peak of the burning season.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fly ash was {{investigated}} {{with a variety}} of chemical, mineralogical, petrographic, and microbeam techniques from three coal-fired units at two Kentucky power plants. Two units burn high-sulfur Illinois Basin high volatile bituminous (hvb) coal, and the third unit burns a ∼ 70 : 30 blend of high-sulfur Illinois Basin hvb coal and low-sulfur, relatively high-CaO Powder River Basin subbituminous coal. With high-S, high-Fe coals in all of the blends, spinel (magnetite) is an important constituent in the fly ashes. Overall, the fly ashes are dominated by glass. Portlandite was noted in the high-Ca-coal-derived ash. Concentrations of Ba and Sr are highest in the latter fly ash, a function of the Powder River Basin coal source for a portion of the blend. Rare earth elements do not have a high concentration in any of the fly ashes and do not show any significant partitioning between the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or baghouse rows in the individual generating units.

Larger fuel timelag classes (1000 +-hr timelag) were measured along the entire 20 m transect. On a given unit, then, at least 120 m, 180 m, 300 m, and 1200 m of 1 – 1000 +-hr timelag fuel transects were measured. Fuelbed depth was measured three times along each transect, and litter and duff depth was also measured three times. After treatment, all transects were remeasured using the same methods.|$|R
