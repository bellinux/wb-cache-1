5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{soldiers}} in Harold's army is unknown. The contemporary records {{do not give}} reliable figures; some Norman sources give 400,000 to 1,200,000 men on Harold's side. The English sources generally give very low figures for Harold's army, perhaps to make the English defeat seem less devastating. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5,000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, and most modern historians argue for a figure of 7,000–8,000 English troops. These men {{would have been a}} mix of the fyrd and housecarls. Few individual Englishmen are known to have been at Hastings; about 20 named individuals can reasonably <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> have fought with Harold at Hastings, including Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine and two other relatives.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the fyrd (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. The main difference between the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E

5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E
