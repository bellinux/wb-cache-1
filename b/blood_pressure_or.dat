5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>or</b> an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>or</b> symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

25|$|Ischemic colitis (also spelled ischaemic colitis) is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which inflammation and injury of the large intestine result from inadequate blood supply. Although uncommon in the general population, ischemic colitis occurs with greater frequency in the elderly, and {{is the most common}} form of bowel ischemia. Causes of the reduced blood flow can include changes in the systemic circulation (e.g. low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure)</b> <b>or</b> local factors such as constriction of blood vessels or a blood clot. In most cases, no specific cause can be identified.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{of the effects of}} synephrine in humans, most of them {{focusing}} on its cardio-vascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given intravenously, doses of 25–50mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200mg had no effects on <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>or</b> pulse rate. Oral doses of 500–1500mg of the drug did not affect <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>or</b> respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Tamsulosin and {{silodosin}} are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in {{the prostate}} {{instead of the}} α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>or</b> prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. Non-selective alpha blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may also require slow dose adjustments as they can lower blood pressure and cause syncope (fainting) if {{the response to the}} medication is too strong.|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} catecholamine {{levels in}} vitro were studied using the modified high pressure liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection. Differential centrifugation showed that platelet-rich plasma contained significantly higher catecholamine levels than platelet-poor plasma. Serum samples {{had significantly higher}} catecholamine levels than plasma. Plasma or serum samples clotted with glass beads had significantly higher catecholamine levels than those without. Therefore, consistent results can only be obtained when catecholamine samples are spun at the same speed, either plasma or serum can be used, but not both in a single study. Post-dated blood for transfusion was used to study stability of catecholamines, and showed that catecholamines are stable. Hence, the collection of blood samples for catecholamine measurements was modified. Blood samples were collected in Vacutainer tubes containing lithium heparin without antioxidants and not pre-cooled, samples were spun at the convenient time. This was welcomed by the clinicians {{who did not have}} to interrupt clinical assessment to care for blood samples as with the former method. The three clinical studies showed no significant differences in catecholamine levels in patients undergoing laryngoscopy with and without tracheal intubation, whether or not the patients were beta blocked or had received topical tracheal analgesia. The mean catecholamine levels were within the normal range. No relationships between baseline catecholamine levels and the baseline <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>or</b> heart rate nor between the changes in catecholamine levels from the baseline and the corresponding changes in <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>or</b> heart rate. The Injury Severity Score in minor injured patients had no relationship with plasma catecholamine levels, and no significant rise in noradrenaline levels when the ISS< 30 and adrenaline levels when the ISS< 17. The studies suggest that catecholamine levels are of no value in assessing the severity of minor injuries, <b>or</b> changes in <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>or</b> heart rate during anaesthesia...|$|R

25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{progressive}} loss in kidney function {{over a period}} of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are not specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>or</b> diabetes and those with a bloodline relative with CKD. This disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia, pericarditis or renal osteodystrophy (the latter included in the novel term CKD-MBD). CKD is a long-term form of kidney disease; thus, it is differentiated from acute kidney disease (acute kidney injury) in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months. CKD is an internationally recognized public health problem affecting 5–10% of the world population.|$|E
25|$|Its use is {{endorsed}} by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms {{as long as there}} are not other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>or</b> recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality. Additionally, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine states that objective evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke is insufficient to warrant its classification as standard of care. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.|$|E
25|$|The first {{published}} case {{report of a}} blood clot and pulmonary embolism in a woman using Enavid (Enovid 10mg in the U.S.) at a dose of 20mg/day did not appear until November 1961, four years after its approval, by which time it had been used by over one million women. It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish {{an increased risk of}} venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or have high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>or</b> other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The hearings were conducted by senators who were all men and the witnesses {{in the first round of}} hearings were all men, leading Alice Wolfson and other feminists to protest the hearings and generate media attention. Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent. Today's standard dose oral contraceptives contain an estrogen dose that is one third lower than the first marketed oral contraceptive and contain lower doses of different, more potent progestins in a variety of formulations.|$|E

25|$|Pets {{might have}} the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in {{particular}} the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>or</b> mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die {{as a result of a}} heart attack than those who didn’t own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment. Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.|$|E
