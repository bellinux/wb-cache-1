40|$|Adequate sealing in {{turbomachinery}} reduces secondary leakage {{and results}} in more efficient and stable systems. Labyrinth seals are most common, although brush seals are popular in specialized applications. The Hybrid <b>Brush</b> <b>Seal</b> (HBS) is a novel design that adds to the bristle brush matrix a number of cantilever pads that rest on the rotor surface. Upon shaft rotation the pads lift due to the generation of a hydrodynamic gas film while the brushes effectively seal an upstream pressure. Hence the HBS has no wear and no local thermal distortion effects. Measurements of leakage versus pressure differential are obtained in a three-teeth labyrinth, a conventional <b>brush</b> <b>seal,</b> and a hybrid <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> for operation at high temperature (300 ?C), with shaft surface speeds to 27 m/s, and at supply pressures to 3. 5 bar. Flow measurements are presented {{in terms of a}} flow factor to remove dependency on the air temperature and supply pressure. The measurements demonstrate the HBS leaks less (~ 61 %) than a standard <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and is significantly better (~ 38 %) than a similarly sized labyrinth seal. Predictions of flow through a labyrinth seal predict well at supply pressures under 1. 7 bar but overpredict by as much as 25 % at high supply pressures. A porous medium fluid flow model predicts the flow through the HBS and <b>brush</b> <b>seal.</b> The model for the HBS and <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> underpredicts the flow rate at low supply pressures but match well at high supply pressures. Measurements of the drag torque of the test seals show the HBS has a larger torque when pressurized compared to the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and labyrinth seal. This indicates that the HBS experiences a larger degree of blow-down due to the pads decreasing the clearance. The mechanical parameters of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and HBS are found based upon the flexibility function from impact load tests. A combined structural and dry friction damping model represent well the measured flexibility. An equivalent damping is found based upon the energy dissipation. Based upon the damping ratio, the HBS has twice of the viscous damping as the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> at a supply pressure of 2. 0 bar...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary fluid {{nitrogen}} flow data are reported for a five-brush, ceramic-coated-rub-runner <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> system, where the brushes and the rub runner were placed {{at each end}} of a centrally pressurized multifunction tester ('back-to-back' set of brushes) and tested at rotor speeds of 0, 10, 18, and 22. 5 krpm. After testing, both the brushes and the ceramic-coated rub runner appeared pristine. The coating withstood both the thermomechanical and dynamic loadings with minor wear track scarring. The bristle tips showed some indication of material shearing (smearing) wear. The Ergun (1952) porous flow equation was applied to the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> data. The Ergun relation fit the gaseous data but was in poor agreement with the fluid results. The <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> exit conditions were two phase.

40|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> dynamic {{behavior}} is {{strongly related to}} pressure and flow fields. Developments in <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> design have led to geometric modifications to control flow field and consequent <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> issues including blow-down, hang-up, and pressure stiffening. Some of the geometric enhancements {{have been found to}} have common use as backing plate modifications. Over the two decades of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> evolution, many backing plate configurations have been suggested in numerous patent disclosures. Even so, literature on the effects of geometric modifications on pressure and flow fields remains limited. This study numerically investigates <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> pressure and flow fields for such common conceptual backing plate configurations as single and multiple grooves, with and without by-pass passages. The CFD analysis presented employs a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various backing plate configurations outlining important flow features is discussed. Results indicate that backing plate configurations have a decisive role in shaping seal pressure fields. In general, it has been found that all cases having bypass configuration leak more. Moreover, the major portion of the seal leakage through fence height is fed from the backing plate cavity. The single backing plate groove forms a constant pressure behind the bristle pack. In contrast, multiple grooves form multiple constant pressure regions...|$|E
40|$|Brush seals {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in the latest turbine engines to reduce leakage and improve efficiency. However, the life of these seals is limited by wear. Studies have shown that optimal sealing characteristics for a <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> occur before the interference fit between the brush and shaft is excessively worn. Research to develop improved tribopairs (brush and coating) with reduced wear and lower friction has been hindered {{by the lack of}} an accurate, low-cost, efficient test methodology. Estimated costs for evaluating a new material combination in an engine company seal test program are on the order of $ 100, 000. To address this need, the NASA Lewis Research Center designed, built, and validated a unique, innovative <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft tester that slides a single tuft of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> wire against a rotating shaft under controlled loads, speeds, and temperatures comparable to those in turbine engines. As an initial screening tool, the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft tester can tribologicaly evaluate candidate seal materials for 1 / 10 th the cost of full-scale seal tests. Previous {{to the development of the}} <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft tester facility, most relevant tribological data had been obtained from full-scale seal tests conducted primarily to determine seal leakage characteristics. However, from a tribological point of view, these tests included the confounding effects of varying contact pressures, bristle flaring, high-temperature oxidation, and varying bristle contact angles. These confounding effects are overcome in tuft testing. The interface contact pressures can be either constant or varying depending on the tuft mounting device, and bristle wear can be measured optically with inscribed witness marks. In a recent cooperative program with a U. S. turbine engine manufacturer, five metallic wire candidates were tested against a plasma-sprayed Nichrome-bonded chrome carbide. The wire materials used during this collaboration were either nickel-chrome- or cobaltchrome-based superalloys. These tests corroborated full-scale seal test results and provided insight into previously untested combinations. As the cycle temperature for improved efficiency turbine engines increases, new <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> materials combinations must be considered. Future <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> tuft testing will include both metallic and ceramic bristles versus commercial and NASA-developed shaft coatings. The ultimate goal of this work is to expand the current data base so that seal designers can tailor <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> materials to specific applications...|$|E
40|$|Developments in turbine {{technologies}} lead {{to higher}} operating temperature and pressure conditions. Parasitic leakage flows around the turbine account for considerable efficiency losses that increase fuel cost dramatically. <b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> has recently emerged as an improved sealing technology to provide better leakage performance and to replace classical labyrinth seals. In order to optimize efficiency, comprehensive study of the factors causing the leakage is required. The leakage performance of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> is directly related with geometry, operating inlet and outlet boundary conditions, bristle pack configuration. <b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> flow and pressure profiles with turbine operating conditions become complicated, and analytical formulations remain inadequate to correlate design parameters and leakage performance in operating conditions. Recently brush seals have found ever increasing applications in steam turbines. Literature review indicates that there is very limited studies of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> for steam environment. There is also no correlation available for <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> porosity coefficients in the literature. In an attempt to meet this need, six brush seals have been tested in a rotary test rig up to 100 psi upstream pressure. Analytical correlations and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations have been performed for test seals and results have been correlated with the test data. Axisymmetric CFD models {{have been designed to}} reach anisotropic resistance coefficients for the brush seals based on experiments. Porous Medium Approach has been applied for representing bristle pack. Leakage rate of brush seals (steam environment) has been optimized through CFD models. Moreover, velocity and pressure characteristics in the bristle pack have been illustrated for an optimum solutions. Consequently, empirical correlations for <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> porosity coefficients have been correlated through a systematic methodology...|$|E

40|$|The {{integrity}} {{and performance of}} <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> have been established.

Short-duration (46 hr) experimental T- 700 engine testing of the compressor discharge seal established over 1 -percent engine performance gain (brush versus labyrinth). Long-term gains were established only as leakage comparisons, with the brush at least 20 percent better at controlling leakage. Long-term materials issues, such as wear and ultimately seal life, remain to be resolved.

Over {{the past two decades}} of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> evolution, manufacturers and researchers have applied many geometric configurations to the front and backing plates of a standard <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> in order to control the flow field and consequent seal performance. The number of studies evaluating the effect of geometric configurations on the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> flow field remains limited in spite of the high number of filed patent disclosures.

A CFD model has been employed to calculate pressure and flow fields in the seal domain. The model incorporates a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various conceptual geometries has been outlined in terms of flow field formation. Results disclose unique effects of geometry on pressure and flow fields such that a longer front plate drives outward radial flow while playing a protective role against upstream cavity disturbances. Findings also indicate that variations in front plate geometry do not directly affect leakage performance.

40|$|Brush seals have {{established}} a niche in the gas-to-gas sealing against leakage in modern turbine engines. The variable nature of the brush during operation makes leakage prediction difficult.

These are the first test results obtained with NASA s new High-Temperature, High-Speed Turbine Seal Test Rig (see the photograph).

It had a radial concentric interference of 0. 071 cm (0. 0028 in.) and a fence height of 0. 0927 cm (0. 0365 in.). There were 1060 bristles per centimeter of circumference (2690 bristles per inch of circumference). Rotor eccentricities of 0. 003, 0. 010, 0. 038, and 0. 043 cm (0. 001, 0. 004, 0. 015, and 0. 017 in.) were achieved by using bushings with different offsets. The results were compared with an annular seal model (FLOWCAL) for air and to a standard labyrinth seal model for steam. The annular seal model was also compared with a bulk flow model of a concentric <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> in air. Large eccentricities did not damage the brush seals or their Haynes 25 bristles. However, the 304 stainless steel rotor did not show wear, indicating a harder surface is needed. Only the stream data showed hysteresis and were affected by shaft rotation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} leakage {{characteristics}} of brush seals including the flow field characteristic of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> {{and the effects}} of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic of brush seals with the consideration of bristle deflection. The flow field characteristic of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> was discussed based on three-dimensional (3 -D) computational model of <b>brush</b> <b>seal,</b> two-way fluid–structure interaction and moving grid technique. Then the effect of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic of brush seals was investigated from theoretical and numerical simulation perspectives with the emphasis on an improved prediction formula of leakage flow rate of brush seals. As illustrated in the analysis of the leakage characteristics of brush seals, (1) the leakage with the influence of bristle deflection is closer to the results of experiment relative to that without bristle deflection, and increases with the increasing inlet/outlet pressure ratios, which validate the developed 3 -D computational model with bristle deflection to be more reasonable; (2) the flow field characteristics (pressure and velocity) of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> are revealed reasonably; (3) with the increasing of the height of backing plate fence, the clearance of brush wire and the axial clearance between brush bristle and back plate, the leakage factor rises and then reaches a stable value when the clearance of brush is larger than 0. 3 mm; moreover, (4) with the increase of brush wire diameter, the leakage factor decreases firstly and then tends to stabilization, while rapidly decreases at first, then slowly decreases, and lastly tends to a value when the bristle row number increases; (5) the reliability and accuracy of the proposed prediction equation for brush seals is validated to be high by the CFD computational results. The efforts of this paper provide a useful theoretical and numerical method to clearly understand the leakage characteristics of <b>brush</b> <b>seal,</b> which is beneficial to improve the design of brush seals.

40|$|The {{gas turbine}} {{industry}} {{used a variety}} of sealing mechanisms to contain and direct secondary flows into and around components for cooling, and to limit leakage into and from bearing and disk cavities. The function of these seals is very important to the component efficiencies and attendant engine performance. Most of these seals are labyrinth seals, which are high-leakage seals that are costly to manufacture. In recent years, <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> have been introduced which have demonstrated significantly reduced leakage, although they are still expensive and have exhibited wear and hysteresis difficulties. A new innovative concept called finger seal, patented by AlliedSignal, has demonstrated leakage similar to <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> and is cheaper. The finger seal is comprised of a stack of precision photo-etched sheet metal elements, which allows intricate features to be made at very low cost and with the potential to resist wear and provide the compliance necessary to accomodate rotor excursions. Initial testing in the high-speed/high-temperature seal test facility, at the NASA Lewis Research Center, has corroborated the finger seal performance. The testing also revealed hysteresis problems with the current design. A NASA funded research project is in progress to correct the functional deficiencies of the finger seal and to refine its features to provide sufficient seal life for commercial transport engines and other long-life applications. This research will benefit the aeronautical gas turbine industry as a whole in terms of fuel consumption, operational characteristics, and cost. The first phase of this research to reduce finger seal hysteresis has been in progress for the last one year. This paper presents the results of this research to date.
