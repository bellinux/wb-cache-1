5000|$|Typically {{muscle fibers}} {{surround}} the hydrostatic body. There {{are two main}} types of muscle fibers orientations {{that are responsible for}} the movement: the circular orientations and longitudinal orientations. [...] Circular muscles decrease the diameter of <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> body, resulting in an increase in the length of the body, whereas longitudinal muscles shortens the length of <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> body, resulting in an increase in the diameter of the body. There are four categories of movements of <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> skeleton : elongation, shortening, bending and torsion. Elongation, which involves an increase in the length of <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> body requires either circular muscles, a transverse muscle arrangement, or radial muscle arrangement. For a transverse muscle arrangement, parallel sheets of muscle fibers that extend along the length of <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> body. For <b>a</b> radial muscle arrangement, radial muscles radiate from a central axis along the axis perpendicular to the long axis. Shortening involves the contraction of the longitudinal muscle. Both shortening and bending involve the contraction of longitudinal muscle, but for bending motion some of the antagonistic muscles work synergistically with longitudinal muscles. The amplitude of movements are based upon the antagonistic muscles forces and the amount of leverage the antagonistic muscle provides for movement. For the torsion motion, muscles are arranged in helical layers around <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> body. The fiber angle (the angle the fiber makes with the long axis of the body) plays a critical role in torsion, if the angle is greater than 54°44', during muscle contraction, torsion and elongation will occur.

"December 2012 "Pumps and motors are commonly connected hydraulically to create hydrostatic drives, also known as <b>hydrostatic</b> transmissions. <b>A</b> typical <b>hydrostatic</b> transmission consists of a variable displacement pump and a fixed displacement motor. Maximum efficiency is typically created for the system when the motor operates at maximum volumetric displacement. The objective of this research is to determine if <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> transmission with <b>a</b> variable displacement motor can be more efficient than one with a fixed displacement motor. A work cycle for a Caterpillar 320 D excavator was created and the efficiency of the hydrostatic drive system, controlling the swing circuit, with a fixed displacement motor was compared to the efficiency with a variable displacement motor. A PID and an H∞ controller were designed for a position control model, as well as velocity control. It was found that while it may seem obvious to achieve maximum efficiency at maximum displacement, there are some cases where maximum efficiency is achieved at a lower displacement. It was also found that for the given work cycle, <b>a</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> transmission with <b>a</b> variable displacement motor can be more efficient...|$|R
