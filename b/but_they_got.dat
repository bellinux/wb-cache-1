William Collins, who was a landscape gardener offered to give his services to beautify the ground, {{and in the early}} 1870s the club had a somewhat ambitious scheme to build a pavilion, fence and level the ground, and also build a bowling green.

25|$|Such a big army {{needed a}} lot of money. Churaman decided to gather booty from rich states of Kota and Bundi. He {{acquired}} Sinsini from the Mughal-Rajput combine in 1704 after having surrounded the fort whereupon seeing his fate sealed, the Durgpal accepted a small amount and vacated the fort hastily. This shows the calculating brains of Churaman where he managed to make the enemy flee {{without having to go}} in for any bloodshed. In 1705 there was a war with Mughal subadar Mukhtar khan of Agra and with Raja Bahadur in 1707 at Sinsini. In the second war at Sinsini 1000 Jats were lost <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the victory.|$|E

25|$|Mike Caldwell pitched {{his second}} win of the Series and almost went the distance. The Brewers struck first on Ted Simmons's bases loaded groundout {{in the first}} off of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied {{the game in the}} third on Keith Hernandez's RBI double. The Brewers took a 2–1 lead in the bottom half on Cecil Cooper's groundout with runners on first and third and added to their lead on Paul Molitor's RBI single in the fifth. George Hendrick's RBI single in the seventh cut the Brewers lead to 3–2, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> that run back {{in the bottom of the}} inning on Robin Yount's home run, then added to their lead in the eighth on {{back-to-back}} RBI singles by Charlie Moore and Jim Gantner off of Bruce Sutter. The Cardinals staged a late rally in the ninth as Keith Hernandez doubled in a run and George Hendrick singled him in with two outs. Bob McClure came in and allowed a single to Darrell Porter, putting the tying run on base. McClure, however, struck out Willie McGee, then retired pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to end the game. Robin Yount set a World Series record by recording his second four-hit game, his first came in Game 1. To this day, Yount remains the only player to have multiple 4-hit games in one World Series.|$|E
25|$|This mound, called Knockinglaw on the 1896 OS, {{still exists}} in very poor condition, near Little Onthank. It was a tumulus in which urns had been found. It had a powder {{magazine}} built into it at one stage and was eventually effectively removed altogether. It {{is involved in}} one of the versions of the stories of the killing of Lord Soulis. He {{is said to have been}} killed here in 1444 after leading a band of English mercenaries into the Kilmarnock area and then subsequently suffering a rout at the hands of the Boyd's of Dean Castle. Dean Castle at one time belonged to the De Soulis family. A memorial stone, dating from at least 1609, to Lord Soulis is to be found set into a wall at the High Church, by the railway viaduct. A brass plaque with details of the De Soulis coat of arms used to be set into the road near this spot. The Soulis Cross was in Soulis Street, but is now housed in the Dick Institute. A notorious Lord Soulis is linked with the evil redcaps at Hermitage Castle in the Borders. He could only be bound by a three-stranded rope of sand, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> over the problem of hanging him by binding him in a lead sheet and boiling himn to death for the murder of the Laird of Branxholm. Robertson points out that the coat of arms of the De Soulis & De Morville families is identical and they may therefore have been related. The De Soulis family lost their lands due to their involvement in 'The Soulis Plot' to depose Robert the Bruce. The family were unsuccessful claimants to the throne of Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|Late in the {{previous}} year, the tower's French defenders had abandoned it after HMS Lowestoffe (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.

2500|$|April Wingate (Series 6–9) (Linda Regan) – April {{worked as}} a hairdresser before joining Maplins in 1960.

During her time at Maplins she began a {{relationship}} with Spike, and eventually decided {{she would like to}} marry him and live in a bungalow. Spike also wanted to get married, but did not want to give up being a comic in favour of a steady job, which upset April. She broke up their relationship after Joe Maplin leaked a story that Spike and Gladys were having an affair, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back together when this was proved false.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Pete lasted {{in the show}} for eight years, and was eventually written out in 1993 when the writers felt that the character {{had come to a}} natural end. There was initially talk of Pete getting back together with his ex-wife Kathy, but it was felt {{that it would have been}} a retrogressive step, and it was dismissed. The character was killed off-screen in December 1993 and brought back to Walford to be buried. The press reported at the time that Pete was killed-off because he spoke negatively about EastEnders in the press following his axing. There was also speculation that he had not got along with Gillian Taylforth, who played his ex-wife Kathy. Dean commented, [...] "When they wrote me out of EastEnders, they said they had run out of storylines.

2500|$|In December1941, Puyi {{followed}} Japan in declaring {{war on the}} United States and Great Britain, but as neither {{nation had}} recognized Manchukuo there were no reciprocal declarations of war in return. During the war, Puyi was an example and role model {{for at least some}} in Asia who believed in the Japanese Pan-Asian propaganda. U Saw, the Prime Minister of Burma, was secretly in communication with the Japanese, declaring that as an Asian his sympathies were completely with Japan against the West. USaw further added that he hoped that when Japan won the war that he would enjoy exactly the same status in Burma that Puyi enjoyed in Manchukuo as part of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, saying that as an Asian it was his fondest wish that Japan would do everything that it had done in Manchukuo in Burma. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg sarcastically wrote that USaw and the rest of Barmar nationalists who saw the Japanese as liberators from the British were not endowed with [...] "great intelligence" [...] as USaw enjoyed far more power as Prime Minister under the British than Puyi did as Emperor under the Japanese, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> their wish to have what was done to people of Manchukuo done to their own people, observing: [...] "The use of military and civilian prisoners for bayonet practice and assorted other cruelties provided the people of Southeast Asia with a dramatic lesson on the new meaning of Bushido, the code of the Japanese warrior." ...|$|E

(28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight. (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days.

[...] if she falls down in one of her disguises. And, if big guys throw her, she tells them to do it [...] "gently!" [...] In addition, when she disapproves of something, she exclaims [...] "Gotta go!" [...] When she makes an appearance on Cory in the House, her father exclaims, [...] "You didn't get kicked out of design school because they don't give out refunds!", which shows she is attending design school.
