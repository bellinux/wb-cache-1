25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} is {{a predictor}} of CVD events and related mortality. Many components of metabolic syndrome {{are associated with a}} sedentary lifestyle, including increased adipose tissue (predominantly central); reduced HDL cholesterol; and a trend toward increased triglycerides, blood pressure, and glucose in the genetically susceptible.

25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> instance, a student may leave the room when talking {{in front of the}} class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable shaking. A fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E

25|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{hand washing}} with soap {{is recognized as}} a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition. However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> example, in most of rural Africa handwashing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build handwashing stations. However, low handwashing rates rather can also {{be the result of}} engrained habits rather than {{due to a lack of}} soap or water.|$|E
25|$|For sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs), {{high levels of}} immunity in one sex induces herd immunity for both sexes. Vaccines against STIs that are targeted at one sex result in significant declines in sexual disease in both sexes if vaccine uptake in the target sex is high. Herd immunity from female vaccination does not, however, extend to homosexual males. If vaccine uptake among the target sex is low, then the other sex {{may need to be}} immunized so that that sex can be sufficiently protected. High-risk behaviors make eliminating STIs difficult since even though most infections occur among individuals with moderate risk, the majority of transmissions occur because of individuals who engage in high-risk <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> these reasons, certain populations may require immunizing high-risk persons or individuals of both sexes to establish herd immunity.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the seminal}} article on {{functional}} analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology {{available to them}} at the time. Instead of treating {{the function of the}} disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead pre-assume consequences to alter disruptive <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, B.F. Skinner) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{theory on}} the {{evolution}} of pursuit predation suggests that the behavior is an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation. Prey animals vary in their likelihood to avoid predation, and it is predation failure that drives evolution of both prey and predator. Predation failure rates vary wildly across the animal kingdom; raptorial birds can fail anywhere from 20% to 80% of the time in predation, while predatory mammals usually fail more than half the time. Prey adaptation drives these low rates in three phases: the detection phase, the pursuit phase, and the resistance phase. The pursuit phase drove the evolution of distinct <b>behaviors</b> <b>for</b> pursuit predation.|$|E
2500|$|Space {{is another}} {{semantic}} domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies. Spatial categories vary greatly across languages. Speakers {{rely on the}} linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks. Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations. While many languages use combinations of them, some languages exhibit only one type and related <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> example, Yimithirr only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relationsâ€” the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions. Speakers define a location as [...] "north of the house", while an English speaker may use relative positions, saying [...] "in front of the house" [...] or [...] "to {{the left of the}} house".|$|E
2500|$|Further REBT {{generally}} {{posits that}} disturbed evaluations {{to a large}} degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> example, awfulizing is partly mental magnification of the importance of an unwanted situation to a catastrophe or horror, elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a [...] "holocaust". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and axiomatically defined by their perceived flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.|$|E
