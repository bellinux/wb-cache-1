5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|Locations in England {{included}} the River Thames, {{for the flight}} of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and the flight of Dumbledore's Army to the Ministry of Magic. This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye, Canary Wharf, <b>Big</b> <b>Ben,</b> Buckingham Palace, and the HMS Belfast. Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, {{as it has in}} the past. A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E
5|$|To {{film the}} final scene at Westminster, the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5am. This {{was the first time}} the security-sensitive area (home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence) had ever been closed to {{accommodate}} filming. Prime Minister (at the time of filming) Tony Blair's son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal, stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.|$|E
50|$|They {{were taken}} over in 1961 by AEC parent Associated Commercial Vehicles Ltd, and {{production}} {{was limited to}} Nubians, <b>Big</b> <b>Bens</b> and Antars, although the Thornycroft-designed six-speed constant mesh gearbox was used in AEC and later medium weight Leyland and Albion trucks. ACV was then taken over by Leyland in 1962. They already had a specialist vehicle unit in Scammell, another manufacturer of large haulage vehicles. Thornycroft's Basingstoke factory was closed in 1969 and specialist vehicles transferred to Scammell at Watford.|$|R

5|$|When {{the budget}} was {{projected}} at $100 million (Warner Bros. wanted it {{for no more}} than $75 million), producer Larry J. Franco commissioned a test reel from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the visual effects company he worked with on Jumanji. Burton was persuaded to change his mind to employ computer animation, which brought the final production budget to $80 million. Although Purves was uncredited for his work, stop-motion supervisors Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders, who would later collaborate with Burton on Corpse Bride, received character design credit. Warner Digital Studios was responsible for the scenes of global destruction, airborne flying saucer sequences, the Martian landing in Nevada, and the robot that chases Richie Norris in his pickup truck. Warner Digital also used practical effects, such as building scale models of <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> and other landmarks. The destruction of Art Land's hotel was footage of the real-life night-time demolition of The Landmark Hotel and Casino, a building Burton wished to immortalize.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} finale was to {{take place}} on the hands of <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of the <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside <b>Big</b> <b>Ben.</b> Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour. Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Dave Gielow spent months designing the interior of <b>Big</b> <b>Ben,</b> with each gear produced as wire-frame graphics on a computer that was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the {{nickname}} <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> {{is the subject of}} some debate. The nickname was applied first to the Great Bell; it may have been named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw the installation of the Great Bell, or after boxing's English heavyweight champion Benjamin Caunt. Now <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> is often used, by extension, to refer to the clock, the tower and the bell collectively, although the nickname is not universally accepted as referring to the clock and tower. Some authors of works about the tower, clock and bell sidestep the issue by using the words <b>Big</b> <b>Ben</b> first in the title, then going on to clarify that the subject of the book is the clock and tower as well as the bell.|$|E

[...] Caplan sharply criticized {{what he described as}} Stein's willingness [...] "to subvert the key reason why the Holocaust took place — racism — to serve his own ideological end.
