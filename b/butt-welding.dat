5000|$|The {{other major}} {{technique}} is socket fusion. It is distinguished from <b>butt-welding</b> by using custom-shaped and -sized heating plates {{rather than a}} basic flat surface. These heads allow for more surface contact, reducing {{the time needed to}} heat and fuse the pipe. Socket fusion joins pipe and fittings together, rather than simply joining pipe to pipe. It requires less pressure than <b>butt-welding</b> and is more commonly used on smaller sizes of pipe (4" [...] or less). Socket welding has additional advantages of requiring less machinery and is more portable than the heavier equipment required for butt fusion.|$|E

HTS steel structures are more sensitive to the welding residual stresses which affect the structural strength and fatigue. In this paper, the uncoupled finite element model is presented to predict the welding residual stress of <b>butt-welded</b> HTS steel plates based on the characteristics of welding thermo-mechanical cycles. The examples show that the results calculated by finite element method are in agreement with the experimental data. The effects of structural parameters, welding process parameters and boundary condition on the welding residual stress of <b>butt-welded</b> HTS steel plates are discussed.

40|$|Deformation and {{stresses}} in <b>butt-welding</b> {{of plates}} were studied. The work includes numerical simulation and experimental verification. The simulations were performed {{by use of}} the finite element method. Temperature dependence of material properties and phase transformations were considered. A thermo-elastoplastic material model was used. Plane stress conditions were assumed. Automatic <b>butt-welding</b> of plates without backing needs close tolerances of joint geometry. The thermally induced deformations and stresses are of great importance for joint geometry during welding. Therefore the change of gap width {{in front of the}} moving arc has been of special interest in these studies. The residual stresses, which may affect inservice behaviour of welded plates, were also calculated and measured. The tack-welds were found to influence the change in gap width in front of the moving arc. A proper tack-welding procedure is important in order to avoid large changes in gap width during <b>butt-welding.</b> The tack-welds should be made as soon after each other as possible. The sequence in which the tack-welds are made also affect the change in gap width. The gap width increased during {{the last part of the}} <b>butt-welding</b> in the simulations performed in this work. This increase was larger for wide plates than for narrow plates.

It is mostly hand-made by using oxy-fuel torch and the final performance of the manufactured goods is too strongly related to the capability of skilled technicians and to the settings of factors Often unpredictable. Further, spreading and out-of-control oxidative phenomena, troublesome reprocessing of the welded parts and unsafe operational conditions are determining a progressively growing demand for alternative welding technologies. The matter of the present investigation is therefore to evaluate the suitability of a high-power diode laser source in automatic <b>butt-welding</b> of sheets in ' 800 / 1000 ' and ' 925 / 1000 ' silver alloys. Interaction mechanisms between laser beam and underlying silver substrates in a chemical active environment were studied.

This project involves background work on <b>butt-welding</b> of injection moulded polypropylene ASTM bars followed by a programme on the welding of extruded polypropylene strapping tape. In the <b>butt-welding</b> study, the effects of processing conditions of the bars, welding variables, and annealing treatments, on the morphology and strength of the welds, were investigated. Light and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used for}} the analysis of morphological structure and fracture surface texture. Tensile tests have been used to assess the weld strength either at room temperature and at sub-zero temperature. In the strapping tape programme the influence of the tape orientation and the welding temperature on weld efficiency was analysed. The orientation of the tapes, obtained by means of five different draw ratios in the manufacturing plant, was assessed by doing shrinkage and optical measurements. Shear and peeling tests have been used to study the weld efficiency. From the <b>butt-welding</b> study was concluded that the microstructure of the injection moulded bars affected the weld zone morphology. The annealing at l 52 degrees C before and after welding caused a reduction in weld strength. However the oriented zones were apparently unaffected by these thermal treatments. In that the strapping tape welding is concerned, an optimum welding tool temperature could be identified.
