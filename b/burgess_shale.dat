5|$|Based on {{the number}} of individuals, Waptia fieldensis {{constitutes}} about 2.55% {{of the total number of}} organisms recovered from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale,</b> and 0.86% of the Greater Phyllopod bed.

The National Museum of Natural History alone houses more than a thousand specimens of the species from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale.</b> Waptia fieldensis are often found disarticulated, with parts remaining in close proximity to each other.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Cambrian fossil Amiskwia {{from the}} <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> has been classed as a nemertean, {{based on a}} {{resemblance}} to some unusual deep-sea swimming nemerteans, but few paleontologists accept this classification as the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossils show no evidence of rhynchocoel nor intestinal caeca.|$|E

50|$|The {{park has}} many Cambrian strata of oceanic {{sedimentary}} origin that shed {{insight into the}} explosive radiation of multicellular life on Earth. In the summer of 2012 {{a team of scientists}} from the Royal Ontario Museum, Pomona College, the University of Toronto, the University of Saskatchewan and Uppsala University discovered a Lagerstätte site of extraordinary preservation in shale, comparable to the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale's</b> phyllopod bed of fossils. only 42 km distant, in Yoho National Park. One species Kootenichela discovered in these rocks had been scientifically described: more than 50 new species were discovered in the Marble Canyon area in just two weeks of intensive exploration. The new assemblage of organisms, dating to Cambrian Stage 5, is described as rich in basal arthropods and remarkable for the density and diversity of its soft-bodied organisms, some preserved in previously unreported detail.|$|R
5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|These {{patterns}} – a few common {{species and}} many rare ones; {{the dominance of}} arthropods and sponges; and the percentage frequencies of different life-styles – seem to apply {{to all of the}} <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale.</b> However the identity of the dominant species differs between sites. For example, Marrella splendens is often credited as the commonest animal in the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale,</b> because of its abundance among the specimens collected by Walcott, but is only the third-most abundant organism in the Greater Phyllopod Bed, and very rare at other localities.|$|E
5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E

50|$|Banffia constricta {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of fossils found in the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shales.</b> It is up to 10 cm in length, and divided equally into anterior and posterior parts. The entire body is twisted in a clockwise spiral, {{as seen from the}} front. This is believed to be a secondary adaptation from an initial bilateral condition for a burrowing lifestyle. The anterior section is covered by two carapace-like un-mineralized shells that are fused together. A crown-like structure formed of three concentrate circular features surrounds the mouth. An antenna-form structure just posterior to the mouth may be a sensory organ. The posterior section is composed of 40 to 50 segments. The gut is straight, and the anus is at the terminal tip of the posterior section. The gut appears to have a series of diverticula or pouches. A possible circulatory system is visible in the fossils. B. constricta and its relative Skeemella were probably filter or deposit feeders.|$|R
40|$|The Estonian black argillites {{formed in}} Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician (Tremadoc) {{just after the}} Cambrian {{evolutionary}} explosion, nicely illustrated by the famous <b>Burgess</b> <b>shales.</b> The abundant new Cambrian lifeforms were well able to thrive in anoxic poisonous and strongly radioactive waters, rich in U 235. They belong to the extensive formation of the Cambrian-Ordovician black shales which form patches in the latitudinal zone extending from Lake Ladoga in the east to the Jutland Peninsula in the west. In the black mud-stones at Sillamäe the most enriched elements are, {{in the order of}} biocapture efficiency, molybdenum, carbon, rhenium, antimony, uranium and arsenic. It appears that not only the most unusual chemical composition, but also the very large compositional variability might depend upon even faraway meta-morphic processes and long-transported allochtons during the Finnmarkian and Caledonian orogenies. The Sillamäe black shale is certainly a better metalliferous ore than the comparable product from Jämtland, Sweden. It is also a very good future fuel, but only nuclear. The carbon content is too low for anything except providing process heat for production of rare metals...|$|R
5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> type preservation were found there.|$|E
5|$|Most Actiniaria do {{not form}} hard parts {{that can be}} {{recognized}} as fossils, but a few fossils of sea anemones do exist; Mackenzia, from the Middle Cambrian <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> of Canada, is the oldest fossil identified as a sea anemone.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the number}} of individuals, Waptia fieldensis is the third most {{abundant}} arthropod from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> Formation, with thousands of specimens collected. It was among the first fossils found by the American paleontologist Charles D. Walcott in 1909. He described it in 1912 and named it after two mountains near the discovery site – Mount Wapta and Mount Field.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale.</b> These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale.</b> Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E
5|$|However, if {{they were}} common, more than the {{occasional}} specimen might be expected in exceptionally preserved fossil assemblages (Konservat-Lagerstätten) such as the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> and Chengjiang. There are at present no widely accepted reports of Ediacara-type organisms in the Cambrian period, though {{there are a few}} disputed reports, as well as unpublished observations of 'vendobiont' fossils from 535Ma Orsten-type deposits in China.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, also from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale.</b> Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are not a single phylum.|$|E
5|$|Waptia fieldensis is {{the only}} species {{accepted}} under the genus Waptia. It is classified under the family Waptiidae (established by Walcott in 1912), the order Waptiida (established by Leif Størmer in 1944), and (tentatively) the clade Crustaceomorpha. Early restorations of Waptia fieldensis by Charles R. Knight in 1940 erroneously depicted it as a primitive shrimp, but modern paleontologists now consider it among the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> arthropods that are of unknown and uncertain taxonomic placement. Some authors have suggested {{that it may be}} allied to crustaceans, but like many Cambrian crustaceomorphs, the mouthparts were not preserved, making it impossible to reliably classify them within the crustacean crown group. Others propose that it may be only distantly related to crustaceans, being at least a member of a stem group of crustaceans, or even of all arthropods. Despite being one of the first species recovered and being the third most abundant fossils of the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale,</b> there is still no in-depth work on the morphology of Waptia fieldensis.|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossils {{were found}} on Mount Stephen in Canada's Rocky Mountains by a {{construction}} worker, whose reports of them reached Richard McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada. McConnell found trilobite beds there in 1886, and some unusual fossils that he reported to his superior. These were misdiagnosed as headless shrimps with unjointed appendages, and were named Anomalocaris because of their unusual appendages– but {{turned out to be}} pieces of a puzzle that took 90years to solve.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossils of}} the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> {{animals were}} {{probably}} killed {{by changes in}} their environment either immediately preceding or during the mud-slides that buried them. Proposed killing mechanisms include: changes in salinity; poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane; changes in the availability of oxygen; and changing consistency of the sea floor. The death event was not necessarily related to the burial, and {{there may have been}} multiple death events between burial events; but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand any chance of being fossilised, instead of rotting or being eaten.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale.</b> Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} {{that has}} {{seen a lot of}} activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the Cambrian explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Opabinia regalis is an extinct, stem group {{arthropod}} {{found in}} the Middle Cambrian <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of Opabinia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. Opabinia was a soft-bodied animal of modest size, and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. Opabinia probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} {{has led to the}} description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as <b>Burgess</b> <b>shale</b> type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
5|$|Charles Doolittle Walcott {{found in}} the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> nine almost {{complete}} fossils of Opabinia regalis {{and a few of}} what he classified as Opabinia media, and published a description of all of these in 1912. The generic name is derived from Opabin pass between Mount Hungabee and Mount Biddle, southeast of Lake O'Hara, British Columbia, Canada. In 1966–1967 Harry B. Whittington found another good specimen, and in 1975 he published a detailed description based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles. Whittington's analysis did not cover Opabinia media: Walcott's specimens of this species could not be identified in his collection. In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they {{found in the}} Norilsky region of Siberia and labelled Opabinia norilica, but these fossils were poorly preserved, and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus Opabinia.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils {{is one of}} their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and diatoms became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the exceptional preservational quality of the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> fossils are far from clear. The interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is that soft bodies and organs could only be preserved in anoxic conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous mudrock {{formations}} is the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> in Western Canada, which formed during the Cambrian. At this site, soft bodied creatures were preserved, some in whole, by the activity of mud in a sea. Solid skeletons are, generally, the only remnants of ancient life preserved; however, the <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> includes hard body parts such as bones, skeletons, teeth, and also soft body parts such as muscles, gills, and digestive systems. The <b>Burgess</b> <b>Shale</b> is one {{of the most}} significant fossil locations on Earth, preserving innumerable specimens of 500 million year old species, and its preservation is due to the protection of mudrock.|$|E
