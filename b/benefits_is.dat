5|$|Friends with <b>Benefits</b> <b>is</b> a 2011 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Will Gluck, and starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis {{in the lead}} roles. The film features Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Bryan Greenberg, Nolan Gould, Richard Jenkins, and Woody Harrelson in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Dylan Harper (Timberlake) and Jamie Rellis (Kunis), who meet in New York City, and naively believe adding sex to their friendship will not lead to complications. Over time, they begin to develop deep mutual feelings for each other, only to deny it each time they are together.|$|E
5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, foods with supposed health <b>benefits,</b> <b>is</b> increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
25|$|Disability {{determination}} at the Social Security Administration {{has created}} the largest system of administrative courts in the United States. Depending {{on the state of}} residence, a claimant whose initial application for <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> denied can request reconsideration or a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Such hearings sometimes involve participation of an independent vocational expert (VE) or medical expert (ME), as called upon by the ALJ.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, in {{the optimal}} allocation, the {{marginal}} <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> weakly decreasing. The countries are divided to consecutive groups, from upstream to downstream. In each group, the marginal <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> the same, and between groups, the marginal <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> decreasing.|$|R

25|$|EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction (NCPDP Telecommunications Standard version 5.1) is used {{to submit}} retail {{pharmacy}} claims to payers by health care professionals who dispense medications, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It {{can also be used}} to transmit claims for retail pharmacy services and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of retail pharmacy services within the pharmacy health care/insurance industry segment.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} plans have been introduced that would raise the age of Medicare eligibility. Some have argued that, as the population ages and the ratio of workers to retirees increases, programs for the elderly need to be reduced. Since {{the age at which}} Americans can retire with full Social Security <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> rising to 67, it is argued that the age of eligibility for Medicare should rise with it (though people can begin receiving reduced Social Security benefits as early as age 62).|$|E
25|$|EDI Health Care Claim Transaction set (837) is used {{to submit}} health care claim billing information, {{encounter}} information, or both, except for retail pharmacy claims (see EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction). It can be sent from providers of health care services to payers, either directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It {{can also be used}} to transmit health care claims and billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of health care services within a specific health care/insurance industry segment.|$|E
30|$|Phase 3 The Benefit and Solution Decision phase during which, if necessary, the <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> recalculated and {{compared}} to the current solution set. If {{there is a difference}} all <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> sorted and the solution set of the top-k <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> chosen.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} <b>benefit</b> <b>was</b> {{a special}} <b>benefit</b> {{to the property}} because it was unique. The value of the special <b>benefit</b> <b>was</b> over $100,000. This amount outweighs {{the value of the}} land taken, therefore, once the special <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> deducted from the value of the land taken, the landowners are not entitled to just compensation.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} liberal social reforms {{in areas like}} censorship, homosexuality, divorce, education, and worker {{participation}} in company management were introduced, whilst social security <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased. Increases were made in unemployment benefits, while substantial improvements in <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> made for farmers, students, war invalids, the sick, families with many children, women, and pensioners between 1970 and 1975, {{which led to a}} doubling of benefit and social security payments during that period. By 1979, old age and survivors’ <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> 53% higher in real terms than in 1970, while family <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> 95% higher.|$|R
25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse. Financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data. The net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings or public willingness to pay compensation (implying the public has no legal right to {{the benefits of the}} policy) or willingness to accept compensation (implying the public has a right to the benefits of the policy) for the welfare change resulting from the policy. The guiding principle of evaluating <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> to list all (categories of) parties affected by an intervention and add the (positive or negative) value, usually monetary, that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.|$|E
25|$|CSR {{is known}} for {{impacting}} employee turnover. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and {{that the ability to}} retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces employee turnover. Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.|$|E
25|$|Cost–benefit {{analysis}} {{is often used}} by organizations to appraise the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the cost–benefit ratio. Generally, accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E

50|$|A pension <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> not {{considered}} to be an asset of a deceased estate. Pension <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> dealt with outside the estate. The deceased may not bequeath these benefits to an heir or legatee. If pension <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> due to the deceased, the trustees will decide to whom they are awarded. The bloedige hand principle has been extended to cover pension benefits.|$|R
5000|$|CLAC offers {{numerous}} group <b>benefit</b> plans, which <b>are</b> {{run through}} the Health and Welfare Trust Fund. There <b>are</b> two <b>Benefit</b> Administration offices.

25|$|Regular, brisk {{exercise}} {{of any kind}} can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduce stress. It can also {{reduce the risk of}} coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical <b>benefits,</b> <b>is</b> also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|To {{assess what}} current {{knowledge}} of social immune systems suggested about whether social immunity was a bypoduct or driver of complex group living, Meunier delineated 30 different mechanisms of social immunity found in eusocial insects {{and looked for}} counterparts to these in presocial and solitary insects. Supporting the hypothesis that social immunity was a driver and not a by-product of complex group living, 10 mechanisms had counterparts in presocial insects and 4 in solitary species (though this {{does not imply that}} some mechanisms may evolve as a byproduct). Evidence that social immunity mechanisms are selected for at least somewhat due to collective <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> lacking though – possibly due to the difficulty in isolating the immune benefits from the other benefits that social immunity mechanisms often bestow (e.g. allogrooming inhibits the establishment of ectoparasites, but also improves the accuracy of nest mate recognition due to the sharing and thus homogenization of chemical signatures between group members), and the difficulty in experimentally separating direct fitness from indirect fitness, potentiated in eusocial taxa where sterile/non-reproductive individuals predominatee. More studies on presocial taxa would allow for phyletic analyses to recover the actual path of evolution that different mechanisms of social immunity took.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would {{have to look for}} a job or education. If {{at the end of the}} year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.|$|E
