25|$|Lev and Natalia {{were married}} in the Soviet Union. Little {{is known about the}} couple in the months that {{followed}} the Nazi and Romanian attack on the Soviet Union. They escaped Bessarabia, and fled further inland: Răutu is said to have been a mere laborer at a sand quarry and a kolkhoz. He and Natalia had two children, both of whom died, probably of hunger, during the months of Soviet retreat. At some point (perhaps in 1943), Răutu became head of the Radio Moscow Romanian-language division, making him a favorite of exile faction leader Ana Pauker's, together with Valter Roman and Petre Borilă. This assignment placed Răutu in direct contact with some of Pauker's colleagues in the Comintern: he replaced Basil Spiru, of Marx University fame, and was supervised by Rudolf Slánský. His other job was as <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> for the Foreign Languages Publishing House.|$|E
500|$|To some reviewers, Satin {{appears to}} have had a {{political}} goal– [...] encouraging activists to establish common ground with ordinary North Americans {{on the basis of their}} shared confusion and humanity. [...] For example, Jackie Hooper, writing in The Province, argues that the purity of motives projected by many pacifist activists is unconvincing, and recommends Satin's more complex view: [...] "Satin's emigration wasn't dictated totally by his idealism. [...] More often than not, he talked himself into radical positions... as a result of trying to impress his peers or his girlfriend, or rebelling against middle-class parental authority". [...] Roy MacSkimming, <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> of the Toronto Star, says Satin portrayed himself as [...] "idealistic" [...] but also troubled and uncertain, wanting to fit in yet also longing to be unique.|$|E
500|$|According to writer Peter Buckley, {{the record}} {{presented}} a faster, [...] "thrashier kind of heavy metal". Steve Huey of AllMusic opined {{that the music}} on Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is predominantly [...] "chaotic", accompanied by [...] "lightning-fast" [...] solo sections. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno said that the original pressing greatly suffered from the poor production, which made the record difficult to listen to. However, {{he noted that the}} music is performed at rapid speed, with precise riffing by both Poland and Mustaine. In his <b>book</b> , <b>editor</b> Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried [...] "like a runaway train". Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that [...] "extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal back in those days". Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he wanted some of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo.|$|E

500|$|Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, {{producers}} at Universal Pictures, independently {{heard about}} Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. Brown came across {{it in the}} literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine's <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> gave {{a detailed description of}} the plot, concluding with the comment [...] "might make a good movie". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was [...] "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" [...] and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} {{as to whether or}} not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her in place for The Killing Joke. Gail Simone included the character's paralysis in a list of [...] "major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered", dubbing the phenomenon [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator. Following the release of the graphic novel, comic <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability—the information broker, Oracle.|$|E
500|$|The writing {{style was}} {{positively}} received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language. Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post remarked the writing was [...] "always lucid, sometimes elegant". In The New York Times Book Review Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a [...] "flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity {{giving way to}} the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire". Janet Maslin of The New York Times found the writing had [...] "an arid, plain, what-if style" [...] while being [...] "strangely uniform in tone". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that [...] " [...] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is {{the heart and soul}} of this book" [...] and that it is [...] "written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet". The Plain Dealer <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> Karen Long said Weisman [...] "uses the precise, unhurried language of a good science writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts".|$|E

500|$|Although <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> and {{university}} instructor James Michener could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright Quaker, he {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Navy in October 1942. [...] He was not sent to the South Pacific theater until April 1944, when {{he was assigned to}} write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely. [...] He survived a plane crash in New Caledonia; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the Treasury Islands, where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by [...] "scrawny residents and only one pig". [...] Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales. On a plantation on the island of Espiritu Santo, he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red betel juice. [...] Punctuated with profanity learned from GIs, she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other Tonkinese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated. [...] She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in French Indochina. These stories, collected into Tales of the South Pacific, won Michener the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, Pfeiffer {{accepted}} and also turned down many high-profile roles, {{beginning with the}} title role in Pretty Woman (1990), which earned Julia Roberts a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She took {{the part of the}} Soviet <b>book</b> <b>editor</b> Katya Orlova in the 1990 film adaptation of John le Carré's The Russia House, opposite Sean Connery, a role that required her to adopt a Russian accent. For her efforts, she was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Pfeiffer then landed the role of damaged waitress Frankie in Garry Marshall's Frankie and Johnny (1991), a film adaptation of Terrence McNally's Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, which reunited her with her Scarface co-star, Al Pacino. The casting was seen as controversial by many, as Pfeiffer was considered far too beautiful to play an [...] "ordinary" [...] waitress; Kathy Bates, the original Frankie on Broadway, also expressed disappointment over the producers' choice. Pfeiffer herself stated that she took the role because it [...] "wasn't what people would expect of [...]" [...] Pfeiffer was once again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance. During this period, she turned down the role of Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), a character that won Jodie Foster the Academy Award for Best Actress. Pfeiffer also declined the role of Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct (1992), ultimately played by Sharon Stone, as well as the role of Louise in Ridley Scott's Thelma & Louise, which went to Susan Sarandon.|$|E
