5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver {{that he or she}} does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first officer}} {{was using a}} {{medication}} against back pains which was not permitted while flying. However, these had been prescribed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> who had training in aviation medicine. No traces of the substance {{were found in the}} pilot's body after the accident. The crew had started duty at Bodø Airport at 13:30 (Central European Time, UTC+1) and were to make a round trip to Trondheim Airport, with intermediate stops at Sandnessjøen Airport, Mosjøen Airport, Brønnøysund Airport and Rørvik Airport as Flight 711. On the way down, the flight canceled its stop at Mosjøen because of bad weather. The aircraft landed at Trondheim Airport at 17:52. The return flight was to operate as Flight 744 from Trondheim via Namsos to Rørvik, where the plane and crew were to overnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician.</b> A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E

25|$|Losartan is a uricosuric. As a {{specific}} inhibitor of the urate transporter 1 (SLC22A12, URAT1), losartan blocks the uptake of uric acid into cells, thus leaving more {{available in the}} bloodstream to be filtered and excreted by the kidneys. Because losartan can cause hyperkalemia, individuals should not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without appropriate monitoring <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician.</b>|$|E

25|$|Restrictions in {{treatment}} are {{the scope of}} training and practice, some laws restricting decent methods to physicians (i.e. medication with specific controlled substances such as opiates) {{and the fact that}} concluding therapies are restricted to physicians and licensed practitioners only.

25|$|The {{concurrent}} use of opioids with other depressant {{drugs such as}} benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose. As with an overdose of opioid alone, the combination of an opioid and another depressant may precipitate respiratory depression often leading to death. These risks are lessened with close monitoring <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician,</b> who may conduct ongoing screening for changes in patient behavior and treatment compliance.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Parliament of Sweden {{enacted a}} law {{allowing}} only persons {{certified by the}} National Board of Health to circumcise infants.

25|$|In the 6th century BCE, the {{knowledge}} of circulation of vital fluids through the body was known to the Ayurvedic physician Sushruta in ancient India.

The valves of the heart were discovered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> of the Hippocratean school around the 4th century BCE. However their function was not properly understood then. Because blood pools in the veins after death, arteries look empty. Ancient anatomists assumed they were filled with air {{and that they were}} for transport of air.|$|E
