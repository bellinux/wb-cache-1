5|$|A more {{substantial}} <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway. A <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> ring and a late <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> sherd were excavated nearby. There {{have been a number of}} <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{horses were}} present in <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> Britain from around 2000BC. <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> horse trappings {{including}} snaffle bits have been found which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age.</b> Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> (about 1500 BC) tribes {{sometimes}} called the Urn people started to settle in the area. They built numerous stone circles, examples {{of which can be}} found on Moscar Moor, Froggatt Edge and Hordron Edge (Hordron Edge stone circle). Two Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> urns were found at Crookes in 1887, and three Middle <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> barrows found at Lodge Moor (both suburbs of the modern city).|$|E

An Iron Age wood and thatch crannóg {{dwelling}} was sited in the Loch at the present day Drumpellier Country Park. Dependent upon the water level in the loch, the remains can still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egypt was {{a civilization}} of ancient Northeastern Africa, {{concentrated}} along the lower {{reaches of the}} Nile River in the place that is now the country Egypt. It is one of six historic civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt occurred {{as a series of}} stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age,</b> the Middle Kingdom of the Middle <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> and the New Kingdom of the Late <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beeston crag {{is one of}} a {{chain of}} rocky hills {{stretching}} across the Cheshire Plain. Pits dating from the 4thmillennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> or early Iron Age in origin. It may have been a specialist metalworking site.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> Britain {{this was}} an {{important}} seaport. Eleven <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> Britain round barrows sit on the promontory with two more a little further inland. Eleven of the round barrows were excavated; three by Bushe Fox in 1911–12 and eight by Harold St George Gray in 1919 and 1922. Two appear to be undisturbed. Numerous finds including Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> axes and cremation urns were recovered from these tumuli, which have been consistently found to be between 3500 and 4000 years old.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age.</b> In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age.</b> In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> II, Intermediate <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age,</b> Middle <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E

5|$|Settlement in {{the region}} of Gaza dates back to Tell es-Sakan, an Ancient Egyptian {{fortress}} built in Canaanite territory to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the Early <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased. Another urban center known as Tell al-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age,</b> a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BCE, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BCE, {{at the end of the}} <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds {{around the}} Humber Estuary were settled and farmed in the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age,</b> and the Ferriby Boats – {{one of the}} best-preserved finds of the era – were {{discovered}} near Hull in 1937. In the more mountainous regions of the Peak District, hillforts were the main <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> settlement and the locals were most likely pastoralists raising livestock.|$|E

The Romano-British period is represented with several sites. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles and church or village crosses which date from the Middle Ages.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human existence on the moors around Bolton since {{the early part of}} the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age,</b> including a stone circle on Cheetham Close above Egerton, and <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> burial mounds on Winter Hill. A <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> mound was excavated in Victorian times outside Haulgh Hall. The Romans built roads from Manchester to Ribchester to the east and a road along what is now the A6 to the west. It is claimed that Agricola built a fort at Blackrod by clearing land above the forest. Evidence of a Saxon settlement exists in the form of religious objects found when the Victorian parish church was built.|$|E
5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of artefact {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken as an indication that during the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> the site was used for funerary practices. Many of the hills near Mellor are surmounted by <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> funerary monuments such as Brown Low, Shaw Cairn, and Werneth Low, supporting the possibility that Mellor was also a funerary site. Also dating from the <b>Bronze</b> <b>Age</b> and found on the site was a rare high-status amber necklace. Amber does not occur naturally in Britain the nearest source is the Baltic. It would have been traded over long distances. The necklace {{was discovered}} {{as part of a}} 4,000‑year‑old burial.|$|E
