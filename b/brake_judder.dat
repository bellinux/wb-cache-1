40|$|Abstract: <b>Brake</b> <b>judder</b> is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring in di erent types of vehicles. The judder frequency is {{directly proportional to}} the revolution speed of the wheel and therefore also to the velocity of the vehicle. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and oor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a sound. <b>Brake</b> <b>judder</b> primarily a ects the comfort but could, when confronting an inexperienced driver for the rst time, lead to faulty reactions and reduced driving safety. Furthermore, a speci c type of judder, so-called hot judder, is related to disc cracking. There are numerous publications available dealing with high frequency vibrations, such as brake squeal, including mathematical models for analysis and simulation. However, low frequency phenomena, such as <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> and groan, have received much less attention. There is a growing interest from the automotive industry concerning <b>brake</b> <b>judder.</b> Even though few companies would admit {{that they have the}} problem, it is not unusual to meet people who have experienced the problem in their own passenger cars. Much of the knowledge concerning <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> remains within the companies. Hence, very few people have the full picture.

40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>judder</b> is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} that typically occurs in vehicles. The judder frequency is {{directly proportional to}} the revolution speed of the wheel and therefore also to the velocity of the vehicle. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and structure floor. <b>Brake</b> <b>judder</b> can be split into two distinct groups – “hot” and “cold” judder, both {{of which can be}} classified as a mechanically induced vibration. Until recently research efforts regarding <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> have been overshadowed by other brake related issues such as brake noise for example squeal and groan. This research studies the cold judder by using <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> test rig (half vehicle). After applying three different pressures (5 bar, 10 bar, 16 bar) for each speed (420 rpm, 330 rpm, 250 rpm and 165 rpm), the results show that at 10 bar and 16 bar give a high vibration amplitude that leads to uncomfortable feeling. The result of non-contact displacement sensors show that the disc thickness variation (DTV), disc surface waviness and side run-out (SRO) combination is the cause of <b>brake</b> <b>judder.</b> After inserting a 3 mm thick round rubber between the pad and the caliper the magnitude of vibration atthe axial steering direction for velocity of 250 rpm and 420 rpm, and brake pressure of 16 bar changed from fairly uncomfortable region to little uncomfortable region and the magnitude of vibration of brake pedal changed from uncomfortable region to fairly uncomfortable region...|$|E
40|$|YesBraking-induced forced vibration, {{known as}} <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> in road vehicles, causes dissatisfaction to drivers and {{passengers}} and also damage and possible early failure in components and systems. In this paper, {{the transmission of}} judder vibration {{from the point of}} generation (the brake friction pair) through the vehicle structure to the driver is investigated for the particular case of a heavy commercial vehicle. The investigation uses a computer simulation multi-body dynamic model based on the automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems software to identify any characteristics of the vehicle suspension design that might influence the vibration transmission from the wheel to the driver. The model uses a simplified rigid chassis and cab to lump the chassis parameters, so that the investigation can focus on the front axle/suspension design, which is a beam axle leaf spring arrangement, and the rear axle/suspension assembly, which is a tandem axle bogie design. Results from the modelling indicate that <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> vibration is transmitted to the chassis of the vehicle through a leaf spring `wind-up¿ mode and a `walking¿ mode associated with the rear tandem axle. Of particular interest is the longitudinal vibration transmitted through the chassis, since this creates a direct vibration transmission path to the cab and driver. The simulation results were compared with the previously published experimental work on the same design of commercial vehicle, and agreement between the predicted and the measured vibration characteristics and frequencies was found. It is concluded that the rear suspension design parameters could affect the transmission of <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> vibration to the cab and driver and that a tandem rear axle offers some design opportunity to control the transmission of <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> vibrations from the wheel to the cab and driver. Given that <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> has so far defied all attempts to eliminate completely from vehicle brake systems, this is potentially an important opportunity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>judder</b> is a {{phenomenon}} of noise which its vibration can be felt physically by the driver of a vehicle. If this vibration is exposed to the driver {{for a long period}} it can lead to tiredness during driving. There are two types of judder which is cold judder and hot judder. This paper will be focusing on the hot judder. As a disc surface heats up during braking it causes both sides of the disc distort and hence produce a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. In this paper finite element analysis of hot judder is performed using a commercial software package, ABAQUS. An existing brake disc design is simulated and will be used as a baseline model. Various structural modifications made on the disc are proposed in an attempt to reduce <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> in a disc brake assembly...|$|E

40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>judder</b> is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring {{in different types}} of vehicles. The frequency can {{be as high as}} 500 Hz, but usually remains below 100 Hz and often as low as 10 - 20 Hz. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a sound. Note that a phenomenological definition (i. e {{forced vibration}}) of <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> is used. Hence, the low frequency brake vibrations, creep groan (related to stick-slip) and dynamic groan (an instability phenomenon), are not studied in this work. The vibration starts with medium to heavy braking from high speed and remains until low speed, if the brakes are continuously applied. There is a considerable amplification of the judder vibration near certain critical vehicle speeds. This behavior has been successfully simulated by the amplitude function technique, which was developed within the project. The method is specially designed for theoretical analysis of forced vibrations like <b>brake</b> <b>judder.</b> The use of amplitude functions was also found to be valuable when analyzing measured vibrations in a braking vehicle. Brake torque variation (BTV) and brake pressure variation (BPV) are the primary excitation mechanisms for judder vibrations. While BPV causes vibrations mostly in the hydraulic system, BTV is believed to be responsible for vibrations in the vehicle structure. This work concentrates on the vibrations caused by BPV; direct effects of BPV like pedal vibrations are not studied. BTV arises mostly as a result of permanent or reversible, geometrical defects, e. g. DTV (Disc Thickness Variation) of disc brakes and shape deviations of drum brakes. DTV in turn is affected by manufacturing tolerances, disc runout, thermal coning and buckling of the disc, uneven disc wear, uneven friction film generation, uneven heating and Thermo-Elastic Instabilities (TEI). Verifying measurements were made on a street-going vehicle with strong first order DTV on one of its front brakes. The measured vibration variation during braking was predicted almost exactly by a rotor-stator model, exposed to a sinusoidal BTV with a sweeping frequency due to the finite deceleration. However, the maximal measured vibration level was seen to vary considerably compared to the predicted value. A full vehicle model, including the aerodynamic drag etc., combined with a more accurate signal analysis, was found to improve the absolute vibration level prediction, especially at low decelerations. Most of the remaining differences at low deceleration levels are believed to be caused {{by the fact that the}} relative BTV of the calculations was approximated by the measured relative BPV level. At high brake pressure levels, the relative BPV level becomes too low (less than 5 %) to admit a reliable estimation. Besides, the estimation of the correction terms due to aerodynamic drag etc. affects the theoretical vibration level. To avoid all this, one should try to measure the brake torque directly. However, measuring the BPV level is useful if one wishes to estimate the instantaneous DTV level in a braking vehicle. This is possible if a relevant pad compression model is available. It was found that a pad stiffness that increases with the brake pressure was able to explain the measured BPV level dependence on the absolute brake level. For such a pad stiffness characteristic, an increase of the DTV level (whatever reason) by 50 % might result in more than a 100 % increase in the corresponding BPV and BTV levels. Hence, a progressive pad is more sensitive to increases of the DTV level than a linear pad would be...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{analytical}} {{formulation of}} the <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> problem caused by disc thickness variation is described by using a simplified source–path–receiver model. Eigenvalue analysis is first conducted to determine the transfer mechanism from the brake source to the steering-wheel receiver. Calculations show that the peak vibration levels of the steering wheel are seen when the rotational frequency of the tyre coincides with the resonant frequency of the transfer path; in this case, only the first-order disc thickness variation is considered. The effects of two key parameters, associated with the source and the path respectively, are analytically and computationally studied. Analysis suggests that the lower pad stiffness and/or the higher bushing stiffness should effectively reduce the vibration levels. Finally, a new vibration control concept is proposed that modulates the actuation pressure; {{it is based on}} an approximate solution for the angular displacement of the disc in the model developed here. Preliminary work indicates that this concept could be very effective in reducing the receiver vibration level without sacrificing the brake performance...|$|E
40|$|Friction braking is {{necessarily}} related to high thermal loads which may cause {{problems such as}} hot spotting and the associated hot judder phenomenon. The driver may experience <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> as vibrations in the frequency range below 100 Hz in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. It is state-of-the-art to investigate the thermal and thermoelastic behaviour of brakes in elaborate finite element studies, which provide high resolution results but require a high computational effort. As a consequence, thermal and thermoelastic issues could not be considered so far in brake models intended {{to be used for}} a system-dynamical analysis of the complete vehicle that may necessary to set up control strategies such as electronic stability programs. With this backgrouns, the article introduces a new method to model brake discs and to account for their thermal amd thermoelastic behaviour while braking in a very efficient way. Effects such as the temperature dependency on friction and the change of contact conditions between the disc and the pad caused by thermal and mechanical influences may be considered with much less computational effort and an acceptable accuracy when compared with the finite element method...|$|E
40|$|Friction force {{oscillations}} {{caused by}} changing {{properties of the}} contact zone between brake disc and pad are well known from various applications. Resulting effects like <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> are known phenomena in brake technologies and in the scope of various scientific work. A new measure to potentially reduce brake torque oscillations is the active compensation {{with the use of}} the control system of a self-energizing hydraulic brake (SEHB). New in comparison to traditional disc brakes is the fact that the brake torque is measured by the pressure in an additional supporting cylinder. Thus, the brake system is able to work in brake torque control mode. Within this paper a dynamic simulation model of the SEHB is shown and evaluated with measurement data achieved from a full scale test rig for railway applications. Based on the simulation model a pressure control strategy is developed to minimize brake torque oscillations of lower frequencies. The control parameters of the simulation are transferred to the experimental setup. Finally, simulation and experimental results are compared. Future work will deal with the development of control strategies to additionally minimize brake torque oscillations of the higher dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{retarding}} a moving vehicle or object {{in a controlled}} manner has been investigated over hundreds of years with many different solutions being developed over the years. As time has progressed a common overall design has almost uniformly been agreed upon for vehicle use; a brake disc and caliper or brake drum arrangement. As vehicle refinement has improved there has been increasing focus on the refinement of such designs with regards to their noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) characteristics. Whilst brake noise has had significant research analysing its cause, effect and solutions, <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> has had less research focussed upon it. The principal reason for past research priorities and the recent interest in judder is because of the increased demands being placed on brakes – higher power absorption with lighter structures. The subject of this thesis was to address the least known phenomena of <b>brake</b> <b>judder,</b> that of the thermo-elastic deformation of vented brake discs. The research utilised experimental, analytical and empirical methods to give a broader understanding of the transient deformation process, both thermo-plastic and thermo-elastic, of a high performance vehicle disc brake. Initial characterisation of thermal judder was carried out on-vehicle where it was identified that brake pressure {{could be used as a}} reliable indicator to show the developing nature of this phenomenon. The brake pressure pulsation was shown to change from low order (first or second order) to high order (up to eighth order) over the duration of a high speed vehicle brake test which involved up to thirty braking events. The pressure pulsation indicated a link to brake disc deformation with the magnitude and order of brake pressure variation increasing with increasing disc temperature. The highly dynamic, transient, nature of brake disc distortion was also investigated on a bespoke quarter car suspension brake dynamometer. Thermoelastic wave-like deformation was shown to occur during the process of a single braking event with the order of deformation corresponding to the brake pressure variation. The order of this wave-like deformation was shown to be linked to the amount of energy transferred into the braking system with higher energy braking events resulting in higher order deformation. Thermal images of the brake disc have shown an equispaced formation of hot-spots on the inboard and outboard friction ring surfaces which was linked to the disc waveform. The wave-like deformation was attributed to circumferential buckling of the brake disc as suggested by Lang [1]. This resulted from rapid thermal expansion of the friction rings due to the sudden - 4 - influx of heat during braking. Thermal gradients between the hot and cold regions of the brake disc constrained the radial thermal expansion of the friction ring and caused compressive stresses to build up. When the tangential load causing the stress was in excess of the critical buckling load, buckling of the brake disc occurred with the mode order of the buckled disc related to the temperature of the friction ring. Stress relieving of the brake disc was shown to occur during brake testing on the brake dynamometer causing a thermo-plastic effect. This “in service” stress relieving effect removed the retained stresses resulting from the casting and machining processes and allowed the disc to adopt a second order mode of deformation. Data from the on-vehicle and dynamometer testing was used to generate and validate finite element analysis simulations which were used to investigate thermal inputs and heat dissipation from the brake disc. These findings were then combined with that of an associated aerodynamic study [2] to generate a modified brake disc vent profile which reduced the surface temperature variation, thermal gradients and maximum disc temperature. On-vehicle testing of the prototype design showed an average 14 % reduction in maximum disc temperature and it was proposed that this would reduce the propensity for the disc to generate judder by reducing the thermal deformation of the brake disc.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{research efforts}} regarding <b>brake</b> <b>judder</b> has been overshadowed by other brake related {{issues such as}} brake noise for example squeal and groan. Although brake noise still remains a problem for vehicle manufacturers, past research effort {{has led to a}} greater understanding of its mechanism and solutions are now more readily available. This is not the case with brake "judder" as past research has been less focussed towards its occurrence or cause. As brake performance and reduced packaging demands increase then the thermal issues of braking become more of an issue. It is this aspect of thermal judder, rather than cold judder, which is most difficult to investigate as this can manifest itself as high frequency (often referred to as drone) or low frequency excitation, the latter causing excessive vibration in the suspension and steering systems. The focus of this research is the analysis of thermo-elastic instability after both high energy braking and prolonged drag braking. Both types of braking result in high energy input into the brake rotor. The principal issue is that the rise in temperature, under some conditions, is localised with temperatures exceeding 730 ºC. If this is followed by rapid cooling, then a phase change in the brake rotor material results. This phase change in the metallurgical structure of the rotor may be seen {{on the surface of the}} rotor as dark areas which are referred to as "hot spots" or `blue spots´. The resulting increase in grain growth associated with these localised areas causes a further increase in temperature and so the process continues. The disc surface becomes a series of raised areas giving localised disc thickness variation. It is during a subsequent light braking application that judder occurs due to the DTV with a high order of vibration - or "drone". The paper is aimed at detailing the preliminary vehicle testing which has been performed which will allow for accurate validation of dynamometer testing and computational analysis. Promising results have been obtained and are presented and discussed. Conclusions have been drawn with recommendations for further work...|$|E
