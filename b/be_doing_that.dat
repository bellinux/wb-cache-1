Like Edward, he finds the light." [...] He also commented very positively on character of Edward, [...] "... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far." [...] Of Depp he wrote, [...] "Depp may not <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but {{what he does is}} tremulous and affecting." [...] As well as Eflman's score of the piece by saying it to be, [...] " [...] lovely, storybook score highlights the pop romanticism of Burton's conception.

500|$|With {{the open}} game world, Rocksteady {{included}} more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange {{was selected as}} a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman [...] "vulnerable and exposed {{in a way that}} he has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a shaved head and contemporary costume design that were intended to move away from his traditional [...] "Boy Wonder" [...] image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: [...] "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The shaved head is inspired by cage fighters, because we thought that Robin might <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> in his spare time to keep him on his toes. Still, we kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." [...] Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.|$|E

Film producer and The Weinstein Company co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, was said to be collaborating with Albarn and Hewlett. In a September 2006 interview with Uncut magazine, Albarn was said that the band [...] "has been a fantastic journey which isn't over, because we're making a film. We've got Terry Gilliam involved.

He died on 23 February 1965, aged 74, four days after suffering a heart attack on 19 February. Just minutes away from death, Laurel told his nurse that he would not mind going skiing right at that very moment. Somewhat taken aback, the nurse replied that she was not aware that he was a skier.

2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX. Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, {{there seemed to be}} a whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs seem to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> anymore. We're trying to bring that back a little bit with our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E

McFarlane wrote; [...] "by that time they had developed into one of the best live bands on the Australian scene". In October 2009 Mariani told The Ages Michael Dwyer, [...] "we were on the charts, getting airplay, very popular. But within the band there was a bit of burnout ... you have these moments where you can't stop thinking negatively and I kept picturing myself pushing a van in the snow. I thought, 'I don't want to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> I'm getting out of here'". The Huffington Posts Holly Cara Price described the group as [...] "one of the most tuneful and tasty garage rock bands of the era. Avid fans of pop, R and 60's garage punk, their predilection translated to great punchy songs".|$|E
