50|$|Of {{the three}} tricresyl {{phosphate}} isomers, only the ortho isomer demonstrates high toxicity, though this toxicity {{has been demonstrated}} {{to be caused by}} a metabolite that is made from tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP). This metabolite is 2-(ortho-cresyl)-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphoran-2-one (CBDP) and is an irreversible inhibitor of human <b>butyrylcholinesterase</b> (<b>BChE)</b> and human acetylcholinesterase (AChE). CBDP ultimately binds to the BChE and AChE at a serine residue in the active site after two consecutive dealkyalation reactions (aging).Though CBDP readily inhibits BChE and AChE, BChE has a sensitivity to CBDP that is nearly one order of magnitude greater than that of AChE.

Furthermore, metabolic dysregulations such as calcium homeostasis [...] and insulin signaling have also been identified to contribute to the onset of AD. Genes that are associated with calcium and insulin signaling are found using GATHER (online bioinformatics tool for analyzing genomic signatures). In fact, insulin signaling impairment and AD has been considered to be related in many levels. Functional protein sequence alignments (e.g. ClustalW, MUSCLE) and phylogenetic analysis (e.g. Phylip, Mega) demonstrate that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and <b>butyrylcholinesterase</b> (<b>BChE)</b> are highly linked in these two diseases. Increased BChE contributes altered lipoprotein metabolism and insulin insensitivity, and is positively correlated to hypertension and diabetes in correlation studies. AChE allows stabilization of neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), which is one of the main target for AD treatment. However, recent in silico pharmacological study examined drug-disease interaction showed that AChE inhibitors may not be the answer to AD treatment.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can notably control many targets {{each and}} {{regulate}} entire cellular pathways, but whether miRNAs can regulate complete neurotransmission processes is largely unknown. Here, {{we report that}} miRNAs with complementary sequence motifs to the key genes involved in acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and/or packaging show massive overlap with those regulating ACh degradation. To address this topic, we first searched for miRNAs that could target the 3 ’-untranslated regions of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene that controls ACh synthesis; the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT), encoded from an intron in the ChAT gene and the ACh hydrolyzing genes acetyl- and/or <b>butyrylcholinesterase</b> (AChE, <b>BChE).</b> Intriguingly, we found {{that many of the}} miRNAs targeting these genes are primate-specific, and that changes in their levels associate with inflammation, anxiety, brain damage, cardiac, neurodegenerative or pain-related syndromes.

40|$|With an {{increase}} in the aging population, research has attempted to elucidate factors that determine the heterogeneity observed in cognitive function within the older adult population. Studies have shown that elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GC) in serum and saliva are related to poorer cognitive performance in old age. However, individual differences are also noted in GC secretion, which gives rise {{to the question of what}} determines individual differences not only in cognitive function, but also in GC secretion in old age. While many researchers have turned to personality as an individual difference factor, the present thesis wanted to assess an underlying factor that is incontestably stable over the lifespan, genetic polymorphism. Thus, the general goal of the present dissertation was to assess the influence of genetic variance on cognition, personality, basal and stress reactive cortisol secretion, while controlling for factors that could impact stress-reactivity, namely education. Three candidate genes were examined in two sample cohorts of older adults: the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE, E 4 vs. nonE 4), the <b>butyrylcholinesterase</b> gene (<b>BCHE,</b> K vs. nonK), and the 5 -HT 2 A serotonin receptor gene (- 1438 A/G, AA vs. GG vs. AG). The first cohort allowed for the assessment of genes on acute (i. e. short term) basal and stress-reactive salivary cortisol secretion, personality, and cognitive performance. The second cohort was a longitudinal sample that allowed for assessment of change over time in GC secretion and cognitive performance as a function of genotype. Overall, it was found that APOE alone did not explain the variance in acute or longitudinal cognitive performance, personality, or cortisol secretion. However, a genetic interaction was observed between APOE and BCHE in explaining variance in acute basal serum cortisol levels, acute declarative memory performance, and scores on a depression and self-esteem scale. Assessment of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor gene showed that the - 1438 A/G polymorphism could explain variance in basal and stress-reactive salivary GC levels, performance on declarative memory and selective attention, and personality traits associated with low mood. Finally, this was the first study to show that education may modulate the stress response to a psychosocial stressor. Altogether, the aforementioned findings show the importance of evaluating genetic polymorphisms of candidate genes in explaining individual differences in cognitive aging.

The time course for the appearance and disappearance of this peak matches the activation/degradation kinetic profile of the BChE inhibitor, and the chemical shift supports the proposed 2 -oxo- 2 -hydroxy- 1, 2 -oxaphosphetane structure...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder {{that has been}} associated, sometimes controversially, with polymorphisms {{in a number of}} genes. Recently the <b>butyrylcholinesterase</b> K variant (<b>BCHE</b> K) allele has been shown to act in synergy with the apolipoprotein E ε 4 (APOE ε 4) allele to promote risk for AD. Most subsequent replicative studies have been unable to confirm these findings. We have conducted a case-control association study using a clinically well defined group of late onset AD patients (n= 175) and age and sex matched control subjects (n= 187) from the relatively genetically homogeneous Northern Ireland population to test this association. The BCHE genotypes of patients were found to be significantly different from controls (χ 2 = 23. 68, df= 2, p<< 0. 001). The frequency of the K variant allele was also found to differ significantly in cases compared to controls (χ 2 = 16. 39, df= 1, p<< 0. 001) leading to an increased risk of AD in subjects with this allele (OR= 3. 50, 95 % CI 2. 20 - 6. 07). This risk increased in subjects 75  years and older (OR= 5. 50, 95 % CI 2. 56 - 11. 87). At the same time the APOE ε 4 associated risk was found to decrease from 6. 70  (95 % CI 2. 40 - 19. 04) in 65 - 74  year olds to 3. 05  (95 % CI 1. 34 - 6. 95) in those subjects 75  years and older. However, we detected no evidence of synergy between BCHE K and APOE ε 4. The results from this study suggest that possession of the BCHE K allele constitutes a significant risk for AD in the Northern Ireland population and, furthermore, this risk increases with increasing age.    Keywords: Alzheimer's disease; BCHE K; APO...|$|R

The extracts were subjected to the microtiter enzyme inhibition assays at 100  μg mL- 1. Antioxidant effect of the extracts was tested for their scavenging activity against DPPH, DMPD, and NO radicals {{as well as their}} ferric- (FRAP) and phosphomolibdenum-reducing power (PRAP) and metal-chelation capacity. Total phenol and flavonoid quantities in the extracts were determined spectrophotometrically. HPLC analysis was performed on Atriplex lasiantha, Conringia grandiflora, and Vaccaria hispanica.|$|E
