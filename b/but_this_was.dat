5|$|A {{total of}} 2,202 M3 GMCs were {{produced}} from 1941 to 1943. Only 86 vehicles were produced in 1941, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> increased in 1942 during which 1,350 examples {{came off the}} production lines. A further 766 were completed in 1943. Production was stopped due {{to the introduction of}} turreted, purpose-built, tank destroyers, such as the M10 GMC.|$|E
5|$|African-Americans were enlisted during World War I, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> halted in 1919 {{and they}} were mustered out of the Navy.

5|$|After a {{successful}} insertion into a circular orbit at , the first experiments began; {{the first two}} samples were run through the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, and measurements were taken for the atmospheric luminosities study. A hydraulic circulation pump failed, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> worked around and it proved to have no impact on operations.|$|E
5|$|After the war Rio Grande was {{assigned}} to the newly formed Alto Uruguai Flotilla, based at Itaqui. She was docked in Ladário for rebuilding in 1899, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> never completed and she was scrapped in February 1907.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and {{carefully}} counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential weapon.

5|$|Castle {{wanted to}} perform a similar study in Cidra, in {{conjunction}} with the School of Tropical Medicine, which was doing related research, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not approved.

5|$|During operations, the He 111Z did {{not have}} enough power to lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E

5|$|Foundation Day: Celebrated every 6 November. Initially the Barnard Run {{was held}} on this day. Before 1892 the {{tradition}} was to celebrate {{the day with a}} paper chase, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> replaced after Lord Barnard donated the Barnard Cup.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> also too expensive.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 the {{colliery}} {{was producing}} 1,800long tons (2,000short tons) of coal a day, and Senghenydd's population {{had grown to}} just under 6,000. No work was undertaken at Senghenydd to implement the requirement, and the Mines Inspectorate gave the management an extended deadline of September 1913 to complete the work, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> missed.|$|E
