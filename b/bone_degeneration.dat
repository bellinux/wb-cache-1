50|$|Deep diving {{has more}} hazards and greater risk than basic open water diving. Nitrogen narcosis, the “narks” or “rapture of the deep”, starts with {{feelings}} of euphoria and over-confidence but then leads to numbness and memory impairment similar to alcohol intoxication. Decompression sickness, or the “bends”, can happen if a diver ascends too fast, when excess inert gas leaves solution in the blood and tissues and forms bubbles.

The onset of symptoms depends on the severity of the tissue gas loading and may develop during ascent in severe cases, but is frequently delayed until after reaching the surface. <b>Bone</b> <b>degeneration</b> (dysbaric osteonecrosis) is caused by the bubbles forming inside the bones; most commonly the upper arm and the thighs. Deep diving involves a much greater danger of all of these, and presents the additional risk of oxygen toxicity, which may lead to a convulsion underwater.

5000|$|One {{effect of}} ageing and disc {{degeneration}} {{is that the}} nucleus pulposus begins to dehydrate and the concentration of proteoglycans in the matrix decreases, thus limiting {{the ability of the}} disc to absorb shock. This general shrinking of disc size is partially responsible for the common decrease in height as humans age. The anulus fibrosus also becomes weaker with age and has an increased risk of tearing. In addition, the cartilage endplates begin thinning, fissures begin to form, and there is sclerosis of the subchondral bone. As the fissures are formed in the anulus fibrosis due to osteo-arthritic <b>bones</b> or <b>degeneration</b> in general, the inner nucleus pulposus can seep out and put pressure on any number of vertebral nerves. A herniated disc can cause mild to severe pain such as sciatica and treatment for herniated discs range from physical therapy to surgery.

Case Report: A 59 -year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to Kashan Shahid-Beheshti hospital, Iran, with a diabetic foot ulcer (3 cm Ã� 2 cm) in his right thumb.

40|$|For many years, {{pharmaceutical}} therapies for osteoarthritis (OA) {{were focused}} on cartilage. However, it has been theorized that bone changes such as increased bone volume fraction and decreased bone matrix mineralization may {{play an important role}} in the initiation and pathogenesis of OA as well. The mechanisms behind the bone changes are subject of debate, and a better understanding may help in the development of bone-targeting OA therapies. In the literature, the increase in bone volume fraction has been hypothesized to result from mechanoregulated bone adaptation in response to decreased mineralization. Furthermore, both changes in bone volume fraction and mineralization have been reported to be highest close to the cartilage, and bone volume fraction has been reported to be correlated with cartilage degeneration. These data indicate that cartilage <b>degeneration,</b> <b>bone</b> volume fraction, and bone matrix mineralization may be related in OA. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the relationships between cartilage <b>degeneration,</b> <b>bone</b> matrix mineralization and bone volume fraction at a local level. With microCT, we determined bone matrix mineralization and bone volume fraction as a function of distance from the cartilage in osteochondral plugs from human OA tibia plateaus with varying degrees of cartilage degeneration. In addition, we evaluated whether mechanoregulated bone adaptation in response to decreased bone matrix mineralization may be responsible for the increase in bone volume fraction observed in OA. For this purpose, we used the experimentally obtained mineralization data as input for bone adaptation simulations. We simulated the effect of mechanoregulated bone adaptation in response to different degrees of mineralization, and compared the simulation results to the experimental data. We found that local changes in subchondral bone mineralization and bone volume fraction only occurred underneath severely degenerated cartilage, indicating that bone mineralization and volume fraction are related to cartilage degeneration at a local level. In addition, both the experimental data and the simulations indicated that a depth-dependent increase in bone volume fraction could be caused by decreased bone matrix mineralization. However, a quantitative comparison showed that decreased mineralization can only explain part of the subchondral sclerosis observed in OA. [...] -...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{determine}} {{the relative importance}} of subchondral nutrition in cartilage in autologous transplants and its relation to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Method The study was performed in non-human primates with two types of autografts placed orthotopically. One type of autograft was placed into vascularized, viable cancellous bone well, and another in an identical bone well, but coated with methylmethacrylate. The latter prevented direct contact between the autograft and the host bone. Observations were continued for 3 years. Results Abrogation of the contact between subchondral bone and articular cartilage–bone autograft had little effect on the cartilage during the first 5 – 12 months. By 3 years, autografts in the methylmethacrylate wells had non-vascularized and non-viable subchondral bone. The cartilage in these wells underwent degenerative changes compatible with OA. Conclusion Interruption of contact between articular cartilage and vascularized subchondral <b>bone</b> resulted in <b>degeneration</b> of the cartilage.

40|$|The {{secreted}} Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are {{a family}} of soluble proteins that are structurally related to Frizzled (Fz) proteins, the serpentine receptors that mediate the extensively used cell-cell communication pathway involving Wnt signalling. Because of their homology with the Wnt-binding domain on the Fz receptors, SFRPs were immediately characterised as antagonists that bind to Wnt proteins to prevent signal activation. Since these initial studies, interest in the family of SFRPs has grown progressively, offering new perspectives on their function and mechanism of action in both development and disease. These studies indicate that SFRPs are not merely Wnt-binding proteins, but can also antagonise one another's activity, bind to Fz receptors and influence axon guidance, interfere with BMIP signalling by acting as proteinase inhibitors, and interact with other receptors or matrix molecules. Furthermore, their expression is altered in different types of cancers, <b>bone</b> pathologies, retinal <b>degeneration</b> and hypophosphatemic diseases, indicating that their activity is fundamental for tissue homeostasis.

40|$|Nowadays, lumbar {{spondylosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent causes of lower back pain. In order to improve our understanding of the lumbar spine anatomy and functionality over time, we compared the lumbar vertebrae of Neanderthals with those of anatomically modern humans. The fossil record reports on only two Neanderthal skeletons (i. e., Kebara 2 and Shanidar 3, both predating the appearance of modern humans) with full preservation of the entire lumbar spine. Examination of these early hominids showed that they display natural lumbar kyphosis, with only mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine (ages at death: 30 – 35  years, Kebara 2; and 35 – 50  years, Shanidar 3). This finding is highly unexpected since Neanderthals are known to have had extraordinary physical activity due to demanding living conditions. The adult lumbar spines discussed here therefore show no correlation between high physical activity and degenerative spine disease as known from recent times. We speculate that both the kyphosis itself and the massive and heavily muscled skeleton of Neanderthals are causative for the minimal <b>bone</b> <b>degeneration.</b> We conclude that a kyphotic lumbar spine is the natural anatomy in these two Neanderthal individuals.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} by which bone cells communicate is vital in exploring diseases characterized by <b>bone</b> <b>degeneration,</b> namely, osteoporosis. Cell seeding {{has been used in}} two dimensional (2 D) cell cultures to study how bone cells interact with one another, specifically, to prove the existence of gap junctions between osteocytes and osteoblasts. However, the natural three dimensional (3 D) state of bone tissue requires examining it in 3 D. Accordingly, the cell seeding procedure was tested on trabecular bone core explants to ascertain whether it is useful in 3 D studies as well. When the dye concentrations taken from past 2 D experiments were used, Day 1 showed many osteoblasts, but by Day 2 the cells were not visible. The dye concentrations were then doubled to determine if the osteoblasts were still seeded onto the bone cores and viable but not visible, or if they had actually died. With these dye concentrations, the stained osteoblasts were still visible on the second day after seeding, indicating that the cells were seeded and living. According to these results, it is evident that with minor modifications of the 2 D procedure, it is possible to seed osteoblasts onto osteocytes in 3 D, making this a credible test for the presence of gap junctions in 3 D bone tissue...|$|E

A potential alternative to this procedure would be to tissue-engineer a biological implant {{and use it to}} replace the entire diseased joint. The objective of this study was therefore to tissue-engineer a scaled-up, anatomically shaped, osteochondral construct suitable for partial or total resurfacing of a diseased joint. To this end it was first demonstrated that a bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell seeded alginate hydrogel could support endochondral bone formation in vivo within the osseous component of an osteochondral construct, and furthermore, that a phenotypically stable layer of articular cartilage could be engineered over this bony tissue using a co-culture of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. Co-culture was found to enhance the in vitro development of the chondral phase of the engineered graft and to dramatically reduce its mineralisation in vivo. In the final part of the study, tissue-engineered grafts (~ 2 cm diameter) mimicking the geometry of medial femorotibial joint prostheses were generated using laser scanning and rapid prototyped moulds.

Individuals carrying the inhibitory KIR haplotype No. 6 have a high potential risk for developing RA...|$|E
40|$|In Great Britain high femoral {{osteotomy}} {{has been}} employed as the favourite conservative method of surgical treatment of osteoarthritis {{of the hip}} {{from the time of}} the independent reports of McMurray in 1935 and of Malkin in 1936. Complete division of the bone in the intertrochanteric region of course permits the correction of deformity, but in a high proportion of cases pain is also relieved within the first few days. As for movement, the results vary widely. When the joint has been allowed to degenerate to a terminal stage of collapse, osteotomy may give little more than a fibrous ankylosis; sometimes, indeed, bony fusion occurs. But in earlier cases when a useful range of movement has been preserved, this as a rule is maintained. The lasting nature of the favourable effects of osteotomy over periods of fifteen to twenty years has often been commented on, notably by McFarland (1957). It suggests that in some obscure way division of the <b>bone</b> arrests the <b>degeneration</b> of the joint above it. In a large number of individual cases presented at clinical meetings in England, particularly cases of the common primary type of osteoarthritis which have not advanced too far, there has been striking radiological evidence that it can do so...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{epidemiological}} studies suggested {{that patients with}} osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip might constitute a definable subset of the population with characteristics that predispose them to joint failure. To investigate this possibility a comparative study of somatotype, <b>bone</b> density, disc <b>degeneration,</b> polyarticular joint degeneration, and soft-tissue calcification {{was carried out in}} 3 groups of individuals: (1) patients presenting with OA of the hip; (2) patients with acute femoral neck fracture; (3) healthy controls. OA of the hip was rare in patients with femoral neck fracture; conversely, patients with coxarthrosis did not have the low values for bone density seen in the fracture group. There were significant differences in somatotype in the 2 patient groups; 94 % of those with OA were endomorphic mesomorphs. Polyarticular OA occurred with the same prevalence in the 2 groups of women, but among males there was a significantly greater involvement of knees and hands in the OA group than in the fracture group. The highest incidence of joint calcification was found in the fracture group and the lowest in the OA group. It was concluded that patients with OA of the hip form a definable subset of the general population. Within this group the appearances of hip OA are determined by 3 interacting factors: mechanical stress, cartilage <b>degeneration,</b> and <b>bone</b> response...|$|R
40|$|Poster PresentationConference theme: The Intervertebral Disc - from Degeneration to Therapeutic Motion PreservationINTRODUCTION: Intervertebral disc {{degeneration}} {{is associated}} with low back pain. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) {{have been used to}} halt the progression or regenerate the disc with hopes to prevent or treat discogenic back pain. However, the safety and efficacy of the use of MSCs for such treatment in animal and human models at short- and long-term assessment (i. e., greater than 48 weeks) have not been systematically addressed. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} perform a systematic review of comparative controlled studies addressing the use of MSCs to that of no treatment/saline for the treatment of disc degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online databases PubMed, PubMed Central, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and MEDLINE were searched. Controlled trials in animal models and humans were eligible for inclusion. Trial design, MSC characteristics, injection method, disc assessment, outcome intervals, and complication events were assessed. Validity of each study was assessed by appropriateness of randomization, blindness of outcome assessment, and sample size. Two individuals independently searched the literature, extracted data parameters, and assessed validity. RESULTS: Twenty-four animal studies were included but no controlled studies in humanswere identified. All three types of MSCs (i. e., bone marrow, synovial, and adipose tissue) showed successful tissue inhibition of disc <b>degeneration.</b> <b>Bone</b> marrow-derived MSC showed superior quality of disc repair that was marked with restoration of extracellular matrix in the disc when itwas compared with other treatments, including TGF-β 1, nucleus pulposus bilaminar coculture, and axial distraction regimen. However, osteophyte development was reported in two studies as a potential complication of MSC transplantation. Overall, the incidence of MSC-related complications was < 0. 5 %. Metaanalyses indicated that MSC increased disc space height in the majority of animal models. Results Twenty-four animal studies were included but no controlled studies in humanswere identified.

CONCLUSIONS: Based on the first systematic reviewaddressing the safety and efficacy of the use of MSCs for disc degeneration prevention/ regeneration, the current evidence, based on animal models, suggests that in the short-term MSC transplantation is safe and effective in halting disc degeneration; however, additional and larger studies are needed to assess the long-term regenerative effects and potential complications. Inconsistency in methodological design and outcome parameters prevent any robust conclusions. In addition, randomized controlled trials in humans are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of such therapy...|$|R
