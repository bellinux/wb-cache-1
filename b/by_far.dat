5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered <b>by</b> <b>Far</b> Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered <b>by</b> <b>Far</b> Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon is <b>by</b> <b>far</b> the cheapest.

The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful <b>by</b> <b>far.</b> The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
