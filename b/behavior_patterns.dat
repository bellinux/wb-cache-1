5|$|The {{pathological}} {{absence of}} a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns,</b> known as styles or patterns. There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized) and disorganized. The latter three are characterised as insecure. These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns</b> which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the importance of patient-related factors in reha-bilitation. We focused on the type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern.</b> If individuals with the type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> have better compliance, they would have a shorter length of hospital stay than those with non-type A behavior. We compared the length of stay of patients with the type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> with that of patients with a non-type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern.</b> [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-seven patients staying in a comprehensive rehabilitation unit participated in this study. Type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern,</b> length of stay, and Barthel Index were assessed. We use the Student’s t-test to examine the statistical differences in length of stay and Barthel Index at discharge between subjects with type A behavior and those without type A behavior. [Results] Age and Barthel Index at discharge were not significantly different between the two groups. However, length of stay was significantly higher in the non-type A group com-pared with the type A group. [Conclusion] Patients with the type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> had a shorter length of hospital stay than patients with a non-type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern.</b> In conclusion, our results suggest that the type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> shortens the length of hospital stay. Those data show that we should consider the patient’s characteristics in rehabilitation to protect the patient and for financial benefit...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [58]- 61) This research {{investigated the}} influence of conscientiousness and goal orientation on performance of a complex task. Goal orientation may be either performance or learning. Goal orientation and perceived ability are expected to interact to create either a mastery or helpless <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> and influence performance. Conscientiousness was measured while goal orientation and perceived ability were manipulated. <b>Behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> and performance were the dependent variables. Regressions were {{used to analyze the}} relationships. The perceived ability manipulation was successful while the goal orientation manipulation was not. Results indicated that goal orientation and perceived ability did interact to influence performance but not <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, the means were not in the predicted direction. Conscientiousness did not influence performance but was related to <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, conscientiousness may have a stronger relationship to subjective performance measures such as supervisor ratings than objective measures. The <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> measure is a self-rating of performance behaviors and would qualify as a subjective measure of performance.

5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns</b> may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns</b> approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E

5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns</b> can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

Afterward, subjects were classified as Type A or B based on audiotapes of the interview. The total amount of activity and the frequency or duration of Type A behaviors were compared between Type A and Type B subjects. In all three experimental conditions, Type A subjects moved their arms more than Type B subjects. During both the waiting and the relaxation periods, Type A subjects sat still less and spent more time exploring than did Type B subjects. During the interview, Type A subjects gestured more frequently than Type B subjects. Nonverbal behaviors correctly identified <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> in 71 % of the subjects.

Thus, though the behavior of a single individual wolf hybrid may be predictable, the behavior of the type as a whole is not. The majority of high wolf-content hybrids are very curious and are generally no more destructive than any other curious or active dogs.|$|E
25|$|Faulkner's {{numerous}} {{contributions to}} the field of NLP began in 1984 with his modeling of Accelerated Learning, to pioneer more efficient and effective learning strategies. He taught this model together with NLP, to a group of teachers in Japan that same year. The result of this work was the founding of Learning How to Learn. Upon returning to the U.S. in 1985, he modeled the Metaphors of Identity. This model states that an individual's strategies and <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns</b> are informed by deeply structured metaphors for life, self, desired outcomes and challenges. By adopting new metaphors, an individual can create new pathways to transformation.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{diversity of}} species exists. Since coldwater coral reefs only occur at great depths, most hobbyists are largely confined to fish, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and Feather duster worms. A few corals {{can be found}} at low depths. Since there are very few commercially available coldwater fish and invertebrates, hobbyists usually have to physically acquire specimens, although recently more specimens have become commercially available from the west coast of the United States as well as Japan, Australia, and the UK. The most common methods of acquisition are by trolling or seining, and experienced hobbyists use the movement of tides and searching methods to find certain species. Unlike commercially available tropical fish, whose <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns</b> and tank compatibilities have been well documented in the last five or six decades, coldwater fish have been kept in public and private aquaria for over two centuries and much ichthyological knowledge has been gathered in order to maintain them.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{relation}} of type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> and job-related psychosocial factors {{to the risk of}} myocardial infarction. Methods: Study subjects comprised 290 cases (173 male workers and 117 women) of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 489 controls (303 male workers and 186 women) recruited from among residents of the study area. Participation rates of cases and controls were 86 % and 50 %, respectively. Type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern,</b> job-related psychosocial factors, and other coronary risk factors were ascertained by interview using a questionnaire. Type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> was measured by 12 questions, and job strain by the method of Karasek. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval with adjustment for potential confounding variables. The relation to job strain was examined only in men. Results: Type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> was significantly associated with an increased risk of AMI in male workers (adjusted OR 1. 9, 95 % CI, 1. 2 – 2. 9) and in women (adjusted OR 2. 8, 95 % CI, 1. 6 – 4. 9). Although job control and job demand showed no material association with AMI, job strain, a combination of low job control and high job demand was associated with an increased risk of AMI (adjusted OR 2. 2, 95 % CI, 1. 1 – 4. 5). Abbreviated type A score and job demand score were higher among nonparticipant control candidates than participant controls in male workers. Conclusions: Type A <b>behavior</b> <b>pattern</b> may be an important risk factor for AMI especially in Japanese women. The present study also revealed persons in stressful psychosocial circumstances were less likely to participate in the study.

Bertz disparaged the main story beats however, calling them [...] "rushed and underdeveloped", whilst lauding the environmental storytelling. James Kozanitis at Game Revolution enjoyed playing as Emily Kaldwin the most and said that, because some elements from Dishonored had returned, Emily infused a fresh perspective into the overall experience. Kozanitis favored the stealthier approach, which was said to better accommodate side quests—opined as the chief incentive for playing Dishonored 2.

500|$|The game's {{signature}} {{feature is}} its Nemesis system. The Monolith team considered themselves experts in artificial intelligence, {{and wanted to}} push its boundaries. Allowing players to choose their story (a sandbox-game pillar) and [...] "leverage the new generation hardware through innovation", the team {{wanted to create a}} system allowing non-playable characters to respond to player actions; this later became the Nemesis system. The system's idea was frameworked three months after development began, and to best present it everyone in the studio was involved. The developers hoped that with the system, orcs could be memorable for players. It was made more complex during the game's early development, incorporating personal relationships among orcs, but was later pared down when the studio considered it too complicated. The Nemesis system was also inspired by pen-and-paper role-playing games. Although most orcs are similar, some were designed with distinctive <b>behavior</b> <b>patterns.</b> These orcs have dialogue written by Dan Abnett, and the team hoped the special orcs would surprise players. The team also hoped that the system would provide tension and competition, similar to a multiplayer game. The studio was inspired by sports games, where the narrative continues when players lose a match. This can prevent immersion and narrative from breaking when players die in the game. According to Rob Roberts, the system is designed so players can emotionally attach to the protagonist through gameplay drama. They also hoped that through the system, players can create their own villain, leading to an organic story.|$|E
