50|$|A <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer,</b> {{also known}} as a coned-disc spring, conical spring washer, disc spring, Belleville spring or cupped spring washer, is a conical shell which can be loaded along its axis either statically or dynamically. A <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> is, then, a type of spring shaped like a washer. It is the {{frusto-conical}} shape that gives the washer a spring characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> or Belleville spring - a disc {{shaped spring}} {{commonly}} used to apply tension to a bolt (and also in the initiation mechanism of pressure-activated landmines).|$|E
5000|$|Considering a <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> {{with outside}} {{diameter}} , inside diameter , height l and thickness t, where [...] is the free height, {{that is the}} difference between the height and the thickness, the following coefficients are obtained: ...|$|E
50|$|The real {{inventor}} of <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> is, then, unknown.|$|R
50|$|As said, {{thanks to}} these {{advantageous}} properties, <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> are today {{used in a}} large number of fields, some examples are listed in the following.|$|R
50|$|A {{wave washer}} also {{acts as a}} spring, but wave washers of {{comparable}} size do not produce as much force as <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers,</b> nor can they be stacked in series.|$|R
50|$|Some {{makers of}} bolt action target rifles use <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> stacks in the bolt {{instead of a}} more {{traditional}} spring to release the firing pin, as they reduce the time between trigger actuation and firing pin impact on the cartridge.|$|E
5000|$|As {{they provide}} {{extremely}} detailed tuning ability, disc springs {{are used in}} the automotive (even in Formula One cars) and aircraft industries as vibration-damping elements: the Cirrus SR2x series, uses a <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> setup to damp out nose gear oscillations (or [...] "shimmy").|$|E
50|$|After the war, the French {{designed}} and built the AMX-50 series of armoured fighting vehicles, which used a 1000 hp Maybach engine with rear drive, as had been intended for the E-50 and E-75, whilst the idea of external <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> suspension - which was also developed with the Entwicklung series in mind - resurfaced on the Swiss Panzer 61.|$|E
50|$|<b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> {{have been}} used as return springs in {{artillery}} pieces, one example being the French Canet range of marine/coastal cannon from the late 1800s (75 mm, 120mm, 152 mm).|$|R
50|$|If a short {{grip length}} {{can not be}} avoided, the use of conical spring <b>washers</b> (<b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> or disc springs) can also reduce the loss of bolt {{pre-load}} due to embedment.|$|R
40|$|Threaded pin {{tightened}} or loosened; tedious trial-and-error procedure shortened. Mechanism joining strut and node in {{truss structure}} preloaded to desired stress to ensure tight, compressive fit preventing motion of strut during loading or vibration. Preload stress on stack of <b>Belleville</b> spring <b>washers</b> adjusted by tightening or loosening threaded Belleville-washer-alignment pin. Pin turned, {{by use of}} allen wrench, to adjust compression preload on <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> and adjusts joint-operating torque...|$|R
50|$|A washer is a {{thin plate}} (typically disk-shaped) with a hole (typically in the middle) that is {{normally}} used to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a screw or nut. Other uses are as a spacer, spring (<b>belleville</b> <b>washer,</b> wave washer), wear pad, preload indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration (rubber washer). Washers often have an outer diameter (OD) about twice their inner diameter (ID), but this can vary quite widely.|$|E
50|$|Another example {{where they}} aid locking {{is a joint}} that {{experiences}} {{a large amount of}} thermal expansion and contraction. They will supply the required pre-load, but the bolt may have an additional locking mechanism (like Thread-locking fluid) that would fail without the Belleville. Belleville washers should never overhang the joint they are trying to secure, as all of their clamping force is on the outside perimeter edge of the washer. If a <b>belleville</b> <b>washer</b> overhangs a joint, its clamping effectiveness is exponentially reduced, and it is a poor application that will eventually fail under thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E
5000|$|Belleville washers, {{when used}} on the {{mounting}} bolts, are also useful {{as an indicator of}} swelling or shrinkage of wooden propellers on aircraft (typically experimental aircraft). By torquing their associated bolts to provide a specific gap between sets of washers placed with [...] "high ends" [...] facing each other, a change in relative moisture content in the propeller wood will result in a change of the gaps which is often great enough to be detected visually. As propeller balance depends on the weight of blades being equal, a radical difference in <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> gaps may indicate a difference in moisture content—and thus weight—in the adjacent blades.|$|E
50|$|Eliminates {{the need}} to stack springs to {{accommodate}} higher loads. It produces high force while maintaining the precision of a circular-grain wave spring. It replaces a stack of <b>belleville</b> <b>washers</b> where a high but accurate force is needed.|$|R
40|$|Connection method applies {{force to}} two interfaces: that between heating element proper and heating-element support members and between heating-element support members and metal conductor. Inner rod of new {{connector}} system is maintained in tension by a spring (for example, <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers).</b> Connection is sufficiently complaint so tension remains within desired range, regardless of {{thermal expansion and contraction}} of various elements...|$|R
40|$|Extreme space {{limitations}} {{and the desire}} to reduce the bounce between contacts prompted an investigation of the use of <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> and Sorbothane as part of a spring/damper system in a medium voltage high-speed shorting device. Experimental tests in conjunction with mechanism simulation have been used to optimize a spring and damping system for the minimization of bounce that occurs during the closing of electrical contacts. Through the use of Dynamic Designer, the amount of stiffness and damping required, the identification of the optimum location of the damping system, and the mechanism components that were contributing to the bouncing phenomena were determined. The stiffness of the <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> was tuned to the moving masses but the overtravel of the shaft was damped using a Sorbothane stack. This paper discusses the basic mechanism of a medium voltage switch and the modeling approach in Dynamic Designer. The experiments used for validation of the model are outlined. Correlation between the model and the test results conclude the paper...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a <b>belleville</b> <b>washer</b> to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of various integrated power/attitude control systems (IPACS) rotor materials was analyzed. Three materials were investigated: (1) 6 A 1 - 4 V-Titanium (the current IPACS rotor material); (2) B 120 VCA Titanium; and (3) Custom 455 stainless steel. The preliminary linear vibration analysis was updated {{to include the}} weights and stiffnesses of the gimbals design. A <b>belleville</b> <b>washer</b> spring preload mechanism was designed to replace the existing helical spring and interference fit preload mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A pair of jaw {{assemblies}} simultaneously {{driven in}} opposed reciprocation {{by a single}} shaft has oppositely threaded sections to automatically center delicate or brittle workpieces such as lithium fluoride crystal beneath the blade of a crystal cleaving machine. Both jaw assemblies are suspended above the vise bed {{by a pair of}} parallel guide shafts attached to the vise bed. Linear rolling bearings, fitted around the guide shafts and firmly held by opposite ends of the jaw assemblies, provide rolling friction between the guide shafts and the jaw assemblies. A <b>belleville</b> <b>washer</b> {{at one end of the}} drive shaft and thrust bearings at both drive shaft ends hold the shaft in compression between the vise bed, thereby preventing wobble of the jaw assemblies due to wear between the shaft and vise bed...|$|E
40|$|Poppet {{and seat}} {{less likely to}} be damaged by faulty operation. Improvements in widely-used {{high-pressure}} valve increase accuracy of preloading of poppet. Redesigned valve prevents metal shavings and other debris from developing during operation, installation, or removal. New features include secondary seal in cap. <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> create precise value of seating force. If installer attempts to exceed force, torque limiter gives tactile and aural warning and makes further force increases difficult...|$|R
50|$|If {{friction}} and bottoming-out effects are ignored, {{the spring rate}} of a stack of identical <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> can be quickly approximated. Counting {{from one end of}} the stack, group by the number of adjacent washers in parallel. For example, in the stack of washers to the right, the grouping is 2-3-1-2, because there is a group of 2 washers in parallel, then a group of 3, then a single washer, then another group of 2.|$|R
50|$|As said, {{multiple}} <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> may be stacked {{to modify}} the spring constant (or spring rate) or the amount of deflection. Stacking {{in the same direction}} will add the spring constant in parallel, creating a stiffer joint (with the same deflection). Stacking in an alternating direction is the same as adding common springs in series, resulting in a lower spring constant and greater deflection. Mixing and matching directions allow a specific spring constant and deflection capacity to be designed.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the joint halves during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular tongue and groove. The two joint halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{biodegradable}} screws and plates have received wide acceptance over metallic fasteners for orthopedic fracture fixation. A biodegradable fastener would gradually "disappear" during healing of a fractured bone or tissues, therefore avoiding a secondary operation to remove that fastener. When using a metal fastener, the current approach requires manual threading {{on a large}} bone fragment for fixation. This technique is difficult when it is required to fixate a small bone fragment. This study puts forth {{the development of a}} threadless, polymer based orthopedic fastener for small fragment fixation which would provide stability and interfragmental compression to the fracture site. The fastener was designed with ratchets on its surface, which deflect during insertion into the drilled hole in the bone and subsequently stiffen to hold the bone fragments in place due to interference. The head of the fastener was developed analogous to a <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> which deflects during insertion of the fastener and subjects the bone fragments to interfragmental compression. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to design the fastener profile and assess its performance. The push-in and pull-out forces predicted by FEA were comparable to the experimental results for the prototype of the microfasteners. The push-in force was found to increase with increasing insertion depth and radial interference. The force required to initiate pull-out was maximum and was reduced with reducing fastener bone contact. An analytical model was proposed to explain the fastener bone interaction. It was found to be in good agreement with the FEA and experimental results at low levels of interference...|$|E
40|$|A {{miniature}} {{latching valve}} has been invented {{to satisfy a}} need for an electrically controllable on/off pneumatic valve that is lightweight and compact and remains in the most recently commanded open or closed state when power is not supplied. The valve includes a poppet that is moved into or out of contact with a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing pairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their transition temperature: heated wires contract to their remembered length, applying tension to pull the poppet toward or away from the seat. A latch consisting mainly of a bistable <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> (a conical spring) made of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions corresponding to the fully closed or fully open state, holding the poppet {{in one of these}} positions when power is not applied to either pair of SMA wires. To obtain maximum actuation force and displacement, the SMA wires must be kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit the fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier design provided for each wire to be crimped in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the opening to produce a large, uniformly distributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical ferrule depicted in the figure. A major problem in designing the valve was to protect the SMA wires from a bake-out temperature of 300 C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in place by miniature clip rings...|$|E
50|$|On {{either side}} of the gear are the thrust washers. The thrust washers are pushed against the ball {{bearings}} inside the gear by <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers.</b> On one side of the gear is an adjusting collar, which allows for adjustments in the amount of slip allowed by the differential. A thrust bearing (or thrust race), {{on the opposite side of}} the gear, is used to stop the differential from loosening the retaining screw holding the output cups, used to attach the differential to the axle, onto the differential.|$|R
50|$|As {{previously}} said, <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> {{are useful}} for adjustments because different thicknesses can be swapped in and out {{and they can be}} configured to achieve essentially infinite tunability of spring rate while only filling up {{a small part of the}} technician's tool box. They are ideal in situations where a heavy spring force is required with minimal free length and compression before reaching solid height. The downside, though, is weight, and they are severely travel limited compared to a conventional coil spring when free length is not an issue.|$|R
50|$|A rundown fixture, {{also known}} as a joint simulator, is used during the {{calibration}} process to help test power tools (electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An adapter bit is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process.|$|R
40|$|A <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer</b> can be best {{described}} as a non flat washer with a conical shape and a uniform cross section. They are also known as disk springs and as the name suggests they are often utilised for their load bearing capabilities. Due to their compactness along the axis of loading and {{a wide range of}} attainable load-deflection characteristics they are an attractive alternative to conventional springs. Though Belleville washers are primarily used for their load bearing capabilities, they {{can also be used to}} build a damping device; which in turn can be used as part of a suspension system. The non linear deflection of the spring makes it difficult to predict the resulting pressure-flow characteristic and as a result the damper pack is built either by an experienced operative or by a trial and improvement method. Without an analytical tool to predict the behaviour a designer cannot exploit the full functionality of this type of spring. The intension of this paper is to present research undertaken to develop a correlation which describes the pressure drop required for various flow rates when using Belleville washers as damping elements. Using existing load deflection theory an initial model was developed to relate load with pressure and deflection with flow area which could be used to estimate flow rate. The solutions from a computer simulation showed similar trends to those found in the experimental study, but they estimated smaller pressure drops for a given flow rate. It was postulated that the exit velocity of the fluid created a region of low pressure which tended to close the opening and thus increase the pressure drop. This hypothesis was examined and confirmed with a computational fluid dynamic simulation and the results were used to modify the existing model. Analysis of the new model showed good agreement with the experimental study...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{control valves}} used in {{automotive}} suspension dampers are almost universally {{based upon the}} restriction of flow using Belleville washers. These washers {{can best be described}} as a non-flat washer of conical shape and uniform thickness. They are also known as disc springs and are commonly used for load bearing in which their compactness and ability to produce a wide range of load-deflection characteristics provide an alternative to conventional coil springs. Due to the non-linear behaviour of Belleville washers, and the complex flow paths in an automotive damper valve, it is difficult to predict the resulting pressure-flow characteristic. As a result, damper valve design is often considered to be a 'black art' best carried out by an experienced engineer using an experimental-based trial-and-error approach. Clearly, without the aid of an analytical tool to predict the behaviour of prototype systems it is difficult for the designer to fully exploit the functionality of a particular design. The current paper describes theoretical and experimental studies undertaken to investigate the pressure-flow characteristic of a Belleville washer-based damper valve. Existing load-deflection theory was extended to account for the hydraulic pressure acting on the surfaces of the washer. However, poor agreement was obtained between the measured pressure-flow data using a uniform pressure distribution across the washer diameter. For this reason the model was developed further to include the effect of a non-uniform pressure distribution within the valve. Computational fluid dynamics software was used to predict the pressure regime within the valve and this, in turn, was used to calculate the forces acting {{on the surface of the}} <b>Belleville</b> <b>washer.</b> The improved model was found to match the experimental behaviour with good accuracy, both for a range of spring pre-load conditions and for applications where several washers are stacked up in parallel. However further work would be required to develop a reliable simulation tool as an element of trial and error was necessary to estimate some simulation parameters...|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{chemical}} inertness, PTFE {{cannot be}} cross-linked like an elastomer. Therefore, {{it has no}} [...] "memory" [...] and is subject to creep. Because of its superior chemical and thermal properties, PTFE is often used as a gasket material within industries that require resistance to aggressive chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or chemical processing. However, because of the propensity to creep, the long-term performance of such seals is worse than for elastomers which exhibit zero, or near-zero, levels of creep. In critical applications, <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> are often used to apply continuous force to PTFE gaskets, ensuring a minimal loss of performance over the lifetime of the gasket.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first five}} prototypes had {{conventionally}} operating dual-strut leg rearwards-retracting main gear, but {{starting with the}} V6 prototype, a main gear design debuted that twisted the new, single-leg main gear strut through 90° during the retraction sequence, much {{like that of the}} American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. This feature allowed the main wheels to end up above {{the lower end of the}} strut when fully retracted [...] and was adopted as standard for all future production Ju 88s, and only minimally modified for the later Ju 188 and 388 developments of it. These single-leg landing gear struts also made use of stacks of conical <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> inside them, as their main form of suspension for takeoffs and landings.|$|R
50|$|Through the years, {{the request}} of an always greater {{precision}} in calibrations process, the availability of new materials and new and more accurate calculation methods, led {{to the introduction of}} the disc spring into all areas of technology and now disc springs are used in a lot of industries: automotive, building, defense and so on. In the different fields, if they are used as springs or to apply a pre-load of flexible quality to a bolted joint or bearing, <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> {{can be used as a}} single spring or as a stack. In a springs stack, disc springs can be stacked in the same or in an alternating direction and of course it possible to stack packets of multiple springs stacked in the same direction.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 has {{a unique}} {{buffering}} system contained within the bolt carrier. In front of the carrier cap are a steel shim {{and a set of}} 27 saucer-shaped <b>Belleville</b> <b>washers</b> oriented in opposing sets of three, which absorb energy from the piston stroke by deforming into a flat plate when the bolt carrier strikes the receiver’s end cap. When the plates return to their original shape they release a pulse of strain energy which propels the reciprocating parts forward in counter-recoil with a speed only slightly below that of the original recoil velocity. The plates will function without failure for between 40,000 and 50,000 rounds (depending upon the type of ammunition used and cyclic rates employed). This feature was designed to extend the weapon’s service life.|$|R
