5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries supply oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> {{the front}} of the brain and the vertebral arteries supply <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the back of the brain. These two circulations join together in the circle of Willis, a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons.|$|E
5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E

5|$|A typical female {{vampire bat}} weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid ounce) {{of blood in}} a 20-minute feed. This feeding {{behavior}} is facilitated by its anatomy and physiology for rapid processing and digestion of the <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> enable the animal to take flight soon after the feeding.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} low (0. 08 microU g- 1 body wt min- 1) and high (0. 16 microU g- 1 body wt min- 1) rates of {{vasopressin}} infusion on <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal liver tissue and to liver metastases derived from azoxymethane induced colorectal carcinomas was studied in 36 male Wistar rats. Portal venous flow {{was measured by}} electromagnetic flowmetry and <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal and metastatic liver tissue by the clearance of xenon- 133 injected directly into the liver parenchyma or metastasis. The low rate of vasopressin infusion decreased portal venous flow but increased <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal and metastatic liver tissue while at the higher rate of infusion these effects were reversed. Hepatic artery ligation (HAL) immediately following a low rate of vasopressin infusion abolished the observed increase in <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> both normal liver tissue and metastases. HAL immediately following the higher rate of vasopressin infusion further reduced <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> metastases but did not further alter <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal liver tissue. HAL prior to the infusion of the vasoactive drug significantly reduced <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> metastatic liver tissue, increased portal venous flow and was without effect on <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal liver tissue. Following HAL, <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> metastatic liver tissue was not further altered by either the low or high rates of vasopressin infusion. However, <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal liver tissue after HAL was reduced by a low rate of infusion of vasopressin and increased by the higher rate of infusion. The {{results of this study}} indicate that <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> normal or metastatic liver tissue can be increased or decreased by differential rates of infusion of vasopressin. These observations may have important implications in the treatment of liver metastases in man where different rates of vasopressin infusion may potentiate the effects of hepatic artery ligation or cytotoxic therapy...|$|R

5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off the flow of <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the brain. Belzer, however, {{fell to the floor}} unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E

5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
50|$|A chest X-ray may be taken, which reveals overall heart size (as a {{reflection}} of the combined mass of the cardiac chambers) and the appearance of <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the lungs.

A large PDA generally accompanies an enlarged cardiac silhouette and increased <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the lungs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> flow <b>to</b> each uterine horn of cows {{during the}} oestrous cycle and early {{pregnancy}} was determined daily {{by use of}} electromagnetic blood flow probes placed around both middle uterine arteries. The pattern of <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> uteri of pregnant and non-pregnant cows was similar until Day 14 after mating or oestrus. Between Days 14 and 18 of pregnancy <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the uterine horn containing the conceptus increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) 2 - to 3 -fold, whereas <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the non-gravid uterine horn in these cows remained constant. No corresponding increase in <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the uterine horn ipsilateral to the ovary bearing the CL was observed in non-pregnant cows during this 4 -day period. By Day 19 of pregnancy, <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the gravid uterine horn had returned to a level similar to that observed on Day 13. <b>Blood</b> flow <b>to</b> both uterine horns of pregnant cows remained constant from Days 19 to 25 and then increased to the gravid horn (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) markedly until Day 30 whereas <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the non-gravid horn remained low. Uterine blood flow during the oestrous cycle of non-pregnant cows was positively correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with systemic concentrations of oestradiol and the ratio of oestradiol (pg/ml) to progesterone (ng/ml). There was no association between oestradiol concentrations and <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> the gravid uterine horn. These data indicate local control of uterine blood flow by the bovine conceptus which may function to create optimal conditions for the continuation of pregnancy...|$|R

5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> appear at the lips.|$|E
