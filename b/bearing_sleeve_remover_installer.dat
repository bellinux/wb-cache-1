5000|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> use two {{surfaces}} lubricated {{with oil}} or grease as a friction contact. They often use porous sintered sleeves to be self-lubricating, requiring only infrequent maintenance or replacement. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are less durable at higher temperatures as the contact surfaces wear and the lubricant dries up, eventually leading to failure; however, lifetime {{is similar to}} that of ball-bearing types (generally a little less) at relatively low ambient temperatures. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> may be more likely to fail at higher temperatures, and may perform poorly when mounted in any orientation other than vertical. The typical lifespan of a sleeve-bearing fan may be around 30,000 hours at 50 Â°C. Fans that use <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are generally cheaper than fans that use ball bearings, and are quieter at lower speeds early in their life, but can become noisy as they age.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of genetic {{algorithms}} to optimize {{the shape of an}} ungrooved fluid-film journal bearing under steady load and steady speed so that it can carry the maximum possible load while constrained to maintaining an adequate minimum film thickness. The shape of the <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve</b> is assumed to vary only in the radial direction, and the shape is represented by linear interpolation of three film thickness design specifications along the <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Each set of film thickness specifications in the design space is encoded into a binary string called a chromosome, and a set of chromosomes makes up a current generation. The bearing load is calculated for each chromosome, and the genetic algorithm creates a new generation based on these loads using elitism selection and chromosome crossover and mutation operators. Several case studies are presented to investigate the effect of bearing geometric specifications on the resulting optimal shape. For a given bearing diameter and bearing length, a random generation of chromosomes is first constructed. Using recommended chromosome crossover and mutation probabilities, it is shown that randomly created starting sets will eventually converge to a common shape, suggesting that a global optimum may have been achieved. Additional parametric studies show that the load results are dependent upon the mutation operator to achieve global optimums. Further comparisons show that the load carried by the optimal shape bearing can be much greater than that carried by a conventional cylindrical bearing...|$|R

40|$|A finite-element {{approach}} to thermoelastohydrodynamic lubrication analysis is developed by extending a previous mass- and energy-conserving algorithm to include wall-convection boundary conditions, groove-mixing theory, and thermo-mechanical deformations. To this end, the cross-film-averaged energy equation is {{coupled with the}} heat conduction equations relevant to the <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the journal by fitting the temperature profile across the film thickness with a fourth-order polynomial. A finite-element condensation technique is used to reduce the unknowns in heat conduction equations in the bush and in the journal to the temperatures of the sleeve surface and journal axis, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the hydrodynamic pressure distribution in oil film and the load carrying capacities of conical slide micro <b>bearings</b> with grooved <b>sleeves.</b> The results for some bearings examples are presented. For the bearings taken into account, the Reynolds equation was solved by the method of Finite Differences. In the calculations, the Reynolds boundary condition was applied. The simulation was performed for the conical slide micro bearings with the groves parallel to the cone generating line. The function of lubrication gap height for the conical slide <b>bearings</b> with <b>sleeves</b> covered with microgrooves was assumed on the basis of existing papers. The results obtained for the analogous bearings without the microgrooves are also shown, therefore the influence of microgrooves on the conical slide micro bearings can be observed. On the basis of the results, one can conclude, that applying microgrooves on the <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve</b> surface causes the increase of the value of hydrodynamic pressure and longitudinal and transverse components of the load carrying capacity of the bearing. Furthermore, the effect of the microgrooves and their impact is noticeable in graphs of hydrodynamic pressure distribution. The applied method of investigation of the impact of microgrooves on a bearing operation is simpler and less expensive than the experimental studies, however it is necessary to verify that the results obtained with this method are correct and whether in fact applying microgrooves, besides form facilitate lubrication, causes the improvement in bearing operating parameters...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. Tilting pad bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit first critical speed that is located approximately midway between the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> split peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with tilting pad bearings. Both rotor bearing systems resulted in first critical speeds in the operating speed range. Numerous attempts to shift the critical out of the operating range were explored without success. As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots. While a tilting pad to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> change is not recommended for all classes of turbomachinery to shift critical speeds, it is a powerful design tool as it may produce critical speed changes of up to 1000 rpm...|$|R

40|$|Plastic sliding {{bearings}} in massive and composite structure mostly {{are used as}} wearing bearing. The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive {{sliding bearings}} with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive sliding bearings is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the sliding bearings are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic sliding bearings {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic sliding bearing works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.

The wood is extremely heavy because it contains extensive deposits of resin (Howes, 1949) and it will sink if placed in water (Wilson and Eisner, 1968).

5000|$|The usual {{solution}} for high-performance aero-engines is a [...] "forked" [...] connecting rod. One rod is {{split in two}} at the big end {{and the other is}} thinned to fit into this fork. The journal is still shared between cylinders. The Rolls-Royce Merlin used this [...] "fork-and-blade" [...] style. A common arrangement for forked rods is for the fork rod to have a single wide <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve</b> that spans the whole width of the rod, including the central gap. The blade rod then runs, not directly on the crankpin, but on the outside of this sleeve. The two rods do not rotate relative to each other, merely oscillate back and forth, so this bearing is relatively lightly loaded and runs as a much lower surface speed. However the bearing movement also becomes reciprocating rather than continuously rotating, which is a more difficult problem for lubrication.|$|R

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve</b> if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedRotordynamic response phenomena, including backward whirl, were investigated both analytically and experimentally. A two degrees-of-freedom rotor model {{was developed to}} simulate the steady state, lateral vibration characteristics of a simply supported, single disk rotor. This model includes the effects of direct and cross-coupled, linear damping and stiffness coefficients. The computer model was used to quantify the influence of bearing characteristics on rotordynamic response. The presence of split resonance, {{which appears to be}} due to separate and distinct natural frequencies in the two orthogonal lateral directions and the occurrence of backward whirl between these two frequencies was studied. The effects of geometric imperfections in the <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve,</b> gravitational forces and bearing support stiffnesses were isolated using the experimental apparatus. It was determined that the split resonance induced backward whirl and the different natural frequencies were caused by asymmetric stiffness of the bearing support structure as well as gravitational forces.

40|$|It {{has been}} known since 1967 that the {{steady-state}} and dynamic performance, including the stability of a wave bearing, are highly dependent on the wave amplitude. A wave-bearing profile can be readily obtained by elastically distorting the stationary <b>bearing</b> <b>sleeve</b> surface. The force that distorts the elastic sleeve surface could be an applied force or pressure. The magnitude and response of the distorting force would be defined by {{the relation between the}} bearing surface stiffness and the bearing pressure, or load, in a feedback loop controller. Using such devices as piezoelectric or other electromechanical elements, one could step control or fully control the bearing.
