5|$|The {{school can}} trace its origins to an {{endowment}} made by John I de Balliol, then Lord of Barnard Castle, in 1229. The school itself {{was established in}} 1883 when it occupied temporary premises in Middleton One Row, County Durham, whilst construction of the school was undertaken in Barnard Castle. Initially there were 25 <b>boarders</b> and 10-day pupils, {{but by the end}} of 1884, there were 76 <b>boarders.</b> Originally known as the North Eastern County School, the main school building was completed on 2 February 1886 and initially housed 116 <b>boarders</b> and 12-day pupils. The Bishop of Durham presided over the foundation ceremony. The building was designed by Clark & Moscrop of Darlington in the Jacobean style, and is a Grade II listed building built with local Yorkstone and Lakeland slate. The school was built for the trustees of Benjamin Flounders and the trustees of St. John's Hospital, Barnard Castle, who managed the Baliol endowment, and was overseen by a University of Durham committee. Flounders was a Quaker industrialist who had helped to fund the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The Flounders trustees financed the entirety of the construction of the school with a donation of £31,000. A further £20,000 was raised by subscription to cover initial running costs, £10,000 of which came from St John's Hospital. The gift from St John's was conditional on the school being situated in Barnard Castle, and this determined its location.|$|E

It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E

5|$|As campus residences {{accommodate}} just 6,400 {{students in}} all, the university guarantees housing only for undergraduates {{in their first}} year of study, while most upper-year and graduate students reside off-campus.

Following this, the wind tore the two ships apart, and Chesapeake was blown around the bows of Shannon. This left the British <b>boarders,</b> about fifty-strong, stranded. However, organised resistance aboard the American ship had almost ceased by this time.|$|E
