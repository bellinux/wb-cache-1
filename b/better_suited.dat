5|$|Historically the breeds {{that were}} merged into the King Charles Spaniel {{were used for}} hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, {{including}} cardiac conditions {{and a range of}} eye issues.|$|E

He also felt that after the {{experience}} of fronting his own band Dare, it was not satisfying enough to play keyboards behind Gorham and Sykes. Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play with Thin Lizzy at any time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} naturalists have visited the island, {{starting}} with the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to the Abrolhos Islands in 1913. This expedition spent little time on North Island, as shore collecting was not very successful there, and other islands appeared <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to their work. Expedition members nevertheless published substantial information about the island, including a description of its physiography {{and a list of}} its vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to Americans. He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating {{the unique needs of}} his own. General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Mikan {{returned}} to professional basketball, {{becoming the first}} commissioner of the American Basketball Association, a rival league to the NBA. In order to lure basketball fans to his league, Mikan invented the league's characteristic red-white-and-blue ABA ball, which he thought more patriotic, <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> for TV, and more crowd-pleasing than the brown NBA ball, and instituted the three-point line. Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E

5|$|King's {{stance on}} Vietnam {{encouraged}} Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, {{with the support}} of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 United States presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal on the grounds that he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> for his morally unambiguous role as an activist.|$|E
5|$|Marina Sirtis {{auditioned for}} the role of Macha Hernandez, while Denise Crosby auditioned for the part of Deanna Troi. They both gained the parts with the {{approval}} of Berman and Justman, but Roddenberry switched the roles of the actresses as he thought Sirtis would be <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> {{for the role}} of the ship's counselor. Macha Hernandez was re-written to become Tasha Yar to better suit Crosby.|$|E
5|$|Mayberry {{has been}} used {{predominantly}} as a starting outfielder, despite some suggesting he is <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> as a platoon player. He hits for power, but strikes out frequently. He is a good athlete, with good speed, but does not steal many bases. Defensively, he is adequate, and possesses a strong and accurate arm. Mayberry has a degree in political science from Stanford. His father, John Mayberry, Sr., played {{in the major leagues}} for over a decade and was a two-time All Star.|$|E

5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to their route structure. Singapore Airlines {{was also an}} expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.|$|E
5|$|Rocket {{remained}} in {{use with the}} L after the accident, albeit rarely used for anything other than internal engineering duties. The more advanced Planet design was <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to heavy loads, and Rocket became redundant. In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used to haul coal until 1844.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force {{is looking}} to {{configure}} the CV-22 to perform combat search and rescue {{in addition to its}} primary long-range special operations transport mission. The Osprey would act as a complement to Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk and planned HH-60W rescue helicopters, being employed in scenarios where its ability to cover more ground quickly would be <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to search and rescue than more nimble but slower helicopters.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{there is a}} relatively high proportion of semi-automatic firearms in the country, which are generally considered <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> for self-defense. The most owned firearms {{in the country are}} CZ 75 Compact and Glock 17. Other popular guns include 1911 clones and semi-automatic rifles made by Czech manufacturers, especially vz. 58 and AR 15 (of which there are 3 manufacturers). There are relatively fewer revolvers, mostly from US manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Colt, or Czech producers ALFA and Kora.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, H J Sawin proposed that the aetosaur Longosuchus was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to {{a large number of}} skeletons that were likely carcasses. A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and were likely <b>better</b> <b>suited</b> to eating plant material.|$|E
