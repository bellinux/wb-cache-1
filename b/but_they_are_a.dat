I have lived in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{strings of}} eggs absorb water and swell in size, and small tadpoles hatch out after {{two to three}} weeks. At first they cling to {{the remains of the}} strings and feed on the jelly. They later attach {{themselves}} to the underside of the leaves of water weed before becoming free swimming. The tadpoles at first look {{similar to those of the}} common frog (Rana temporaria) <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> darker colour, being blackish above and dark grey below. They can be distinguished from the tadpoles of other species by the fact that the mouth is the same width as the space between the eyes, and this is twice as large as the distance between the nostrils. Over the course of a few weeks their legs develop and their tail gradually gets reabsorbed. By twelve weeks of age they are miniature toads measuring about [...] long and ready to leave the pond.|$|E
500|$|Although Spiritual Machines {{was not as}} {{successful}} as Our Lady Peace's previous three albums, it was highly praised by fans and critics alike as being one of Our Lady Peace's finest releases, and has also been proclaimed as being the height of their artistic creativity. Selena Gomez of the University Star of Texas State University–San Marcos called the album incredible, but {{also pointed out that}} it was a commercial disaster due to it being [...] "flighty and difficult to palate." [...] MacKenzie Wilson of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying that [...] "They can still deliver pinch-hitting licks and the brash attitude they did when they first formed in 1993, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> little older and a little wiser." [...] A review from the Hamilton Spectator noted that the album's concluding tracks [...] "If You Believe" [...] and [...] "The Wonderful Future" [...] demonstrated a particular facility for mixing sonic textures and that there were [...] "actually moments when vocalist Raine Maida varies from his impersonation of a singing head cold." [...] Ashley Bird of Kerrang! noted that the album was packed with crisp, clean songwriting, odd searing post-grunge riffs and Raine Maida's nasal croon. He {{went on to say that}} the song [...] "Life" [...] "is one of the most perfectly weighted slices of pop-rock you'll hear." ...|$|E

2500|$|The current Police Commissioner, is Ottis Blair, {{serving his}} second term in that role. He has been working for the {{department}} since 1993, and has served various other roles such as captain, major, and deputy chief. The department responds to about 4,900 calls to action each month, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> more proactive crime fighting organization. For example, in 2013, the city expanded its police force as summer was approaching because crime generally rises during that time and the addition was done in anticipation of more calls to action. The United States Department of Justice gave them a Community Oriented Policing Services (C.O.P.S.) grant in 2012 that allowed the department to create five new positions that were implemented in this plan. The department prefers to keep its [...] "rank and file" [...] at {{more than one hundred}} officers and this grant has allowed them to surpass that goal. However, retirements and injuries continue to make it difficult to fully staff the department's many divisions.|$|E

5000|$|One {{can take}} a {{low-dimensional}} {{point of view on}} high-dimensional manifoldsand ask [...] "Which high-dimensional manifolds are geometrizable?",for various notions of geometrizable (cut into geometrizable pieces as in 3 dimensions, into symplectic manifolds, and so forth).

2500|$|Diamonds {{are usually}} cut into brilliants {{to bring out}} their {{brilliance}} (the amount of light reflected back to the viewer) and fire (the degree to which colorful prismatic flashes are seen). Both properties are strongly affected by the cut of the stone, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> function of diamond's high refractive index (RI—the degree to which incident light is bent upon entering the stone) of 2.417 (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) and high dispersion (the degree to which white light is split into its spectral colors as it passes through the stone) of 0.044, {{as measured by the}} sodium B and G line interval. Thus, if a diamond simulant's RI and dispersion are too low, it will appear comparatively dull or [...] "lifeless"; if the RI and dispersion are too high, the effect will be considered unreal or even tacky. Very few simulants have closely approximating RI and dispersion, and even the close simulants can be separated by an experienced observer. Direct measurements of RI and dispersion are impractical (a standard gemological refractometer has an upper limit of about RI 1.81), but several companies have devised reflectivity meters to gauge a material's RI indirectly by measuring how well it reflects an infrared beam.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the CPC has {{failed to live up}} to its {{promises}} about the freedom of the mainland Chinese media. Freedom House consistently ranks China as 'Not Free' in its annual press freedom survey, including the 2014 report. PRC journalist He Qinglian says that the PRC's media are controlled by directives from the Communist Party's propaganda department, and are subjected to intense monitoring which threatens punishment for violators, rather than to pre-publication censorship. In 2008, ITV News reporter John Ray was arrested while covering a 'Free Tibet' protest. International media coverage of Tibetan protests only a few months before the Beijing Olympics in 2008 triggered a strong reaction inside China. Chinese media practitioners took the opportunity to argue with propaganda authorities for more media freedom: one journalist asked, 'If not even Chinese journalists are allowed to report about the problems in Tibet, how can foreign journalists know about the Chinese perspective about the events?' Foreign journalists also reported that their access to certain websites, including those of human rights organizations, was restricted. International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge stated at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games that 'The regulations [...] might not be perfect <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> sea-change compared to the situation before. We hope that they will continue.' The Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) issued a statement during the Olympics that 'despite welcome progress in terms of accessibility and the number of press conferences within the Olympic facilities, the FCCC has been alarmed at the use of violence, intimidation and harassment outside. The club has confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference since the formal opening of the Olympic media centre on 25 July, and is checking at least 20 other reported incidents.' ...|$|E
