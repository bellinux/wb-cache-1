40|$|Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is {{a digital}} {{computer}} for automation of process such as control of instruments in industries. It uses a programmable memory to store instructions and specific functions that include ON/OFF control, timing, counting, sequencing, arithmetic, and data handling. The basic parts include processor, input/output devices, memory unit, programming panel and power supply. Static Application Panels {{are designed to}} produce input and output from the PLC. Early electrical control systems were composed of mainly relays and switches. A relay, or contactor, is an electromagnetic device composed of a frame (or core) with an electromagnet coil and contacts with some movable and some fixed parts. Due to its disadvantages like chattering, complicated wiring and less flexibility relays are replaced by PLC. The SAP panels and ladder programmes were developed for automatic <b>bottle</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> water level controller, logic gates and counter and comparator. Ladder programme is downloaded into PLC and verified with SAP model. According to the condition and comments provided in the ladder programme the SAP model works, if any deviation in the comments provided and this can be modified in the ladder diagram. This paper explain about the PLC, SAP model and ladder diagram designed for <b>bottle</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> water level controller, logic gates and counter and comparator...|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{magnitude}} of the bottling endeavor, there are many different types of bottling machinery available. Liquid level <b>machines</b> <b>fill</b> <b>bottles</b> so they appear to be filled to the same line on every <b>bottle,</b> while volumetric <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> <b>fill</b> each <b>bottle</b> with exactly the same amount of liquid. Overflow pressure fillers are the most popular machines with beverage makers, while gravity <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> are most cost effective. In terms of automation, inline <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> are most popular, but rotary machines are much faster albeit much more expensive.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the topic to plan the {{prolongation}} of the lifetime of capital goods through a special focus to upgrading during product development and product life span. It is the goal that products are utilized longer and to reduce the essential disadvantages upon the environment. The costs of development and manufacturing {{for the implementation of}} the new functions and modules in the product in a later utilization phase have to be decreased effectively. The discussed guideline “design for upgrading ” shows a methodology how to develop prod-ucts which can be upgradeable in their life span. The three interrelated processes (product life cycle, module life cycle and upgrading process) and the use of resources will be presented, too.
