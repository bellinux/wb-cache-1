5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and use tools.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} at {{authenticity}} and realism, the producers allowed the characters speak in a mix of Hokkien, English and Mandarin, in the typical Singaporean manner. The film would later be subtitled in English and Mandarin during post-production so that the audience would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the characters' lexicon without knowing how the average Singaporean speaks.|$|E
25|$|The actors of {{the film}} were {{required}} to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and explain The Matrix. Simulacra and Simulation was required reading {{for most of the}} principal cast and crew. Reeves stated that the Wachowskis had him read Simulacra and Simulation, , and Dylan Evans’s Introducing Evolutionary Psychology even before they opened up the script, and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.|$|E
25|$|Ashley was insistent {{that the}} course should provide a broad education, with {{students}} not only studying commerce but also languages and modern history. Even then he recognised {{the importance of the}} international context in which business operated, wanting his graduates to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the background to the political and economic policies of other countries. Given Britain's position as a colonial power {{at the turn of the}} century, this was a far-sighted approach.|$|E

25|$|Clear and exact {{communication}} between the helmsman and officer on the bridge is essential to safe navigation and ship handling. Subsequently, a set of standard steering commands, responses by the helmsman, and acknowledgment by the conning officer are widely recognized in the maritime industry. The helmsman repeats any verbal commands {{to demonstrate that the}} command is heard and understood. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) requires that a helmsman <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and respond to helm orders in English.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Noelle Fair and Lisa LaGrande {{adapted the}} play into Interpreting her Martyr'd Signs, {{the title of}} which is taken from Titus' claim to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the mute Lavinia. Focusing on the backstories of Tamora and Lavinia, the play is set in Purgatory shortly after their deaths, where they find {{themselves}} in a waiting area with Aaron as their salvation or damnation is decided upon. As they try {{to come to terms with}} their unresolved conflict, Aaron serves as a master of ceremonies, initiating a dialogue between them, leading to a series of flashbacks to their lives prior to the beginning of the play.|$|E
25|$|Armenian can {{be divided}} into two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into {{individual}} dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have become extinct due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Although Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, many subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is also literate in one of the standards, when exposed to the other dialect {{for a period of time}} will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the other with relative ease.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Eric Lenneberg criticised Whorf's {{examples}} from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent {{events in the}} real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual use of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not think in that way.|$|E
25|$|Defining a German nation {{based on}} {{internal}} characteristics presented difficulties. Since {{the start of}} the Reformation in the 16th century, the German lands had been divided between Catholics and Lutherans and linguistic diversity was large as well. Today, the Swabian, Bavarian, Saxon and Cologne dialects in their most pure forms are estimated to be 40% mutually intelligible with modern Standard German, meaning that in a conversation between a native speaker of any of these dialects and a person who speaks only standard German, the latter will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> slightly less than half of what is being said without any prior knowledge of the dialect, a situation which is likely to have been similar or greater in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Historical ecology is a {{research}} program {{that focuses on the}} interactions between humans and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries. In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields. Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to and shape the environment, continuously contributing to landscape transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that system.|$|E

500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say." [...] “There’s going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization," [...] he told Science Friday, adding that [...] "in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.” ...|$|E
