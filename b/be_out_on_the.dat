He {{then returned to the}} Holden Racing team for the 2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000, teaming with Englishman Jason Plato in a VY Commodore. The pair failed to finish after Plato was involved in a spectacular accident coming out of Caltex Chase with the Ozemail Falcon of fellow BTCC regular (and Brock's 1993 Bathurst co-driver) John Cleland while Cleland was lapping the Commodore (which was limping to the pits with a blown tyre) on lap 29. The clash caused the Falcon to roll and enough damage to the HRT car to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot with Brock failing to get a drive in his last Bathurst race after Plato had started the car and was due to hand over to Brock a few laps after the crash.|$|E

On an interview, he said, [...] "Where to start… Orchestral Drive-By: KJ and I are about 5 songs deep now. Can’t wait for you all to hear this. I haven’t been this excited in a while.

2500|$|According to Edin: [...] "No one {{avoided the}} {{unnecessary}} expenditures, {{such as the}} occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them some money or something, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street {{if they are not}} watching TV." [...] However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses. According to Edin, for [...] "most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the government. For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care, clothing, and other household expenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Life for Italians under German {{occupation}} was hard, {{especially in}} Rome. Rome's citizens by 1943 had {{grown tired of}} the war and upon Italy signing an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, Rome's citizens took to the streets chanting [...] "Viva la pace!" [...] ("Long live the peace!), but within hours German forces raided the city and attacked anti-Fascists, royalists and Jews. Roman citizens were harassed by German soldiers to provide them food and fuel and German authorities would arrest all opposition and many were sent into forced labor. Rome's citizens upon being liberated reported that {{during the first week of}} German occupation of Rome, crimes against Italian citizens took place as German soldiers looted stores and robbed Roman citizens at gunpoint. Martial law was imposed on Rome by German authorities requiring all citizens to obey a curfew forbidding people to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street after 9 p.m. During winter of 1943, Rome's citizens were denied access to sufficient food, firewood and coal which was taken by German authorities to be given to German soldiers housed in occupied hotels. These actions left Rome's citizens to live in the harsh cold and on the verge of starvation. German authorities began arresting able-bodied Roman men to be conscripted into forced labour. On 4 June 1944, the German occupation of Rome came to an end as German forces retreated as the Allies advanced.|$|E
