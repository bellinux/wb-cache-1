5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E

5|$|In the 1870 election, {{the first}} state in which <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> allowed to vote, Stevenson warned that {{violence}} against them would not be tolerated. Although he relied on local authorities to suppress any incidents, he offered rewards for the apprehension of perpetrators of election-related violence. Stevenson also recommended that the carrying of concealed weapons be outlawed. The General Assembly passed the requested legislation on March 22, 1871. The law imposed small fines for the first offense, but the amount rapidly increased for subsequent infractions in order to deter repeat offenders.|$|E
5|$|The Originals' Test against Wales {{is still}} {{considered}} one of sport's great matches. The Test was played at Cardiff Arms Park, 16 December 1905 in front of 47,000 spectators. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> applauded onto the park where they performed their haka {{in front of a}} silent crowd. Once they had applauded their haka, the crowd, led by 'Teddy' Morgan, sang the Welsh national anthem Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of My Fathers). The match was reportedly the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting fixture.|$|E
5|$|The {{most egregious}} episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois {{published}} a letter in the New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.|$|E

Although the All <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> held {{scoreless}} for the first 25 minutes, at the time the longest period that the All Blacks had gone without scoring on tour, George Smith eventually crossed for the All Blacks first score of the game. The All Blacks ended the match 28–0 winners.|$|E
5|$|While <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> {{excluded}} from the AG until the 1960s, the denomination's work among Spanish-speaking people has a long history, first sanctioned explicitly in 1918. Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established. By the end of World War II, the AG's Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States. The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations, but as later generations assimilated into American culture, these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts.|$|E
5|$|While the All <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> {{on a tour}} of Australia in 1914, the British Empire {{declared}} war on Germany and the team collectively decided to enlist. Three of them were killed, Downing the first of the All Blacks in World War I.

5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and had studied the All Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after the All Blacks, and hence preventing the All Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the All Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make them feel very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E
5|$|Both Smith and {{his wife}} were of mixed-race African and European ancestry. As he became {{economically}} successful, he built a house in a good neighborhood; in the 1860 census he and his family were classified in that neighborhood as white, whereas in 1850 they were classified as mulatto. He served for nearly 20 years as the doctor at the Colored Orphan Asylum in New York but, after it was burned down in July 1863 by a mob in the New York Draft Riots, in which nearly 100 <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> killed, Smith moved his family and practice out to Brooklyn for safety. The parents stressed education for their children. In the 1870 census, his widow and children continued to be classified as white.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Black</b> pigment <b>is</b> an {{important}} pigment in the ceramic decoration. The traditional <b>black</b> pigment <b>is</b> spinel type matter containing Co, Fe or Cr elements. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> the best <b>black</b> pigment and <b>is</b> nontoxic. However, carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> oxygenated in the ceramic sintering process at atmosphere. Carbon black enclosed in the crystal latter of ZrSiO 4 was reported. However, {{the content of}} carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> little which decreases the color generation. Carbon black coated with SiO 2 was prepared by sol-gel method using combustion method using SiO 2 sol and black ink as raw materials. The obtained <b>black</b> pigment <b>was</b> characterized by XRD, TEM and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The {{results show that the}} black pigment does not change its color after calcinations at 1300 °C at atmosphere implying the carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> coated completely with SiO 2...|$|R

50|$|Carbon <b>black</b> (subtypes <b>are</b> {{acetylene}} <b>black,</b> channel black, furnace black, {{lamp black}} and thermal <b>black)</b> <b>is</b> a material {{produced by the}} incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as FCC tar, coal tar, ethylene cracking tar, and a small amount from vegetable oil. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> a form of paracrystalline carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, albeit {{lower than that of}} activated carbon. It is dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and significantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) content. However, carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> widely used as a model compound for diesel soot for diesel oxidation experiments. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> mainly used as a reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products. In plastics, paints, and inks carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> used as a color pigment.|$|R
5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Fred {{encountered}} {{two young}} farmers in Connecticut {{who had spent}} time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful and cheap, and many recently emancipated <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation. For $10,000 ($ in 2009) she purchased a cotton plantation near Orange Park, south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader Zephaniah Kingsley in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, until 1811.|$|E

An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a white man, <b>blacks</b> <b>were</b> elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
