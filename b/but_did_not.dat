50|$|In yeast and Drosophila, CKIs {{are strong}} inhibitors of S- and M-CDK, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> inhibit G1/S-CDKs.

Once the cell cycle is initiated, phosphorylation by early G1/S-CDKs leads to destruction of CKIs, relieving inhibition on later cell cycle transitions. In mammalian cells, the CKI regulation works differently. Mammalian protein p27 (Dacapo in Drosophila) inhibits G1/S- and S-CDKs, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> inhibit S- and M-CDKs.|$|R
