5|$|Initially <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Saltzman {{had wanted}} to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, {{but there was an}} ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Saltzman chose Dr. No: the timing was apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had {{problems}} with rockets going astray.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{the film}} Thunderball was released, {{starring}} Sean Connery as James Bond. The film was produced as the fourth Eon Productions film and, {{as well as}} listing Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Harry Saltzman as producers, Kevin McClory was {{also included in the}} production team: <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Saltzman made a deal with McClory, to undertake a joint production of Thunderball, which stopped McClory from making any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version. Thunderball premiered in Tokyo on 9 December 1965, grossing $141.2 million at the global box office.|$|E
5|$|Thunderball was {{associated}} with a legal dispute in 1961 when former Ian Fleming collaborators Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham sued him shortly after the 1961 publication of the novel, claiming he based it upon the screenplay the trio had earlier written in a failed cinematic translation of James Bond. The lawsuit was settled out of court and Bond film series producers Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Harry Saltzman, fearing a rival McClory film, allowed him to retain certain screen rights to the novel's story, plot, and characters, and for McClory to receive sole producer credit on this film; <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Salzman were instead credited as Executive Producers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{interruption}} of McClory as producer, Albert <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Harry Saltzman returned to produce once again. The first four Bond films had been popular in Japan, and Eon {{decided to take}} advantage of the market by producing You Only Live Twice. The film included progressive elements of Japanese culture as part of the background.|$|E
5|$|Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Harry Saltzman co-produced {{most of the}} Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli {{became the}} sole producer. The single {{exception}} during this period was Thunderball, on which <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon {{and was replaced by}} his daughter Barbara, who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, Danjaq, has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.|$|E

50|$|In early 1961, {{excited by}} reading the James Bond novel Goldfinger, he made a bid to land the film rights to the character. Saltzman co-founded Danjaq, S.A. with Albert R. Broccoli in 1962. It was a holding company {{responsible}} for the copyright and trademarks of James Bond on screen, and {{the parent company of}} Eon Productions, which they also set up as a film production company for the Bond films.

He became a full-fledged art director after an injury to the planned art director just prior to the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962). After work on the spy spoof Road to Hong Kong Cain rejoined Broccoli's Eon Productions.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Michael G. Wilson, who also wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by John Glen, and the last to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Saltzman {{then decided}} to start {{production}} on The Man with the Golden Gun after Live and Let Die. This was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli was dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions's parent company, Danjaq, LLC, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, for three years.|$|E
5|$|Charles K.

The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain the ratio of corn flour <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> that meet the quality of instant noodles on SNI 01 - 3551 - 2000.

5|$|Telly Savalas as Ernst Stavro Blofeld aka Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp â€“ Bond's nemesis, {{leader of}} SPECTRE and in hiding. Savalas had {{appeared}} in The Dirty Dozen in 1967, leading to Broccoli suggesting him to director Peter Hunt, for the role, in place of Donald Pleasence, who {{had appeared in}} You Only Live Twice. Both <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Hunt felt Pleasence was unsuited to the more physical side of the Blofeld role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow You Only Live Twice with The Man with the Golden Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man with the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E

It was shot in Switzerland, England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was still one of the top performing films of the year. Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time.|$|E
