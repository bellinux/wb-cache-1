The task occupied his time for a further two years before he could present his results, which he did in a hundred-page paper to the Royal Society in 1778.

"I {{sat down}} and wept when I remembered the lost pubs of Burslem, the {{demolished}} Star that stood where the Moonglow Ballroom stands now, {{on the corner of}} the street of the Preacher and the Tote office; it was a gaunt, dark building nicknamed the Star of Bethlehem, a grimey stuccoed star the colour of years of wet smoke. From outside it looked forbidding and empty, lit only by one or two naked electric light bulbs; its doors were difficult to find, its main door {{on the corner of the}} Square had been screwed down for some reason and on the inside covered with a piece of painted plywood. Only the side-doors would let you in and these were narrow and difficult to open.
