After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's <b>backup</b> crew and promoted to <b>backup</b> commander.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the F-22 was {{upgraded}} with a <b>backup</b> oxygen system, {{software upgrades}} and oxygen sensors {{to address the}} frequent oxygen deprivation issues and normalize operations. In 2013, the faulty flight vest valves were replaced and altitude restrictions lifted; distance restrictions will be lifted once a <b>backup</b> oxygen system is installed. In April 2014, the USAF stated in Congressional testimony that installation of automatic <b>backup</b> oxygen systems on the F-22 fleet would be completed within twelve months.|$|E

5|$|During the 2010 {{regular season}} and playoffs, Kafka was {{inactive}} as the team's third quarterback for all but five games. In week two Kafka was the <b>backup</b> to Vick against the Detroit Lions after Kolb suffered a concussion in week one against the Green Bay Packers. In Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers, week six against the Atlanta Falcons and week seven against the Tennessee Titans, Kafka was the <b>backup</b> to Kolb after Vick, who took over as the starting quarterback {{for the remainder of}} the season, suffered a rib injury in Week 4 against the Washington Redskins. In the week seventeen game against the Dallas Cowboys, Kafka was the <b>backup</b> quarterback to Kolb in a decision to rest Vick and the team's starters before the playoffs.|$|E

Individuals and organizations with anything from one computer to thousands of computer systems all require protection of data. The scales may be very different, but the objectives and limitations are essentially the same. Those who perform <b>backups</b> need to know how successful the <b>backups</b> are, regardless of scale.|$|R

5|$|In Chicago, Hašek {{spent time}} as the <b>backup</b> to Ed Belfour, and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks, {{splitting}} time between the Blackhawks and the Indianapolis Ice of the IHL. On November 6, 1990, wearing the number 34 (31 was worn by <b>backup</b> goaltender Jacques Cloutier that year), Hašek made his first NHL start in a 1–1 tie against the Hartford Whalers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the <b>backup</b> crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the <b>backup</b> for Gemini 10, became the mission's <b>backup</b> crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked <b>backup</b> on Gemini 3, {{taking charge}} of the newly {{established}} Mission Control Center in Houston, {{at a time when}} flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida. On Gemini 4, he again was working <b>backup,</b> this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston.

5|$|Martinez {{signed a}} one-year, $500,000 {{contract}} with the Chicago White Sox for the 1995 season. He received limited playing time under manager Gene Lamont. When Lamont was replaced by Terry Bevington, Martinez saw an increase in playing time. He signed a two-year $1.425 million contract for the 1996 and 1997 seasons. He spent the 1996 season as a <b>backup</b> behind Darren Lewis, Tony Phillips, and Danny Tartabull, along with fellow <b>backup</b> Lyle Mouton.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a <b>backup</b> relief {{party of}} 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} <b>backup</b> party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning <b>backup</b> relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the <b>backup</b> party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
5|$|The New York Jets signed Gault as a {{free agent}} in 1973, and he was slated to compete with Al Woodall for the <b>backup</b> quarterback spot behind Joe Namath.

After practicing with the team throughout the offseason, he was released in August, ending his professional career.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{technology}} of dynamic diversity <b>backups,</b> an intrusion tolerant system is proposed which guarantees {{the performance of the}} system and does not degrade drastically when it is exposed to outside attacks. By analyzing the consequence of the attacks, we give the attack model and model of the proposed intrusion tolerant system by General Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN). Through it, we can evaluate the efficiency of the intrusion tolerant system (ITS) based on the dynamic diversity <b>backups.</b> In the end of the paper, we analyze the proposed system with three diversity <b>backups</b> and random schedule strategy among the <b>backups</b> by the tool SPNP (Stochastic Petri Net package). The results show that the ITS is affected lightly under the heave attacks, which implies that the system can defend most intrusion effectively...|$|R
40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have shown that}} the efficiency of value iteration, a dynamic programming algorithm for Markov decision processes, can be improved by prioritizing the order of Bellman <b>backups</b> to focus computation on states where the value function can be improved the most. In previous work, a priority queue has been used to order <b>backups.</b> Although this incurs overhead for maintaining the priority queue, previous work has argued that the overhead is usually much less than the benefit from prioritization. However this conclusion is usually based on a comparison to a non-prioritized approach that performs Bellman <b>backups</b> on states in an arbitrary order. In this paper, we show that the overhead for maintaining the priority queue can be greater than the benefit, when it is compared to very simple heuristics for prioritizing <b>backups</b> that do not require a priority queue. Although the order of <b>backups</b> induced by our simple approach is often sub-optimal, we show that its smaller overhead allows it to converge faster than other state-of-the-art priority-based solvers...|$|R
