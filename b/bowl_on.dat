5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's {{place at a}} benefit concert at the Hollywood <b>Bowl</b> <b>on</b> April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy {{was able to buy}} out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.|$|E
5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii <b>Bowl.</b> <b>On</b> the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC. Offensive tackle Ryan Clady was the team's only All-American, and promised {{to do a good}} job protecting Taylor Tharp on the offensive line.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{running back}} Chris Johnson {{finished}} {{the game with}} 223rushing yards, 32receiving yards, and 153return yards {{for a total of}} 408all-purpose yards. That mark broke the NCAA bowl record for all-purpose yards previously set by Alabama's Sherman Williams against Ohio State in the 1995 Citrus <b>Bowl.</b> <b>On</b> the basis of his record-setting performance, Johnson was named the game's Most Valuable Player. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Boise State tailback Jeremy Avery had a solid, if unspectacular, outing. He produced 69rushing yards, 43receiving yards, 41kick–return yards, and caught a 25–yard touchdown pass. Both Johnson and Avery received the Most Valuable Player award for their respective teams.|$|E

5|$|Having {{reached his}} zenith, Berry {{did not have}} the same {{statistical}} success over his final seven seasons, but he remained a consistent target for Unitas. His 75 receptions in the 1961 season was second most in the league, and he finished 10th in receiving yards, but failed to record a touchdown {{for the first time since}} his rookie year. He scored the first touchdown of that year's Pro <b>Bowl</b> <b>on</b> a 16-yard reception from Unitas in the first quarter. His streak of Pro Bowl invitations ended at four, as he was not invited in 1962, but made consecutive Pro Bowl appearances in 1963 and 1964, the latter being his final. The Colts returned to the postseason in 1964, where they were shutout 27–0 by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 championship game.|$|E
5|$|Texas' {{win over}} USC was their ninthconsecutive victory when facing a ranked opponent. Texas broke USC's winning streak (then the longest in the nation) at 34 and claimed the longest running winning streak for {{themselves}} at 20wins {{in a row}}. Texas' 20-game winning streak was the second-longest winning streak in school history; Texas had 30 wins in a row from 1968 to 1970. Texas extended the winning streak to 21 before a September 9, 2006, loss to Ohio State University. In beating USC, Texas defeated a No. 1ranked team {{for the first time}} since defeating Alabama in the Orange <b>Bowl</b> <b>on</b> January 1, 1965. The Longhorns ended the season ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage (.7143).|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{coaching}} changes {{came about}} a month after the Orange <b>Bowl.</b> <b>On</b> February 14, the school announced that the son of head coach Frank Beamer, Shane Beamer, had been hired as running backs coach. He replaced Billy Hite, the longest-tenured assistant coach in the country, who took an administrative role with the team. Two days later, Tech replaced 62-year-old linebackers coach Jim Cavanaugh with 35-year-old Cornell Brown. On February 22, Tech announced that offensive coordinator Bryan Stinespring had been removed from play-calling duties and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike O'Cain. Stinespring, who also was the team's associate head coach, was replaced in that capacity by Shane Beamer.|$|E

5|$|When Bart, Lisa and the {{students}} of Springfield Elementary go {{on a field trip}} to the post office, Bart gets a coupon book as a souvenir, which he gives to Homer as a birthday present. Homer uses one of his coupons at a tire business on a free wheel balancing, but is informed that all four tires in his car are faulty and need to be replaced. While waiting for the new tires, Homer meets Wally Kogen, a travel agent. They go to Moe's and watch a special on the Super <b>Bowl</b> <b>on</b> TV. Wally says his agency has a charter bus going to the game and suggests to Homer that he can fill the bus and ride for free. Moe agrees to come as do other prominent men of Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Aigler {{also played}} an {{important}} role in securing the Big Ten's long-term contract with the Rose Bowl. Prior to the 1947 season, the visiting spot in the Rose Bowl was open to all conferences, and the Big Ten champion only appeared in the Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>on</b> rare occasions. In November 1946, Aigler was appointed to a five-person steering committee assigned to negotiate an exclusive contract with the Rose Bowl. The Big Ten approved the exclusive arrangement by a vote of 7 to 2, with Illinois and Minnesota the only opponents. The relationship was negotiated at meetings between Aigler and the Big Ten steering committee and the Pacific Coast Conference held in Berkeley, California in November 1946. Aigler traveled to California again in May 1947 with William Reed to negotiate administrative details of the Rose Bowl arrangement with Pacific Coast Conference representative William C. Ackerman. The University of Michigan was the first Big Ten participant in the new Rose Bowl arrangement, defeating the USC Trojans 490 in the game held on January 1, 1948.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange <b>Bowl,</b> <b>on</b> January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the temple between two springs, {{the orientation of the}} gates and the circular structure in the courtyard indicate the cultic nature of the Temple seems to have been connected to water. Pottery found at the site is almost exclusively of four types: <b>bowls</b> <b>on</b> fenestrated pedestals, small bowls, cornets and animal figurines. This limited variety may reflect its cultic significance — <b>bowls</b> <b>on</b> fenestrated pedestals have also been found in the Chalcolithic temple in Megiddo.|$|R
