5000|$|Chrysiptera cyanea is {{a species}} of {{damselfish}} native to the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Common names include <b>blue</b> <b>damselfish,</b> blue demoiselle, blue devil, cornflower sergeant-major, [...] Hedley's damselfish, red tail Australian damsel, sapphire devil, and sky-blue damsel.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that small-sized live feed with sufficient DHA, EPA and ARA as starter feed is the key factor for the success in larviculture of marine fishes with altricial larvae having limited yolk, which are in an undeveloped state at hatching. Copepods form {{a major component of}} the natural diet of many fish larvae and the wide range of body sizes of copepods both within and between species is extremely useful for employing the early stage nauplii and copepodites as starter feed for very small larvae with small mouth opening. Improved survival, growth and normal pigmentation have been documented in the larviculture of several marine finfishes reared with the early stage nauplii and copepodites. This is generally attributed to the levels of DHA, EPA and or arachidomic acid (ARA) in the diet and particularly to the DHA: EPA ratio in the diet. Two species of copepods viz. Euterpina acutifrons, a harpacticoid copepod and Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus, a calanoid copepod were selected and cultured. They were employed as starter feed for the larviculture of three species of damsel fishes viz. the three spot damselfish, Dascyllus trimaculatus, the humbug damselfish, Dascyllus aruanus and the <b>blue</b> <b>damselfish,</b> Pomacentrus caeruleus. It was found that co-culturing of copepods in greenwater in the larviculture tank is the most effective method for initiating the exogenous feeding of the species studied...|$|E

30|$|Changes {{in ambient}} {{temperature}} seriously affect physiological regulation and biochemical reactions in ectotherms. However, transient elevation in oceanic temperature occurs naturally during the day. Short-term elevation in the ambient temperature affects different physiological responses in marine fish, including cellular protein stability and osmotic {{balance of the}} internal environment. Since fish gills are vital osmoregulatory organ which directly contacts external environment, activation of cytoprotective responses to maintain gill cell viability and biological function is essential for fish survival under challenging environmental conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the short-term effects of elevated temperature on physiological regulation in the gills of a marine teleost, <b>blue</b> green <b>damselfish</b> (Chromis viridis).|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of 50 ornamental fish species from shallow water habitats on coral reefs were investigated using visual census techniques, between latitudes 11 − 29 °N in the Red Sea, in Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and in the adjacent Gulf of Aden in Djibouti. One hundred eighteen transects (each 100 × 5 m) were examined in 29 sites (3 − 8 sites per country). A total of 522, 523 fish individuals were counted during this survey, with mean abundance of 4428. 2 ± 87. 26 individual per 500 m² transect. In terms of relative abundance (RA), the most abundant species were <b>Blue</b> green <b>damselfish,</b> Chromis viridis (RA= 54. 4 %), followed by Sea goldie, Pseudanthias squamipinnis (RA= 34. 7), Whitetail dascyllus, Dascyllus aruanus (RA= 2. 6 %), Marginate dascyllus, Dascyllus marginatus (RA= 2. 0), Red Sea eightline flasher Paracheilinus octotaenia (RA= 1. 0), and Klunzinger’s wrasse, Thalassoma rueppellii (0. 7 %). The highest number of species (S) per 500 m² transect was found on reefs at the latitude 20 ° in Saudi Arabia (S= 21. 8), and the lowest number of species was found at the latitude 15 ° in Djibouti (S= 11. 11). The highest mean abundance (8565. 8) was found on reefs at latitude 20 ° in Saudi Arabia and the lowest mean abundance (230) was found on reefs at latitude 22 °, also in Saudi Arabia. Whereas, the highest Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index was found in reefs at the latitude 22 ° (H`= 2. 4) and the lowest was found in reefs at the latitude 20 ° (H`= 0. 6). This study revealed marked differences {{in the structure of}} ornamental fish assemblages with latitudinal distribution. The data support the presence of two major biogeographic groups of fishes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden: the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden group and the group in the northern and central Red Sea. Strong correlations were found between live coral cover and the number of fish species, abundance and Shannon-Wiener Diversity indices, and the strength of these correlations varied among the reefs. A conclusion was done that environmental differences among the reefs and the habitats investigated were important components of abundance variations and species diversity of ornamental fish along latitudinal gradients in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden...|$|R
