50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{a number}} of {{research}} and commercial computers used <b>bit</b> <b>slicing,</b> in which the CPU's arithmetic logic unit (ALU) was built from multiple 4-bit-wide sections, each section including a chip such as an Am2901 or 74181 chip.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} called <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> {{processing}} because m-bit slice is processes at a time. Word parallel signifies selection of all words. It {{can be considered as}} one bit from all words are processed at a time.|$|E
50|$|The 74181 is a <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> {{arithmetic}} {{logic unit}} (ALU), implemented as a 7400 series TTL integrated circuit.

5000|$|<b>Bit</b> <b>slicing,</b> {{although}} not called {{that at the}} time, was also used in computers before large scale integrated circuits (LSI, the predecessor to today's VLSI, or very-large-scale integration circuits). The first bit-sliced machine was EDSAC 2, built at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1956-1958.|$|R
50|$|The {{stream cipher}} part of CSA {{is prone to}} <b>bit</b> <b>slicing,</b> a {{software}} implementation technique that allows decryption of many blocks, or the same block with many different keys, at the same time.

50|$|Occasionally, {{physical}} limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> approach necessary. Instead of processing {{all of a}} long word on one integrated circuit, multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each data word. While this required extra logic to handle, for example, carry and overflow within each slice, {{the result was a}} system that could handle, for example, 32-bit words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four bits each.|$|E
50|$|The Four-Phase Systems AL1 was an 8-bit <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> chip {{containing}} eight registers and an ALU. It {{was designed}} by Lee Boysel in 1969. At the time, it formed part of a nine-chip, 24-bit CPU with three AL1s, but it was later called a microprocessor when, in response to 1990s litigation by Texas Instruments, a demonstration system was constructed where a single AL1 formed part of a courtroom demonstration computer system, together with RAM, ROM, and an input-output device.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{stand-alone}} DSP chips discussed below, most DSP applications were implemented using bit-slice processors. The AMD 2901 bit-slice chip with its family of components was a very popular choice. There were reference designs from AMD, but very often the specifics of a particular design were application specific. These <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> architectures would sometimes include a peripheral multiplier chip. Examples of these multipliers were a series from TRW including the TDC1008 and TDC1010, some of which included an accumulator, providing the requisite multiply-accumulate (MAC) function.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} {{was that}} <b>bit</b> <b>slicing</b> made it economically possible in smaller processors to use bipolar transistors, which switch {{much faster than}} NMOS or CMOS transistors. This allowed for much higher clock rates, where speed was needed; for example DSP functions or matrix transformation, or as in the Xerox Alto, the combination of flexibility and speed, before discrete CPUs were able to deliver that.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bit</b> <b>slicing</b> is a {{technique}} for constructing a processor from modules of processors of smaller bit width, {{for the purpose of}} increasing the word length; in theory to make an arbitrary n-bit CPU. Each of these component modules processes one bit field or [...] "slice" [...] of an operand. The grouped processing components would then have the capability to process the chosen full word-length of a particular software design.|$|R
50|$|Structured VLSI {{design is}} a modular {{methodology}} originated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks {{which can be}} interconnected using wiring by abutment. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal <b>bit</b> <b>slices</b> cells. In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting.|$|R
5000|$|PDP-11/44 - A {{replacement}} for the 11/45 and 11/70, introduced in 1980, that supports optional (though apparently always included) cache, memory, FP-11 floating-point processor (one circuit board, using sixteen AMD Am2901 <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> processors), and commercial instruction set (CIS, two boards). It includes a sophisticated serial console interface and support for 4 MB of physical memory. The design team was managed by John Sofio. This was the last PDP-11 processor to be constructed using discrete logic gates; later models were all microprocessor-based. It was also the last model produced at Digital Equipment Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The {{block cipher}} part {{is harder to}} <b>bit</b> <b>slice,</b> as the S-boxes {{involved}} are too large (8x8) to be efficiently implemented using logical operations, a prerequisite for bit slicing to be more efficient than a regular implementation. However, as all operations are on 8-bit subblocks, the algorithm can be implemented using regular SIMD, or a form of âbyteslicingâ. As most SIMD instruction sets, with a notable exception of AVX2, do not support parallel look-up tables, the S-box lookups are done as in a non-bytesliced implementation, but their integration {{into the rest of}} the algorithm is not hampered markedly by the byteslicing.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} this CPU stems from the early 1970s, when the group of {{engineers}} in Zelenograd's Special Computing Center, led by D.I. Yuditsky, developed their first 16-bit minicomputer, called Elektronika NC-1. This machine, intended to directly compete with SM EVM series, was first released in 1973 and used the <b>bit</b> <b>slice</b> 4-bit 587 CPU, sometimes called the first Soviet microprocessor ever. Its descendants proved popular and were widely used in various control systems and telecom equipment. However, the bit-slice nature of their CPUs made these machines somewhat unwieldy, especially in military applications, {{and the need for}} a single-chip microprocessor was identified.|$|E

This is useful for image compression, robust person identification and efficient transmission. Local entropy-based thresholding is used on the reconstructed image, obtained by combining specific bits in <b>bit</b> plane <b>slicing,</b> for segmentation.

BSAC coding is best performed in the range of 40 kbit/s to 64 kbit/s, though it operates in the range of 16 kbit/s to 64 kbit/s. The AAC-BSAC codec is used in Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) applications.|$|R
