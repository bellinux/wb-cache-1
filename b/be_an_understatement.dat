5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

The Riksbanken {{predicted}} that between 2012 and 2020, the amount of cash in circulation will decline by 20 to 50 percent. The prediction may prove to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> as the decline has exceeded 20 percent from 2012 to 2015. Speculation about Sweden declaring all banknotes and coins invalid at some future date is widespread in the media with Björn Ulvaeus as a celebrity advocate of a cashless Sweden which he believes {{will result in a}} safer society because simple robbery will involve stealing goods that must be fenced.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{summarised}} in Internet Bookwatch as [...] "ragmatic, insightful, rational, iconoclastic, informed and informative". It {{was described as}} [...] "thoughtful and thought-provoking, making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists." [...] In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working {{in the area of}} animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> to say that I disagree with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E

500|$|Recorded {{in three}} months, As Daylight Dies was {{released}} on November 21, 2006 and peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart with 60,000 sales in its first week. [...] "As Daylight Dies" [...] proved {{to be one of}} their biggest albums yet. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 29. Mixed by Dutkiewicz, the album received mostly positive reviews—Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it [...] "a Top Five metal candidate for 2006 for sure". Decibel Magazine contributor Nick Terry said [...] "To call As Daylight Dies addictive would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> That it outdoes its already impressive enough predecessor could almost go without saying". Cosmo Lee of Stylus Magazine commented [...] "the album is astonishingly badly sequenced", though he praised the album as being [...] "less emotionally heavy-handed, and a lot more fun". As of November 27, 2007, As Daylight Dies has sold more than 500,000 units in the US.|$|E
500|$|Mortal Kombat has {{received}} critical acclaim. GameZone's David Sanchez considered describing Mortal Kombat as [...] "a fitting reboot for the series" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> as [...] "while offering plenty of nostalgia" [...] {{the game is}} also [...] "a major step up for the series". Andrew Reiner of Game Informer called it [...] "the best Mortal Kombat yet." [...] According to Mark Waltron of GameSpot, [...] "over-the-top, bloody, and bursting with content, Mortal Kombat {{is a return to}} form for the franchise." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements called it an [...] "amazing" [...] game that [...] "combines the novelty of extreme violence with a great fighting engine." [...] Neidel Crisan of 1UP.com stated it [...] "has simply set the standard for future fighting games to follow." [...] Eurogamer's Matt Edwards was more critical of the game, but added that [...] "to judge Mortal Kombat harshly simply because it isn’t the equal of BlazBlue or Street Fighter IV on a technical level would be unfair to what the game does right." [...] Brett Elston of GamesRadar was also more cautious in his review, stating it is [...] "a successful sequel that both reboots and redeems the wayward series, though it’s not a flawless victory." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News awarded Walton a [...] "Daytime Gold Standard" [...] for her portrayal. He stated: [...] "Walton played each {{scene in}} this “Bette Davis-like” {{emotional}} marathon of a week. How did Walton do it? With aplomb and greatness." [...] The following year, when Jill opened her own nail salon, Mike Jubinville, also of Zap2it, {{noted that the}} character had [...] "stepped into a time warp". Prior to being paired with Colin, Nekeeta Borden wrote that, [...] "Jill Foster Abbott (cough, cough) Fenmore’s (Jess Walton) Jimmy Choos must have crossed paths with a black cat, because she can’t find a good man to bless her somewhat shriveled heart." [...] Of the character's possible pairing with Colin, she added: [...] "I, for one, hope that Maria Arena Bell and Co. keep Colin in Genoa City and surprise us all by making him a dream lover for Jill. She is a multidimensional character {{with a lot of}} fire, and a great capacity to be soft and vulnerable. Goodness knows she’s been through the ringer. Can Jill find love with Colin, or will her newest dalliance lead to heartbreak?" [...] In 2013, Giddens wrote of Walton's portrayal throughout her run, stating: [...] "Unlike most soap opera recasts, where success or failure depends on chemistry with an opposite sex romantic lead, newcomer Jess Walton would sink or swim, based on her ability to connect with fellow female powerhouse Jeanne Cooper, who played Jill's bitter rival Katherine [...] "Kay" [...] Chancellor." [...] He also commended Walton and Cooper's portrayal of their characters' rivalry, [...] "To say Walton swam alongside Cooper would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> The two women did a backstroke even Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps would have to admire, during their 26 years as acting partners," [...] he wrote.|$|E
50|$|Many {{historians have}} {{questioned}} {{the authenticity of the}} NKVD report, stating that it <b>was</b> probably <b>a</b> far <b>understatement,</b> noting also that the figure produced by Khruschev in 1956 contradicts Beria's figure by at least 96,000 people (and stating that even Khrushchev's could have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> considering his position).|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} widespread critical acclaim, with some calling {{it one of}} the greatest heartbreaking music videos of all time.

500|$|... "Rosemary's Baby" [...] {{was named}} {{as one of}} the [...] "Top 11 TV Episodes of 2007" [...] by UGO, and ranked thirteenth on The Futon Critics list of [...] "the 50 Best Episodes of 2007"; both citing the Baldwin and Morgan therapy scene as the reason. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{declared}} it as [...] "one of 30 Rock's best episodes ever" [...] He praised Carrie Fisher's guest appearance, but felt that Baldwin's role-playing during Morgan's therapy session stole the show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that even though the plot was [...] "insane", the episode still managed [...] "to have a heart at its core". Sassone called the therapy scene [...] "one of the funniest scenes ... on TV this season". Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode has [...] "great storylines to great guest stars", making it [...] "one of the best the series has produced so far". Canning called the therapy scene [...] "the best moment of the episode". [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] " [...] Between Carrie Fisher's delightfully bonkers guest role and Jack Donaghy's hijacking of Tracy Jordan's therapy session, this 2007 episode was so wrong. And so good." [...] In 2016 Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker described the episode as [...] "the keys-to-all-mythologies of female comedy", which A. O. Scott of The New York Times said [...] "may actually <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of second-wave feminism, and Liz's ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence". Scott added that given Lemon's depiction as a Star Wars fan, [...] "the casting of Ms. Fisher ... adds about 12 dimensions of meta".|$|E
2500|$|Wisden {{described}} Fred Trueman as [...] "probably {{the greatest}} fast bowler England has produced".

2500|$|According to Josephus, Vespasian encamped {{with three}} Roman legions in Sennabris. He {{describes}} it as a [...] "village," [...] but given {{the size of the}} Roman force stationed there, this seems to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> A fort was constructed at this time, probably by the builders of the Sixth Legion, as well as a road connecting Tiberias to Sennabris, via Bethsaida and Hippos.|$|E

50|$|The army of William IX on the Crusade of 1101 {{was formed}} by William IX “the Troubador,” Duke of Aquitaine, {{to fight in the}} minor Crusade of 1101.

Defeated, he reached Antioch with only six companions still alive.|$|R
2500|$|Dolphy was posthumously {{inducted}} into the Down Beat magazine Hall of Fame in 1964. John Coltrane paid tribute to Dolphy in an interview: [...] "Whatever I'd say would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> I can only say my life was made much better by knowing him. He {{was one of the}} greatest people I've ever known, as a man, a friend, and a musician." [...] Dolphy's mother, Sadie, who had fond memories of her son practicing in the studio in the backyard of their house, gave instruments that Dolphy had bought in France but never played to Coltrane, who subsequently played the flute and bass clarinet on several albums before his own death in 1967.|$|E

50|$|To {{say that}} Glenn Roberts and his six {{brothers}} {{were born to}} humble beginnings, would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> Few today could visualize sweeping snow out of every room the next morning after a snowfall.

5000|$|Dread Central {{gave the}} movie 4 stars and wrote that [...] "Be My Cat takes meta-filmmaking to mind-bending levels and plays out like an arthouse snuff film. Simply calling it unique <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> What {{we have here}} is {{potentially}} revolutionary and, like the most impactful examples of uncompromising art, potentially dangerous.

50|$|Examples: “not too bad” for “very good” <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> {{as well as}} {{a double}} {{negative}} statement that confirms a positive idea by negating the opposite.
