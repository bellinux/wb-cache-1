40|$|Genomic {{breeding}} values (GEBVs) predicted from dense marker {{panels are}} now {{being used in the}} dairy industry <b>for</b> <b>bull</b> selection. However the cost of genotyping these dense marker panels is too high to justify genomic selection for dairy cows, beef <b>bulls</b> and rams <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> and wool production. However if potential selection candidates were genotyped for a standard panel of less expensive sparse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and key ancestors within their breed were genotyped for a dense panel of markers, {{it would be possible to}} trace the chromosome segments in the selection candidates back to the key ancestors and thus infer their genotypes at all markers assayed on the key ancestors. In this way genomic selection could be practiced using a large number of markers while the cost of genotyping was kept low by the widespread use of a standard SNP chip...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{purpose was}} to apply a {{simplified}} mixed model BLUP for estimating bulls' breeding value <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> production in terms of weight daily gain and establish their hierarchy, Also, it aimed to compare the bulls' ranging obtained by a simplified BLUP mixed model with their hierarchy set up by contemporary comparison. A sample of 1, 705 half sibs steers, offspring of 106 Friesian bulls were used as biological material. Bulls' breeding value varied between + 244. 5 g <b>for</b> the best <b>bull</b> and - 204. 7 g <b>for</b> the <b>bull</b> with the weakest records. A number of 57 bulls (53. 77 %) registered positive breeding values. The accuracy of the breeding value estimation varied between 80, the highest precision, in case of the bull number 21 and 53, the lowest precision, in case of the bull number 38. A number of 7 bulls of the total of 57 with a positive breeding value were situated aproximately on the same positions at a difference of 0 to 1 points on the both lists established by BLUP and contemporary comparison. As a conclusion, BLUP could be largely and easily applied in <b>bull</b> evaluation <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> production traits in term of weight daily gain, considered the key parameter during the fattening period and its precision is very high, a guarantee that the bulls' hierarchy is a correct one. If a farmer would chose a high breeding value bull from a catalogue, he could be sure of the improvement of beef production by genetic gain...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} genetic merit <b>for</b> milk and <b>meat</b> production using a sample of 16 Romanian Friesian bulls and a BLUP simplified model as well as the contemporary comparison method. The bulls' 730 daughters (half-sisters) registered during the 305 days first lactation 3, 034. 89 kg milk with 22. 86 % variation coefficient, 3. 79 % fat with 6. 06 % variation and 115. 72 kg fat with 23. 49 % variation. The 249 sons (half-brothers) recorded 138. 05 kg atthe age of 6 months with 19. 31 % variation coefficient, 293. 41 kg at the age of 12 months with 4. 33 % variation, and 881. 97 g/day daily gain with 3. 14 % variation. The heritability was 0. 505 for milk yield, 0. 741 for fat %, 0. 567 for milk fat, 0. 524 for the weight at 6 months, 0. 642 for the weight at 12 months and 0. 372 for daily gain. The genotypic correlations have been - 0. 245 between milk yield and fat % and 0. 465 between milk and fat yield, - 0. 287 between the weight at 6 months and 12 months and 0. 850 between the weight at 12 months and daily gain. Breeding value varied from 637. 6 and - 68. 1 for milk yield and between 26. 26 and - 2. 07 for milk fat. The breeding value precision ranged between 92 and 58 in case of milk traits. Breeding value varied between 48. 6 and - 27. 8 for the weight at 12 months and between 168. 2 and 2. 2. for daily gain. The accuracy of the breeding value <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> traits ranged between 76 and 60. Rank correlations between <b>bull</b> ranking <b>for</b> milk traits were 0. 377 ** between milk fat and fat %, 0. 974 ** between milk yield and fat yield. Rank correlations between <b>bull</b> ranking <b>for</b> <b>meat</b> traits were 0. 766 ** between the weight at 6 months and at 12 months and 0. 847 ** between the weight at 12 months and daily gain. The rank correlation between bull hierarchy by BLUP and contemporary comparison was 0. 563 significantly for P= 0. 05 and P= 0. 01. As a conclusion, the high accuracy of BLUP model recommends it to be used for breeding value assessment. The position occupied by bulls in their ranking by BLUP was similar in some cases with the one set up by contemporary comparison. Some Friesian bulls could improve both milk and meat production but most of them have the best impact on the growth of milk yield...|$|R
40|$|The North American buffalo (Bison bison) {{has survived}} near {{extinction}} {{to become a}} commodity (meat, hides, and hair) in a consumer-driven market. Since this is a growth industry, primarily young <b>bulls</b> are slaughtered <b>for</b> <b>meat,</b> while most females are used to build the herd. Bison meat is highly palatable, and previous research showed that grain-finished bison meat is low in fat and high in protein. However, bison may be grain- or grass-finished. In this study we found few differences in nutrient content of the meat between grain- or grass-finished bison. Grass-finished animals had a little more moisture (75. 9 vs. 74. 6 %) and less fat (1. 7 vs. 2. 2 %). The largest difference was in fatty acid profiles (expressed as percentages of total fat), with grass-finished bison containing on average 5 % more saturated fatty acids, 6 % more polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 11 % less monosaturated fatty acids than meat from grain-finished bison. Bison meat is low in sodium. It is also {{an excellent source of}} phosphorus, zinc, selenium, and vitamin B 12, as well as, iron, niacin, vitamin B 6, and other minerals and vitamins. In summary, bison meat is a low-fat, low-sodium, nutrient-dense food, making it a nutritious food, whether it is grain- or grass-finished...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen bulls and {{an equal}} number of heifers of western Baggara cattle of similar average initial body weight were used to study their meat {{production}} potential. Bulls and heifers were kept separate for a period of 112 days during which they were fed ad libitum a complete diet. Average daily DMI of bulls (6. 63 Kg) was higher than that of heifers (6. 27 Kg) yet the difference was not significant. Average daily weight gain of bulls (1. 01 Kg) was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than that of heifers (0. 62 Kg). Average feed conversion ratio of bulls (6. 62) was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than that of heifers (10. 21). Average feed intake (% of body weight) of bulls (3. 07) was significantly (P< 0. 01) lower than that of heifers (3. 48). When western Baggara bulls and heifers were compared at different feeding period (28, 56, 84 and 112 days) average daily feed intake, DMI, daily live weight gain and feed conversion efficiency were consistently higher <b>for</b> <b>bulls</b> than heifers. Live weight gain of at least 1. 0 kg/day was sustained by western Baggara bulls, throughout the experimental feeding period. However, live weight gain of 1. 0 Kg could be maintained by heifers only for 28 days of feeding. 11 Of the selected body measurements, neck length and heart girth were significantly (P< 0. 05) more developed in bulls than in heifers. Height at wither, height at hip, body length, back length and chest depth were more developed in bulls than in heifers, yet the differences were not significant. On the other hand circumference of barrel and hip width were more developed in heifers than in bulls, yet the differences were not significant. Carcass weight of bulls was significantly (P< 0. 001) heavier than that of heifers but heifers dressed out consistently higher than bulls, though the differences were not significant. Carcass muscle weight proportion of bulls (66. 92 %) was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than that of heifers (59. 53 %) while carcass fat proportion of heifers (18. 17 %) was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than that of bulls (11. 8 %). Bone weight as proportion of carcass weight of bulls (16. 84 %) was higher than that of heifers (16. 5 %), yet not significantly different. L. dorsi muscle area of bulls (60. 89 cm 2) was significantly (P< 0. 05) larger than that of heifers (47. 72 cm 2) whereas back fat of heifers carcass (11. 0 mm) was significantly (P< 0. 05) thicker than that of bulls (8. 0 mm). Forequarters weight % of carcass weight was significantly (P< 0. 05) greater <b>for</b> <b>bulls</b> (50. 51) than that of heifers (48. 59) whereas hindquarters weight % of carcass weight of heifers (51. 18) was significantly (P< 0. 05) greater than that of bulls. Percent primal cuts weight of carcass weight of heifers (43. 73) was higher than that of bulls (42. 75), yet the difference was 12 not significant, while carcass percent minor cuts (low priced) weight was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher <b>for</b> <b>bulls</b> (54. 60) than that of heifers (52. 77). Cooking loss % of bulls meat (33. 21) was significantly (P< 0. 001) lower than that of heifers (37. 74) while water-holding capacity of heifers meat was significantly (P< 0. 01) higher than that of bulls.
