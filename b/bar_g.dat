40|$|A {{non-linear}} structure preserving matrix method for the computation of a structured low rank approximation S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar) of the Sylvester resultant matrix S(f, g) of two inexact polynomials f = f(y) and g = g(y) is considered in this paper. It is shown that considerably improved results are obtained when f (y) and g(y) are processed {{prior to the}} computation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar), and that these preprocessing operations introduce two parameters. These parameters can either be held constant during the computation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar), {{which leads to a}} linear structure preserving matrix method, or they can be incremented during the computation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar), which leads to a {{non-linear structure}} preserving matrix method. It is shown that the non-linear method yields a better structured low rank approximation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar) and that the assignment of f (y) and g(y) is important because S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar) may be a good structured low rank approximation of S(f, g), but S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over bar) may be a poor structured low rank approximation of S (g f) because its numerical rank is not defined. Examples that illustrate the differences between the linear and non-linear structure preserving matrix methods, and the importance of the assignment off (y) and g(y), are shown. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The Wairakei Geothermal Power Complex is {{situated}} five kilometers north of Lake Taupo in the North Island of New Zealand. The Wairakei system consists basically {{of a highly}} permeable hot water aquifer contained within almost impermeable boundaries. Steam is produced from the hot fluid in a three-stage flash process. Initially the first stage produced steam at 13. 8 <b>bar</b> <b>g</b> (200 psig) but due to declining field pressure this has been progressively reduced to 8. 3 <b>bar</b> <b>g</b> (120 psig) by mid- 1980. The second stage produces steam at 5. 5 <b>bar</b> <b>g</b> (80 psig). In 1972 the third stage flashing facilities were installed to utilize the otherwise waste saturated water from the second stage. This produces steam at 1. 72 <b>bar</b> <b>g</b> (25 psig). The first machine was synchronized to the national grid on 15 November 1958 and the last machine in October 1964. Development of the power complex was in two stages and has a total installed capacity of 192 MWe. The final arrangement of equipment is shown in Figure la. The unusual complexity of small machines in the Stage I development {{is a result of}} the initial concept containing a heavy water distillation plant. This plant, however, was stopped early in the project, but not before manufacturing contracts had been let.

For breasts with t < 4 cm, a general good performance was obtained with the W anode combined with 60 mu m of the Mo filter at 24 - 25 kVp, while 60 mu m of the Pd filter provided a general good performance at 24 - 26 kVp for t = 4 cm, and at 28 - 30 and 29 - 31 kVp for t = 6 and 8 cm, respectively...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a highly efficient architecture for the hardware implementation of context-free grammar (CFG) parsers. Its efficiency stems from an innovative combinatorial circuit that implements the fundamental operation of Earley's parsing algorithm in time complexity O(log(2) vertical <b>bar</b> <b>G</b> vertical bar). where vertical <b>bar</b> <b>G</b> vertical bar {{is the size}} of the CFG. Using this hardware architecture in a template form. we have developed an automated synthesis tool that, given the specification of an arbitrary CFG. generates the HDL (Hardware Design Language) synthesizable source code of the hardware parser for the given grammar. The generated source has been simulated for validation, synthesized and tested on a Xilinx FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) board. Our method increases the performance by a factor of one to two orders of magnitude, compared to previous hardware implementations. {{depending on the size of}} the grammar and the input string length. The speedup. compared to the pure software implementation. varies from two orders of magnitude for toy-scale grammars to six orders of magnitude for large real life grammars. This makes it particularly appealing for applications where (syntactic) pattern recognition response is a crucial aspect. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
