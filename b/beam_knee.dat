40|$|SummaryObjectiveRecent {{studies using}} various {{standardized}} radiographic acquisition techniques {{have demonstrated the}} necessity of reproducible radioanatomic alignment of the knee to assure precise measurements of medial tibiofemoral joint space width (JSW). The objective {{of the present study}} was to characterize the longitudinal performance of several acquisition techniques with respect to long-term reproducibility of positioning of the knee, and the impact of changes in positioning on the rate and variability of joint space narrowing (JSN). MethodsEighty subjects were randomly selected from each of three cohorts followed in recent studies of the radiographic progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA) : the Health ABC study (paired fixed-flexion [FF] radiographs taken at a 36 -month interval); the Glucosamine Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) (paired metatarsophalangeal [MTP] radiographs obtained at a 12 -month interval), and a randomized clinical trial of doxycycline (fluoroscopically assisted semiflexed anteroposterior (AP) radiographs taken at a 16 -month interval). Manual measurements were obtained from each radiograph to represent markers of radioanatomic positioning of the knee (alignment of the medial tibial plateau and X-ray <b>beam,</b> <b>knee</b> rotation, femorotibial angle) and to evaluate minimum JSW (mJSW) in the medial tibiofemoral compartment. The effects on the mean annualized rate of JSN and on the variability of that rate of highly reproduced vs variable positioning of the knee in serial radiographs were evaluated. ResultsParallel or near-parallel alignment was achieved significantly more frequently with the fluoroscopically guided positioning used in the semiflexed AP protocol than with either the non-fluoroscopic FF or MTP protocol (68 % vs 14 % for both FF and MTP protocols when measured at the midpoint of the medial compartment; 75 % vs 26 % and 34 % for the FF and MTP protocols, respectively, when measured at the site of mJSW; P< 0. 001 for each). Knee rotation was reproduced more frequently in semiflexed AP radiographs than in FF radiographs (66 % vs 45 %, P< 0. 01). In contrast, the FF technique yielded a greater proportion of paired radiographs in which the femorotibial angle was accurately reproduced than the semiflexed AP or MTP protocol (78 % vs 59 % and 56 %, respectively, P< 0. 01 for each). Notably, only paired radiographs with parallel or near-parallel alignment exhibited a mean rate of JSN (±SD) in the OA knee that was more rapid and less variable than that measured in all knees (0. 186 ± 0. 274 mm/year, standardized response to mean [SRM]= 0. 68 vs 0. 128 ± 0. 291 mm/year, SRM= 0. 44). ConclusionThis study confirms the importance of parallel radioanatomic alignment of the anterior and posterior margins of the medial tibial plateau in detecting JSN in subjects with knee OA. The use of radiographic methods that assure parallel alignment during serial X-ray examinations will permit the design of more efficient studies of biomarkers of OA progression and of structure modification in knee OA...|$|E

50|$|The {{schooner}} will be {{a perfect}} masterpiece of workmanship and beauty. The expense to us will be great, {{but there will be}} the satisfaction of her being strong and very durable. Her floor-timbers, keel, keel-son, stem and lower futtocks are oak. The transom, stern-post, upper futtocks, top-timbers, <b>beams</b> and <b>knees</b> are all red cedar. She will carry 350 barrels.|$|R
60|$|It did {{so after}} he had scraped off some {{smoldering}} wick and stuck it on a massive oak knee. The wrecked bulwarks broke the wind, for only draughts came down, and the light spread about the forecastle. There was some sand in the vessel's bottom, and the floor and ceilings had gone. Nothing remained but the heavy timbers and the planks bolted fast to them. A few shrimps sped {{up and down a}} pool and a small crab that made a crackling noise crawled into a corner. Andrew examined the <b>beams</b> and <b>knees</b> with interest.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of the}} {{exterior}} detailing, Fournier selected the Craftsman style, with its broad, sloping roof pierced by shed dormers. He also created wide, unenclosed eaves, exposed rafter tails, and exposed roof <b>beams</b> supported by <b>knee</b> braces. With a Craftsman sense of economy, he eliminated the vestibule. Instead a sheltered partial-width front porch was built. Fournier used the Craftsman device of an elevated dining room window grouping with space under the windows for closets.|$|R

[...] Then while working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore, Agamemnon struck an uncharted shoal. On 17 June her crew abandoned Agamemnon. Captain Jonas rose, of Agamemnon testified at his court martial that she could have been gotten off had so many <b>knees,</b> <b>beams,</b> and timbers been decayed; furthermore, rotten planking giving way had caused the flooding that doomed her.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new coincidence experiment {{designed to improve}} understanding of {{the composition of the}} primary cosmic-ray <b>beam</b> around the <b>knee</b> of the spectrum. The experiment consists of an air shower array on the surface (SPASE 2), which works in coincidence with an array of air- Cerenkov detectors (VULCAN), and the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) deep in the ice. The experiment must cover the energy range from 10 14 eV to 3 Θ 10 16 eV to overlap with direct measurements at lower energy and encompass the regions of the knee and beyond in the cosmic ray spectrum. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} {{of a model}} solar atmosphere to heating by an electron beam has been studied for electron beam flux spectra which are power laws with low-energy 'knees' (rising linearly with time to a peak at 30 s and then falling linearly to 0 at 60 s) ranging from 10 to 20 keV. The results indicate that high peak electron <b>beam</b> fluxes, low-energy <b>knees,</b> and larger spectral indices all move the atmospheric response toward greater enhancements of the parameters in the coronal regions of the atmosphere. Coronal responses can thus {{be used as a}} diagnostic of the parameters of the electron beam...|$|R
50|$|The Nellie Crockett is a wooden, plank-on-frame freightboat, {{documented}} measuring 61.6 ft long, 20.33 ft on {{the beam}} and 6.42 ft in draft (18.8 m × 6.20 m × 1.96 m). She measures 52 tons gross and 35 tons net. Her wide beam and moderate draft were useful in her business of buying, loading and transporting oysters {{in the shallow}} waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The hull is built using wood frames made from the natural crooks of tree limbs and roots. It is planked with 3.5 in pine. The deck planking is laid fore-and-aft over deck <b>beams</b> on hanging <b>knees.</b> A partially watertight bulkhead {{is located in the}} forecastle.|$|R
5000|$|She was berthed at South Lake Union Park in Seattle {{adjacent}} to the Center for Wooden Boats. She was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Heritage Register, and the vessel was an official city landmark. [...] However, after efforts to restore the decaying ship failed, she was dismantled in March 2009. After conferring with many experts in the maritime heritage field, locally and across the nation, Northwest Seaport created a plan to preserve key artifacts from the vessel. Graduate Students from East Carolina University's graduate program in nautical archaeology documented the Wawona during the Wooden Boat Festival on 4-6 July 2008. In March 2009, the vessel was carefully deconstructed in a local shipyard and artifacts (including wooden <b>knees,</b> <b>beams,</b> and paneling) removed for storage and later display in on-land exhibits and memorials. Some parts of the Wawona were donated to be used on the C.A. Thayer in San Francisco.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework is}} developed which integrates the reliability concept into topology optimization to solve reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) problems under uncertainty. Two typical methodologies {{have been presented}} and implemented, including the performance measure approach (PMA) and the sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA). To enhance the computational efficiency of reliability analysis, stochastic response surface method (SRSM) is applied to approximate the true limit state function {{with respect to the}} normalized random variables, combined with the reasonable design of experiments generated by sparse grid design, which was proven to be an effective and special discretization technique. The uncertainties such as material property and external loads are considered on three numerical examples: a cantilever <b>beam,</b> a loaded <b>knee</b> structure, and a heat conduction problem. Monte-Carlo simulations are also performed to verify the accuracy of the failure probabilities computed by the proposed approach. Based on the results, it is demonstrated that application of SRSM with SGD can produce an efficient reliability analysis in RBTO which enables a more reliable design than that obtained by DTO. It is also found that, under identical accuracy, SORA is superior to PMA in view of computational efficiency...|$|R
40|$|An in vivo boron- 10 {{screening}} {{technique was}} developed to analyze the boron biodistribution in a rabbit knee for the pre-screening of compounds for Boron Neutron Capture Synovectomy (BNCS). Three approaches were investigated: emission computed tomography (ECT), transmission computed tomography (TCT) and in vivo prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (IVPGNAA). Each was first studied using simulation-generated projection data. Experimental data collection systems were then constructed for TCT and IVPGNAA, and phantom experiments were conducted at the MIT Research Reactor (MITR) to verify simulation results. While TCT was predicted to have superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, temporal resolution and boron quantification, IVPGNAA was chosen for further development given the readily available neutron sources at the MITR. Assuming an 8. 5 x 105 cm- 2 s- 1 incident neutron flux, a 3. 5 mmx 20 mm <b>beam,</b> and a <b>knee</b> injection of 1. 05 mg 10 B, one projection data set can be collected within 12 minutes, for reconstruction of relative 10 B distribution in eight 40 mm 2 regions. The estimated uncertainty associated with reconstructed results, assuming a regional 2000 ppm concentration, is [approx. ] 25 %. Phantom experiments demonstrated the overall feasibility of IVPGNAA {{as a means of}} conveniently evaluating spatial and temporal characteristics of 10 B in a rabbit knee. (cont.) Animal experiments were then conducted at the MITR using 3. 5 kg anesthetized arthritic rabbits. Three boronated compounds were investigated, each with widely different in vivo spatial and temporal characteristics, as determined previously via dissection studies. Good agreement in egression behavior between IVPGNAA predictions and dissection study results was found for 2 compounds. The third compound was not detectable under experimental conditions, suggesting the possibility that the compound was not taken up by the synovium. This finding was consistent with the dissection study results. IVPGNAA is an invaluable tool for early rejection of compounds with poor characteristics, and can provide guidance for dissection studies of promising compounds. by Xuping Zhu. Thesis (Ph. D.)
