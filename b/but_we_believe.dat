2500|$|Michael Behe, a {{biologist}} at Lehigh University and an advocate of intelligent design, felt that by [...] "talking on {{about the age of}} the Earth [...] than on the elegance and complexities of life", both Ham and Nye lost the debate. Metropolitan Nicholas of the Greek Orthodox Church, who was trained as a scientist before taking holy orders, also criticized both Nye's and Ham's approach to the debate, saying that [...] "Research that is done to challenge God, has the disease of prejudice. Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is time to find out about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Taylor Coleridge {{continues}} {{by explaining}} the {{negative aspects of}} such a concept: [...] "Though the tenderness and beauty resulting from this opinion be to us a rich overpayment for the occasional strainings and refinements of sentiment to which it has given birth, it has yet often served to make the author ridiculous in common eyes, in that it has led him to state his own fairy dreams as the true interpretation and import of the looks and movements of children, as being even really in their minds." [...] In a February 1821 review for the British Critic, John Taylor Coleridge attacked the poem again for a heretical view found {{in the notion of}} pre-existence and how it reappeared in Wordsworth's poem [...] "On an Extraordinary Evening of Splendour and Beauty". However, he does claim that the passage of the ode containing the idea is [...] "a passage of exquisite poetry" [...] and that [...] "A more poetical theory of human nature cannot well be devised, and if the subject were one, upon which error was safe, we should forbear to examine it closely, and yield to the delight we have often received from it in the ode from which the last extract [...] is made." [...] He was to continue: [...] "If, therefore, we had met the doctrine in any poet but Mr. Wordsworth, we should have said nothing; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> him to be one not willing to promulgate error, even in poetry, indeed it is manifest that he makes his poetry subservient to his philosophy; and this particular notion is so mixed up by him with others, in which it is impossible to suppose him otherwise than serious; that we are constrained to take it for his real and sober belief." ...|$|E
