25|$|Graeme Le Saux, an England {{international}} left-back, endured homophobic taunts {{despite being}} married with children. The rumours allegedly began {{because of his}} “unladdish hobbies” which included antique collecting, and his university background. He later admitted he had considered quitting the game because of the abuse and the humiliation he felt. One example of the public abuse he suffered came in a Premier League match between Chelsea and Liverpool on 27 February 1999, Le Saux became involved in a running series of taunts with Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler. With Le Saux preparing to take a free kick, Fowler repeatedly <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> pointed his backside in the Chelsea player's direction. Despite the obvious taunts, Le Saux, who refused to take the free kick, was booked for delay of play. Unseen by the match officials, Le Saux later struck Fowler {{on the edge of}} the Chelsea penalty area. Both were later charged with misconduct by the FA.|$|E
500|$|The white pear- or egg-shaped {{fruit body}} of C.sculpta may be [...] tall by [...] wide. The outer layer of tissue, {{known as the}} exoperidium, is covered on the outer surface with {{distinctive}} long, pointed, pyramid-shaped warts, either erect or <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> sometimes connected at the tip with other warts. The warts bear parallel horizontal lines towards the base. Mycologist David Arora opined that C.sculpta resembled [...] "a cross between a geodesic dome and a giant glob of meringue." [...] In age, the peridium sloughs off and exposes a brownish spore mass. The interior of the puffball, the gleba, is firm and yellowish-white when young, but gradually becomes powdery and deep olive-brown as it matures.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous images of the event was the live {{broadcast}} of Hoy Mismo, a news program in the Televisa television network, when the earthquake struck. In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were María Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing {{the underside of the}} desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped no one could see how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating [...] "...it's still shaking a little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will wait just a second so we can keep talking." [...] Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Niños Héroes and Dr. Río de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores.|$|E
