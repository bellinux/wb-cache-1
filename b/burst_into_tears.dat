5|$|As a child, Olga was {{described}} as a simple and chubby little girl with a broad face and big blue eyes. Unlike her younger sister, Vera, she had a calm temperament, but she was also extremely shy. For example, when interrogated by her tutors during lessons, she <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> and ran from the classroom.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Negron is the {{defendant}} {{in a court}} proceeding, facing {{a life sentence for}} his killing of Rodolfo. He is successfully defended by a powerful executive attorney acting on behalf of a unknown wealthy man.

5|$|Not {{only was}} Imelda good with people, {{she was also}} a skilled {{mediator}} who mended broken relationships that occurred with Marcos.

5|$|Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians {{not only}} forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was {{reinstated}} {{in command of}} the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the levers of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, Paralus and Xanthippus, in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears,</b> and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and {{her mother}} {{received}} him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance {{in the middle of}} December out of fear that Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary {{and her mother}}, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> because of their ill fate.|$|E

5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{powers as}} a preacher {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.|$|E
25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. Abraham gave Hagar bread and water then sent {{them into the}} {{wilderness}} of Beersheba.

25|$|In their match, Lenglen {{lost the}} first set 6–2 {{and just as the}} second set got underway, she began {{coughing}} and <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears,</b> unable to continue. The crowd jeered her as she walked off the court, and the American press severely criticised her. This worsened when, under doctor's orders after it was confirmed that she was afflicted with whooping cough, she cancelled her exhibition match. Unaccustomed to such treatment, a devastated Lenglen went home.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the retreat, Mullá Husayn {{received}} a letter which appeared to have been written by Siyyid Kázim before his death; while his companions assumed that the letter contained an appointment from Siyyid Kázim naming Mullá Husayn as his successor, it contained only veiled instructions for the coming journey. Mullá Husayn is reported to have publicly <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> upon reading the posthumous instructions of Siyyid Kázim and realizing the enormity and uncertainty to his task.|$|E

25|$|On 29 November, at {{the request}} of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the {{psychiatrist}} who had written the 1985 psychological profile of the then-unknown killer, was invited to assist in the questioning of the suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo. Within two hours, Chikatilo <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.|$|E
25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread {{and water and}} sent them away. The two wandered in the {{wilderness}} of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears.</b> After God heard the boy's voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|After Michael Murphy fisted a {{point with}} eight minutes remaining, only {{narrowly}} missing the Mayo goal, photographers surrounded Donegal manager Jim McGuinness {{and his assistant}} Rory Gallagher. Donegal led the entire game. As referee Maurice Deegan blew the final whistle, Karl Lacey caught the ball and threw it into the crowd. Mayo had lost their sixth consecutive All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, a run stretching back to 1989. Mark McHugh ran to embrace his father Martin, {{who was on the}} sideline as a pundit for the BBC's television coverage. Martin <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears.</b> The emotional moment became one of the iconic images of the victory. From Chicago to Dubai fans of the winning team celebrated.|$|E

25|$|Points {{were rare}} during this time; Pedro Lamy scored his {{one and only}} point in Formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1995 Australian Grand Prix; this result was {{followed}} by a long barren spell until Marc Gené finished 6th in the 1999 European Grand Prix. That same race, Luca Badoer had been running fourth until his gearbox failed with 13 laps to go, at which point the Italian <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> next to his stricken car. Other Minardi drivers also came close to scoring points, including Shinji Nakano who finished 7th at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix and Esteban Tuero, who finished 8th at the 1998 San Marino Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Show {{returned}} at the 2001 Royal Rumble, but {{was eliminated}} by The Rock. Angered by his quick elimination, Wight proceeded to chokeslam The Rock through the broadcast table {{before leaving the}} arena. He then began competing for the WWF Hardcore Championship, which he lost to Kane in a Triple Threat match that also included Raven at WrestleMania X-Seven. Throughout The Invasion, Big Show reverted to being a face and remained loyal to the WWF. He faced Shane McMahon, the on-screen owner of WCW, in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash and was defeated following interference from Test. Following an unscripted backstage interview, Big Show <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> and fled from the arena. Show was {{also part of the}} victorious Team WWF at Survivor Series, though he was the first man eliminated.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{disorder}} {{of the allied}} column was soon checked as each battalion rallied around its colours; the compact formation was restored, and the British and Hanoverians accomplished their retreat in good order. Attacked from three sides the allies performed a fighting withdrawal – the rearguard of the column facing about at measured intervals to fire at their pursuers. Ligonier made provisions for covering the retreat. Skelton's (32nd) and Cholmondeley's (34th) formed the rearguard, the Buffs were ordered to hold the churchyard, while hedges and ravines were lined with the Black Watch. On either flank the British cavalry closed in to form a screen for the infantry – the Royal Horse Guards to the fore especially distinguished themselves. The army reformed behind Vezon, before retreating on Ath. Upon reaching the safety of Ath, Cumberland <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>tears</b> over his disappointment at the defeat and the huge number of lives the defeat cost.|$|E
