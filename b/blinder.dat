They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the <b>Blinder,</b> a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} common options {{for dealing with}} {{a player in the}} <b>blinds</b> who must also pay the kill <b>blind.</b> First, they may pay only the kill <b>blind</b> and their {{scheduled}} <b>blind</b> is not posted.

Lastly, the player may post their kill <b>blind</b> in this hand, and then [...] "owe" [...] their scheduled <b>blind</b> in the next hand when they no longer have to post the kill <b>blind,</b> similar to the moving button rule of <b>blinds</b> busting out. This can cause a shifting of all <b>blinds</b> to a player who triggered a kill while [...] "under the gun"; the player would first post the kill <b>blind</b> when the big <b>blind</b> was due, then in the next hand (assuming they didn't have to pay the kill <b>blind</b> again) they would pay their big <b>blind</b> instead of the small <b>blind</b> that is now due. On the third hand, with the player on the button, the small <b>blind</b> would be paid and the player is now [...] "caught up".|$|R

2500|$|The {{expression}} {{derives from}} the 1979 trial of Dan White, a former San Francisco police officer and firefighter, and until just before the crime, a city district supervisor. [...] On November 27, 1978, White assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk. At the trial, psychiatrist Martin <b>Blinder</b> testified that White had been depressed {{at the time of}} the crime, and pointed to several behavioral changes indicating White's depression: he had quit his job; he shunned his wife; and although normally clean-cut, he had become slovenly in appearance. Furthermore, White had previously been a fitness fanatic and health food advocate, but had begun consuming junk food and sugar-laden soft drinks like Coca-Cola. [...] As an incidental note, <b>Blinder</b> mentioned theories that elements of diet could worsen existing mood swings. [...] Another psychiatrist, George Solomon, testified that White had [...] "exploded" [...] and was [...] "sort of on automatic pilot" [...] {{at the time of the}} killings. The fact that White had killed Moscone and Milk was not challenged, but– in part because of the testimony from <b>Blinder</b> and other psychiatrists– the defense successfully convinced the jury that White's capacity for rational thought had been diminished; the jurors found White incapable of the premeditation required for a murder conviction, and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter. Public protests over the verdict led to the White Night Riots.|$|E
