5|$|On 30 June 2011, Edinburgh Council {{voted to}} {{continue}} the line between Edinburgh Airport and St Andrew Square. Costs rose to an estimated £770m, leaving the council with a shortfall of more than £200m. The option to scrap the project was considered, but rejected. On 25 August 2011, the council voted to cut the line to run between the airport and Haymarket, reducing the expected cost to £715m. A week later, after the Scottish Government threatened to withhold £72 million of funding, the council reversed its decision, restoring the terminus at St Andrew Square. On 29 November 2011 {{it was announced that}} the eastern terminus would be at York Place instead of St Andrew Square; the intention had been to build the tracks to a reversing point at York Place (without a stop for passengers). Extending passenger services from St Andrew Square to York Place would enable Broughton Street, Picardy Place and the surrounding area to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> at comparatively little additional cost.|$|E
5|$|Orélie-Antoine {{felt that}} the {{indigenous}} peoples would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader, and was accordingly elected {{by a group of}} Mapuche loncos (chieftains) to be their king. He made efforts to gain international recognition, and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie-Antoine and his kingdom, at least initially, and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucanía, a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Orélie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. The current pretender, Prince Antoine IV, lives in France. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne, even though a few Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E

5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

25|$|While {{developing}} a new disruptive camouflage in the 2000, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) evaluated over 100 existing patterns, and judged Rhodesian Brushstroke {{to be one of}} the three best schemes previously developed, along with CADPAT and tigerstripe. None of the candidates were adopted because there was some indication that Marines would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by something more distinctive than a preexisting design. The MARPAT digital camouflage eventually introduced by the USMC in 2002 remains in use today, and blends elements from all three camouflages.|$|E

Wests Tigers then allocated all NRL contracted players to the Balmain Tigers (the Wests Magpies had six junior players in that group, as opposed to one from Balmain), citing the advantages of both the NRL and NSW Cup teams training together at Concord Oval. This continued from 2006 to 2007.|$|E

Conversely, he also notes that some challenges to a contract's formation necessarily include a challenge to the arbitration clause in any event, contrary to some recent lower-court decisions.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Francis Vere had {{successfully}} defeated a massive Spanish assault in Ostend in January the same year. The veteran Englishman with his troops stuck in Ostend proved an issue - {{the states general}} demanded that Vere would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> in the field with Maurice. After this had been agreed the garrison of Ostend was replaced by fresh troops along with a new governor - Frederick van Dorp. Vere left in March and {{was back in the}} field with a large portion of English troops (many newly recruited) numbering 8,000 men and many of them veterans from the siege at Ostend.|$|E
25|$|Four {{months after}} the library was demolished, Jill Nerheny, the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Coordinator, claimed there was a groundswell of support for leaving the land as green space. Residents Clyde Scott and Peter White became adamant the {{community}} would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> with a park on the reserve site and the library located elsewhere in Highbury. Others lobbied for the fence ringing the library site to be taken down, and eventually the Birkenhead-Northcote Community Board had it pushed back to the perimeter. Two new park benches were installed on the reserve {{to take advantage of}} the expanse that was now available (pictured).|$|E

25|$|Samuel Scott died in 1886 {{and in time}} William became {{convinced}} that their mill might <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> another way. He canvassed many of his farmer friends and customers for miles around Caledonia persuading them to invest in shares of a new milling firm. There were successful examples in other milling establishments. And so on Feb 16, 1892 The Caledonia Milling Company Limited received its provincial charter and in March, 1892 a Bargain and Sale was recorded: “William Scot and wife and Hugh Scott and wife to The Caledonia Milling Co. Ltd. Supposed flouring mill and an undivided interest in Dam #5 – 2 acres, 2 roods, 9 perches.” (A rood is the fourth part of an acre, and a perch is a land measure of 5 and a half yards).|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s NSB {{started working}} on plans rebuild the Østfold Line between Ski Station and Moss Station. Originally {{the idea was to}} simply place a second track next to the first. But it soon became evident that the railway would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> if a new route was selected, which allowed for higher speeds. Originally Kjenn Station north of Hobøl was {{proposed}} {{as the end of the}} double track, but NSB extended their plans. A new route was proposed between Rustad Station and Sonsveien Station which would place the line further west, avoiding the village of Hobøl. It would also allow the line to be built next to European Road E6. Construction was approved in 1989. A major part structure on the segment past Hølen was Hølendalen Bridge, a concrete structure which replaces the original viaduct.|$|E
25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing on the golf course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, of all {{the current}} {{newspapers}} published within Cornwall, only one is independent, the St. Ives Times & Echo, which formed out of the merger of Western Echo and the St. Ives Times in 1972. All of the others are either owned by Tindle Newspaper Group, Newsquest or Northcliffe Newspapers Group. The geographical coverage of the existing papers is also haphazard, {{with a lot of}} duplication (for example, Callington is covered by the East Cornwall Times, The Cornish Times and the Cornish & Devon Post) while some areas (particularly North Cornwall/Bude) are poorly served (just the North Cornwall edition of the St Austell centric Cornish Guardian). There is an argument that Cornwall would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> having at least one weekly paper which covers the entire county, as {{one of the main reasons}} for purchasing the weekly paper is by prospective property buyers and people buying and selling cars and job seekers. Indeed, The West Briton has gone some way to accommodate this; although there are four separate news editions of the paper, each week a classified/job vacancy section and a property section cover all of mid and west Cornwall, though places east of Bodmin, for no known reason, are generally excluded.|$|E
