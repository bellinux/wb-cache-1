500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I would never, ever tell you ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about so that you could all be surprised. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how I {{can be an}} able {{minister}} of the New Testament, and of the Spirit who gives life.|$|E
60|$|PAUL (suddenly grave). Not of that description. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a {{story of}} another kind, a true story, a tragic story.|$|E
60|$|D. Well, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> {{him that}} you will come on shore to him when your ship is got off.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> {{them one}} small secret in conclusion. There is nothing {{whatever}} {{wrong in the}} ancient and universal idea of Punishment--except {{that we are not}} punishing the right people.|$|R
6000|$|Limb. If this maggot bite {{a little}} deeper, {{we shall have}} you a citizen of Bethlem yet, ere dog-days. Well, <b>I</b> say little; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> Pug on it. [...] [Exit.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} give to know? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> frankly;--yes. And once,--once I thought that my answer {{would not have been}} a 'no.'" ...|$|E
60|$|L. You {{need not}} sigh for that, Violet; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{what we should}} all sigh for,--that {{there are so many}} ugly things we never see.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} lad with {{apparent}} reluctance. [...] "Mrs. Macdonald, {{you will remember}} that they dragged it out of me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing more whatever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{not till}} I am your wife. You must trust me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] she said, [...] "lest {{you should be}} miserable. He asked me to be his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur is {{not going}} to be gratified by a tale of ambitious proportions, and the {{spectacle}} of the narrator sticking fast in the midst. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> him the title--the 'Priest's Pupil.'" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went over}} to Clemente Island, which is thirty-six miles from Catalina Island. Clemente is a {{mountain}} {{rising out of the}} sea, uninhabited, lonely, wild, and beautiful. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> about the island later.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Kate, no, I do not. I might {{strive to}} {{disguise}} my real feelings from anybody but you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that--briefly and plainly, Kate--that I love her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{would not}} wish to {{interfere}} with you in any underhand way, Frank; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what has occurred to me. You have heard, probably, of Miss Dunstable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must dress now, sir; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{all about}} it when I get back from Cornwall. I will come back direct to Matching, and will explain everything." [...] So he escaped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; yes; it is,--if {{you will}} keep it so. I would rather {{you should keep}} it a secret. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] Then she stood still, looking into the other's face. [...] "I wonder how you will take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won't abuse your {{patience}} again, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you: <b>I</b> {{should like}} to come and look now {{and then at the}} picture Miss Saunders has begun of her, and that I want her to keep on with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, dear Eva, you are {{a mortal}} child, and cannot enter here; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> them of the kind little maiden who has learned to love them, and they will {{remember}} you when you are gone. Come now, for you have seen enough, and we must be away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, my lord, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> alone; for {{although}} Titus {{made no secret}} of it at the time, he might not care for the story to be generally told." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he said. [...] "We will go {{and play}} bridge. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what it is, my dear Princess. I think I am very near {{falling in love}} with your little stepdaughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may think}} me an old fool, ma'am, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what fancy {{came into my}} mind. Your son saved Aggie's life. He was twelve years old, she was five, seven years' difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not this waltz. I can't, {{having just}} sent away that good Captain Broadfoot. Look at Mr. Pynsent, {{did you ever}} see such a creature? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> dance the next waltz with you, and the quadrille too. <b>I</b> am promised, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> Mr. Poole that I had {{forgotten}} my engagement to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he who {{was chief}} among the minstrels said to Sir Launcelot, [...] "Messire, will ye not also sing?" [...] At this Sir Launcelot laughed, and quoth he: [...] "Nay, good fellows, I cannot sing as ye do, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> ye a story an ye list to hear me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw him, Senor Capitan," [...] he cried. [...] "He {{kept his}} horse in my corral, {{and at night}} he came and took it out {{saying that he was}} riding to visit a senorita. He fooled me, the scoundrel; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you--he rode south. I saw him ride south with my own eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Clym {{remained}} thinking. [...] "I almost {{wish you}} had not had that party," [...] he said; [...] "and for other reasons. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{in a day or}} two. We must think of Tamsin now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so easy, my lord. Where {{that heavy}} horse can go, Martin Lightfoot can follow. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> one secret, which I never told to living man. I can {{read and write}} like any clerk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now harkee, mate; {{you will}} not beg, {{you will not}} rob; so be it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what you WILL do. You will play decoy whilst I beg. Refuse, an' you think you may venture!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alack," [...] {{said the}} peasant, [...] "an it shall not displease your Reverence, the lesson comes {{too late for}} me, for <b>I</b> am <b>but</b> a maimed man; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that your mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him {{faithful}} service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> {{take steps}} to prevent his intruding on you any further. There may be an end of the matter now. I {{have no doubt that}} he has endeavoured to use his {{influence}} with Patrick; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> your brother not to speak of the matter further." [...] And so saying, she dismissed her daughter.|$|R
5000|$|... "I am, {{for a long}} time, {{a liberal}} monarchist, unionist of the Empire of Brazil. Do not think that I am going to the Republic, or to despotism; <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> the noble senator that in matters of public service I do not inquire what Brazilians are in politics, but, yes, if they fulfill their duty {{for the good of}} the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am here {{much earlier}} than I intended, Tom; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> what brings me, and I think I can answer for your being glad to hear it. Is that {{anything}} you wish to show me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a long one," [...] Dame Margaret added. [...] "Were I to tell {{it fully}} it would last till midnight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how matters befell, and to-morrow will inform you of the details more at length." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was expecting}} you," [...] Simon said, when that evening Guy entered his room. [...] "There {{will be a}} meeting at midnight in the butchers' hall, and I cannot take you in with me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what happens." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{are these}} the men, I thought to myself, that I must live with so long? these the men I am to eat with, and sleep with all the time? And besides, I now began to see, {{that they were not}} going to be very kind to me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> all about that when the proper time comes.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was broken}} off,--when I thought that I {{should be forced}} to go to India. The story is very long, and very sad. It is my own father who has ruined me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> it you some day." [...] Then he told it all, as he was sitting there with his cigar in his hand. Stories may seem to be very long, and yet be told very quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad on't, maiden," [...] said Aunt Judith, {{somewhat}} angrily; [...] "for I {{think the}} follies {{of the young}} people of this generation would drive mad an old brain like mine. Here you come on the viretot, through the whole streets of London, to talk some nonsense to a lady, who scarce sees God's sun, but when he shines on a brick wall. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> her you are here." ...|$|R
