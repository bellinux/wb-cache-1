5|$|Bennett had a {{significant}} influence on English music, not solely as a composer <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett's compositions has been rekindled {{and a number of}} his works, including a symphony, his piano concerti, some vocal music and many of his piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.|$|E
5|$|Byzantines availed {{themselves}} {{of a number}} of diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. According to Dimitri Obolensky, the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Studies by English Heritage {{have found}} that the site {{originally}} functioned not only as the manorial court hall for Ruislip, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> working farm. The main building was built over two existing structures, possibly to accommodate the new lessee of the manor, Robert Drury, a former Speaker of the House of Commons. The study concluded this was most likely achieved by a team of masons and carpenters. Manor Farm was also known as Ruislip Court until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The Sunnah contributed {{much to the}} {{development}} of Islamic law, particularly {{from the end of the}} first Islamic century. Muslim mystics, known as sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perfect human-being. All Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|The film then {{centers on}} the gala, which is {{attended}} by the Dumitrius and offers the setting for Von Debretsy's rejection of General Ipsilanti's advances. The characters' backgrounds are explained through the gossip of Madame Vorvoreanu, a distant relative of Von Debretsy, who is attending the event. The spectators are thus told that Von Debretsy {{is the daughter of}} a Romanian boyaress {{and a member of the}} Hungarian aristocracy, and that she is held in contempt by the local notabilities. In parallel, Ipsilanti himself is shown to be not just a military commander, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prince.|$|E

5|$|After {{his first}} novel, The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least one}} book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|E
5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome threw off Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scuta. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and several soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, {{not only as a}} strong leading edge to their maniple, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E
5|$|In a {{move that}} was {{described}} {{as an act of}} hurt pride by social historian David Smith, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on Easter Monday 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould's honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president Sir John Llewellyn present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including David A. Thomas, were joined by a reed and string orchestra, the band of the Fourth Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, and galleries packed by members of the public.|$|E
5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E

5|$|In many respects, {{the history}} of the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist {{resistance}} in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the Service for Poland's Victory (Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw, {{at a time when the}} Polish defeat in the German invasion of Poland (accompanied by the Soviet one) appeared inevitable. SZP founder General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski received orders from Polish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground 19th-century Polish National Government and World War I-era Polish Military Organization, it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life. Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the Polish Government in Exile, envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories.|$|E
5|$|The Greek and Latin histories, which {{represent}} {{the majority of}} materials covering Parthian history, are not considered entirely reliable since they were written {{from the perspective of}} rivals and wartime enemies. These external sources generally concern major military and political events, and often ignore social and cultural aspects of Parthian history. The Romans usually depicted the Parthians as fierce warriors <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> culturally refined people; recipes for Parthian dishes in the cookbook Apicius exemplifies their admiration for Parthian cuisine. Apollodorus of Artemita and Arrian wrote histories focusing on Parthia, which are now lost and survive only as quoted extracts in other histories. Isidore of Charax, who lived during the reign of Augustus, provides an account of Parthian territories, perhaps from a Parthian government survey. To a lesser extent, people and events of Parthian history were also included in the histories of Justin, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, Cassius Dio, Appian, Josephus, Pliny the Elder, and Herodian.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican {{cochineal}} {{led to an}} abrupt slump in the Polish cochineal trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in quantities of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vodka colorant, an ingredient in folk medicine, or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
5|$|William L. Mayo {{was born}} in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, in 1861, and was educated at Prestonsburg Seminary, Cedar Bluff Academy in Tazewell County, Virginia, and Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana; {{he had planned to}} attend Indiana University until {{financial}} difficulties prevented him from doing so. He worked as a teacher and principal at Cedar Bluff Academy before taking a public school position in Denver, although he resigned upon arriving and learning that the school was integrated. Mayo then moved to Pecan Gap in Delta County, Texas, in 1886, where his aunt and uncle lived; he began teaching at the local public school, and by 1889 had become superintendent of nearby Cooper's public school system. During his tenure in Pecan Gap, Mayo earned a reputation as a disciplinarian, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sympathetic instructor.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few months}} of John's return, rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising {{resistance}} to his rule. John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring. John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support. This was particularly important for John, as a way of pressuring the barons <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way of controlling Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the meantime, John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the king was escalating the conflict. John announced his intent to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law.|$|E
