Did not the club present the Town-hall with a portrait of the renowned fishing Sculptor? and did it not (only stipulating that the school should be built beyond the bridge to avoid noise) give fifty pounds to the said school but five years ago, in addition to Mark's own hundred? ...|$|E
40|$|Medium density fibreboards (MDF), {{prepared}} from thermomechanical (TMP) and chemo-thermomechanical (CTMP) pulps using phenolformaldehyde (PF), melamin urea phenolform-aldehyde (MUPF) and tanninformaldehyde (TF) resins {{as well as}} adhesives {{based on}} 4, 4 -diphenylmethandiisocyanates (PMDI) as binders and both the <b>blow-line</b> and blender technique as gluing method, were tested as to the creep behaviour and dimensional stability. The results reveal: TMP-boards bonded with PMDI (6 %) and MUPF-resin (14 %) have much lower creep factors than those bonded with pf-resin (8 %). The creep factor of boards bonded with TF-resin (14 %) lies in-between. Furthermore, using the <b>blow-line</b> technique leads to boards with much higher creep resistance, lower creep factors than those prepared from fibres glued by the blender process. Evidence has also been adduced that the dimensional stability of MDF prepared by using PF-resin is much lower than those made by using MUPF-resin or PMDI adhesive...|$|E
30|$|Four wood species, {{scots pine}} (Pinus sylvestris), beech (Fagus sylvatica), birch (Betula spp.), and poplar (Populous spp.), {{as well as}} a pine-beech-mixture (50 / 50 wt), were used in the {{production}} of MDF panels. The wood fibers were produced applying the laboratory refiner of the Institut für Holztechnologie Dresden GmbH (IHD) (Dresden, Germany), without adding any additives or resin in the flash tube dryer (<b>blow-line).</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} a Kappa-number estimator {{using different}} modelling approaches in continuous cooking. Alkaline, {{total dissolved solids}} and lignin content are measured on-line from several circulations in a continuous digester. ABB's Cooking Liquor Analyser (CLA 2000) and an on-line Kappa-number measurement were used in this research. With these measurements {{it is possible to}} estimate the <b>blow-line</b> Kappa-number long {{before the end of the}} cook and to gain a better understanding on the dependence of the Kappa-number on these variables. The developed models will be used in cooking control to reduce the Kappa-number variation. Artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, partial least squares method and linguistic equations are used in building a model to map input-output relationships of the measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Quality and {{economical}} requirements have raised evident need {{and interest in}} the industry to further develop continuous kraft cooking. A Kappa number, representing the cooking degree, {{is one of the}} few quality measures of cooking, and usually the only one measured on-line. Cooking degree is mainly controlled by temperature, chemical charge, and cooking time. Cooking conditions strongly depend on the packing degree of a chip column in the digester. At the same time, the packing of a chip column is affected by the cooking degree of chips. A typical problem is that the conditions and cooking degree in the process are not known. To achieve better control, more information about the cooking process is required. The aim of this thesis has been to more accurately describe the cooking conditions and phenomena in the digester scale. Conventional and Downflow Lo-Solids™ continuous cooking processes, producing both softwood and hardwood pulp, were investigated. Information achieved from measurements, and physical and chemical models describing chip scale phenomena, were utilised. Kappa number modelling was based on the use of an optimised and on-line adapted Gustafson's model. Modelling over grade change situations was accomplished by smoothly adjusting the model parameters as a function of temperature change profiles. Real-time profiles of cooking chemicals, temperature, and lignin and carbohydrates contents of chips within the processes were modelled. These real-time profiles were utilised in the modelling of the chip column's packing degree in the conventional process. Based on the developed models, <b>blow-line</b> Kappa numbers of both processes were predicted. By exploiting the prediction results, a new control strategy for the Kappa number was developed. In the strategy, set points for chemical charge and cooking temperature are iteratively solved by using only the developed prediction models of the <b>blow-line</b> Kappa number. It was shown that the modelled profiles of wood components and cooking chemicals can give new information regarding the continuous cooking processes. The modelling results are feasible in control purposes, and they also can support the operators' work. In the new control strategy, compared to the widely used H-factor based control, chemical concentrations can be more precisely taken into account...|$|E
40|$|In the Kamyr {{digester}} {{used for}} kraft pulping processes, {{there are strong}} interactions between the many process variables, long time delays, and frequent disturbances in the operation. Steady-state operation is, therefore, difficult to obtain. A complex kinetics-diffusion, simulation model developed for the Kamyr digester operation was coupled with a continuous dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimum of a continuous, multivariate, nonlinear yield function subject to constraints. The optimization program was used to (a) determine an optimal set of operating conditions that would maximize pulp yield at a specific chip meter speed and <b>blow-line</b> kappa number and (b) determine optimal profile changes in effective alkali concentration and upper and lower heater outlet temperatures to minimize the amount of off-specification pulp produced during swings between types of wood. In the model pulp yield can be increased by about 5 % on a relative basis by careful choice of operating conditions. In addition, significant reduction {{in the amount of}} off-specification pulp produced during swings has been achieved using optimal profile changes...|$|E
40|$|Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (TMP) {{refiners}} {{served in}} this work {{as an example of}} how to combine oversampled and undersampled variables on a common timeframe for further analysis. To get more information from the refining process, temperature measurement arrays in the refining zones were studied alongside process measurements such as motor load, production rates, plate gaps, dilution waters, pulp properties and manually measured <b>blow-line</b> consistency. The undersampled data set consisted of 63 laboratory samples obtained at a Swedish TMP mill, which were tested for tensile index, mean fiber length and Somerville shives content. The pulp samples were obtained at five different periods during three months to cover a large dynamic operating window. The data set was expanded using a piece-wise linear approach. The measurements inside the refining zone were shown to be important variables when interlacing the undersampled pulp properties with the oversampled process data set, consisting of 350 000 samples. Use of an extended entropy model provided a palette of information about the process conditions inside the refining zone. Particularly, the residence time and the consistency in the refining zones were essential for the pulp property development, as a link between the refining segment pattern used and the current state of refiner operation...|$|E
