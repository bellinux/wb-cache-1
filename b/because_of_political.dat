Fiji, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea chose to become Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|Due to the unrelenting {{losses and}} stories of Greek atrocities in Tripolis, the Sultan became desperate and in 1824 {{he called on}} his Viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to aid him. Ali promised to aid him in return for cession of the island of Crete, Cyprus, as well as making his son Ibrahim Pasha, Pasha of the Peloponnese. After his offer was accepted, Ali sent his son {{in command of the}} expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> rivalries which had caused a civil war.

During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, possibly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade chaff launchers.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due {{to several}} {{campaign}} blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide.

The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, {{after months}} of {{political}} pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping {{the office of the}} power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Shankar's {{parents had}} died {{by the time}} he {{returned}} from the European tour, and touring the West had become difficult <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> conflicts that would lead to World War II. Shankar gave up his dancing career in 1938 to go to Maihar and study Indian classical music as Khan's pupil, living with his family in the traditional gurukul system. Khan was a rigorous teacher and Shankar had training on sitar and surbahar, learned ragas and the musical styles dhrupad, dhamar, and khyal, and was taught the techniques of the instruments rudra veena, rubab, and sursingar. He often studied with Khan's children Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi. Shankar began to perform publicly on sitar in December 1939 and his debut performance was a jugalbandi (duet) with Ali Akbar Khan, who played the string instrument sarod.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E

5|$|During the 1230s and 1240s, Mindaugas {{strengthened}} {{and established}} his power in various Baltic and Slavic lands. Warfare {{in the region}} intensified; he battled German forces in Kurland, while the Mongols destroyed Kiev in 1240 and entered Poland in 1241, defeating two Polish armies and burning Kraków. The Lithuanian victory in the Battle of Saule temporarily stabilized the northern front, but the Christian orders continued to make gains along the Baltic coast, founding the city of Klaipėda (Memel). Constrained {{in the north and}} west, Mindaugas moved to the east and southeast, conquering Navahrudak, Hrodna, Vawkavysk, and the Principality of Polotsk, but there is no information about any battles for those cities. In 1246 by Chronic of Gustynia he was baptized by Orthodox church in Navahrudak, but later <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> situation he was re-baptized by Catholic church. In about 1239 he appointed his son Vaišvilkas to govern these areas, then known as Black Ruthenia. In 1248, he sent his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas, the sons of his brother Dausprungas, along with Vykintas, the Duke of Samogitia, to conquer Smolensk, but they were unsuccessful. His attempts to consolidate his rule in Lithuania met with mixed success; in 1249, an internal war erupted when he sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas' lands.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{various levels}} of {{government}} in the Socialist Republic of Croatia initiated planning processes aimed at development of road transport infrastructure of the then constituent republic of Yugoslavia. The first proposal of a motorway link in Croatia was made by Josip Roglić, {{a member of the}} Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts at the time. He proposed the motorway to be built between Zagreb and Split. In 1962, a formal proposal was made by local authorities in Split, resulting in Croatian government adopting a framework motorway development plan in 1966. Designs were commissioned in 1967, extending the route north to Maribor, Slovenia for the first time. The extension largely used the same corridor as an existing ZagrebMaribor roadZagorje Highwaya congested and insufficiently safe two-lane road with at-grade intersections, connecting numerous towns and villages between Zagreb and Maribor. The road itself represented yet another upgrade of a transport route recorded along ZagrebMaribor corridor since Middle Ages. The plan was shelved <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> pressures following suppression of Croatian Spring only to be reinstated upon Croatian independence from Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Morosini {{initiated}} a more energetic {{approach in the}} Venetian pursuit of the war: {{in the spring of}} 1655, he raided the Ottoman supply depot at Aigina and razed the port town of Volos in a night attack on 23 March. In early June, Morosini sailed to the Dardanelles, awaiting the sally of the Ottoman fleet, which was however delayed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> upheaval in the Ottoman government. Leaving Lazzaro Mocenigo with half the fleet (36 ships) to keep watch at the Straits, Morosini returned to the Cyclades. A week after his departure however, on 21 June, the Ottoman fleet, numbering 143 ships under Mustapha Pasha, appeared. The resulting battle was a clear Venetian victory. The Ottoman fleet avoided action {{for the remainder of the}} year, before it withdrew to winter quarters, leaving Morosini free to undertake an ultimately unsuccessful siege of the strategically important island fortress of Malvasia (Monemvasia) off the south-eastern coast of the Peloponnese. In September, Morosini was posted as the new provveditore of Crete, with Lorenzo Marcello as the new Captain General of the Sea.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Al-Talaba {{finished}} in sixth place with 31 points, having won eight matches, drawn seven and lost seven. They reached {{the final of}} the 1995 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, coming up against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the fourth time in a row in this competition, and Al-Talaba won with a single goal scored by Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail, achieving their third Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup success. After Al-Zawra'a achieved a double in the 1993–94 season, the Iraq FA chose the FA Cup runners-up, Al-Talaba, as Iraq's representative in the 1995 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. Under the management of Ayoub Odisho, they defeated Al-Gharafa in the first leg in Doha 5–3 and lost in the second leg 1–0 at the Al-Shaab Stadium. In the second round, they came up against Yangiyer and lost 2–1 in Tashkent before they turned it around to win 2–0 in Baghdad with goals from Muhannad Mohammed and Qahtan Chathir. In the quarter-finals, Al-Talaba won their first leg against Bahman in Tehran 1–0 with a goal by Sabah Jeayer. At the Al-Shaab Stadium, Bahman won 1–0 for a 1–1 draw on aggregate. The match went to a golden goal decider which was scored by Chathir. Al-Talaba had now qualified for the semi-finals where they were drawn to meet Kazma SC of Kuwait but Kazma withdrew from the tournament, refusing to play against Al-Talaba <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> tensions between Iraq and other Persian Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, {{in the aftermath of the}} 1991 Gulf War. The AFC directed Al-Talaba to play against Al-Riyadh of Saudi-Arabia but they too withdrew for the same reason, and that meant Al-Talaba had a walkover through the semi-finals. In the final, Al-Talaba faced Bellmare Hiratsuka in Kanagawa where they were beaten 2–1 after the winning goal was scored in the 81st minute by Hidetoshi Nakata.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months later}} royalist general Pío Tristán {{advanced}} {{in the north}} with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus {{of the city of}} Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, still much less than the 3,000 at Tristan's command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán. By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution, but failed to do so <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> disputes between the members. It did not take measures regarding the national flag, but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.|$|E
