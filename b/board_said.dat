A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster.

5|$|In February 2011, Fletcher filed {{a lawsuit}} against the Board of Directors of The Dakota co-op {{building}} in Manhattan, where he had lived since 1992 and owned four apartments. Among other things, he alleged defamation and unlawful discrimination. In March 2010, Fletcher had signed a contract to purchase a fifth apartment at The Dakota, intending to combine it with his current home. The Dakota <b>board</b> <b>said</b> it rejected Fletcher's application based on the financial materials he provided in his application. Judge Eileen A. Rakower dismissed the suit in September 2015 and Fletcher announced his intention to appeal.|$|E
5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic <b>board</b> <b>said</b> evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E

25|$|The project again caused {{significant}} controversy, but {{was eventually}} terminated. In early October 1997, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry proposed legislation giving National Children's Island, Inc., a 99-year lease on Kingman and Heritage islands. Although it initially {{appeared that the}} legislation would pass quickly, opposition from the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund led several Council members to withdraw {{their support for the}} lease. Opponents pointed out, too, that the company had performed none of the studies required by the 1993 Council vote. The delay doomed the project. In 1995, Congress had imposed a Financial Control Board on the D.C. government in an attempt to help the city avoid impending bankruptcy. The Control Board had the power to override decisions made by the mayor and city council. On March 5, 1999, the Financial Control Board exercised that power and voided the city's agreements to build Children's Island. The Control <b>Board</b> <b>said</b> the project would cost too much and was not financially viable. The decision {{was the first time the}} panel overturned a decision by city officials.|$|E

25|$|On 26 January 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Adam Air and the Indonesian {{government}} regarding the retrieval {{of the black}} boxes. Due to the depth involved, recovery required an underwater remotely operated vehicle, but due {{to the cost of}} using this method of recovery—especially since such equipment needed to be shipped in from elsewhere—the government placed the responsibility for the cost of recovering the recorders on Adam Air. Vice-President of Indonesia Jusuf Kalla went as far as to question the need to retrieve the black boxes at all, although experts said in response that the accident was of international significance as it could indicate a fault with the aircraft. Adam Air said that in its opinion, the black boxes should be recovered, describing the accident as being relevant on both national and international levels, but refused to pay, saying that was the responsibility of the government. Indonesia did request technical assistance from the United States, Japan and France. Jim Hall, {{a former chairman of the}} US National Transportation Safety <b>Board,</b> <b>said</b> that it was essential the boxes be recovered quickly, as at that point their 30-day battery life was about to expire, which subsequently did happen. He cited problems such as poor visibility and strong currents making it difficult to recover the devices without the signal. Setio Rahardjo, Head of National Committee for Transportation Safety, estimated that equipment for the salvage operation, if available, would cost US$100,000 per day to hire in an operation that would take around ten days, equating to US$1 million.|$|E
25|$|Another {{obstacle}} {{emerged on}} June 6. Ameren {{was required to}} install pollution-reducing equipment on its five coal-fired generating plants in 2015. But because Ameren was in financial difficulty, it sought and received a waiver {{from the state of}} Illinois granting it a five-year delay. Ameren sought to transfer this delay to Dynegy, so that Dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until 2020, either. But the Illinois Pollution Control Board denied Ameren's request. Dynegy filed its own request for a five-year waiver in July, and warned that the Ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver. But the Sierra Club, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, and other environmental groups said Dynegy had the resources to install the equipment, and opposed a waiver. ACM Partners, a financial firm hired by the Sierra Club, also argued that Dynegy purposefully left IPH significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent company's resources. Dynegy disagreed, but the firm warned that if IPH went bankrupt, workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation. The Illinois AFL-CIO, however, supported Dynegy's request on September 16, saying that local jobs depended on the waiver. The pollution <b>board</b> <b>said</b> it would make a decision by November 2013. Foresight Energy, a major Illinois coal mining company, said it would install the $500 million anti-pollution devices for free if Dynegy agreed to sign a long-term contract to accept coal only from Foresight Energy. Dynegy declined the offer (in part because it already has long-term coal contracts), and environmental groups opposed it.|$|E

500|$|When Lynn Johnston's For Better or For Worse {{explored}} the {{coming out of}} a teenaged character in 1993, it provoked a vigorous reaction from conservative groups. Readers opposed to homosexuality threatened to cancel newspaper subscriptions, and Johnston received hate mail and death threats towards herself and her family. Over 100 newspapers ran replacement strips or canceled the comic. One result of the storyline was that Johnston was made a jury-selected [...] "nominated finalist" [...] for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1994. The Pulitzer <b>board</b> <b>said</b> the strip [...] "sensitively depicted a youth's disclosure of his homosexuality and its effect on his family and friends."

500|$|The {{main problem}} with the Act was {{whether or not the}} {{claimant}} had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply.

The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having [...] "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book". The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections.|$|E
