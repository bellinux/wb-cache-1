5|$|Observing the French fleet's {{departure}} from the harbour at dusk, Pellew immediately dispatched Phoebe to Colpoys and Amazon to the main fleet at Portsmouth with warnings, before approaching the entrance to Brest in Indefatigable {{with the intention of}} disrupting French movements. Believing that the frigates in the bay must be the forerunners of a larger British force, de Galles attempted to pass his fleet through the Raz de Sein. This channel was a narrow, rocky and dangerous passage, and de Galles used corvettes as temporary light ships that shone <b>blue</b> <b>lights</b> and fired fireworks to direct his main fleet through the passage. Pellew observed this, and sailed Indefatigable right through the French fleet, launching rockets and shining lights seemingly at random. This succeeded in confusing the French officers, causing the Séduisant to strike the Grand Stevenent rock and sink with the loss of over 680 men from a complement of 1,300. Séduisants distress flares added to the confusion and delayed the fleet's passage until dawn. His task of observing the enemy completed, Pellew took his remaining squadron to Falmouth, sent a report to the Admiralty by semaphore telegraph, and refitted his ships.|$|E

50|$|Light is {{transmitted}} to the retina through the lens. In humans, the amount of light transmitted by the lens is age-dependent. In young children, more than 65% of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> {{is transmitted}}. This transmission rate decreases over time; at age 25, only 20% of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is {{transmitted to the}} retina. The decreased transmission of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> occurs as our eye’s lens naturally yellows and absorbs more <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> over time, thus preventing <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> from reaching the retina. As {{a result of this}} natural process, younger people are more susceptible to the effects of <b>blue</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>light</b> {{significantly}} increased tillering in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants grown {{at the same}} photosynthetic photon flux (PPF). Plants were grown under two levels of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> (400 - 500 nm) in a controlled environment with continuous irradiation. Plants received either 50 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> or 2 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> from filtered metal halide lamps at a total irradiance of 200 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 PPF (400 - 700 nm).

5|$|On 13 March 1806, Warren's {{squadron}} was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of {{the squadron}} were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing together {{some distance from}} the rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker. At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the wind from the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with <b>blue</b> <b>lights,</b> the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron trailing behind. To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails in the distance and turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy. Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and could be avoided in the night. It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire.|$|E

It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car.

The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars.

5|$|While under construction, {{the tower}} was {{specially}} illuminated on several occasions.

On October 27 of that same year, it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On December 11, the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season. On February 24, 2012, the building was lit up with red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, who became a cardinal on February 18.

Studies utilizing both lamp types were done at two photosynthetic photon flux levels, 200 and 500 mumol m- 2 s- 1 under a 16 h photoperiod. Phytochrome photoequilibria was nearly identical among treatments. The <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> effect on dry mass, stem length, leaf area, specific leaf area and tillering/branching was species dependent. For these parameters, wheat {{did not respond to}} <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> but lettuce was highly sensitive to <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> fraction between 0 and 6 % blue.

25|$|Only {{emergency}} and police vehicle may use <b>blue</b> <b>lights.</b> This includes firefighters, rescue services, emergency response vehicles for public utilities and civil defense units.

40|$|The {{effect of}} light on Monascus and the {{underlying}} mechanism have received {{a great deal of}} interest for the industrial application of Monascus pigments. In this study, we have examined the effects of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> on the culture morphology, mycelium growth, pigments, and citrinin yield of Monascus in liquid-state and oscillation fermentation, and explored the mechanism at a physiological level. It was found that <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> affected the colony morphology, the composition (chitin content), and permeability of the Monascus mycelium cell wall in static liquid culture, which indicates <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> benefits pigments secreting from aerial mycelium to culture medium. In liquid oscillation fermentation, the yields of Monascus pigments in fermentation broth (darkness 1741 U/g, <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> 2206 U/g) and mycelium (darkness 2442 U/g, <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> 1900 U/g) cultured under <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> and darkness are different. The total pigments produced per gram of Monascus mycelium under <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> was also higher (4663 U/g) than that in darkness (4352 U/g). However, the production of citrinin (88 μg/g) under <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> was evidently lower than that in darkness (150 μg/g). According to the degradation of citrinin caused by <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> and hydrogen peroxide, it can be concluded that <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> could degrade citrinin and inhibit the catalase activity of Monascus mycelium, subsequently suppressing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which is the active species that degrades citrinin...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>light</b> regulates many {{physiological}} and developmental processes in fungi.

Upon illumination with <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> VIVID undergoes a photocycle indicative of the formation of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct. VVD is localized in the cytoplasm and is only present after light induction. A loss-of-function vvd mutant was insensitive to increases in light intensities. Furthermore, mutational analysis of the photoactive cysteine indicated that the formation of a flavin-cysteinyl adduct is essential for VIVID functions in vivo.

Two wild-type ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, germinated either under white light or in darkness, were exposed to different red and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> conditions and used to examine these relationships. 	Red light exposure preceding growth under solely <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> was shown to have an inhibitory effect on root lengths, regardless of ecotype or etiolation. Surprisingly, red light did not produce significant phototropistic curvature in roots of either ecotype. The remainder of the results illustrated the fact that different ecotypes exhibit different phototropistic responses to light treatments and etiolation. Seedlings did not uniformly respond to constant red and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> in the same manner as they responded to pretreatment by red light. In different circumstances, simultaneous red and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> led to results statistically identical to <b>blue</b> <b>light’s</b> results, red pretreatment’s results, or an intermediate between the two. 	Our results both highlight the importance of testing multiple ecotypes within a species and reveal interesting trends in the relationship between red and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> pathways.
