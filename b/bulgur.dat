5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of <b>bulgur,</b> spices and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a <b>bulgur</b> crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with <b>bulgur</b> and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for scooping the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|E
5|$|Tabbouleh is a Levantine vegan dish (sometimes {{considered}} a salad) traditionally made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, <b>bulgur</b> and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt.

Especially popular are kubba {{prepared}} from <b>bulgur</b> and stuffed with ground lamb and pine nuts, and the soft semolina or rice kubba cooked in soup, which Jews of Kurdish or Iraqi heritage habitually enjoy as a Friday lunchtime meal.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{community}} {{that lived in}} Ottoman Syria prior to Zionist immigration that began in 1881 {{was known as the}} Old Yishuv. The cooking style of the community was Sephardi cuisine, which developed among the Jews of Spain before their expulsion in 1492, and in the areas to which they migrated thereafter, particularly the Balkans and Ottoman Empire. Sephardim also established communities in the Old Yishuv. Particularly in Jerusalem, they continued to develop their culinary style, influenced by Ottoman cuisine, creating a style that became known as Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. This cuisine included pies like sambousak, pastels and burekas, vegetable gratins and stuffed vegetables, and rice and <b>bulgur</b> pilafs, which are now considered to be Jerusalem classics.|$|E
25|$|Meals tend {{to favor}} meats and {{starches}} over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with sofrito, which {{is a mix of}} local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, <b>bulgur,</b> or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes or tipili (<b>bulgur</b> salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include chicharrón, yuca, casabe, pastelitos (empanadas), batata, yam, pasteles en hoja, chimichurris, and tostones.|$|E

25|$|Couscous is {{distinct}} from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, {{in that it is}} made from crushed durum wheat semolina, while pasta is made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined. Pasta is cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed.

25|$|Once {{separated}} from the stalks, the grain was used {{in a number of}} ways: Most simply, unripe kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both unripe and ripe grain was roasted over fire for immediate use. Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern <b>bulgur,</b> and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used to make gruel and in stews. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.|$|E
25|$|Proteins are {{composed}} of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, <b>bulgur</b> and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.|$|E
25|$|Raw wheat can {{be ground}} into flour or, using hard durum wheat only, can be ground into semolina; germinated and dried {{creating}} malt; crushed or cut into cracked wheat; parboiled (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into <b>bulgur</b> {{also known as}} groats. If the raw wheat is broken into parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer husk or bran can be used several ways.

25|$|Buckwheat groats are {{commonly}} used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish.

Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, eaten primarily in Estonia, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, called grechka in Ukrainian or Russian. The groats can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked.|$|E
500|$|Levantine cuisine is {{the cooking}} of the Levant (including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast, east of Egypt).

500|$|Stuffed vegetables, called memula’im, were {{originally}} designed to extend cheap ingredients into a meal. They are prepared by cooks in Israel from all ethnic backgrounds and are made with many varying flavors, such as spicy or sweet-and-sour, with ingredients such as bell peppers, chili peppers, figs, onion, artichoke bottoms, Swiss chard, beet, dried fruits, tomato, vine leaves, potatoes, mallow, eggplants and zucchini squash, and stuffing such as meat and rice in Balkan style, <b>bulgur</b> in Middle Eastern fashion, or with ptitim, a type of Israeli pasta.

Artichoke bottoms stuffed with meat are famous as one the grand dishes of the Sephardi Jerusalem cuisine of the Old Yishuv.|$|E
500|$|...com/details.php?id=481=42=42 Palestinian Flavour] {{there are}} three regions of Palestinian food; The Galilee, which is the {{northern}} part of the State of Israel, the [...] "West Bank" [...] and [...] "Gaza Strip" [...] which are parts of land occupied by the Israelis during 1967 war from Jordan and Egypt accordingly. [...] In the Galilee, <b>bulgur</b> and meat (beef or lamb) are primary ingredients that are often combined to form several variations of dishes ranging from a family-sized meal to a side dish. However, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the populations have a cooking style of their own. In the West Bank, meals are particularly heavy and contrast from the foods of the northern Levant. Main dishes involve rice, flatbreads and roasted meats. The staple food of the inhabitants in the Gaza Strip is fish due to its location on the Mediterranean seacoast. Their cuisine is similar to that of the Levant's; however, other spices are used more frequently. These generally include chili peppers, dill seed, garlic, and chard to flavor many of Gaza's meals. Although the cuisine is diverse, generally Palestinians are not restricted to the foods of their specific region and there is constant culinary diffusion amongst them. Although, because of Gaza's isolation from other Palestinian and Levantine Arab areas, their cooking styles are less known in the region.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bulgur</b> is {{recognized}} as a whole grain by the U.S.D.A. and the Whole Grains Council. <b>Bulgur</b> is sometimes confused with cracked wheat, which is crushed wheat grain {{that has not been}} parboiled. Whole-grain, high-fiber <b>bulgur</b> and cracked wheat can be found in natural food stores, Middle Eastern specialty grocers, and some traditional grocery stores. <b>Bulgur</b> is a common ingredient in Armenian, Iraqi, Assyrian, Kurdish, Syrian, Israeli, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. It has a light, nutty flavor. In Turkey, a distinction is made between fine-ground <b>bulgur,</b> called köftelik <b>bulgur,</b> and a coarser grind, called pilavlık <b>bulgur.</b> In the United States, <b>bulgur</b> is produced from white wheat in four distinct grinds or sizes (#1 Fine, #2 Medium, #3 Coarse and #4 Extra Coarse). The highest quality <b>bulgur</b> has particle sizes that are uniform thus allowing a more consistent cooking time and result.|$|E

Pomegranate molasses (nar ekşisi in Turkish), which is more sour than sweet, is commonly used in favor of lemon juice to add tartness. A variety of mezes and main dishes are prepared with köftelik <b>bulgur,</b> such as çiğ köfte, içli köfte, and ezogelin soup.
