50|$|Additionally, {{the loss}} of a single segment in a track immobilizes the entire vehicle, which can be a {{disadvantage}} in situations where high reliability is important. Tracks can also ride off their guide wheels, idlers or sprockets, which can cause them to jam or to come completely off the guide system (this is called a 'thrown' track). Jammed tracks may become so tight that the track may need to be broken before a repair is possible, which requires either explosives or special tools. Multi-wheeled vehicles, for example, 8 X 8 military vehicles, may often continue driving even after {{the loss of}} one or more non-sequential wheels, depending on the <b>base</b> <b>wheel</b> pattern and drive train.|$|E
5000|$|Note that {{by using}} exactly the next prime number of 5 wheel cycles and {{eliminating}} the multiple(s) of that prime (and only that prime) from the resulting list, we have obtained the <b>base</b> <b>wheel</b> as per step 4 for a factorization wheel with base primes of 2, 3, and 5; {{this is one}} wheel {{in advance of the}} previous 2/3 factorization wheel. One could then follow the steps to step 10 using the next succeeding prime of 7 cycles and only eliminating the multiples of 7 from the resulting list in step 10 (leaving some [...] "relative" [...] primes in this case and all successive cases - i.e some not true fully qualified primes), to get the next further advanced wheel, recursively repeating the steps as necessary to get successively larger wheels.|$|E

The system applies wheel measurement to get weigh signal and model-based measurement processing weigh signal, thus weighing a ship (or boat) of passing dike.

Although only the last of these spelled out the target market in its name, all the various long <b>wheel</b> <b>base</b> Opel 2-litres were designed with the taxi trade in mind.
