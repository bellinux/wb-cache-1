Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a metric system was invented by John Wilkins, the first secretary of the Royal Society, in 1668.|$|E
5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus {{based on the work of}} <b>Boole</b> and Schröder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Boole</b> {{participated in}} the Mechanics Institute, in the Greyfriars, Lincoln, {{which was founded in}} 1833. Edward Bromhead, who knew John <b>Boole</b> through the institution, helped George <b>Boole</b> with {{mathematics}} books and he was given the calculus text of Sylvestre François Lacroix by the Rev. George Stevens Dickson of St Swithin's, Lincoln. Without a teacher, it took him many years to master calculus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boole's</b> work {{founded the}} {{discipline}} of algebraic logic. It is often, but mistakenly, credited as being the source {{of what we know}} today as Boolean algebra. In fact, however, <b>Boole's</b> algebra differs from modern Boolean algebra: in <b>Boole's</b> algebra A+B cannot be interpreted by set union, due to the permissibility of uninterpretable terms in <b>Boole's</b> calculus. Therefore, algebras on <b>Boole's</b> account cannot be interpreted by sets under the operations of union, intersection and complement, {{as is the case with}} modern Boolean algebra. The task of developing the modern account of Boolean algebra fell to <b>Boole's</b> successors in the tradition of algebraic logic (Jevons 1869, Peirce 1880, Jevons 1890, Schröder 1890, Huntingdon 1904).|$|R
2500|$|Second, in {{the realm}} of logic's problems, <b>Boole's</b> {{addition}} of equation solving to logic—another revolutionary idea—involved <b>Boole's</b> doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the [...] "perfect syllogisms") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving.|$|R

25|$|Around 1830, George <b>Boole,</b> the mathematician, {{taught at}} Waddington Academy Boarding School in the village, run by Robert Hall. From 1838 to 1840, <b>Boole</b> {{lived in the}} village and became {{headmaster}} of the academy.|$|E
25|$|Boolean algebra {{is named}} after him, as is the crater <b>Boole</b> on the Moon. The keyword Bool {{represents}} a Boolean datatype in many programming languages, though Pascal and Java, among others, both use the full name Boolean. The library, underground lecture theatre complex and the <b>Boole</b> Centre for Research in Informatics at University College Cork are named in his honour. A road called <b>Boole</b> Heights in Bracknell, Berkshire {{is named after}} him.|$|E

The acquisition also helped BMC expand its international sales.|$|E

50|$|The zeroeth extrapolation, R(n, 0), is {{equivalent}} to the trapezoidal rule with 2n + 1 points; the first extrapolation, R(n, 1), {{is equivalent}} to Simpson's rule with 2n + 1 points. The second extrapolation, R(n, 2), {{is equivalent to}} <b>Boole's</b> rule with 2n + 1 points. Further extrapolations differ from Newton Cotes formulas. In particular further Romberg extrapolations expand on <b>Boole's</b> rule in very slight ways, modifying weights into ratios similar as in <b>Boole's</b> rule. In contrast, further Newton Cotes methods produce increasingly differing weights, eventually leading to large positive and negative weights. This is indicative of how large degree interpolating polynomial Newton Cotes methods fail to converge for many integrals, while Romberg integration is more stable.|$|R
25|$|<b>Boole</b> {{was born}} in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John <b>Boole</b> Sr (1779–1848), a {{shoemaker}} and Mary Ann Joyce. He had a primary school education, and received lessons from his father, but due to a serious decline in business, he had little further formal and academic teaching. William Brooke, a bookseller in Lincoln, may have helped him with Latin, which he may also have learned {{at the school of}} Thomas Bainbridge. He was self-taught in modern languages. In fact, when a local newspaper printed his translation of a Latin poem, a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretense that he was not capable of such achievements. At age 16, <b>Boole</b> became the breadwinner for his parents and three younger siblings, taking up a junior teaching position in Doncaster at Heigham's School. He taught briefly in Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 <b>Boole</b> {{published}} an influential paper in early invariant theory. He received a medal from the Royal Society for his memoir of 1844, On A General Method of Analysis. It was {{a contribution to}} the theory of linear differential equations, moving from the case of constant coefficients on which he had already published, to variable coefficients. The innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not commute. In 1847 <b>Boole</b> published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, the first of his works on symbolic logic.|$|E
25|$|First, in {{the realm}} of foundations, <b>Boole</b> reduced Aristotle's four propositional forms to one form, the form of equations, which by itself was a revolutionary idea.|$|E
