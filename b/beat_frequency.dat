In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second.

25|$|The {{regulation}} of axonemal dynein activity {{is critical for}} flagellar <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> and cilia waveform. Modes of axonemal dynein regulation include phosphorylation, redox, and calcium. Mechanical forces on the axoneme also affect anoxemal dynein function. The heavy chains of inner and outer arms of axonemal dynein are phosphorylated/dephosphorylated to control the rate of microtubule sliding. Thioredoxins associated with the other axonemal dynein arms are oxidized/reduced to regulate where dynein binds in the axoneme.

40|$|Autodyne lidar with CO 2 -laser {{is a good}} {{system for}} remote {{measurements}} of environmental gases 1 {{as a number of}} them have absorption bands in spectral region 9 - 11 km. In this report we present an analytical approach for calculation of the parameters of a parametric autodyne lidar for environmental DIAL applications. This approach allows one to express analytically the parameters of the atmosphere, such as the absorption coefficient and the distance to remote target, through experimentally measured values. A model of parametric autodyne lidar based on two level laser scheme has been considered. The aim is to derive analytical dependencies of lidar field on parameters of the atmosphere. Two nonlinear differential equations for laser field amplitude at resonator mirrors are derived. Using reflectivity of the remote mirror as a small parameter (it can reach 10 i 9 in field experiments) a perturbation theory has been built, which allows one to reduce nonlinear lidar equations to a couple of linear differential equations with diving force. These equations have been solved both analytically, using proper approximations, and numerically. From the analytical solution two important expressions for the absorption coefficient and the distance to the target have been derived. Two types of lidar mirror modulation mostly used in experiments have been considered, harmonic-like oscillation and a saw-tooth-like oscillation. Comparison of the two mirror modulation schemes leads one to conclusion that the harmonic modulation has two apparent disadvantages. The first one is that in this case one has to deal with specific and short time intervals when the mirror passes its equilibrium point in order to filter out the maximal <b>beating</b> <b>frequency,</b> whereas the saw-tooth modulation results in a fixed <b>beating</b> <b>frequency</b> and then {{there is no need to}} deal with a wide signal spectrum. The second (probably minor) disadvantage is that the maximal <b>beating</b> <b>frequency</b> in case of harmonic-like modulation is higher than the constant <b>beating</b> <b>frequency</b> in case of saw-tooth-like modulation (provided both amplitude and frequency of mirror oscillations are identical in both cases). This difference however may become important when very large distances should be measured. For instance, assume the distance is about 300 km and the mirror oscillation amplitude and frequency are 11 m and 1 kHz respectively. Then the maximal <b>beating</b> <b>frequency</b> in case of harmonic modulation is about 600 MHz, while in case of saw-tooth modulation the <b>beating</b> <b>frequency</b> is about 350 MHz...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Heart {{function}} {{is based on}} electrochemical changes (action potentials) across the cardiomyocyte cell membranes. Action potentials induces the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores (sarcoplasmic reticulum), binding of calcium to sarcomeric proteins and finally in cardiac muscle contraction. The most important ions, which {{take part in the}} action potential generation, are sodium, calcium and potassium. The rapid flow of sodium ions into the cardiomyocytes causes the depolarization of the cell membrane. SCN 5 A is the gene located on chromosome 3 p 21, and it encodes the pore-forming α-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 5. Patients with these mutations in SCN 5 A gene have different inherited arrhythmia syndromes, such as congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS). This work will focus on two different SCN 5 A mutations, I 141 V and R 1913 C. It has different aims: 1) Baseline beating characterization of cardiomyocytes carrying mutation in SCN 5 A. 2) To study drug responses of cardiomyocytes carrying mutation in SCN 5 A. 3) Image and analyse both visually and using the BeatView software SCN 5 A mutation -patient specific and wildtype (WT) iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) 4) To get reliable data of SCN 5 A mutation -patient specific CMs visual inspection was used, if it is impossible to analyze signals with BeatView. Methods: Two of cell lines were derived from patients with mutations in the SCN 5 A gene and they were compared to a control cell line from a healthy individual. Behavior of the cells were analyzed using videos of single dissociated beating cardiomyocytes of each cell line. Individuals carrying mutations in the SCN 5 A gene get arrhythmias during exercise. Adrenaline was used to replicate this phenomenon in vitro. Flecainide was used to study how it effects in good way to arrhythmic symptoms of the CMs. Analyzing and classification of CMs were studied both visually and using Beatview software. Results: <b>Beating</b> <b>frequency</b> of cells with SCN 5 A mutations was higher than in control cells. Flecainide decreased <b>beating</b> <b>frequency</b> of all cell lines and made disease cells more regular.
