25|$|The match {{finished}} under {{lights and}} was won by Woods and Sörenstam with a par {{at the first}} extra hole. They had come from 2 behind with three holes to play, Sörenstam taking the match into sudden death by holing a 10-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the 18th.|$|E
25|$|Faldo won {{his second}} major {{championship}} at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo's {{final round of}} 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him {{to get into a}} playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. On the back nine, Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 feet at the 13th, 5 feet at the 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 feet at the 17th. On the first hole of the ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> to win the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Mickelson {{made his}} 2012 debut at the Humana Challenge and {{finished}} tied for 49th. He {{missed the cut}} at the Farmers Insurance Open after shooting rounds of 77 and 68. In {{the final round of}} the 2012 AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Mickelson rallied from six shots back, winning the tournament by two strokes with a final round score of 8-under 64 and a four-round total of 269. The win marked his 40th career victory on the PGA Tour. The following week at Riviera Country Club, Mickelson lost the Northern Trust Open in a three-way playoff. He had held the lead or a share of it from day one until the back nine on Sunday when Bill Haas posted the clubhouse lead at seven under par. Mickelson holed a 27-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the final regulation hole to force a playoff alongside Haas and Keegan Bradley. Haas however won the playoff with a 40-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the second playoff hole. The second-place finish moved Mickelson back into the world's top 10.|$|E

5000|$|Both were {{a stroke}} behind with makeable <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> on the 72nd green to tie Nicklaus, {{who had just}} missed his 12 ft birdie attempt. Miller missed left and low from 18 ft while Weiskopf's eight-footer (2.4 m) missed right.Source: ...|$|R
50|$|After {{a double}} bogey, Sandra Haynie sank <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> from 70 and 15 ft {{on the final}} two holes to win by a stroke over runners-up Carol Mann and Beth Stone. Haynie had won the {{previous}} major, the LPGA Championship, a month earlier.|$|R
25|$|At the AT Pebble Beach Pro-Am, Mickelson shot {{rounds of}} 68-65-66-72 {{to finish in}} solo second place, one shot behind winner Vaughn Taylor. Mickelson lipped out a five-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> to force a playoff on the 72nd hole. Mickelson entered the final round with a two stroke lead, his first 54-hole lead since the 2013 U.S. Open and was seeking to end a winless drought dating back 52 {{worldwide}} events to the 2013 Open Championship.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy {{missed out}} on {{a chance to win}} the 2010 PGA Championship when he three-putted the 15th green to fall out of a tie for the lead. His final-hole <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> {{narrowly}} missed the hole to leave him one stroke out of the playoff between Bubba Watson and eventual winner Martin Kaymer. McIlroy finished tied for third. On 4 October 2010, McIlroy won a crucial half-point to help Europe regain the Ryder Cup.|$|E
25|$|At the Open Championship Mickelson shot {{rounds of}} 70-72-70 {{to enter the}} final round eight shots behind outside the top 40. In the final round Mickelson birdied the 15th hole to move to 10 under and within two of the lead. After a missed 10 foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on 16, Mickelson hit his drive on the infamous road hole 17th at the famed Old Course at St Andrews onto a 2nd floor balcony of the Old Course Hotel. The out of bounds drive lead to a triple bogey 7 that sent Mickelson {{tumbling}} out of contention.|$|E
50|$|The sudden-death playoff {{began on}} the 18th hole, a 354 yd par-4. Both {{narrowly}} missed <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> and tapped in for pars, {{and went to the}} next hole, the 10th at 363 yd. Again both hit the fairway and the green. Norman's downhill 20 ft birdie attempt ended four feet (1.3 m) short, and Azinger's from seven feet (2.1 m) lipped out, and he tapped in for par. Norman's attempt to save par also rimmed out, and the playoff was over.|$|R
50|$|The {{match was}} {{played in a}} stroke play format, and was closely contested. McIlroy built a three shot lead after three holes, but with a birdie at seven and a chip-in at twelve, Woods closed the gap to one. Woods missed <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> to tie McIlroy at both sixteen and seventeen, and needed to hole a greenside bunker shot at the final hole to salvage extra holes. He lipped out and instead settled for par and a four-under 68. McIlroy brushed in a three-footer for par and a 67 (-5), to win by a shot.|$|R
50|$|Tiger Woods had the {{outright}} lead after a 67 on {{the first}} round, which included 5 birdies and no bogeys. Defending champion Pádraig Harrington, who played in the same group as Woods, was alone in second place after a 68. David Toms, 2001 champion, also started well. He made many long <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> and par saves to shoot a 69, placing him {{in a group of}} six tied for third that also included two-time champion Vijay Singh. World number two Phil Mickelson struggled slightly, shooting a 2-over par 74. John Daly, 1991 champion, withdrew after posting a 78, citing a back injury.|$|R
25|$|In May 2011, Westwood contested {{a playoff}} at the BMW PGA Championship with fellow Englishman {{and at the}} time world number two Luke Donald. On the par five 18th, Donald hit his {{approach}} shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but got too much backspin on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, {{which was}} the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round. After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus {{received}} a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilken Bridge. Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a birdie, holing a 15-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Mickelson tied his career low round of 60. He made seven birdies in his first nine holes and needed a birdie on the 18th hole to equal the PGA Tour record of 59. However, his 25-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the final hole lipped out, {{resulting}} in him missing out by a single shot on making only the sixth round of 59 in PGA Tour history. Mickelson led the tournament wire-to-wire and completed a four shot win over Brandt Snedeker for his 41st PGA Tour victory and 3rd Phoenix Open title. Mickelson's score of 28-under-par tied Mark Calcavecchia's tournament scoring record. He also moved back inside the world's top 10 after falling down as far as number 22.|$|E
50|$|Hearn lost another sudden-death playoff in July 2015, at the Greenbrier Classic. He had a putt at the 72nd hole to win {{the tournament}} {{outright}} but left the 20-footer short of the cup. In the four-man playoff, Danny Lee and Hearn holed <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> at the first extra hole to eliminate Kevin Kisner and Robert Streb who both missed the green at the par three. Then on the second extra hole, Hearn found trouble off his drive and could only bogey the par five, allowing Lee to claim victory with a two-putt par. This was Hearn's second runner-up finish on the PGA Tour, losing both times in playoffs.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the fourth}} playoff in Players Championship history and the first since Sergio García {{defeated}} Paul Goydos in 2008. The format was again sudden death, on a rotation of holes 17-18-16-17-18 {{until there is a}} winner. On the first extra hole, both players made it on the island green 17th, but both had long <b>birdie</b> <b>putts.</b> After Choi lagged up to three feet, Toms had 23 ft for the win, but barely missed; it went three and a half feet past, and he lipped out his comebacker for par. Choi sank the putt for his first win on the PGA Tour since 2008.|$|R
50|$|Woods and Westwood both {{hit their}} drives into bunkers {{and had to}} lay up. Woods' second shot went into the rough; Westwood laid up in the fairway. Both reached the green with their third shots, leaving them with <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> to force an 18-hole playoff with Mediate. Westwood's 15 ft putt, which had a severe break to the right, was not successful. Woods' putt was closer at 12 ft, with a much less severe break; his putt lipped the hole before {{dropping}} and putting him in the playoff. Both Woods and Mediate became the first to finish under par at the U.S. Open since 2004.|$|R
25|$|Watson won the 2014 Masters Tournament {{by three}} shots, {{with a score}} of −8. He entered the final round tied for the lead with 20-year-old Masters rookie Jordan Spieth. Playing {{together}} in the final pairing, Spieth birdied the seventh hole for a two-stroke lead over Watson. However, the momentum turned on the par-5 eighth hole. Spieth had a <b>birdie</b> <b>putt,</b> but ended up three-putting for bogey while Watson birdied to pull into a first-place tie. Then, on the ninth hole, Watson birdied again while Spieth bogeyed, and the four-shot swing over two holes gave Watson a lead that he never relinquished in a win over Spieth and Jonas Blixt. With the win, Watson became the 17th player to win the Masters two or more times. The win moved him again to number four in the Official World Golf Ranking.|$|E
25|$|At the 2013 U.S. Open, Mickelson {{entered the}} final round leading by one stroke after rounds of 67-72-70 (−1) over the first three days, but he started {{the final round}} by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys {{to fall out of}} the lead. He regained the lead at the par 4 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a {{misjudgment}} at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.|$|E
25|$|At the 1988 U.S. Open, Faldo ended 72 {{holes of}} {{regulation}} {{play in a}} tie for the lead with Curtis Strange. Faldo's even-par fourth round of 71 started with 14 consecutive pars. A birdie on the 15th hole gave him {{a share of the}} lead with Strange. However, on the 16th hole Faldo found himself with a difficult bunker shot to play. After backing away from his bunker shot to scold some photographers for talking, Faldo made his lone bogey. Strange dropped a shot on the 17th to leave the two rivals tied for the lead on the 18th tee. Faldo missed a 25-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the 18th green which would have made him the first British player since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to hold both major national championships. The following day, Strange won the 18-hole Monday playoff by four strokes. Strange shot an even-par round of 71, while Faldo struggled with a round of 75.|$|E
50|$|Picard had not trailed {{and led by}} two {{as late as the}} 26th hole, but {{the match}} was squared on the 29th green and Nelson led by one after 32 holes. Both birdied the par-5 33rd and Picard sank a curling putt from over 20 ft for par to halve the 34th hole and stay one back. They halved the par-3 35th at par and both had <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> on the 36th green. Nelson missed his from 10 ft feet while Picard sank his from three to square up the match. On the extra hole, both again had birdie putts: Picard made his from ten feet while Nelson missed his from six.|$|R
50|$|Tiger Woods {{won four}} {{years in a row}} at Bay Hill, from 2000 to 2003, one of only four {{occasions}} that an event was won four consecutive times on the PGA Tour. In 2004, he was one shot off the lead after opening with a 67, but followed up with consecutive 74s on Friday and Saturday, and tied for 46th place. Woods also won the 2008 and 2009 tournaments, both times with <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> on the final hole. He then won the tournament in 2012 by five shots, his first official PGA Tour win in 924 days and his seventh win at the event. Woods repeated in 2013 for his eighth victory at the tournament. He withdrew two days before the 2014 event, citing a bad back, and underwent surgery shortly after.|$|R
50|$|Play resumed Monday at 10:05 a.m., {{with six}} {{players on the}} course within three shots of the lead. Headed to the 72nd hole, Phil Mickelson was tied for the lead at three under with Thomas Bjørn and Steve Elkington. Mickelson birdied the par 5 18th to win his second major title. Mickelson flopped a chip from the deep grass some 50 ft away to two feet for a birdie and a {{one-shot}} victory. Elkington and Bjorn both missed <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> and {{had to settle for}} par on the 554 yd closing hole. Mickelson became the seventh wire-to-wire winner (though he shared the lead after the first and third rounds) at the PGA Championship and the first since Tiger Woods in 2000. The round of the day belonged to Ted Purdy, who ended up in a tie for tenth after a final round 66.|$|R
25|$|Mickelson shot a 63 in {{the opening}} round of the Open Championship at Royal Troon. The round set a new course record and matched the {{previous}} major championship record for lowest round. Mickelson had a 15-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> that narrowly missed on the final hole to set a new major championship scoring record of 62. He followed this up with a 69 {{in the second round}} for a 10 under par total and a one shot lead over Henrik Stenson going into the weekend. In the third round, Mickelson shot a one under 70 for a total of 11 under par to enter the final round one shot back of Stenson. Despite Mickelson's bogey-free 65 in the final round, Stenson shot 63 to win by three shots. Mickelson finished 11 strokes clear of 3rd place, a major championship record for a runner up. Mickelson's 267 total set a record score for a runner up in the British Open, and only trails Mickelson's 266 at the 2001 PGA Championship as the lowest total by a runner up in major championship history.|$|E
2500|$|For many fans, Mickelson's {{finish in}} the tournament was {{especially}} poignant, given that Amy had been suffering from breast cancer during the preceding year. Mary Mickelson, Phil's mother, was also dealing with cancer. CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz's call of the final <b>birdie</b> <b>putt,</b> [...] "That's a win for the family," [...] was {{seen by many as}} capturing the moment well.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 July 2010, McIlroy {{confirmed}} {{his status as}} a favourite for the Open title on the Old Course at St Andrews by shooting a 9-under-par 63 on the opening day, the lowest-ever first round score in the 150-year history of the Open Championship, and tying the course record. He missed a 5-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the 17th, [...] "The Road Hole", which would have given him the outright record. His tied third finish in the 2010 Open Championship sent him to a career high world ranking of seventh.|$|E
50|$|Two weeks later, Donald won the Transitions Championship {{to reclaim}} the number one ranking from McIlroy. This was his fifth victory on the PGA Tour and came after a solid week's play {{culminating}} in a four-man playoff with Robert Garrigus, Bae Sang-moon and Jim Furyk. Donald had earlier shot a bogey-free round of 66, which included 5 birdies in his first 11 holes to make the playoff. After a loose tee shot found the rough, Donald hit a brilliant seven iron approach to within six feet on the 18th, the first extra hole. Garrigus also knocked his close, while Furyk and Bae left themselves lengthy <b>birdie</b> <b>putts.</b> There had only been 5 birdies all day in regulation play on the 18th and when Furyk, Bae and Garrigus all missed their putts, Donald brushed his in for the victory and the number one ranking.|$|R
50|$|The {{final round}} began {{strongly}} for the American challengers, with Nick Watney, Hunter Mahan, Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar all getting under par early, while the international players struggled. As the leaders reached the turn, Doral's famous back nine began to bite, {{with a number}} of the leading players making bogeys and double bogeys. This opened the tournament back up to the field; ahead of the leaders, Anders Hansen was going low, but missed makeable <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> on 16 and 17 to settle for a 67 and 13-under. Meanwhile, Nick Watney holed long par putts at 13 and 15 to stay at 15-under, and shared the lead with Dustin Johnson going into the final stretch. But Johnson bogeyed 16, and when Watney birdied the tough 18 it left Johnson, in the final group, needing to hole his second shot to force a playoff; he hit it close, but eventually had to settle for a par, leaving Watney the winner by two. The low rounds on the final day were a pair of 66s by the young American Rickie Fowler, and former world number one Tiger Woods, a multiple winner of this event.|$|R
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|The USGA and R {{sanction}} a [...] "Modified Stableford" [...] {{system for}} scratch players, which makes par worth zero, a birdie worth 2, eagle 5 and double-eagle 8, while a bogey is a penalty of -1 and a double-bogey or worse -3. As {{with the original}} system, the highest score wins the game, and terrible scores {{on one or two}} holes won't wreck an entire game, but this system rewards [...] "bogey-birdie" [...] play more than the original, encouraging golfers {{to try to make the}} riskier <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> or eagle chipshot instead of simply parring each hole.|$|E
2500|$|Four players {{began the}} final round tied for the lead {{for the first time}} at the U.S. Open since 1973. In the final pairing with Jason Day at 3 pm PDT, Dustin Johnson {{recorded}} two birdies on the front nine to take sole possession of the lead, then lost it with bogeys on three out of four holes to begin the back nine. In the penultimate pairing, Jordan Spieth and Branden Grace both birdied the par-4 12th to tie, but Grace fell from contention on the 16th after his drive went out of bounds and he made double bogey. Spieth holed a [...] <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> at the 16th to open up a three-stroke lead, but then three-putted for double bogey on the par-3 17th to fall into a tie with Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen began the round three shots off the lead and quickly dropped further behind with three consecutive bogeys on the front-nine. Beginning at the 12th, however, Oosthuizen birdied six out of his last seven holes to tie Spieth. At the par-5 18th, Spieth hit the green in two and proceeded to two-putt for birdie. Johnson recovered from his bogey streak with a birdie at the 17th, then also found the 18th green in two. Faced with a [...] eagle putt to win the championship, Johnson's attempt rolled three feet (0.9 m) past the hole, then missed his <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> to tie. Expecting a Monday playoff, Spieth suddenly gained a one-stroke victory for his second consecutive major title.|$|E
2500|$|Woods {{then took}} an {{extended}} break from competition, to refine new techniques with Foley. He returned in early November, {{after more than}} a month off, at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, where he had placed 2nd in 2009, but failed to challenge seriously. Next was a visit to Thailand, his mother's birthplace, for a one-day Skins Game, honoring King Bhumibol. At the 2010 JBWere Masters, held near Melbourne, Australia in mid-November, Woods arrived as defending champion and was paid an appearance fee of more than $3million. He charged late on the final day to finish in fourth place. Over his final six holes, Woods made two eagles, two birdies, and two pars, to end with a round of 6-under 65. Three weeks later, resuming his role as host of the elite-field Chevron World Challenge near Los Angeles (he had skipped the 2009 event because of personal crisis; the tournament serves as a primary benefactor of his charitable foundation), Woods put up three straight rounds in the 60s, and led going into the final round {{for the first time in}} 2010. But he struggled with his long-game control in mixed weather conditions on Sunday, and putted much worse than he had in previous rounds, winding up in a tie with Graeme McDowell after 72 holes. McDowell sank a [...] <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> on the final green; Woods then sank his own short <b>birdie</b> <b>putt</b> to tie. McDowell again made birdie on the first playoff hole (the 18th) from [...] to take the title, when Woods missed from shorter range. The playoff loss meant that Woods went winless for an entire season, for the first time since turning professional. However, Woods finished the 2010 season ranked #2 in the world. He again used the Nike Method 003 putter for his final two events of 2010.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Couples {{became the}} first American player to reach the number one {{position}} in the Official World Golf Rankings (since the World Ranking points system debuted in April 1986). He spent 16 weeks at number 1, {{after one of the}} hottest ever starts to a season by a PGA Tour player. Beginning with the Nissan Los Angeles Open, where he defeated Davis Love III in a playoff, Couples won two tournaments and finished second in two others in the five weeks leading up to The Masters. At Augusta, Couples carried over his momentum, shooting in the 60s in each of the first three rounds to hold second place heading into Sunday. After a shaky start to his final round that allowed 49-year-old Raymond Floyd to claim the lead, Couples took it back with 18- and 20-foot <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> at the 8th and 9th holes, respectively, then saved par on a slick 6-footer at 10. At 12 (perhaps the scariest par-3 in the world), Couples barely cleared Rae's Creek in front of the green. Although his ball rolled back towards the water, it incredibly remained on the bank and he saved par. Sensing that destiny was on his side, Couples held off Floyd the rest of the way, completing Augusta's treacherous back nine with eight pars and one birdie to win his first Major. The win pushed Couples past the $1 million mark in earnings on the season as well, by far the fastest any player had reached that plateau.|$|R
25|$|A new swing brought {{big changes}} for Singh in 2008, {{although}} he had good opportunities at Pebble Beach and Bay Hill, he was not competing {{at a high level}} {{for the first half of}} the year. His game was plagued by poor putting for the better part of two years, but his season started to turn around with a tie for fifth at the Travelers Championship. After missing the cut at The Open Championship, Singh won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in early August for his first win of the year and first World Golf Championship. His win had been a relief after missing short putts throughout the week. He missed the cut the following two weeks including at Oakland Hills for the PGA Championship and entered the PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 7th in the standings. At the first playoff event, Singh prevailed for his first FedEx Cup win defeating Sergio García and Kevin Sutherland in a playoff. On the first playoff hole García and Singh matched long <b>birdie</b> <b>putts</b> before Singh won with birdie on the second playoff hole. Singh was propelled into first place in the FedEx Cup race with three events remaining. At the second event of the playoffs, he triumphed once again, this time at the Deutsche Bank Championship bewildering the field with a five strokes victory and a final round 63. He had won three times in his last five starts and created an almost insurmountable lead in the points race. He would not contend in the remaining two events, but by playing in both the 2008 FedEx Cup title belonged to Singh. His season which looked to be a major disappointment in July turned into an historic year for Singh: he won the PGA Tour money list for the third time in his career and he surpassed Harry Cooper for most PGA Tour wins of all time for a non-American.|$|R
50|$|In May 2015, Kjeldsen ended {{a six-year}} drought and won his fourth European Tour title at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open. On a very windy final day, Kjeldsen held a two stroke lead but shot a 76 five over par round {{to fall into}} a three-man playoff with Eddie Pepperell and Bernd Wiesberger. On the first extra hole, Kjeldsen found the par five 18th green in two and after Pepperell and Wiesberger could not get up and down for their <b>birdies,</b> he two <b>putted</b> from 30 feet for the victory. Kjeldsen {{maintained}} his 100% record of winning when holding the 54 hole lead, which now stands at 4-for-4. The next week he finished second at the Nordea Masters. Later he finished second at the Made in Denmark and British Masters tournaments.|$|R
