Higher altitude slopes and ridgetops house sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch trees. Zelazny et al. note that [...] " [...] high frequency of disturbed sites dominated by aspen stands reveals the degree of historical and recent human disturbance along the Petitcodiac River." [...] The Petitcodiac River's riparian zone houses a number of trees, including willows, white spruce, white pine, and speckled alder.
