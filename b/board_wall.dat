60|$|By feeling {{along the}} brick wall she brought up, with a sudden bump, {{at the back of}} the stairway. Then she deliberated. If she went around to the front so as to get access to the steps, she might pass in range of the loiterer whom she mistrusted. That risk she would not incur. Examining the wall that {{enclosed}} the box-like stairway as best she could in the dark, she found it rickety, full of holes and cracks, and she decided she would climb it. A sheer perpendicular <b>board</b> <b>wall,</b> some twelve or fifteen feet high, shrouded in pitchy darkness and apparently within earshot of a police spy, did not daunt Bessy Bell. Slipping her strong fingers in crevices and her slim toes in cracks, she climbed up and up, till she got hold of the railing post on the first platform. Here she had great difficulty to keep from falling, but lifting and squirming her supple body, by a desperate effort she got her knees on the platform, and then pulled herself to safety. Once on the stairs she ran up the remaining few steps to the landing, where she rested panting and triumphant.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed through}} Tranmere {{yesterday}} forenoon, and lingered awhile {{to see the}} sports. The greatest peculiarity of the crowd, to my eye, was that they seemed {{not to have any}} best clothes, and therefore had put on no holiday suits,--a grimy people, as at all times, heavy, obtuse, with thick beer in their blood. Coarse, rough-complexioned women and girls were intermingled, the girls with no maiden trimness in their attire, large and blowsy. Nobody seemed to have been washed that day. All the enjoyment was of an exceedingly sombre character, so far as I saw it, though there was a richer variety of sports than at similar festivals in America. There were wooden horses, revolving in circles, to be ridden a certain number of rounds for a penny; also swinging cars gorgeously painted, and the newest named after Lord Raglan; and four cars balancing one another, and turned by a winch; and people with targets and rifles,-- the principal aim being to hit an apple bobbing on a string before the target; other guns for shooting at the distance of a foot or two, for a prize of filberts; and a game much in fashion, of throwing heavy sticks at earthen mugs suspended on lines, three throws for a penny. Also, there was a posture-master, showing his art in the centre of a ring of miscellaneous spectators, and handing round his bat after going through all his attitudes. The collection amounted to only one halfpenny, and, to eke it out, I threw in three more. There were some large booths with tables placed the whole length, at which sat men and women drinking and smoking pipes; orange-girls, a great many, selling the worst possible oranges, which had evidently been boiled to give them a show of freshness. There were likewise two very large structures, the walls made of boards roughly patched together, and rooted with canvas, which seemed to have withstood a thousand storms. Theatres were there, and in front there were pictures of scenes which were to be represented within; the price of admission being twopence to one theatre, and a penny to the other. But, small as the price of tickets was, I could not see that anybody bought them. Behind the theatres, close to the <b>board</b> <b>wall,</b> and perhaps serving as the general dressing-room, was a large windowed wagon, in which I suppose the company travel and live together. Never, to my imagination, was the mysterious glory that has surrounded theatrical representation ever since my childhood brought down into such dingy reality as this. The tragedy queens were the same coarse and homely women and girls that surrounded me on the green. Some of the people had evidently been drinking more than was good for them; but their drunkenness was silent and stolid, with no madness in it. No ebullition of any sort was apparent.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of lightweight framed gypsum <b>board</b> <b>walls</b> is very complicated {{due to its}} frequency dependency. Basically, it {{is determined by the}} material properties of the struc-tural members – the gypsum board and the studs – and the way of their assembly. In a test series the dynamic response of the leaf of different gypsum <b>board</b> <b>walls</b> is investi-gated and the wave numbers of free bending waves are measured in-situ. From the bending wave numbers it is possible to estimate the frequency dependent stiffness properties of the structure. The test walls are geometrically almost identical, but differ in their structural details, like for instance the stud spacing and the number of layers of gypsum board. Since the stiffness prop-erties of the used materials are known, respectively are also determined experimentally, it is possible to compare them with the measured properties of the leafs of the walls and define frequency ranges where structural members participate differently in the dynamic response of the leaf. The obtained results are very useful for the understanding of the dynamics of lightweight framed structures and can further be used for modeling or predicting the dynamic response, sound radiation, etc of gypsum <b>board</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R

50|$|Another {{carpentry}} method {{which is}} sometimes called plank wall, <b>board</b> <b>wall,</b> plank-on-plank, horizontal plank frame is the stacking of horizontal planks or boards to form a wall of solid lumber. Sometimes the planks were staggered or spaced apart to form keys for a coat of plaster. This method was recommended by Orson Squire Fowler for octagon houses in his book The Octagon House: A Home for All in 1848. Fowler mentions he had seen this wall type being built in central New York state while traveling in 1842.|$|E
50|$|One {{member of}} a team stands before a <b>board</b> <b>wall</b> with {{openings}} for both hands. Both hosts enable the guest to touch two items: an edible and inedible item. The guest does not get to freely touch the items, but are limited {{to as much as}} the host wants them to touch. After contact with the items consecutively, the guest must decide whether which item he touched is edible. Guessed correctly would earn the team $5000 HK. Harlem would hit the guest with the inedible item if guessed incorrectly.|$|E
50|$|Fort Mitchell Depot is a {{historic}} railway depot located at Fort Mitchell, Lunenburg County, Virginia. It is a one-story, four-bay, rectangular frame vernacular building that is approximately 20 feet wide and 48 feet long. It consists of two sections: the rear, freight portion of the depot, built about 1860, of heavy timber, mortise and tenon construction and clad with board and batten siding; and the front passenger portion of the depot built about 1884. The passenger portion consists of two segregated waiting rooms separated by a vertical, beaded <b>board</b> <b>wall.</b> It ceased use as a passenger station in 1956.|$|E

After smelling both sides respectively, the guest must decide within five seconds whether the right or left hand side contains the edible dish base on their sense. Guessed correctly would earn the team $5000 HK. However, punishment applies if guessed wrong. Both team member either have to taste or take a bite of the inedible dish.|$|E
50|$|One {{structure}} was a rectangle approximately 8 m by 16 m in size. There {{appear to have}} been two different buildings on this location, both constructed {{in the first half of}} the 17th century, with one possibly oriented slightly differently from the other, but generally northwest to southeast. This was interpreted as an original building being refurbished or replaced by a later building on the same site. The structure had a hard-packed sandy clay floor, with a roof supported by posts. There is little evidence of walls, although small pieces of fired clay may represent chinking in a wattle or <b>board</b> <b>wall.</b> This {{structure was}} smaller than the church buildings typically found at other missions in Florida, but may have been a chapel or the convento (priest's house).|$|E
50|$|The keeping {{room of the}} {{original}} house is its largest room and has an impressive system of framing with its original posts, girts, and exposed summer beams of solid oak and chestnut. The ceiling is exposed beam. The wide <b>board</b> <b>wall</b> sheathing was at some point covered with plaster as it remains today. There {{is also a very}} early corner cupboard opposite the enormous fireplace. It has what appears to be {{the original}}, planed, single plank, batten door along with two hand-wrought, butterfly hinges. The oak chimney trees (fireplace lintels) throughout the home are enormous as well as completely petrified. This author's own observation, far less than scientific, would indicate that based on the size of the trees used in construction as well as when they were installed, would make much of the wood in the house close to a millennium old.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his quest}} for enlightenment, recounted in the last chapter of the Flower Ornament Scripture, Sudhana would {{converse}} with a diverse array of 52 kalyāṇa-mittatā (wise advisors), 20 of whom are female, including an enlightened prostitute named Vasumitrā, Gautama Buddha's wife and his mother, a queen, a princess and several goddesses. Male sages include a slave, a child, a physician, a ship's captain. The antepenultimate master of Sudhana's pilgrimage is Maitreya. It is here that Sudhana encounters the Tower of Maitreya, which — along with Indra's net - is a most startling metaphor for the infinite: In {{the middle of the}} great tower... he saw the billion-world universe... and everywhere there was Sudhana at his feet... Thus Sudhana saw Maitreya's practices of... transcendence over countless eons (kalpa), from each of the squares of the check <b>board</b> <b>wall...</b> In the same way Sudhana... saw the whole supernal manifestation, was perfectly aware of it, understood it, contemplated it, used it as a means, beheld it, and saw himself there. The penultimate master that Sudhana visits is the Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, the bodhisattva of great wisdom. Thus, one of the grandest of pilgrimages approaches its conclusion by revisiting where it began. The Gaṇḍavyūha suggests that with a subtle shift of perspective we may come to see that the enlightenment that the pilgrim so fervently sought was not only with him at every stage of his journey, but before it began as well—that enlightenment is not something to be gained, but [...] "something" [...] the pilgrim never departed from.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: 20 % {{of total}} energy use to sustain {{temperature}} of building inside. In this reasons, researchers {{effort to improve}} the thermal insulation capacity with new wall system. Using appropriate materials and consisting new wall system should considered in energy saving design. OSB(Oriented strand board), Larch lining board used to consist wall system. 2 x 6 Larch lining board has tongue & groove shape for preventing moisture. Comparing with gypsum board and green timber lining board as interior sheathing material, temperature difference of Green timber wall system was bigger than temperature difference of gypsum <b>board</b> <b>wall</b> system. This aspects indicate that Green timber wall system was revealed higher thermal insulation property than gypsum <b>board</b> <b>wall</b> system.

The concept of ultra wideband radar (UWB radar) is an emerging technology, which offers high spatial resolution, as opposed to narrow band radars. Thus, TWI applications using UWB radar have become a growing field of research with several applications in the civil and defense areas such as rescue and surveillance. For this study, a prototype system of UWB radar to TWI has been built.
