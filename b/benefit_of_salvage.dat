40|$|Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL) {{accounts}} for 3 % of all primary brain tumors {{with a median}} age at onset of about 62 years. In {{the vast majority of}} cases, PCNSL presents as unifocal or multifocal enhancing lesions on MRI, frequently adjacent to the ventricles. Stereotactic biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice revealing high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma in more than 90 % of cases. Therapy is not evidence based. When eligible, patients should be included in clinical trials. In patients younger than 60 years cure is the aim. Polychemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate (MTX) or alternatively high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue should be offered to patients eligible for this regimens. For patients over 60 years of age no curative regimen with acceptable toxicity has yet been established. An MTX-based chemotherapy, for example, in combination with temozolomide, is recommended. The role of radiotherapy as part of the initial treatment is not established; however, the combination of radiotherapy with MTX-based chemotherapy potentially leads to severe long-term neurotoxic sequelae. Therefore, radiotherapy as part of the initial therapy is not recommended by the author outside clinical trials. At relapse or in cases of refractory disease, patients will frequently <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> therapy, which depends on the initial treatment...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The {{clinical}} <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> oesophagectomy {{in patients}} who recur after radical chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is not clearly defined. This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome {{in patients who}} underwent salvage oesophagectomy having failed primary CRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1999 and October 2005, 181 patients with oesophageal cancer were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital with definitive CRT. Ten patients underwent salvage oesophagectomy. All of them had locally advanced cancer of the oesophagus at presentation (adenocarcinoma in three patients and squamous cell carcinoma in seven patients) and received combined CRT, consisting of 12 weeks of cisplatin and 5 -fluorouracil-based chemotherapy followed by CRT. Radiotherapy was delivered with a computed tomography-planned technique to a dose of 54 Gy with daily 5 -fluorouracil. RESULTS: An Ivor-Lewis procedure {{was carried out in}} all cases. The median time between the end of CRT and surgery was 5 months (range 1 - 67). Curative resection was achieved in three patients, seven had microscopic positive circumferential margins. One patient died postoperatively and complications occurred in four cases: anastomotic leak in two patients, pneumonia in one patient, empyema and sepsis in one patient. The median critical care unit stay was 7 days (range 4 - 26) and hospitalisation was 21 days (range 15 - 84). With a median follow-up period of 45. 5 months (range 5 - 89) the 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year survival calculated from the completion of CRT was 70, 50 and 30 %, respectively. Median survival was 21. 5 months (range 8 - 90). CONCLUSIONS: Salvage oesophagectomy may prolong survival in carefully selected patients with local relapse.

40|$|Allogeneic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (allo-SCT) using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is a feasible procedure in selected patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), but its efficacy remains {{a matter of}} debate. The mortality and morbidity related to the procedure and the rather high relapse risk make the use of allo-SCT controversial. In addition, the availability of novel antimyeloma treatments, such as bortezomib and immunomodulatory agents, have made allo-SCT less appealing to clinicians. We investigated the role of RIC allo-SCT in patients with MM who relapsed after autologous stem cell transplantation and were then treated with a salvage therapy based on novel agents. This study was structured similarly to an intention-to-treat analysis and included only those patients who underwent HLA typing immediately after the relapse. Patients with a donor (donor group) and those without a suitable donor (no-donor group) were compared. A total of 169 consecutive patients were evaluated retrospectively in a multicenter study. Of these, 75 patients found a donor and 68 (91 %) underwent RIC allo-SCT, including 24 from an HLA-identical sibling (35 %) and 44 from an unrelated donor (65 %). Seven patients with a donor did not undergo allo-SCT for progressive disease or concomitant severe comorbidities. The 2 -year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 22 % in the donor group and 1 % in the no-donor group (P < 0001). The 2 -year progression-free survival (PFS) was 42 % in the donor group and 18 % in the no-donor group (P < 0001). The 2 -year overall survival (OS) was 54 % in the donor group and 53 % in the no-donor group (P = 329). In multivariate analysis, lack of a donor was a significant unfavorable factor for PFS, but not for OS. Lack of chemosensitivity after salvage treatment and high-risk karyotype at diagnosis significantly shortened OS. In patients who underwent allo-SCT, the development of chronic graft-versus-host disease had a significant protective effect on OS. This study provides evidence for a significant PFS <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> treatment with novel drugs followed by RIC allo-SCT in patients with relapsed MM who have a suitable dono...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe NADiA ProsVue is a {{prognostic}} {{system that}} measures prostate-specific antigen slope to identify men at {{lower risk of}} clinical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. We developed a decision-modeling framework to evaluate its cost-effectiveness to guide the use of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART). MethodsWe populated the model using patient-level data and external sources. Patients were classified as intermediate risk or high risk {{on the basis of}} Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram and then stratified by the ProsVue slope (≤ 2 pg/mL/mo; > 2 pg/mL/mo) and receipt of ART. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the effect of the ProsVue slope on the use of ART and other model parameters. ResultsThe cost-effectiveness of the ProsVue-guided strategy varied widely because of small differences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 10 years. In the intermediate-risk group, when the use of ART decreased from 20 % (standard care) to 7. 5 % among patients with a ProsVue slope value of  2 pg/mL/mo or less, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 25, 160 /QALY. In the high-risk group, the use of ART would have to decrease from 40 % (standard care) to 11. 5 % among those with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less to obtain a ratio of $ 50, 000 /QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> therapy, quality <b>of</b> life, and costs of ART and ProsVue testing. ConclusionsThe effect of the ProsVue system on costs will be dependent {{on the extent to which}} ART decreases among men identified as having a low risk of recurrence. Its effect on QALYs will remain conditional on uncertain clinical and quality-of-life benefits associated with ART...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Reducing future fire {{severity}} is {{a proposed}} ecological <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> logging following wildfire disturbance. Considerable debate continues over {{the ability of}} such management practices to achieve this objective given limited understanding of coarse woody detritus (CWD) dynamics, fuel bed alterations, and post-fire vegetative growth. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the dynamics of snags and logs in conjunction with surface fuel accumulation following high-severity fire disturbance in dry-mixed conifer forests of Oregon’s eastern Cascades. Snag dynamics (fall and breakage rates) were estimated for Abies sp., Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta in three DBH classes of 41 cm (large). A total of 5, 103 snags in thirty 0. 25 -ha plots were sampled at seven different fire sites, covering a 24 year chronosequence following high-severity fire disturbance. Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta snags had the quickest fall rates with estimated half-lives of 7 - 8 and 12 - 13 years for small and medium sized snags, respectively. Large Pinus ponderosa snags had an estimated half-life of 17 - 18 years. Abies sp. snags fall rates were slower, with half-life estimates of 8 - 9, 14 - 15 and 20 - 21 years for small, medium and large snags respectively. Breakage rates were variable but correlated with wood strength, crown and stem weight and crown position (exposure to wind). Decomposition loss rate-constants were obtained from the same fire sites, up to seven years post-fire, by removing three cross-sections from each of sixty fire-killed Abies sp. snags, sixty Pinus ponderosa snags, and forty Pinus ponderosa logs. Abies sp. snags exhibited significant decay with an estimated decomposition loss rate-constant of k = 0. 0149 yr⁻¹. Pinus ponderosa snags did not exhibit significant decay, but logs did. Sapwood and heartwood decomposition loss rate-constants equaled k = 0. 0362 yr⁻¹ and k = 0. 0164 yr⁻¹, respectively. These values confirm hypothesized differences in decay rates among species and between snags and logs in dry forest environments. An empirical model was developed to link snag fall and breakage with snag and log decomposition during succession in order to estimate the contribution of fire killed biological legacies to fine and coarse woody detritus accumulation. Legacy CWD is responsible for the largest total accumulation of surface fuel as snags break and fall, but primarily in 100 - and 1000 -hr fuel classes. Decomposition rates increase as CWD moves from standing to downed material, reducing total CWD biomass by 30 - 50...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Retropharyngeal {{lymph node}} (RPLN) {{metastasis}} is an uncommon finding {{in patients with}} oral cavity squamous carcinoma (OSCC). We sought to investigate the clinical outcomes, clinicopathological characteristics, and the priority of treatment with curative intent in OSCC patients with RPLN involvement. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2007 and January 2011, we identified 36 patients with primary RPLN metastases (n =  10) or RPLN relapse (n =  26). The follow-up continued until June 2013. Disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and the potential <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> therapy served as the main outcome measures. RESULTS: The 2 -year DSS and DFS rates of untreated patients with RPLN involvement were 20 % and 24 %, respectively. Level IV/V neck lymph node involvement was an adverse prognostic factor for DSS (P =  0. 048) and DFS (P =  0. 018). All of the patients presenting with neck lymph node involvement at level IV/V died within 6 months. Among patients who were treated for RPLN relapse, the 2 -year DSS and DFS rates from the relapse day were 12. 8 % and 9. 6 %, respectively. Concomitant contralateral neck lymph node metastases (N 2 c) were associated with lower 2 -year DSS (P =  0. 005) and DFS (P =  0. 011) rates. Moreover, five (55 %) of the nine patients with recurrent disease in the contralateral RPLN had distant metastases within 6 months. Salvage therapy yielded the maximum survival benefit in patients without N 2 c disease and ipsilateral RPLN involvement alone (P =  0. 005). CONCLUSION: OSCC patients with RPLN involvement have poor outcomes. The risk factor for definitive treatment in OSCC patients with FDG PET/CT defined RPLN disease in primary disease was neck lymph node involvement at level IV/V and N 2 c and/or contralateral RPLN disease in recurrent disease. Treatment efforts with curative intent should be tailored according to individual risk factors...|$|R
40|$|For primary {{radiation}} therapy (RT) of prostate cancer, dose intensification is established as standard of care. Less is known {{on the role}} of dose intensification in the postprostatectomy setting for salvage RT. Thus, we aimed to identify and summarize the existing literature. In retrospective analyses, dose-intensified salvage RT showed a superior biochemical control compared to standard dose salvage radiation with favorable acute and late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity rates, especially when modern radiation techniques such as intensity modulated RT were applied. We identified one randomized phase III trial addressing the potential <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> dose-intensified <b>salvage</b> RT (SAKK 09 / 10). Recently, acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities and early quality of life data of this trial were reported, and no significant difference in acute toxicities between both treatment arms were found; however, a significant worsening of genitourinary quality of life was noted in the dose-intensified treatment arm.

40|$|Locally {{recurrent}} {{prostate cancer}} after radiation therapy, {{also known as}} radiorecurrent prostate cancer, has an unfavorable prognosis. Two-thirds of patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer have an advanced pathological disease status {{by the time they}} undergo salvage therapy. Several salvage therapies for radiorecurrent prostate cancer are available. Salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP) and salvage cryoablation are the most feasible and effective therapies for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.

40|$|Inadequate {{mobilization}} of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) {{is sometimes a}} limiting factor to proceed with an autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT), in an otherwise eligible patient. In such situations, a bone marrow harvest (BMH) procedure may be considered to achieve the CD 34 + target dose for an autograft.

We report here, 6 patients who underwent BMH after PBPC mobilization failure with plerixafor. The median CD 34 + yield with plerixafor mobilization and BMH were 1. 15 x 10 ^ 6 /Kg (range, 0. 2 - 1. 7 × 10 ^ 6 /Kg) and 0. 32 (range, 0. 12 - 0. 38 × 10 ^ 6 /Kg), respectively.

40|$|Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are {{the most}} common benign renal {{neoplasm}} and are often discovered incidentally. Due to both an increase in the use of imaging, as well as advances in imaging technology, they are being increasing identified in the general population. As these lesions are benign, there is good evidence that the majority of them can be safely followed up without treatment. However, there is an increasing wealth of information available suggesting there are individuals with AMLs where prophylactic treatment is indicated to prevent complications such as haemorrhage. In such cases, treatment with radiological interventional techniques with subselective particle embolization has superseded surgical techniques in most cases. Even in emergency cases with catastrophic rupture, prompt embolization may save the patient with the additional <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> renal <b>salvage.</b> Confident identification <b>of</b> a lesion as an AML is important as its benign nature obviates the need for surgery in most cases.

40|$|AbstractThrombolytic {{therapy for}} the removal of {{intravascular}} thrombi was introduced when streptokinase was first given to humans 40 years ago, the same year the American College of Cardiology was founded. Streptokinase was first administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction in 1959. Today, thrombolytic therapy has been established to offer significant benefits to patients with acute myocardial infarction provided they are brought to medical attention early enough after the onset of symptoms. The two major agents, streptokinase and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), have been shown to result in reperfusion of infarct-related arteries, to salvage ischemic myocardium, to improve myocardial performance and to reduce mortality. In spite of these impressive gains, this novel therapy has shortcomings. The interval from the start of thrombolytic treatment to coronary reperfusion varies significantly from patient to patient and may, at times, be too long to produce a real <b>benefit</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> <b>of</b> ischemic myocardium. The rate of reocclusion lies somewhere between 10 % and 20 % and appears not to be influenced by concomitant heparin anticoagulation. The rate of bleeding complications even with the “fibrin-specific” rt-PA is higher than anticipated and may range from 10 % to 30 %. As a consequence, intensive efforts are being directed at the development of improved thrombolytic agents and for adjunctive therapy evaluating better anticoagulants than heparin and better anti-platelet agents than aspirin. This review is a status report summarizing where we are in thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, where we need to improve treatment results and what is being done mainly at the preclinical level to bring about such improvements...|$|R

This {{study sought to}} determine trends and predictors <b>of</b> <b>salvage</b> treatment after failure of primary treatment in a community cohort over the past 10 years. METHODS From the community-based Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database, 6275 patients were identified who initiated a form of primary treatment for prostate cancer; 839 of these were identified as failing treatment by biochemical recurrence or initiation of secondary treatment between 2000 and 2010. Salvage therapy was categorized as either systemic, local, or none. Patient characteristics were tested for association with salvage therapy using analysis of variance, Pearson chi-square tests, and multinomial logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of the 839 patients identified as failing therapy, 390 (47 %), 146 (17 %), and 303 (36 %) received systemic, local, or no salvage therapy, respectively.
