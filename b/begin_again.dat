It was later screened on April 26, 2014 on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's title was changed from Can a Song Save Your Life? to <b>Begin</b> <b>Again</b> between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers {{found it difficult to}} remember and it was often misquoted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Begin</b> <b>Again</b> is a 2013 American musical comedy-drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by John Carney and starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo.

5|$|The {{plan was}} to <b>begin</b> <b>again</b> in 1976, and seed typhoons by flying out of Guam. However, {{political}} issues blocked the plan.

5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can <b>begin</b> <b>again.</b> However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him {{on the wrong side of}} the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would <b>begin</b> <b>again</b> years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E

5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were {{intended}} as improved {{versions of the}} s, but were recast as battlecruisers after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, saw no real need for more battleships. A number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to {{the bulk of the}} Grand Fleet's battlecruisers so the design was revised to counter these. The class was going to consist of , Anson, Howe, and Rodney—all names of famous Admirals—but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to <b>begin</b> <b>again</b> with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} KB-4, the surface ship design bureau of the Baltic Shipyard, was {{selected}} for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements. They did manage to get agreement on 22 November 1936 for a thickening of the deck armor that raised the displacement to about 47,000 tons. Design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47,700 tons in April 1937, but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships. The issue was resolved by Premier Stalin at a meeting on 4 July when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56,000 tons. This forced the project to <b>begin</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may <b>begin</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before casting Keira Knightley as Gretta, Carney {{considered}} {{casting a}} pop singer such as Adele {{in the main}} role, {{as well as a}} number of other actresses including Scarlett Johansson, who was at one point attached to the project. Knightley, who had never sung professionally before, prepared for the role by training with a vocal coach and learning how to play a guitar. Mark Ruffalo was Carney's first choice for the role of Dan, and agreed to star in the film after Carney sent him the first draft of the screenplay. Singer Adam Levine was also the only person Carney considered casting as Dave, and won the role after talking with Carney over Skype and recording some dialogue as an audition; he declined to be paid for appearing in the film. Although he had had minor acting parts on television before, <b>Begin</b> <b>Again</b> marked his first role in a film. Carney approached James Corden to appear in the film after admiring Corden's performance in the lead role in a Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were to {{have been}} a class of four British Royal Navy battlecruisers {{designed}} near the end of World War I. Their design began as an improved version of the s, but it was recast as a battlecruiser after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, pointed out that there was no real need for more battleships, but that a number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to the bulk of the Grand Fleet's battlecruisers and the design was revised to counter these. The class was to have consisted of , Anson, Howe, and Rodney — all names of famous admirals — but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to <b>begin</b> <b>again</b> with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919. No more battlecruisers would be built due to the arms limitations agreements of the interbellum.|$|E
5|$|For the 72nd Academy Awards, the Academy invited 75 {{countries}} to submit films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The submission deadline {{was set on}} November 1, 1999. Forty-seven countries submitted films to the Academy, surpassing the record set in 1994. The Asian nations of Bhutan, Nepal and Tajikistan submitted films {{for the first time}} ever. The nominations were announced on February 15, 2000, and the winner was revealed during the awards presentation held on March 26, 2000. Belgium's submission Rosetta was not nominated, even though it had received the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival the previous year. Nepal received its first and so far only nomination for Caravan, a film made in the Tibetan language, which is spoken in parts of Nepal, about the country's now disappearing salt-trade system. The four other nominated films came from France, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The latter received its nomination for Solomon and Gaenor, the first film made entirely in Welsh and Yiddish. Spain eventually won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Pedro Almodóvar's All About My Mother. It was the country's third win after Volver a Empezar (To <b>Begin</b> <b>Again)</b> in 1982 and Belle Époque in 1993. Almodóvar dedicated the award to the Spanish people and to Spain, and had to be dragged from the stage after an overlong speech in which he thanked numerous saints and relatives.|$|E

5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to <b>begin</b> <b>again</b> in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E
5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would <b>begin</b> <b>again</b> by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E
