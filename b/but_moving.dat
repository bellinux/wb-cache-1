5|$|Edward VIII did {{not spend}} much of his reign at Windsor Castle. He {{continued}} {{to spend most of}} his time at Fort Belvedere in the Great Park, where he had lived whilst Prince of Wales. Edward created a small aerodrome at the castle on Smith's Lawn, now used as a golf-course. Edward's reign was short-lived and he broadcast his abdication speech to the British Empire from the castle in December 1936, adopting the title of Duke of Windsor. His successor, George VI also preferred his own original home, the Royal Lodge in the Great Park, but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife Elizabeth. As king, George revived the annual Garter Service at Windsor, drawing on the accounts of the 17th-century ceremonies recorded by Elias Ashmole, <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> the event to Ascot Week in June.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{properties}} described in articles about electromagnetism, charge is a relativistic invariant. This means that any particle that has charge Q, {{no matter how}} fast it goes, always has charge Q. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of one helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) {{is the same as}} two deuterium nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).|$|E

Randy Orton, assuming Batista was announcing his retirement, then came out and stated that he ended Batista's career.

He then announced that he will not retire, <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> to SmackDown instead. Later that night, he defeated Orton in a no-holds barred match which was to be his last match on Raw.|$|E

25|$|Speed {{remained}} with Moore for the 1994 season starting off with finishes of sixth at Atlanta, fifth at Darlington and third at Bristol, {{moving up to}} fifth place in the points. Two races later, Speed finished seventh at Talladega. It was during this time that Speed {{was inducted into the}} karting hall of fame. Speed would {{have to wait until the}} July Daytona race to get another top ten finish, a tenth. Speed and the team ran good through the summer stretch, often starting near the rear of the field <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> to the front. Unfortunately, Speed did not manage a top ten finish until Dover where he finished ninth. In the final four races, Speed had three great runs. A fifth at Charlotte, a tenth at Rockingham and a fourth at Atlanta where he led twenty laps. It wasn't enough for Speed to finish in the top ten in points. He finished eleventh behind Bill Elliott.|$|E
25|$|On May 6, Hancock's II Corps {{attacked}} Hill at 5 a.m., overwhelming the Third Corps {{with the}} divisions of Wadsworth, Birney, and Mott; Getty and Gibbon were in support. Lee had assured Hill that Longstreet's Corps would arrive to reinforce Hill before dawn, <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> cross-country in the dark, they made slow progress and lost their way at times. Ewell's {{men on the}} Turnpike had attacked first, at 4:45a.m., but continued to be pinned down by attacks from Sedgwick's and Warren's corps {{and could not be}} relied upon for assistance. Before a total collapse, however, reinforcements arrived at 6 a.m., Brig. Gen. John Gregg's 800-man Texas Brigade, the vanguard of Longstreet's column. General Lee, caught up in the excitement, began to move forward with the advancing brigade. As the Texans realized this, they halted, refusing to move forward unless Lee remained in the rear.|$|E
25|$|Janet and Van Korrell {{purchased}} {{the house when}} the Cannons left in 1992. Janet had been fascinated with the Frank Lloyd Wright designed house for some time, and they quickly tore off the enclosed staircase that the Suttons had added 50 years earlier {{to get up to}} the balcony on the back. Determined to restore it as fully as possible, in 1999 they hired John G. Thorpe to oversee the work. Thorpe, a Wright expert, restoration architect, and {{one of the founders of}} the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust in Oak Park, Illinois, worked with the original plans and old photos on a complete restoration inside and out, including the Wright-designed cupboards, the ground-level entry, and the daring cantilevered veranda roof. As part of this work, the Korrells elected to build an addition in the previously open northwest corner, balancing the original northeast corner bedroom <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> away from Wright's cruciform design. This addition incorporates a modern laundry and a second stairway to the basement.|$|E

25|$|Drift diving {{occurs when}} the divers allow {{themselves}} to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem.|$|E

500|$|According to Rodgers' biographer William Hyland, {{the score}} for The King and I {{is much more}} {{closely tied to the}} action than that of South Pacific, [...] "which had its share of purely {{entertaining}} songs". [...] For example, the opening song, [...] "I Whistle a Happy Tune", establishes Anna's fear upon entering a strange land with her small son, but the merry melody also expresses her determination to keep a stiff upper lip.

500|$|Mole crickets stridulate {{like other}} crickets by {{scraping}} the rear {{edge of the}} left forewing, which forms a plectrum, against the lower surface of the right forewing, which has a ratchet-like series of asymmetric teeth: the more acute edges face backwards, as do those of the plectrum. The plectrum can move forwards with little resistance; <b>but</b> <b>moving</b> it backwards makes it catch each tooth, setting up a vibration in both wings. The sound-producing stroke is the raising (levation) of the wings. The resulting song resembles the result of modulating a pure tone with a 66 Hertz wave to form regular chirps. In G. vineae, the wing levator muscle, which weighs 50 milligrams, can deliver 3.5 milliWatts of mechanical power; G. gryllotalpa can deliver about 1 milliWatt. G. vineae produces an exceptionally loud song from half an hour after sunset, continuing for an hour; it can be heard up to 600 metres away. At a distance of 1 metre from the burrow, the sound has a mean power over the stridulation cycle of up to 88 decibels; the loudest recorded peak power was about 92 decibels; at the mouths of the burrow, the sound reaches around 115 decibels. G. gryllotalpa can deliver a peak sound pressure of 72 decibels and a mean of about 66 decibels. [...] The throat of the horn appears to be tuned (offering low inductive reactance), making the burrow radiate sound efficiently; the efficiency increases when the burrow is wet and absorbs less sound. Mole crickets are the only insects that construct a sound-producing apparatus. Given the known sensitivity of a cricket's hearing (60 decibels), a night-flying G. vineae female {{should be able to}} detect the male's song at a range of 30 metres; this compares to about 5 metres for a typical Gryllus cricket that does not construct a burrow.|$|E
