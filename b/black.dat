Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on <b>black</b> land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E

On August 27, 1832, <b>Black</b> Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the <b>black</b> swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a <b>black</b> swan as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and <b>black</b> swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, <b>black</b> swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, <b>black</b> swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest).

25|$|The {{volatile}} {{social conditions}} produced white-led riots against <b>blacks</b> in 1829, when many <b>blacks</b> {{lost their homes}} and property.

White-led riots against <b>blacks</b> occurred in 1836, when an abolitionist press was twice destroyed; and in 1842. More than one thousand <b>blacks</b> abandoned the city after the 1829 riots. <b>Blacks</b> in Philadelphia and other major cities raised money to help the refugees recover from the destruction.

5|$|Away colours {{have tended}} to be either white—often with <b>black</b> shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and <b>black,</b> referring back to the <b>black</b> and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks.

5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a <b>black</b> market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food on the <b>black</b> market was extremely expensive.

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up <b>black</b> feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and <b>black</b> empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other <b>black</b> female artists - has held back with her identity as a <b>black</b> woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a <b>black</b> woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues <b>black</b> women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about <b>black</b> feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of <b>black</b> women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
