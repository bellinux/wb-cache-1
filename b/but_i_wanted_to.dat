The lighting was described as [...] "saturated, but low and naturalistic" [...] to give the video a cinematic feel, referencing the 1995 film Leaving Las Vegas. It premiered on TRL on April 12, 2004. Spears called the show and explained the video explored reincarnation. She added, [...] "It's more like a movie. It's different than anything I've ever done.

500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts that had to do with really big visual pictures. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E

500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, it was {{reported}} that Jeethu Joseph will be directing a film titled My Family with Mohanlal in the lead. In August 2013, Jeethu clarified that the film was titled Drishyam. A thread similar to that of Drishyam has been with the director since the early 1990s. He was inspired by a conversation he had overheard about the plight of two families involved in a legal battle. Jeethu had penned the story of Drishyam even before Memories (2013). He says, [...] "I started working on the subject some two years back. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> stick to the planned order and hence postponed the project till I finished Memories". The script was initially planned to be filmed by another director but since that director could not find a producer, Jeethu took back the script and decided to direct it himself. Drishyam contrasts from the director's previous films. He says, [...] "Different films require different treatment. I toiled hard while filming Memories as the film was full of twists and turns and the handling of the subject mattered a lot. But Drishyam is a complete script-oriented film that does not require any special effort. We shot the film sticking completely to the script, and the shooting was completed effortlessly." ...|$|E

Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for {{whatever it is you}} believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E

During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, [...] "That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. If you ask me why, it was Beyoncé.

500|$|According to Lucy O'Brien, {{author of}} , the main concept of American Life was about [...] "nothing". This {{was evident in}} the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the {{negative}} tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] began as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife. He asked singer Jem Archer to collaborate with him and during their first collaborative session, they wrote a song called [...] "Silly Thing", inspired by Sigsworth's wife. He said: [...] "I never write love songs, but I was moved to write one for her. I've never had a problematic relationship with her, there's not been a lot of drama. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write something naive and honest." [...] The demo, which sounded like an offbeat folk song, was later played for Madonna, who loved it and added to and changed parts and the title of the song. In September 2012, Sigsworth leaked the original version of [...] "Nothing Fails", describing it as a [...] "work-in-progress demo of a song I originally wrote with Jem, and which later became 'Nothing Fails', co-written and recorded by Madonna.

500|$|Odubade {{opted to}} stay at Eastbourne Borough ahead of the 2005–06 season, and {{subsequently}} started in the club's {{first game of the}} season, scoring the only goal of the game in a 1–0 away win against Bishop's Stortford. Odubade scored his second goal of the season a week later, scoring the opening goal of the match as Eastbourne lost 3–2 against Basingstoke Town, as well as scoring in the club's 2–1 home loss to Weston-Super-Mare. After scoring three goals in the club's first five matches of the season, Odubade failed to score again until November 2005 – scoring Eastbourne's goal in a 1–1 draw against Carshalton Athletic. He also scored and assisted a goal in the club's 3–2 away victory against Farnborough Town at Cherrywood Road. Odubade impressed in the club's FA Cup run during the same season, helping the club take Oxford United to a replay in November 2005. After impressing Oxford manager Brian Talbot in the two ties, Odubade joined Oxford two months later for a fee of £25,000 on an 18-month contract. On joining Oxford, Odubade said [...] "It brings a tear to my eye just the thought of leaving Eastbourne. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get back into the Football League and I just feel I am very lucky to have this second chance".

500|$|Writer Brian K. Vaughan {{conceived}} Saga in his childhood, {{calling it}} [...] "a fictional universe that I created when I was bored in math class. I just kept building it." [...] He {{was inspired by}} such influences as Star Wars, Flash Gordon and children's books, and has also invoked the awe and wonder of first seeing the Silver Surfer, which seemed an [...] "incredible and different" [...] concept to him. It was not until his wife became pregnant with his second daughter, however, that he conceived of the protagonists, the winged Alana and the horned Marko, two lovers from warring extraterrestrial races who struggle to survive with their newborn daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the series. It was also {{at this point that}} the central theme that Vaughan wanted for the book emerged. Vaughan explains, [...] "I wanted to write about parenthood, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> Trojan-horse it inside some sort of interesting genre story, to explore the overlap between artistic creation {{and the creation of a}} child." [...] Vaughan, who intended to return to writing a comics series following the 2010 conclusion of his previous series, Ex Machina, and who notes that the publication of Saga #1 coincided with the birth of his daughter, saw parallels between the caution advised by colleagues against launching a new book in the poor economy and those who cautioned against bringing a new child into the world, observing: ...|$|E
