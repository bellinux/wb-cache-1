50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the integrated regular-interval timetable in the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW-Takt) in 1998, the connection between Bielefeld and Braunschweig has been operated as the RE 70 under the name of the Weser-Leine Express, after the Weser and Leine rivers. It is being operated by DB Regio Nord until December 2015. The new tender process carried out in 2012 was won by WestfalenBahn, which will operate the so-called Mittellandlinie (midland line) from December 2015 until December 2030. According to a press statement, the number of seats will be increased by up to 60 per <b>bi-level</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} determining {{the maximum number of}} cars by zones in view of the capacity of the road network and the number of parking spaces available. In other words, the proposed model is to examine whether existing road network and parking supply is capable of accommodating future zonal car ownership growth (or the reserve capacity in each zone); i. e. the potential maximum zonal car ownership growth that generates the road traffic within the network capacity and parking space constraints. In the proposed model, the vehicular trip production and attraction are dependent on the car ownership, available parking spaces and the accessibility measures by traffic zones. The model is formulated as a bi-level programming problem. The lower-level problem is an equilibrium trip distribution/assignment problem, while the upper-level problem is to maximize the sum of zonal car ownership by considering travellers' route and destination choice behaviour and satisfying the network capacity and parking space constraints. A sensitivity analysis based heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the proposed <b>bi-level</b> <b>car</b> ownership problem and is illustrated with a numerical example. ...|$|E

5000|$|Until its {{nationalisation}} on 1 January 1938, when {{it became}} part of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the line was operated by the Lübeck-Büchen Railway Company (Lübeck-Büchener Eisenbahn, LBE). The LBE, which already operated the line in the 1930s with high quality <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars,</b> also introduced the distinctive slogan [...] "Hamburg, Lübeck, Travemünde-from the sea of houses on the sea" [...] (Aus dem Häusermeer an die See).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the western}} USA, cars {{are of the}} upper-level-connection type. They use low-platform stations, because the {{traditional}} single floor trains all had exterior entry steps to maximize flexibility (emergency and temporary stops) and minimize infrastructure costs. There are no examples of two floor platforms, {{so there are no}} platform doors on the upper floor. Car roof lines lengthwise are flat for connecting doors to the upstairs of <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars.</b> A Bombardier Amtrak Superliner car is [...] tall.|$|R

They were the only Odakyu trains with first-class seating in [...] "semi-compartments" [...] on the upper deck of two <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> {{in the center of}} each train.

The single-level DMUs have a passenger capacity of 94, while the bi-level models can carry 188 passengers. Both types are equipped with two [...] Detroit Diesel engines for propulsion. The single-level railcars have a capacity of 102 people, while the <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> can seat 218. The company also offers unpowered luxury railcars, dubbed the [...] "Ultradome." ...|$|R

50|$|Viewliner {{passenger}} cars {{are designed for}} use on Amtrak's long-distance routes in the Eastern US, due to clearance issues in and around both New York Pennsylvania Station and Baltimore Pennsylvania Station that prevent tall <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> from clearing the tunnels (see loading gauge and structure gauge). These long-distance routes typically include some segments of track along the Northeast Corridor, but extend to Chicago on two routes, to Miami on two routes, or south to New Orleans, well beyond the Northeast Corridor.|$|R
2500|$|Chicago and North Western also {{operated}} {{commuter train}} {{service in the}} Chicago area, where they developed what was perhaps the first control car. [...] A modified gallery car was built in 1960 with locomotive controls to allow push-pull operation. [...] Today, it is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. The C also pioneered the concept of Head End Power (HEP), generating 480 volt electricity from the locomotive to power the air conditioning, lighting, and heating on the new <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars.</b> This eventually became the standard for all railroads in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|The Penn Line {{runs about}} [...] between Washington, D.C., and Perryville, Maryland, via Baltimore Penn Station over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and Washington Terminal District. It is {{purported to be}} the fastest {{commuter}} rail line in North America, with trains of <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> and electric locomotives capable of operating at speeds up to [...] The service was initially operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad (hence the name) and is the busiest line, carrying more passengers {{than the other two}} lines combined. The Penn Line is the only line that operates on weekends.|$|R
50|$|RER {{will operate}} 4-car, bi-level {{electric}} multiple unit (EMU) sets {{which would be}} coupled to form 8- and 12-car trains. To reduce operating costs, smaller 4-car trains will run during periods of lighter demand, such as on weekends. GO Transit's existing fleet of unpowered <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> {{will be used to}} operate many peak services, but will be pulled by electric locomotives. EMUs cost less to operate than 12-car diesel trains and have faster acceleration. Journey times can be reduced significantly with electric traction depending on the route, stopping pattern and equipment.|$|R
50|$|Until 1969, the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad ran its Peninsula 400 to Ishpeming from Chicago. In {{its last}} days, the train {{consisted}} of one engine and one <b>bi-level</b> passenger <b>car.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Metrolink fleet {{consists}} of 55 locomotives, 137 active Bombardier Bi-level Coaches (Sentinel Fleet) and 137 Hyundai Rotem <b>Bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> (Guardian Fleet). An order for 20 more Rotem coaches was placed after Metrolink obtained a {{loan from the}} LACMTA in 2013, Metrolink's long-term plans for their Bombardier cars are uncertain as Metrolink's original goal was to replace all of their Bombardier coaches with the Rotem coaches, {{but this is not}} possible until 40 more Guardian Fleet orders are placed. Generation 1 Sentinel Fleet passenger coaches require major rehabilitation as they are close to the end of their service life.|$|R
5000|$|The low door {{cars were}} retired from service in 2005. Many {{of the cars}} were sold to Utah Transit Authority (UTA) for the FrontRunner service and leased to Metrolink in 2008 to help with an acute car {{shortage}} there. In 2010, Metrolink returned the cars to FrontRunner upon Metrolink's receiving delivery of its new [...] "Guardian Fleet" [...] <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars.</b> The Comet I cars have become popular with western commuter lines as the low door setup {{is compatible with the}} low-platform stations in use. Eight Comet Is were sold to SEPTA, but are now out of service and put into storage.|$|R
5000|$|Amtrak {{has worked}} closely with states using {{stimulus}} funds to purchase 130 next-generation <b>bi-level</b> <b>cars</b> and 35 next-generation diesel locomotives to upgrade corridor service in the Midwest, California, and Washington State. [...] Other major orders for new equipment are in the works, marking {{the beginning of a}} renewal of Amtrak's aging fleet. Using stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Amtrak rescued from the wreck yards more than 90 railcars, rebuilt them, and put them into service. The added capacity allowed Amtrak's passenger totals to grow by record numbers, more than one million year-over-year in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and revenues increased as well.|$|R
50|$|Some {{passenger}} trains, both {{long distance}} and short distance, may use <b>bi-level</b> (double-decker) <b>cars</b> to carry more passengers per train.
