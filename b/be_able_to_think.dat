5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E
25|$|According to Derkx, freethought {{serves to}} get one closer to the truth. To <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> freely, freedom of expression, free inquiry, freedom of association, freedom of {{assembly}} and tolerance are essential. All relevant possibilites about how the world is and works or should work, may be considered, discussed, investigated and argued out, despite potential aversion one may have regarding certain ideas. In the end, true knowledge is not achieved by any individual alone, but by a free exchange of thoughts with others. All ideas may be proposed and also criticised, no single opinion may be excluded.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{educational}} {{psychologists have}} conducted {{research on the}} instructional applicability of Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children {{need to be taught}} using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur {{at the same time in}} all domains. A child may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{important}} exception of Four Quartets, Eliot directed {{much of his}} creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said [...] "Every poet would like, I fancy, to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that he had some direct social utility [...] [...] [...] [...] He {{would like to be}} something of a popular entertainer, and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask.

2500|$|An {{aim of the}} Tractatus is {{to reveal}} the {{relationship}} between language and the world: what {{can be said about}} it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: [...] "What we can say at all can be said clearly," [...] he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: [...] "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what cannot be thought)." ...|$|E

I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything.

40|$|This {{research}} was a qualitative descriptive {{that aims to}} describe the critical thinking process {{of male and female}} senior high school students with dependent and independent cognitive style in solving contextual mathematics problems using Polya steps. Classification of students cognitive styles used group embedded figures test (GEFT). The subjects of this research were 4 students of XI year of SMA Negeri 1 Kartasura selected by purposive sampling. Validity of the data used time triangulation and the technique of data analysis were done by: (1) classifying the data into four problem solving steps: (a) understand the problem, (b) make a plan, (c) carry out the plan, and (d) look back at the completed solution, (2) presenting the data in narrative text, and (3) concluding the thinking process of students in each problem solving steps. The results show as follows: (1) Male students with a field dependent cognitive style in understanding: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> organize and analyze information or aspects of a problem. In making a plan: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> identify the material that is needed in formulating steps or solutions. In carrying out the plan: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> in the rational thinking and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make a valid conclusions. In looking back: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> rationally. (2) Male students with field independent cognitive styles in understanding: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> organize and analyze information or aspect of a problem, capable of conceptualizing, understanding an attitude and thinking rationally. In making a plan: the students <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> identify the material that is needed in formulating steps or solutions. In carrying out the plan: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> rationally, <b>to</b> make a valid conclusions, reflective thinking and understanding an attitude. In looking back: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> reflectively. (3) Female students with a field dependent cognitive style in understanding: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> organize and analyze information or aspect of a problem. In making a plan: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> identify the material that is needed in formulating steps or solutions.
