50|$|<b>Bufexamac</b> {{is thought}} to act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme cyclooxygenase, {{which would make it}} a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Evidence on the mechanism of action is scarce.Furthermore, <b>bufexamac</b> was identified as a specific inhibitor of class IIB histone deacetylases (HDAC6 and HDAC10).|$|E
50|$|Ointments and lotions {{containing}} <b>bufexamac</b> {{are used}} {{for the treatment of}} subacute and chronic eczema of the skin, including atopic eczema, as well as sunburn and other minor burns, and itching. Suppositories containing <b>bufexamac</b> in combination with local anaesthetics are used against haemorrhoids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bufexamac</b> {{can cause}} severe contact {{dermatitis}} {{which is often}} hard to distinguish from the initial condition. As a consequence, the European Medicines Agency recommended to withdraw the marketing approval in April 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bufexamac</b> {{is a drug}} used as an {{anti-inflammatory}} agent on the skin, as well as rectally. Common {{brand names}} include Paraderm and Parfenac. It was withdrawn in Europe because of allergic reactions.|$|E
40|$|A {{double blind}} {{study of the}} {{efficacy}} and tolerance of local injections of <b>bufexamac</b> versus triamcinolone acetonide has been performed in 39 patients suffering from abarticular rheumatism or osteoarthritis. No statistical difference has been noted between each product concerning their efficacy and tolerance, (good results: 45 % <b>bufexamac,</b> 58 % triamcinolone acetonide; local painful side-effects: 25 % <b>bufexamac,</b> 16 % triamcinolone acetonide). <b>Bufexamac</b> appears thus {{to be an interesting}} drug which might replace local steroid injection in some circumstances.

40|$|Lysine deacetylases inhibitors (KDACIs) {{are used}} in basic research, and many are being {{investigated}} in clinical trials for treatment of cancer and other diseases. However, their specificities in cells are incompletely characterized. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain acetylation signatures for 19 different KDACIs, covering all 18 human lysine deacetylases. Most KDACIs increased acetylation of a small, specific subset of the acetylome, including sites on histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. Inhibitor treatment combined with genetic deletion showed {{that the effects of}} the pan-sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide are primarily mediated by SIRT 1 inhibition. Furthermore, we confirmed that the effects of tubacin and <b>bufexamac</b> on cytoplasmic proteins result from inhibition of HDAC 6. <b>Bufexamac</b> also triggered an HDAC 6 -independent, hypoxia-like response by stabilizing HIF 1 -alpha, providing a possible mechanistic explanation of its adverse, pro-inflammatory effects. Our results offer a systems view of KDACI specificities, providing a framework for studying function of acetylation and deacetylases...|$|E

40|$|The Cambridge Structural Database {{incorporates}} an algorithm, {{based on}} data mining and statistical analysis of the structures in the database, for evaluating the “risk of polymorphism” in any compound. We have applied that algorithm {{to a number of}} pharmaceutically important compounds from the European Pharmacopoeia for which multiple crystal forms have not been reported. The survey suggested the possibility of polymorphism in at least two compounds, <b>bufexamac</b> and meglumine. The statistical analysis and the subsequent experimental search for polymorphism are reported here. While polymorphism was detected and characterized in both cases, the structural results were not necessarily compatible with the basis for the measure of the “risk of polymorphism”...|$|E
40|$|Topical {{application}} of 400 μg of cantharidin to the rat's ear caused an approximate doubling {{in the mean}} weight of uniform ear punch samples when compared to vehicle-treated controls at 72 hr, and produced a maximal response at 7 days. Dexamethasone reduced the increase in weight when applied topically, but was ineffective when given subcutaneously or orally at the same doses. Hydrocortisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, flurometholone, paramethasone acetate, fluocinolone acetonide, fluocinonide, and flurandrenolide showed significant suppression of cantharidin-induced inflammation. Cholesterol, diphenhydramine, tripelennamine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, cyproheptadine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, alpha-tocopherol, indomethacin, and <b>bufexamac</b> were inactive. It is suggested that the procedure employed {{may be useful in}} the screening and evaluation of topical anti-inflammatory agents...|$|E
40|$|The current {{interest}} in hydroxamic and polyhydroxamic acids {{is related to}} the vari-ety of their biological activities, as well as to their role as iron chelators and microbial siderophores (13). Antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities of hydroxamic acids are connected with their ability to inhibit various enzymes, viz., matrix metalloproteinases (4, 5), 5 -lipoxygenase (6, 7), urease (8) or ribonucleotid reduc-tase (9). Some ion exchange resins are based on hydroxamic acids (10), and a number of hydroxamic acids are currently accepted therapeutic agents (desferrioxamine B, hydro-xycarbamide, ibuproxam, oxametacin, <b>bufexamac,</b> adrafinil) (11). The promising thera-peutic potential of this class of compounds prompted us to screen antimicrobial activity of several hydroxamic acids previously synthesized by our group (12). In this paper, we report the results of the undertaken antimicrobial evaluation. EXPERIMENTA...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{effects of}} forty seven {{different}} substances (drugs, plant extracts, plant ingredients and polysaccharides) on UV irradiation induced lipid peroxidation were investigated. Methods: Two lipid systems of different complexity {{were used as}} in vitro screening models. Iron ions were added as transition metal catalysts. A UV irradiation device was used to create high level radiation. The amount of lipid peroxidation secondary products was quantified by the thiobarbituric acid assay detecting malondialdehyde. Results: The screening for antioxidative compounds for topical administration resulted in new, interesting findings. In the drug testings amantadine, <b>bufexamac,</b> tryptophan, melatonin, propranolol and hyaluronic acid were found to act antioxidatively whereas for ascorbic acid pro-oxidative effects were determined. Buckwheat extract significantly reduced the level of irradiation induced lipid peroxidation {{as well as the}} extracts of St. John`s Wort, melissa and sage. The resistant starch novelose 330 and the samples of locust bean gum from a swing mill grinding series showed lipid protection after UV irradiation in the polysaccharide test rows. Conclusions: Human skin is constantly exposed to UV light and oxygen. Therefore, the administration of protectors in cosmetic formulations or sunscreens, as found in this study, may be helpful {{for the protection of the}} human skin against UV induced damage. In vivo experiments with substances found as protectors should follow to allow in vitro-in vivo correlation and clinical interpretation of the data...|$|E
