5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy.

5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence.

40|$|Balance-of-powers {{arguments}} are ubiquitous in judicial opinions and academic articles that address separation-of-powers disputes over the president 2 ̆ 7 s removal authority, power to disregard statutes, authority to conduct foreign wars, and much else. However, the concept <b>of</b> the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> has never received a satisfactory theoretical treatment. This Essay examines possible theories <b>of</b> the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and rejects them all as unworkable and normatively questionable.

The proposed technique is based on finite control set model predictive control with two techniques which improve {{the behavior of the}} basic predictive algorithm to deal with different time constants in the system. The proposed algorithm uses approximation <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> losses by an exponential filter and furthermore, it combines this approximation with extended prediction horizon. The behavior of the system is then significantly improved with respect to <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> losses among the transistors and with respect to quality of the output current...|$|R

5|$|Calls for the {{abolition}} of Europe's monarchies have been widespread since the development of republicanism in the 17th to 18th centuries during the Enlightenment. During the French Revolution, the Ancien Régime in France was abolished, and in all territories the French First Republic conquered during the following Coalition Wars, sister republics were proclaimed. However, after Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French in 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic European Restoration reaffirmed the monarchical <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> not dependent on outside aid.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, George {{resigned}} as field marshal, never {{to go on}} active service again. In 1710, he was granted the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Empire, an office formerly held by the Elector Palatine—the absence of the Elector of Bavaria allowed a reshuffling of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but {{was removed from the}} French line of succession, and the Elector of Bavaria was restored.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this success, joined {{by the forces of}} John Doukas, John Palaiologos marched south into Thessaly, seizing and fortifying its fortresses, until he reached the town of Neopatras, where he made his camp for a time. He then continued on into Boeotia, the territory of the Duchy of Athens, where he took and plundered Levadeia and Thebes. At this point, however, John Doukas defected back to his father, upsetting the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and John himself was soon after recalled to Lampsacus. Thus, his conquest of Greece remained incomplete and was soon reversed by the recovery of Epirus' fortunes.|$|E
