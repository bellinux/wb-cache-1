2500|$|In game theory, perfect play is the {{behavior}} or strategy {{of a player}} {{that leads to the}} best possible outcome for that player regardless of the response by the opponent. [...] Based on the rules of a game, every possible final position can be evaluated (as a win, loss or draw). By <b>backward</b> <b>reasoning,</b> one can recursively evaluate a non-final position as identical to that of the position that is one move away and best valued for the player whose move it is. Thus a transition between positions can never result in a better evaluation for the moving player, and a perfect move in a position would be a transition between positions that are equally evaluated. As an example, a perfect player in a drawn position would always get a draw or win, never a loss. If there are multiple options with the same outcome, perfect play is sometimes considered the fastest method leading to a good result, or the slowest method leading to a bad result.|$|E
