To resolve the issue, secondary condensates from evaporation plants have been reutilized in pulp washing between the <b>bleaching</b> <b>stages.</b> In order to explore further their exploitation, secondary condensates were applied in bleaching, rather than after bleaching, in this thesis work. Pure water was partially substituted with four types of evaporation condensates as diluents in chlorine dioxide (D) and ozone (Z) <b>bleaching</b> <b>stages.</b> Mass and COD balance of the <b>bleaching</b> <b>stages</b> {{and the effects of}} secondary condensates on pulp quality and chemical composition were studied. Headspace gas chromatography - mass spectrometry was applied for quantifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the condensates, bleaching filtrates and the vapor phase of the bleaching reactor. Meanwhile, COD of pulp filtrates and condensates and brightness, viscosity and kappa number of the pulps were examined to study the possible impacts of the condensate use on environmental load and pulp properties. No noticeable effect of the condensate used on pulp brightness, viscosity and kappa number in D 0 and Z stages were observed. The main VOCs in the condensates were methanol, ethanol, acetone and some sulphur components, such as dimethyl disulfide. VOCs detected in pulp filtrates were mainly methanol. Also the condensate-free pulp filtrates contained significant amounts of methanol, thus secondary condensates are not the only source of methanol. It could also be formed through demethoxylation of lignin in pulp bleaching. Instead of the secondary condensates, the unbleached kraft pulp was the main source of sulphur in pulp bleaching. Secondary condensates and the methanol in them contributed quite little on COD of pulp filtrates.

40|$|The aim of {{bleaching}} is {{to increase}} the brightness of the pulp by reducing the amount of the residual lignin and to provide the pulp with specific physicochemical properties. It is known that the brightness of the pulp depends on its ability to reflect the light, which can be reached by discoloration of the coloring agents contained in the unbleached pulp or by their removal. The coloring agents are generally different chromophoric groups in the residual lignin whose properties strongly depend on the method of pulp cooking, nature of wood and the bleaching agents. The subjects of the research were softwood kraft pulp after oxygen-alkali treatment (Kappa number 10 - 14) and softwood kraft pulp without oxygen-alkali treatment (Kappa number 30). In the present work, softwood kraft pulp samples were bleached according to the following schemes: HO—A—P—D—P(a) and A—P—D—P(a), where HO – Oxygen-alkaline treatment stage; A –Acidic <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage</b> where sulphuric acid or sulphuric dioxide water is used as a reagent; P – Alkaline <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage</b> where hydrogen peroxide is used as a reagent; D – Acidic <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage</b> where chlorine dioxide is used as a reagent; P(a) – Acidic <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage</b> where hydrogen peroxide is used as a reagent. The pulp stiffness and brightness were determined to illustrate the efficiency of the acid-catalytic activation of pulp. The dependences of the delignification degree and hydrogen peroxide conversion on time according to the scheme H 0 — A—P were defined. The pulp viscosity and paper mechanical characteristics such as breaking length and tear resistance as well as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of bleaching filtrates were estimated. The results provided better understanding of elemental chlorine free bleaching (ECF-bleaching) with low chlorine dioxide consumption (“soft” ECF bleaching). Moreover, a conclusion was made that “soft” ECF-bleaching was the most optimal process because it was more environmentally friendly than ECF and cheaper than total chlorine free (TCF) bleaching.

Sample 1 came directly from “Mondi Syktyvkar”, samples 2 and 3 were produced in the laboratory of Chemical Department, Syktyvkar Forest Institute. The pulp samples were further analyzed by different methods: extractive substances content were determined, aldehyde groups content was found by a photocolorimetric method, Kappa number was determined by permanganate index, and finally electron microscopy of the three samples was done. Further, residual lignin extraction from sulphate pulp was conducted, and the lignin samples obtained were conducted by ÑÍ 3 ÑÎÎÍ-Í 2 Î – ZnCl 2 blend. Extracted residual lignin was estimated by Komarov’s method, the amount of carboxyl groups in lignin was determined by potentiometry method, lignin molecular weight was calculated by cryoscopy method. Finally, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods were used to analyze extracted lignin spectrum. During the bleaching process, the lignin content of the pulp decreased from 16 to 9 Kappa units. Also, {{a reduction in the}} amount of aldehyde group was observed after the second <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage</b> compared to the first stage.

X stage was also applied before and after the final P or D stages (DEDDX/DEDXD and DEDPX/DEDXP) to produce high brightness pulps (c. 91 %). RESULTSX stage with xylanase Pulpzyme HC allowed an increase of c. 1. 5 % in pulp brightness while decreasing the brightness reversion and a concomitant pulp yield loss of only 0. 5 %.

Eucalyptus spp. industrial cellulosic pulp with oxygen {{was used in this}} experiment. The same bleaching sequence D(E+P) DP was performed ten times, under the same conditions (temperature, consistency and time). Counter current washing was used in the <b>bleaching</b> <b>stages,</b> and each sequence was carried out with different washing factors: 9, 6, 3, 0 m 3 of distilled water/ton of pulp, trying to reach brightness of 92 ± 0, 5 % ISO.

Then, the COD results were compared to the brightness ones from the bleached pulp. The evaluated results from the ten sequences and four different washings showed an increasing in COD due to the organic load accumulation, resulting from the reuse of effluent from previous sequences.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to investigate the impact of heavy and transition metals on alkaline and acid pulping processes and chlorine-free bleaching of the resulting pulps. Hard and softwoods used for pulp production in Germany were analyzed regarding their heavy and transition metal content. They were pulped in acid and alkaline pulping processes and the pathways of these metals were investigated. They are mainly influenced by the pH of the pulping liquor. The lower the pH, the more metals are dissolved. Wood impregnated with wood-protecting salts could be pulped without any problems. During pulping and bleaching {{it was possible to}} reduce the heavy metal content of the bleached pulp so far that they could be used in a conventional way. Separation of heavy metals in chlorine free bleaching sequences can be achieved by complexation or acid washing. By closing the water loop in the bleach line, the content of transition metals in the filtrate increases from cycle to cycle, and together with the organic charge this leads to a reduced bleaching efficiency. Selectivity of single <b>bleaching</b> <b>stages</b> is not effected.

40|$|The {{amount of}} water {{available}} is usually restricted, {{which leads to a}} situation where a complete understanding of the process, including water circulations and the influence of water components, is essential. The main aim of this thesis was to clarify the possibilities for the efficient use of residual peroxide by means of water circulation rearrangements. Rearranging water circulations and the reduction of water usage may cause new problems, such as metal induced peroxide decomposition that needs to be addressed. This thesis introduces theoretical methods of water circulations to combine two variables; effective utilization of residual peroxide and avoiding manganese in the alkaline peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage.</b> Results are mainly based on laboratory and mill site experiments concerning the utilization of residual peroxide. A simulation model (BALAS) was used to evaluate the manganese contents and residual peroxide doses. It was shown that with optimum recirculation of residual peroxide the brightness can be improved or chemical costs can be decreased. From the scientific perspective, it was also very important to discover that recycled peroxide was more effective pre-bleaching agent compared to fresh peroxide. This can be due to the organic acids i. e. per acetic acid in wash press filtrate that have been formed in alkaline <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage.</b> Even short retention time was adequate and the activation of residual peroxide using sodium hydroxide was not necessary. There are several possibilities for using residual peroxide in practice regarding bleaching. A typical modern mechanical pulping process line consist of defibering, screening, a disc filter, a bleach press, high consistency (HC) peroxide bleaching and a wash press. Furthermore there usually is not a particular medium consistency (MC) pre-bleaching stage that includes additional thickening equipment. The most advisable way to utilize residual peroxide in this kind of process is to recycle the wash press filtrate to the dilution of disc filter pulp (low MC pre-bleaching stage). An arrangement such as this would be beneficial in terms of the reduced convection of manganese to the alkaline <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage.</b> Manganese originates from wood material and will be removed to the water phase already {{in the early stages of}} the process. Recycling residual peroxide prior to the disc filter is not recommended because of low consistencies. Regarding water circulations, the novel point of view is that, it would be beneficial to divide water circulations into two sections and the critical location for the division is the disc filter. Both of these two sections have their own priority. Section one before the disc filter: manganese removal. Section two after the disc filter: brightening of pulp. This division can be carried out if the disc filter pulp is diluted only by wash press filtrate before the MC storage tower. The situation is even better if there is an additional press after the disc filter, which will improve the consistency of the pulp. This has a significant effect on the peroxide concentration in the MC pre-bleaching stage. In terms of manganese content, it is essential to avoid the use of disc filter filtrate in the bleach press and wash press showers. An additional cut-off press would also be beneficial for manganese removal. As a combination of higher initial brightness and lower manganese content, the typical brightness increase varies between approximately 0. 5 and 1 % ISO units after the alkaline peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>stage.</b> This improvement does not seem to be remarkable, but as it is generally known, the final brightness unit is the most expensive and difficult to achieve. The estimation of cost savings is not unambiguous. For example in GW/TMP mill case 0. 6 % ISO units higher final brightness gave 10 % savings in the costs of bleaching chemicals. With an hypothetical 200 000 ton annual production, this means that the mill could save in the costs of bleaching chemicals more than 400 000 euros per year. In general, it can be said that there were no differences between the behavior of different types of processes (GW, PGW, TMP and BCTMP). The enhancement of recycling gave a similar response in all cases. However, we have to remember that the utilization of residual peroxide in older mills depends a great deal on the process equipment, the {{amount of water}} available and existing pipeline connections. In summary, it can be said that processes are individual and the same solutions cannot be applied to all cases...|$|E

Compared to xylanase prebleaching, xylanase posttreatment of the peroxide bleached pulps solubilized less lignin and chromophores and made smaller amounts of these materials alkaline soluble. Nevertheless, the final brightness achieved by xylanase posttreatment was similar or superior to that achieved with xylanase prebleaching of the corresponding unbleached pulps...|$|R
40|$|Recycled pulps {{from various}} fibre sources {{were treated with}} ozone (Z), sodium {{hypochlorite}} (H), peroxide (P), and sodium hydrosulphite (Y) <b>bleaching</b> <b>stages.</b> Included in the pulp fumishes were deinked ledger pulps (one spiked with 30 % coloured broke), a book furnish containing {{a large portion of}} groundwood, and two furnishes containing unbleached chemical pulps. The best result was obtained with a ledger pulp containing some semi-bleached fibres. The ledger pulps responded as follows to the various sequences in terms of brightness gain: ZY 2 ZH> ZP The Z and Y stages removed the colour tint from pulp better than did a P stage. A secondary pulp with a high proportion of mechanical pulp fibres or unbleached chemical pulp fibres did not respond well to ozone or hypochlorite bleaching...|$|R
