500|$|GamePro {{gave the}} Tetris & Dr. Mario {{compilation}} a rave review. They praised the Mixed Match mode and the SNES enhanced graphics and sounds, and concluded [...] "Sharp controls and absorbing action are what make these two classics even {{better as a}} pair than they were alone." [...] Next Generation, in contrast, said the compilation was only significant for being the first appearance of Tetris on the SNES, summarizing that [...] "Yeah, it's great, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> you own a copy of {{one or both of}} these games already." [...] They did, however, praise Nintendo for having the [...] "cajones" [...] to package their Tetris-inspired game with Tetris itself.|$|E

[...] RTÉ.ie had a similar reaction, writing, [...] "Sure, the did-they-really-just-play-that? double takes arrive by the half-minute on their latest magnum opus (self-titled for extra definitiveness), <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> you will come away from Dream Theater singing a chorus rather than throwing air guitar/bass/drums/keyboards/violin/conductor's baton shapes." ...|$|E

'Then, {{while the}} half-caste, {{bursting}} with importance, shouted his orders, while the yards swung creaking {{and the heavy}} boom came surging over, Jim and I, alone as it were, to leeward of the mainsail, clasped each other's hands and exchanged the last hurried words. My heart was freed from that dull resentment which had existed {{side by side with}} interest in his fate. The absurd chatter of the half-caste had given more reality to the miserable dangers of his path than Stein's careful statements. On that occasion the sort of formality that had been always present in our intercourse vanished from our speech; I believe I called him [...] "dear boy," [...] and he tacked on the words [...] "old man" [...] to some half-uttered expression of gratitude, as though his risk set off against my years had made us more equal in age and in feeling. There was a moment of real and profound intimacy, unexpected and short-lived like a glimpse of some everlasting, of some saving truth. He exerted himself to soothe me as though he had been the more mature of the two. [...] "All right, all right," [...] he said, rapidly, and with feeling. [...] "I promise to take care of myself. Yes; I won't take any risks. Not a single blessed risk. Of course not. I mean to hang out. Don't you worry. Jove! I feel as if nothing could touch me. Why! this is luck from the word Go. I wouldn't spoil such a magnificent chance!" [...] . A magnificent chance! Well, it was magnificent, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> what men make them, and how was I to know? As he had said, even I--even I remembered--his--his misfortune against him. It was true. And the best thing for him was to go.|$|E

50|$|Mermaid Saga - a manga {{series by}} Rumiko Takahashi, which tells {{that when a}} person eats the flesh of a mermaid, he can gain immortality, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that the mermaid's flesh will either kill him or {{transform}} him into a horrible creatures called a Lost Soul. Two types of mermaids are shown in the manga. The first may gain human appearance when they eat the flesh of an immortal girl; the second has two legs and feed on the flesh of mermaids who live in water, specifically when {{they are about to}} give birth. Besides the flesh, a mermaid's blood, ashes, and liver have different effects on humans. Mermaid's blood can stop a person's youth, but it can't stop their insides from aging. Ashes can give flowers immortality, but can only temporarily revive dead humans. A mermaid's liver was used to revive a dead girl, but gave her a need to feed on the livers of living things.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Shetler of PopCrush {{gave the}} song 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that, [...] "'Finally Found You' {{may be his}} most euphoric song yet, with its {{fluttering}} synths and lyrics about eternal commitment." [...] Shetler also saw that Adams verses [...] "don't necessarily fit {{the theme of the}} song, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> listeners will be so busy dancing they won’t notice the inconsistency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix wrote that in the upbeat and bouncy song, [...] "he’s finally found what he’s looking for, and it sounds remarkably like many other songs he’s done before and virtually every other song today that borrows David Guetta’s tremendously popular dance-pop whirl." [...] Kim Alessi of Commonsensemedia wrote that [...] "There's really nothing original about [...] "Finally Found You," [...] but the song does match Iglesias' sexy Latin dance-pop style and heartthrob persona, and is reminiscent of his other recent hit dance singles featuring rappers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lucy O'Brien of IGN {{gave the}} film 7/10, saying: [...] "with an unnerving monster at its core, great cast and {{relentless}} final sequence, Light’s [...] Out is a debut director Sandberg {{should be proud}} of. A clunky script occasionally loosens its grip on the nerves, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> Diana will still have you sleeping with the lights on for a good while after leaving the theatre." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film 4 stars out of 4, stating: [...] "even the most cynical, jaded, seen-it-all-before critic cannot deny certain visceral reactions to a film. Lights Out gave me the chills." [...] Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "a surprisingly maternal horror movie that relies as much on fraying emotional bonds as supernatural suspense to create tension, Lights Out deals {{with an array of}} primal fears that threaten to unravel a family’s fundamental relationships, along with their sanity." [...] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "spackling over any copycat cracks with strong acting and fleet editing, Lights Out delivers minimalist frights in old-school ways." ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{generally}} earned positive {{reviews from}} critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama awarded it 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "On the whole, LONDON PARIS NEW YORK is the hackneyed and passe rom-coms. It's a quirky, witty, coming-of-age movie {{that takes a}} conventional premise and twirls it into something delightfully unconventional, designed to charm and magnetize the urban youth. The movie speaks their lingo, mirrors their objectives and depicts the anguish and elation of falling in love. If you are young or young at heart, celebrate your weekend by leaping onto this feel-good earth hopping romance." [...] Aniruddha Guha of DNA India awarded the film 3/5 stars and stated, [...] "LPNY is a short and sweet romcom that will leave you with a smile. Go for it. Rajeev Masand of IBN Live gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars, writing that [...] "The charismatic actors rise above the flawed script to deliver an easy, enjoyable evening at the movies. Watch it for its freshness; you won't be bored." [...] Aniruddha Guha of DNA India gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars, remarking [...] "London Paris New York is a romcom that demands neither much time nor patience.

5000|$|Gilnockie Castle lies {{immediately}} left of {{the north}} side of Canonbie Bridge, occupying a strong defensive site and was once the seat of the Armstrongs, Lairds of Mangerton. It was the home of John Armstrong of Gilnockie and was unfinished {{at the time of his}} death. Not much of the castle remains. When James V became king of Scotland, one of his objectives was to restore order in his kingdom and to pacify the borders. He commanded an army of 12,000 men. He ordered all earls, lords, barons, freeholders and gentlemen to meet at Edinburgh with a month's supplies, and then to proceed to Teviotdale and Annandale. The nobles were to bring their dogs with them. After hunting for a few days, the King offered safe conduct to Johnnie Armstrong for an audience. John Armstrong was the laird of Kilnockie and was felt by all Scots to be as good a chieftain as there was within the borders, either in Scotland or England. Johnnie Armstrong may have been a loose-living man and although he never molested a Scotsman, he was of such a force that from the Scots border to Newcastle of England there were not many estates who did not pay tribute to him. When Johnnie came into the king's presence there was no trial but a hanging of Johnnie and his men in the trees of Carlanrig churchyard. There is a legend that persists to this day that the dule trees upon which they were hung withered and died and that the same has happened to any trees which were planted since. John and his men would have fought when they realized what was to happen to them <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that they were seized and restrained before they could do so. He is said to have shouted to the King. [...] "I have asked grace at a graceless face." [...] His execution weakened James' authority in the borders and was a grave mistake on the King's part.|$|E

40|$|For half {{a decade}} now, {{cataract}} surgeons in ever-increasing numbers are employing the femtosecond laser for arcuate and corneal incisions, capsulotomy, and lens fragmentation before they perform the some-what reduced part of manual surgery, {{the removal of}} the lens fragments and the intraocular lens implan-tation. The technology has been discussed in peer-reviewed journals, at conventions, and also among the public, who is always fascinated by any procedure that contains the magic word “laser. ” Half a decade is an appropriate time to quote Shake-speare: What’s in a name?

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presentation}} is to give a "friendly" introduction to the PFEM (Particle-Finite Elements Method), a quite recent and powerful numerical method, designed to handle very non-linear problems, involving large displacements and deformations, in a Lagrangian framework. In some cases, as for example in dynamic fluid-structure interaction problems, the Eulerian approach can become very cumbersome, due to the intimate Lagrangian nature of the phenomenon; on the other hand, it is well-known that classical Lagrangian numerical approaches can suffer from mesh distortion problems: the PFEM {{is one of the}} methods which try to avoid this kind of issues, still working in a pure Lagrangian framework. During {{the presentation}}, some of the key features of the method will be pointed out, also underlining its differences with others so-called "meshless" and "particle" methods. The first applications of the PFEM belong mostly to the fluid dynamics domain, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> that the method could be used in a very interesting way in solving solids non-linear problems as well: therefore some perspectives on the possible future applications of PFEM are given...|$|E
40|$|You {{may never}} have heard of thirdhand smoke, or THS, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> you’ve smelled it. THS is, {{in the words of}} The New York Times, “the {{invisible}} yet toxic brew of gases and particles clinging to smokers ’ hair and clothing, not to mention cushions and carpeting, that lingers long after secondhand smoke [SHS] has cleared from a room. ” 1 Recent research exploring potential dangers of THS has received a flurry of coverage in the international media 2, 3, 4 and the scientific press. 5, 6, 7 And in the United States, court cases are beginning to appear in which plaintiffs are citing these alleged dangers, 8, 9 despite a lack of human health studies on the longterm health effects of THS exposure. So how dangerous might THS really be? The answer, still to be pronounced, will depend on many factors. Thirdhand smoke consists of residual tobacco smoke pollutants that 1) remain on surfaces and in dust after tobacco has been smoked, 2) are re-emitted back into the gas phase, or 3) react with oxidants and other compounds in the environment to yield secondary pollutants...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} aims at contributing in an immediately practical {{fashion to}} a trans-cultural dialogue and broader understanding between Canada and the Arab world. The trans-lation of Ronald Sutherland's Second Image: Comparative Studies in Quebec/Canadian Literature will fan an already lively interest in Canadian and Australian literatures, {{as well as}} the literature produced by the third world coun-tries, in Lebanon and other countries of the Arab world. There are parallels in the political and cultural tensions in Canada and in Lebanon, which are reflected in the litera-tures of the two countries, parallels which Sutherland's book should bring to the mind of the Arabic-speaking reader. Indeed, even the local controversies aroused by Sutherland's study are certain to suggest to the knowledgeable reader of Arabic literature controversies of a similar nature in the literary milieu of Lebanon and the Arab world more general-ly. There is no question that Second Image can contribute to a fuller understanding of the Canadian literatures among Arabic readers, <b>but</b> <b>chances</b> <b>are</b> it will do more: it will generate a shock of recognition in minds that had not antic-ipated it, thereby contributing in some degree to interna-tional understanding.
