40|$|The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a {{frequently}} used instrument developed for screening childhood mental health problems. The {{aim of this}} study is to clarify the structure of the Hungarian version of SDQ, to test previous measurement models, and to propose an alternative <b>bifactor</b> <b>model.</b> Data were collected from a community sample of 8 – 13 -year-old children. We conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses on parent (n = 383) and teacher ratings (n = 391). The classic five-factor, an alternative three-factor, and a <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> were estimated. In the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model,</b> specific components refer to the five SDQ-traits, and the General Problems factor refers to an impression about the problem severity of the child. For both informants, the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> yielded the best fit to the data compared to other models. Childhood behavioral problems can be best described as a multidimensional construct, which has implications regarding the screening procedure in various samples. ...|$|E
30|$|Another DIF {{method was}} {{to employ the}} <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> {{to account for the}} item {{clustering}} effect (Cai et al. 2011; Jeon et al. 2013). Each item was loaded on the primary factor (i.e., target ability) and the secondary factor (i.e., secondary ability measured by the content of the testlet) to account for the item clustering effect. A DIF parameter was included in the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> for DIF detection, and the Wald test or the likelihood ratio test was used for significance tests. Fukuhara and Kamata (2011) detected DIF under the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> framework by including a covariate (i.e., the grouping variable) instead of a DIF parameter. The regression coefficient of the covariate was considered as the effect size estimate of DIF. These DIF methods have been demonstrated to be efficient in terms of both significance tests and recovery of DIF parameter estimates. These methods, however, only focused on the item clustering effect in DIF analysis.|$|E
40|$|The first {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a brief and general case for the {{possible}} utility of the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> in sport, exercise, and performance (SEP) psychology. The second {{purpose of this}} study was to demonstrate how exploratory and confirmatory forms of the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> may be compared with each other and with more commonly used factor models in SEP psychology within a substantivemethodological synergy format. The substantive focus was the consideration of the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> for the Psychological Need Thwarting Scale. The methodological focus was the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model,</b> which has a general factor, group factors, and a pattern matrix with a bifactor structure. The synergy was a demonstration of how exploratory and confirmatory bifactor analysis may be compared with each other and with more commonly used and more restrictive analyses (e. g., correlated first-order factor analysis, a second-order factor analysis), by reanalyzing existing data. A four-factor exploratory bifactor analysis on Psychological Need Thwarting Scale data produced an approximate bifactor structure that may offer a viable conceptualization for future research in this area. More broadly, when the underlying measurement theory is consistent with (a) a conceptually broad general factor, as well as (b) conceptually narrower group factors, there may be utility in comparing bifactor analysis to more commonly used and more restrictive factor analyses in SEP psychology...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{measurement}} invariance of the Work Organisation Assessment Questionnaire (WOAQ) across genders in a group of healthcare employees, using <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling.</b> There is a very limited research that uses invariance testing of <b>bifactor</b> <b>models,</b> despite their usefulness. Establishing validity of the WOAQ in this way is important for demonstrating its relevance for both males and females. Methods A <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling</b> procedure was used here to examine the validity of the WOAQ with a sample of 946 paramedics employed in a large Australian organization in the healthcare sector. Results The results of this study show that the WOAQ has good psychometric properties across genders in healthcare settings. In addition, there were significant mean differences between males and females in their perceptions of ‘quality of relationships with colleagues’, and ‘reward and recognition’. There were no differences between males and females on the remaining factors: ‘quality of relationships with the management’, ‘quality of relationships with colleagues’, and ‘quality of the physical environment’. Conclusions The use of <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling</b> to establish the cross-validity of the WOAQ across male and female paramedics adds to evidence for the measure’s good psychometric properties. The findings add to those of previous research that has used higher order Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Moreover, mean differences between males and females were found to be significant in two of the five WOAQ subscales. These findings have practical implications for healthcare organizations, in terms of assessing work characteristics and developing activities to support the health and well-being of their employees. ...|$|R
40|$|The Attitudes and Belief Scale- 2 (ABS- 2 : DiGiuseppe, Leaf, Exner, & Robin, 1988. The {{development}} of a measure of rational/irrational thinking. Paper presented at the World Congress of Behavior Therapy, Edinburg, Scotland.) is a 72 -item self-report measure of evaluative rational and irrational beliefs widely used in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy research contexts. However, little psychometric evidence exists regarding the measure's underlying factor structure. Furthermore, given {{the length of the}} ABS- 2 {{there is a need for}} an abbreviated version that can be administered when there are time demands on the researcher, such as in clinical settings. This study sought to examine a series of theoretical models hypothesized to represent the latent structure of the ABS- 2 within an alternative models framework using traditional confirmatory factor analysis as well as utilizing a <b>bifactor</b> <b>modeling</b> approach. Furthermore, this study also sought to develop a psychometrically sound abbreviated version of the ABS- 2. Three hundred and thirteen (N = 313) active emergency service personnel completed the ABS- 2. Results indicated that for each model, the application of <b>bifactor</b> <b>modeling</b> procedures improved model fit statistics, and a novel eight factor intercorrelated solution was identified as the best fitting model of the ABS- 2. However, the observed fit indices failed to satisfy commonly accepted standards. A 24 -item abbreviated version was thus constructed and an intercorrelated eight-factor solution yielded satisfactory model fit statistics. Current results support the use of a <b>bifactor</b> <b>modeling</b> approach to determining the factor structure of the ABS- 2.

Methods An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling</b> approach were used to separate a general distress continuum from more specific sub-domains of depression and anxiety in an adolescent community sample (n = 1159, age 14). The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale were used. Results A three-factor confirmatory factor analysis is reported which identified a) mood and social-cognitive symptoms of depression, b) worrying symptoms, and c) somatic and information-processing symptoms as distinct yet closely related constructs. Subsequent <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling</b> supported a general distress factor which accounted for the communality of the depression and anxiety items. Specific factors for hopelessness-suicidal thoughts and restlessness-fatigue indicated distinct psychopathological constructs which account for unique information {{over and above the}} general distress factor. The general distress factor and the hopelessness-suicidal factor were more severe in females but the restlessness-fatigue factor worse in males. Measurement precision of the general distress factor was higher and spanned a wider range of the population than any of the three first-order factors. Conclusions The general distress factor provides the most reliable target for epidemiological analysis but specific factors may help to refine valid phenotype dimensions for aetiological research and assist in prognostic modelling of future psychiatric episodes. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{disorders}} often {{share common}} symptoms and aetiological factors.

40|$|The factor {{structure}} of mental abilities has most often been depicted using a higher-order model. Under this model, general mental ability (g) is placed {{at the top of}} a pyramid, with “loading” arrows going from it to the other factors of intelligence, which in turn go to subtest scores. In contrast, under the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> (also known as the nested factors/direct hierarchical model), each subtest score has its own direct loading on g; the non-g factors (e. g., the broad abilities) do not mediate the relationships of the subtest scores with g. Here we summarized past research that compared the fit of higher-order and bifactor models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We also analyzed additional archival datasets to compare the fit of the two models. Using a total database consisting of 31 test batteries, 58 datasets, and 1, 712, 509 test takers, we found stronger support for a <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> of g than for the traditional higher-order model. Across 166 comparisons, the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> had median increases of 0. 076 for the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), 0. 083 for the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and 0. 078 for the Normed Fit Index (NFI) and decreases of 0. 028 for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and 1343 for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Consequently, researchers should consider using bifactor models when conducting CFAs.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a psychometric approach of broad relevance to psychiatric research instruments.

The HADS is frequently analyzed via maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (ML-CFA).

Several R packages {{can be used to}} estimate the parameters in various IRT models, the most flexible being the ltm (Rizopoulos 2006), eRm (Mair and Hatzinger 2007), and MCMCpack (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011) packages. However these packages have limitations in that ltm and eRm can only analyze unidimensional IRT models effectively and the exploratory multidimensional extensions available in MCMCpack requires prior understanding of Bayesian estimation convergence diagnostics and are computationally intensive. Most importantly, multidimensional confirmatory item factor analysis methods have not been implemented in any R package. The mirt package was created for estimating multidimensional item response theory parameters for exploratory and confirmatory models by using maximum-likelihood meth- ods. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature method used in traditional EM estimation (e. g., Bock and Aitkin 1981) is presented for exploratory item response models as well as for confirmatory <b>bifactor</b> <b>models</b> (Gibbons and Hedeker 1992). Exploratory and confirmatory models are estimated by a stochastic algorithm described by Cai (2010 a,b). Various program comparisons are presented and future directions for the package are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) has {{traditionally}} been conceptualised as a unidimensional measure of self-esteem, but empirical evidence is equivocal, with some studies supporting a one-factor solution and others favouring multidimensional models. Participants and procedure The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the factor structure, factorial invariance and composite reliability of the RSES within a European sample of children affected by parental imprisonment (N = 724). The study specified and tested six alternative factor models using conventional confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) techniques and a confirmatory <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling</b> approach. Results The RSES was most effectively represented by a bifactor model including a general self-esteem factor comprising all ten scale items and separate method effects for the positively and negatively phrased items. This model was found to be factorially invariant among boys and girls. Composite reliability indicated good internal consistency for the general self-esteem dimension but slightly less so for the positive and negative method effects. Conclusions It follows that the calculation of a total RSES score is appropriate for children of prisoners, providing that the presence of method effects is taken into consideration to avoid giving rise to false interpretations. This study demonstrated the application of a bifactorial modeling approach as a potential solution...|$|R
40|$|Despite its long-standing and {{widespread}} use, disagreement remains regarding {{the structure of}} the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). In particular, concern remains regarding {{the degree to which the}} scale assesses self-esteem as a unidimensional or multidimensional (positive and negative self-esteem) construct. Using a sample of 3, 862 high school students in the United Kingdom, 4 models were tested: (a) a unidimensional model, (b) a correlated 2 -factor model in which the 2 latent variables are represented by positive and negative self-esteem, (c) a hierarchical model, and (d) a <b>bifactor</b> <b>model.</b> The totality of results including item loadings, goodness-of-fit indexes, reliability estimates, and correlations with self-efficacy measures all supported the <b>bifactor</b> <b>model,</b> suggesting that the 2 hypothesized factors are better understood as “grouping” factors rather than as representative of latent constructs. Accordingly, this study supports the unidimensionality of the RSES and the scoring of all 10 items to produce a global self-esteem score...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} the nuanced associations between components of executive functioning (EF) and subtypes of aggression, using a latent variable approach. Participants were racially diverse undergraduate students who completed a self-report of reactive (RA) and proactive aggression (PA), and traditional neuropsychological tasks of EF. The appropriateness {{of using a}} nested <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> of EF was confirmed, and this <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> of EF {{was used to examine}} the specific associations between components of EF and RA and PA. Results revealed components of EF are differentially associated with RA and PA, such that impulsive, provoked aggression is associated with lower levels of goal-oriented inhibition and higher levels of flexibility, whereas planned, goal-oriented aggression is associated with higher levels of working memory. Findings from the current study underscore the importance of considering the multidimensional nature of EF as well as aggression when examining their associations with external constructs of interest...|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} lack of {{attention}} to construct shift in item response theory (IRT) vertical scaling, a multigroup, <b>bifactor</b> <b>model</b> was proposed to model the common dimension for all grades and the grade-specific dimensions. <b>Bifactor</b> <b>model</b> estimation accuracy was evaluated through a simulation study with manipulated factors of percentage of common items, sample size, and degree of construct shift. In addition, the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) model, which ignores con-struct shift, was also estimated to represent current practice. It was found that (a) bifactor models were well recovered overall, though the grade-specific dimensions were not as well recovered as the general dimension; (b) item discrimination parameter estimates were overesti-mated in UIRT models due to the effect of construct shift; (c) the person parameters of UIRT models were less accurately estimated than those of bifactor models; (d) group mean para-meter estimates from UIRT models were less accurate than those of bifactor models; and (e) a large effect due to construct shift was found for the group mean parameter estimates of UIRT models. A real data analysis provided an illustration of how bifactor models can be applied to problems involving vertical scaling with construct shift. General procedures for testing practice were recommended and discussed. Keywords vertical scaling, full-information <b>bifactor</b> <b>model,</b> construct shift, item response theory (IRT), mul-tidimensional IRT (MIRT), testlet model Full-information bifactor models have been applied to empirical data from achievement tests to multiple-domain survey instruments along with unidimensional and other multidimensiona...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} underlying {{factor structure of the}} Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) in the literature. An established view is that it reflects a unitary or bi-dimensional construct in non-clinical samples. There are, however, reasons to reconsider this conceptualisation. Based on previous factor analytic findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies, the aim {{of the present study was}} to compare 16 competing models of the BHS in a large university student sample (N = 1, 733). Sixteen distinct factor models were specified and tested using conventional confirmatory factor analytic techniques, along with confirmatory <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling.</b> A 3 -factor solution with 2 method effects (i. e., a multitrait–multimethod model) provided the best fit to the data. The reliability of this conceptualisation was supported by McDonald's coefficient omega, and the differential relationships exhibited between the three hopelessness factors (‘Feelings about the Future’, ‘Loss of Motivation’, and ‘Future Expectations’) and measures of goal disengagement, brooding rumination, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt history. The results provide statistical support for a three-trait and two-method factor model, and hence the three dimensions of hopelessness theorised by Beck. The theoretical and methodological implications of these ﬁndings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{utilised}} measures of behavioural and emotional difficulties among children and young people. Previous research has raised concerns about the psychometric properties of the measure, particularly the internal consistency of the CP and PP subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has generally supported a five-factor solution that is consistent with Goodman’s (1997) original conceptualisation of the SDQ, but alternative factor structures have been validated including models with internalising and externalising factors, and a total difficulties factor. This was the first study to examine the dimensionality, construct validity and internal consistency of the Romanian self-report version of the SDQ. Based on data collected from 1, 086 school children aged 9 - 17 years old, six alternative factor models were specified and tested using conventional CFA techniques and a confirmatory <b>bifactor</b> <b>modelling</b> approach. The five-factor model provided a better fit for the data than alternative factor structures, but was still unacceptable according to a range of overall model fit indices and individual item loadings. Model fit statistics for the five-factor solution were also notably poorer among boys than girls. Internal consistency was low for the CP, H and PP subscales among the total sample and girls only; and for the EP, CP, H and PP subscales among boys only. Results are discussed in terms of the appropriate interpretation of the Romanian SDQ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives  The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop a measure of life skills development through sport.   Method  Four studies were conducted to develop the Life Skills Scale for Sport (LSSS). Study 1 developed items for the scale and included 39 reviewers’ assessment of content validity. Study 2 included 338 youth sport participants and used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and descriptive statistics {{to reduce the number of}} items in the scale and explore the factor structure of each subscale and the whole scale. Study 3 included 223 youth sport participants and assessed the factor structure of the scale using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), exploratory structural equation <b>modeling</b> (ESEM) and <b>bifactor</b> <b>modeling.</b> Study 4 investigated the test-retest reliability of the scale over a two-week period with 37 youth sport participants.   Results  Study 1 resulted in the development of the initial 144 -item LSSS and provided content validity evidence for all items. Study 2 refined the scale to 47 items and provided preliminary evidence for the unidimensional factor structure of each subscale. Study 3 supported the factorial validity of the scale, with ESEM solutions providing the best fit and resulting in more differentiated factors. Study 4 provided evidence for the test-retest reliability of the scale.   Conclusions  Collectively, these studies provided initial evidence for the validity and reliability of the LSSS; a measure which can be used by researchers and practitioners to assess participants’ perceived life skills development through sport...|$|R
