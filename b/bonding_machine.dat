Figure 1 shows a diagram of a Thermosonic <b>Bonding</b> <b>machine</b> which includes a magnetostrictive or piezoelectric-type transducer {{which is used to}} convert electrical energy into vibratory motion which is known as Piezoelectricity. The vibratory motion travels along the coupler system, a portion which is tapered to serve as the velocity transformer. The velocity transformer amplifies the oscilliatory motion and delivers it to a heated bonding tip. It is akin to a friction bond, since the introduction of ultrasonic energy (via a bonding tool vertically attached to an ultrasonic transformer or horn) simultaneously delivers a force and vibratory or scrubbing motion to the interfacial contact points between a pre-heated deforming lead-wire and the metallized pads of a silicon integrated circuit (Figure 2). In addition to the delivery of thermal energy, the transmission of ultrasonic vibratory energy creates an ultrasonic softening effect by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the preheated lead wire. These two softening effects dramatically facilitates the lead wire deformation by forming the desirable contact area using relatively low temperatures and forces. As a result of the frictional action and ultrasonic softening induced in the preheated lead wire during the bonding cycle, thermosonic bonding can be used to reliably bond high melting point lead wires (such as gold and lower cost aluminum and copper) using relatively low bonding parameters. This ensures that the fragile and costly silicon integrated circuit chip is not exposed to potentially damaging conditions by having to use higher bonding parameters (ultrasonic energy, temperatures or mechanical forces) to deform the lead wire in forming the required contact area during the bonding process.|$|E

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state <b>bonding</b> <b>machines</b> where he pre-heated the lead wire (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening the lead wire, the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating lead wire and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state <b>bonding</b> <b>machines.</b> The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the lead wire, the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the lead wire where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|R

Differently {{from the present}} prevailing fabrication process of silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor: platinum is used as the sensing material, with a smaller but acceptable sensitivity and much simpler processes; adhesive bonding with SU- 8 is used as an alternative choice to anodic bonding, and we choose a vacuum hot plate to avoid using a <b>bonding</b> <b>machine.</b> To achieve a successful bonding, {{it is found that}} pre-bake time and pumping time are the most important factors.

A typical servo actuator is the voice-coil motor used for actuating micro <b>machine</b> tool axes, <b>bonding</b> <b>machines</b> and hydraulic/pneumatic valve drives.

40|$|Most {{assembly}} {{tasks in}} industry require the manipulator end effectors {{to come into}} contact with the work piece. Hence force sensing and feedback can be used to ensure contact between two mating parts, and can be used to monitor the forces of interaction to ensure that they are within a safe limit. As demand for advanced contact control increases, a growth of interest in force regulation and impact control has resulted. Force control technology has not been commonly practiced in the current generation of die and wire bonding machines. To regulate the impact force, one has to rely on an accurate position control and low bonding movement. This limits the performance and productivity of the bonding machines. To improve this situation, a force feedback control becomes necessary. Force feedback control has several advantages over the accurate position control in most die and bonding machines: (1) Regulation of impact force with even wide variations in die size. (2) Maintenance of constant contact forces to any desirable levels after impact. (3) Substantially reducing oscillation period to enhance the bonding rate. To verify and analysis the force control technology, force control has been implemented on an industrial vertical wire <b>bonding</b> <b>machine.</b> This study has investigated different force feedback controllers. These included linear controller, adaptive controller and hybrid position-force controller.

The distribution of W-plugs also affected the bond peeling from the top or bottom surfaces of the W-plugs. Mechanisms giving rise to the peeling failure of bonds were analyzed based on the acoustic impedance of materials, which determined the amount of ultrasonic energy transmitted from one material to another. Two different paths of ultrasonic energy transmission occurred during the bonding process due to the different acoustic impedances of the materials.

The concept of EMC for voltage sag problem call for utilities, customers, equipment manufacturer and regulators to play their role {{in order to minimize}} the impact of voltage sag by virtue of complying to SEMI F 47 and MS IEC 61000 curve. This project focuses on determining the sensitivity level of selected industrial equipments by conducting Ride through Test (RTT) using CHROMA 6530 Programmable AC Source and PSL Industrial Power Corruptor. The industrial equipments selected are the production machine for Semiconductor industries (Tester <b>Machine,</b> Wire <b>Bond</b> <b>Machines</b> and Die Attached), Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Magnetic contactors. The sensitivity or Immunity level data of the selected industrial equipments against voltage sag has been established. Comparison on the sensitivity level among similar type of equipments is also performed. It is evident from the RTT results, that majority of semiconductor equipments are very sensitive to voltage sag. The RTT results for PLCs and magnetic contactor also indicate that these two equipments are very sensitive to voltage sag and establish themselves as one of the ‘weak links’ in industrial equipment system. The established sensitivity data for the industrial equipments is helpful in predicting estimated loss due to voltage sag and determining the best cost effective voltage sag mitigation solution to the industrial equipments...|$|R
40|$|High {{precision}} {{approaches for}} active and passive alignment and assembly on optoelectronic micro benches have been realized at Fraunhofer IZM for various material systems and different scales. The alignment and reliable mounting of optical subcomponents such as semiconductor laser and photo diodes, micro lenses and micro prisms require far higher mounting and alignment accuracies than for micro-electronic parts. When connecting from silicon photonics chip level to single mode optical fibers, even higher precisions are called for (typically < 100 nm). Alignment and assembly commonly are performed on specialized lab equipment which needs manual operation, consuming {{a lot of}} time, with less possibilities for automation. To introduce {{a higher degree of}} automatized production, like it has become standard in large volume electronics, one can choose either active or passive alignment processes - or possibly a combination of both. In this article we will present examples of micr o-optic benches and optical interconnections that include alignment structures for passive alignment - where the accuracy lies in the components to be assembled, and mounting takes place on a less accurate machine ("fit into place"). But there is also a lot of progress on optical pick, measure and place machines that realize a flexible and fully automated active alignment using vision systems and activated components of less cost, with machine and process robustness for usability in industrial environments. As connecting elements, passive optical components like optical fibers are commonly used. These fragile and flexible elements pose additional challenges in secure picking, placing and fixing, at long lengths vs. small diameters. A very recent and specific approach to use more robust plastic optical fibers (POF) for very short and cost effective optical interconnects by means of wire <b>bonding</b> <b>machines</b> will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Compared with serial-structure-based manipulators, {{parallel}} manipulators {{have potential}} advantages {{in terms of}} stiﬀness, payload, etc. In certain applications that require less than {{six degrees of freedom}} (or lower mobility) task motions, parallel manipulators are especially more suited than their serial counterparts. In this dissertation, we study a new design method, called ”Integrated Design Method”, for the design of lower-mobility parallel manipulators. The design parameters of the integrated design method consist of both mechanical structure parameters such as link length, mass, mass center location, etc. and control parameters such as PID feedback gains. All these design parameters would be included in the kinematic and dynamic models of the selected parallel manipulator candidate. In addition to rigid body kinematics and dynamics, we also studied the kinematics and dynamics of lower-mobility parallel manipulators with ﬂexible links/joints. With the derived model, several performance indexes, such as workspace, condition number, motion type error and lowest natural frequency of ﬂexible parallel manipulators, were deﬁned and formulated. Then, the design problem was translated into an optimization problem by proper combination of these performance indexes, and the two groups of design parameters could be obtained simultaneously. A planar parallel manipulator, named the HKUST Planar-Delta, was selected to validate the design theory. Mechanical parameters such as the link shape and controller parameters such as the PD feedback gains were chosen as the design variables. Kinematic and dynamic models considering link ﬂexibility were derived and identiﬁed by simulations and experiments. With the design speciﬁcation extracted from the positioning stage of LED wire <b>bonding</b> <b>machines,</b> a multi-objective optimization problem was formulated and solved. Finally from the experimental results, it can be concluded that using the integrated design method, the lowest natural frequency of the Planar-Delta was increased by 30 % averagely while other requirements on the workspace and accuracy were all satisﬁed...|$|R
