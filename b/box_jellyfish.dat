5|$|All the Kimberella fossils {{found so}} far are {{assigned}} to one species, K. quadrata. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. They were originally classified as jellyfish by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and then as <b>box</b> <b>jellyfish</b> by Wade in 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these prompted a reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to Kimberella being recognised as the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a jellyfish at all.|$|E
5|$|Medusae {{and complex}} {{swimming}} colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration {{by means of}} statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths.

Most species have ocelli ("simple eyes"), which can detect sources of light. However the agile <b>Box</b> <b>Jellyfish</b> are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true eyes that have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.|$|E

40|$|Background: The phylum Cnidarians {{have over}} nine {{thousand}} species that approximately, one hundred species are dangerous for humans. Annually, {{a large number}} of deaths were reported due to jellyfish stings. The manifestations depend on their species and kind of venoms, and include the local and systemic manifestations. A number of methods and compounds were used and under investigation for management of injuries with jellyfishes. Due to the lack of an integrated systematic review, the current study was done. Materials and Methods: The PubMed data bank was searched for the term “Jellyfish”. A total of 1677 papers were found. These papers were divided into three categories: medical, biomedical and biotechnological fields. The medical category was further divided into three subcategories comprising systemic manifestations, cutaneous manifestations and treatments for the stings of jellyfishes. The biomedical category was further subdivided into genomics, proteomics, and biology of venoms, mechanisms of actions and products of biomedical significance. In this part of systematic review, the medical aspects of injuries with jellyfishes were evaluated. Results: The clinical manifestations in jellyfish envenomation depend on their species and the nature of venoms. The most common clinical manifestations of jellyfish stings are cutaneous presentations like urticasia, erythema, swelling, vesicles and severe dermonectoric manifestations. Systemic manifestations were seen in the stings of <b>box</b> <b>jellyfishes,</b> Portuguese man-of-war and in Irukandji syndrome. The most common recommendations for jellyfish envenomation managements include decreasing the local effects of venom, prevention of the venomous nematocysts release, and Controlling of systemic reactions. Application of commercial vinegar (4 - 6 % acetic acid), hot water immersion (HWI) (42 ° C for 20 minutes), ice packs, sea water rinsing for inactivating nematocysts, administration of topical and parenteral analgesics, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are the basics for treatments of jellyfish envenomations. The Anti-venom for jellyfishes can counteract the effects of venom. Conclusion: The cutaneous manifestations in jellyfish envenomation are the most common clinical presentation. There was no any conducted double-blind and controlled clinical trials for the management of jellyfish envenomation, the application of commercial vinegar (4 - 6 % acetic acid), hot water, ice packs and sea water rinsing are the fundamentals of treatments in the stings of the jellyfishes...|$|R
40|$|Collectively {{known as}} the <b>box</b> <b>jellyfishes,</b> cubomedusae have been {{documented}} around the world up to latitudes of 42 ° but are primarily found within the tropics. Cubozoans are unique among the Cnidaria for their complex sensory systems including camera type lens eyes, their strong directional swimming ability and orientation behaviour, yet {{perhaps best known for}} their powerful venom with envenomation from some species fatal to man. Two distinct syndromes including the delayed symptomatic Irukandji syndrome from some carybdeids, and the immediately painful and potentially fatal envenomation from large chirodropids, are well known from Australian tropical waters and have gained increasing global interest over recent times. Due to the gelatinous nature and rarity of most species identification has been difficult, and as not all cubozoans are uniformly venomous to humans reliable identification is critical for informed risk management. The population structure of cubozoans is poorly understood at spatial scales that range from hundreds of metres to thousands of kilometres. Further, despite their recognised mobility there are few descriptions of how far they move over days. A greater knowledge of the ecology of these elusive creatures would also provide invaluable information for risk management in areas where cubozoan envenomations are of concern. The objective of this thesis was to utilise the shape and elemental chemistry of cubozoan statoliths to gain knowledge on identification, population structure and sources and dispersal of cubomedusae. Morphometric analysis of hard structures and elemental chemistry assays of calcified structures have been used for identification and population assessment investigations in other marine phyla. The approach taken in this thesis was to use the only hard, calcified structure in cubomedusae (the statolith) to address the following issues: can statolith shape be used to discriminate among species of cubozoans (Chapter 2); can statolith shape discriminate among populations of medusae within a metapopulation (Chapter 3); can elemental chemistry of statoliths be used to discriminate among populations (Chapter 4); and can within statolith variation in elemental chemistry be used to determine the movement of cubozoans between water masses of different salinity (Chapter 5). Statoliths provided a hard structure for robust morphometric analysis. In Chapter 2 traditional morphometric Length to Width ratios (L: W) and modern morphometric Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) were applied to proximal, oral and lateral statolith faces of 13 cubozoan species to determine if statolith shape could discriminate among taxa. Both L: W and EFA were successful in quantitatively discriminating among species with EFA outperforming L: W as L: W gave no account of the curvature of the statolith. Best discrimination was achieved when analysing all three statolith faces in combination, with Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) of Normalised Elliptical Fourier (NEF) coefficients classifying 99...|$|R
25|$|Beyond initial first aid, antihistamines such as {{diphenhydramine}} (Benadryl) may control {{skin irritation}} (pruritus). Ice or fresh water {{is not usually}} applied to stings, since they may cause nematocysts to continue to release toxin.

25|$|Jellyfish {{adversely}} affect humanity by interfering with public systems and harming swimmers. The most obvious consequences are human {{injury or death}} and reduced coastal tourism. Jellies destroy fish nets, poison or crush captured fish, and consume fish eggs and young fish. The most venomous jellyfish is the <b>box</b> <b>jellyfish</b> which produces enough poison to kill 60 humans and {{is the reason for}} 1 death per year.|$|E
25|$|The sea wasp, a <b>box</b> <b>jellyfish</b> {{found in}} Australian waters, and more recently, Florida, can kill an adult human {{within a few}} minutes. A thin skin {{covering}} such as pantyhose {{was found to be}} sufficient protection. The pantyhose were formerly thought to work because of the length of the nematocysts, but it is now known {{to be related to the}} way the stinger cells work. The stinging cells on a box jellyfish's tentacles are not triggered by pressure. Instead, they are triggered by the chemicals found on skin. Pantyhose hinders the detection of the chemicals preventing the nematocysts from firing.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. <b>Box</b> <b>jellyfish</b> venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Vinegar (3–10% aqueous acetic acid) {{may be used}} as {{a common}} remedy to help with <b>box</b> <b>jellyfish</b> stings, but not the stings of the Portuguese man o' war (which is not a true jellyfish, but a siphonophore). For stings on or around the eyes, a towel {{dampened}} with vinegar may be used to dab around the eyes, with care taken to avoid the eyeballs. Salt water {{may be used as}} an alternative if vinegar is unavailable; and may be preferred over vinegar. Fresh water is not usually used if the sting occurs in salt water, as changes in tonicity can release additional venom. Rubbing wounds, or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine may have strongly negative effects as these can encourage the release of venom.|$|E
25|$|A huge {{variety of}} marine {{invertebrates}} {{are found in}} Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef {{an important source of}} this diversity. Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the Cnidaria (includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies), the Echinodermata (includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons). Venomous invertebrates include the <b>box</b> <b>jellyfish,</b> the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail, which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The crown-of-thorns starfish usually inhabits the Reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster. Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.|$|E
2500|$|Medusa {{jellyfish}} may {{be classified}} as scyphomedusae ("true" [...] jellyfish), stauromedusae (stalked jellyfish), cubomedusae (<b>box</b> <b>jellyfish),</b> or hydromedusae, according to which clade their species belongs.|$|E
2500|$|Scyphozoan {{jellyfish}} stings {{range from}} a twinge to tingling to agony.

2500|$|Although what {{first comes}} to mind as the common domain of {{jellyfish}} is living well up off the ocean floor in the plankton, a few species of jellyfish are {{closely associated with the}} bottom for much of their lives (that is, they can be considered benthic).

The tiny creeping jellyfish Staurocladia and Eleutheria (see section on Size, above) cannot swim and [...] "walk" [...] around on seaweed fronds or rocky bottoms on their tentacles. Most hydromedusae and scyphomedusae that live in coastal habitats find themselves on the bottom periodically, where they may stop swimming for a while, and certain <b>box</b> <b>jellyfish</b> species also rest on the sea bed in shallow water. Even some deep-sea species of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the stauromedusae are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.|$|E
