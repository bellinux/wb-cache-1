5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated.

The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset.

5|$|Fingleton {{was dropped}} after this Test, and was {{controversially}} overlooked for the 1934 tour of England despite strong performances for New South Wales. His omission {{was thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by the belief that {{he was responsible for}} leaking Woodfull's comments as well as Bradman's criticism of his performance. Other factors speculated to have contributed to his omission included a dispute that Fingleton had with Woodfull during a Sheffield Shield match, and interstate rivalries between New South Wales and Victoria causing Fingleton's omission at the expense of an additional Victorian.|$|E

Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction would also <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.|$|E

Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to <b>be</b> <b>influenced</b> by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
