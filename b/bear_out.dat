5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{dismissal}} of Robertson in February 1918, Maurice became convinced that troops were being withheld from the Western Front in order to undermine the position of Douglas Haig. When David Lloyd George announced in the House of Commons that British troop levels on the Western Front were at all-time highs, Maurice believed that he was deceiving both Parliament and the British public. In his capacity as Director of Military Operations, Maurice knew that the troop statistics available to his office did not <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> Lloyd George's claims, and he wrote to Robertson's successor, Henry Wilson, to outline his position. After Wilson failed to respond, Maurice {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, criticizing Lloyd George for misleading the public {{about the state of the}} British Expeditionary Force during the German Spring Offensive. The publication of this letter on 7 May caused a political storm, and members of the Liberal opposition, including former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, called for a debate. This subsequently occurred on 9 May, and Lloyd George was able to imply that the source of confusion was, in fact, Maurice's office, rather than the Prime Minister's. Maurice was initially suspended, and ultimately forced to retire; he was also denied a court martial.|$|E

500|$|Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had {{a vision}} in which he saw many {{soldiers}}, [...] "as thick as grasshoppers," [...] falling upside down into the Lakota camp, which his people took as a foreshadowing of a major victory in which {{a large number of}} soldiers would be killed. About three weeks later, the confederated Lakota tribes with the Northern Cheyenne defeated the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col.

[...] Sitting Bull's leadership inspired his people to a major victory. Months after their victory at the battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, North-West Territories (now Saskatchewan), where he remained until 1881, at which time he and most of his band returned to US territory and surrendered to U.S. forces. A small remnant of his band under Waŋblí Ǧi decided to stay at Wood Mountain.|$|E
500|$|As {{the armies}} {{assembled}} in their positions, the flanks and forward outposts encountered {{one another in}} several skirmishes; indeed, they had been skirmishing for seven days, until 19March, when the outposts of both armies nearly overlapped. On the right wing, General Ferino's men encountered an Austrian column of volunteer infantry and some light cavalry {{from one of the}} border Hussar regiments, and took 70and 80prisoners, respectively, including several officers. All of this happened without the Austrians knowing that there was an official declaration of war. On the 20March, a French emissary arrived at camp of Prince Schwarzenberg, a major general commanding a brigade of the advanced guard. The emissary asked if he possessed a declaration of war from Vienna, and upon being informed that Schwarzenberg had received no such declaration, informed him that the armistice established at Campo Formio was ended, and there existed between France and Austria a state of war. General Jourdan reportedly began a general attack when the emissary left, although other sources do not <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> the scale of the attack.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the team}} {{had come up with}} a core {{gameplay}} mechanic idea based on three groups of forces; drones that would carry a desirable resource, protectors that would guard the drones, and harvesters that would attempt to take the resource from the drones; these would eventually <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> as the Little Sisters, Big Daddies, and splicers in the final game, but {{at the time of the}} concept, there was no set theme. They began working on creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers. A 2002 demonstration version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first Xbox. This demonstration was primarily set aboard a space station overtaken with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a [...] "cult deprogrammer"—a person charged with rescuing someone from a cult, and mentally and psychologically readjusting that person to a normal life. Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult deprogrammer does: [...] " [...] people who hired people to [...] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [...] character that you were." [...] This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a Senator. The team collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a publisher. They considered ending development, but as news about their efforts to make a spiritual successor to System Shock 2 began to appear in gaming magazines and websites, the team opted to continue development, performing a full revamp the game.|$|E

2500|$|In the post-Roman period, the {{earliest}} rulers of Wales and Gwynedd may have exerted authority over regions {{no larger than}} the cantrefi (hundred) described in Welsh law codified centuries later, with their size somewhat comparable in size to the Irish tuath. These early petty kings or princelings (Lloyd uses the term chieftain) adopted the title rhi in Welsh (akin to the Irish Gaelic rí), later replaced by brenin, a title used to [...] "denote a less archaic form of kingship," [...] according to Professor John Davies. [...] Genealogical lists compiled around 960 <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> {{that a number of}} these early rulers claimed degrees of association with the old Roman order, but do not appear in the official royal lineages. [...] "It may be assumed that the stronger kings annexed the territories of their weaker neighbors and that the lineages of the victors are the only lineages to have survived," [...] according to Davies. Smaller and weaker chieftains coalesced around more powerful princelings, sometimes through voluntary vassalage or inheritance, though at other times through conquest, and the lesser princelings coalesced around still greater princelings, until a regional prince could claim authority over the whole of north Wales from the River Dyfi in the south to the Dee in the east, and incorporating Anglesey.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, (Untitled) was {{met with}} almost {{universal}} critical acclaim and strong international sales, with advance orders alone accounting {{for the sale of}} 100,000 copies. The album's success continued the revival of the band's commercial fortunes that had begun with the release of their previous album, Ballad of Easy Rider. Many fans at the time regarded the album as a return to greatness for the band and this opinion was echoed by many journalists. Bud Scoppa, writing in the November 16, 1970 edition of Rock magazine, described the album as [...] "easily their best recorded performance so far – in its own class as much as the records of the old Byrds were – and I think one of the best half-dozen albums of 1970." [...] Ben Edmonds' review in the December issue of Fusion magazine was also full of praise: [...] "(Untitled) is a joyous re-affirmation of life; {{it is the story of}} a band reborn. The Byrds continue to grow musically and lead stylistically, but they do so with an unailing sense of their past." [...] Edmonds concluded his review by noting that [...] "History will no doubt <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> the significance of The Byrds' contribution to American popular music, but, for the time being, such speculations are worthless because (Untitled) says that The Byrds will be making their distinctive contributions for quite some time to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|The clear {{differentiation}} between the kohens (the priests) {{and the other}} Levites, in the regulations given by the Priestly Code for the ma'aser rishon, is a distinction scholars attribute to the pro-Aaronid political bias of the priestly source; according to the Biblical revisionists' worldview, all Levites can be legitimate priests, {{which is likely to}} be why the Deuteronomist does not mention a tithe of the tithe (the portion of the tithe which is given to the priests rather than other Levites), since it would be somewhat meaningless. On the other hand, it raises a question about the distinction between ma'aser and terumah. In the Priestly Code it is stated that the ma'aser rishon existed as the source of sustenance for the Levites, since they had no territory, and hence nowhere to keep livestock or perform agriculture (Numbers [...] ). but this seemingly neglects the existence of a number of scattered Levite cities; scholars believe that the tithe (i.e. the tithe of which the ma'sar ani and ma'aser rishon are conflicting versions) actually arose as a generic heave offering, given to priests at the sanctuaries for their sustenance, and only became distinct when the Aaronids began to position themselves as the only Levites that could be legitimate priests. This view neglects the fact that cities are not agricultural centers and the tithing laws focus on agricultural produce. According to a holistic view of the Torah, the Levites had no portion in the fields. The Book of Amos, cited by some scholars for support of their proposition, admonishes the Israelites about their rebellious offerings to idols by mentioning practices that would be acceptable to idolatry but not Torah Law. Thus, Amos sarcastically remarks that they bring [...] "for three days your tithes", as well as saying that they should offer their todah offerings of leaven (which was forbidden, see Lev. [...] ). Amos [...] The text itself does not <b>bear</b> <b>out</b> such scholars identification between ma'aser rishon and ma'sar ani. First, the text clearly does not state [...] "three years," [...] it states [...] "three days". Second, the text expressly proposes deviant practices as forms of rebellion. Finally, the owner of the produce was not required to bring ma'sar ani to the Temple; but, rather to the poor, no matter where there were. Likewise, this confused story does not clearly demonstrate how ma'aser sheni developed into a system where the owner separated the tithe for himself and {{had nothing to do with}} kings or priests.|$|E
