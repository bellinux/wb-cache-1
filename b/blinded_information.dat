However, {{there is less}} evidence supporting this recommendation especially among East Asians, a population with a unique distribution of cardiovascular disease compared to the Western population. Methods and resultsThe NAGOYA HEART Study is a prospective randomized open-label blinded-endpoint study to compare an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan, and a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, regarding their efficacies on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Japanese hypertensive patients with glucose intolerance. Of 1168 eligible patients, we enrolled 1150 patients from October 2004 to January 2009. The participants will be followed {{for more than a}} median follow-up period of 3 years. The primary composite endpoint includes myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and admission due to congestive heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Any of these events are adjudicated by an independent committee under <b>blinded</b> <b>information</b> regarding the treatment arm. Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, changes in glucose tolerance status, kidney function, left ventricular structure measured by echocardiogram, and incident atrial fibrillation/flutter. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00129233.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{define the}} use of cineventriculography, cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (cMRI), and unenhanced and contrast-enhanced echocardiography for detection of left ventricular (LV) regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA). BACKGROUND Detection of RWMA is integral to the evaluation of LV function. METHODS In 100 patients, cineventriculography and unenhanced and contrast-enhanced echocardiography were performed. Fifty-six of the patients underwent additional cMRI. RWMA were assessed referring to a 16 -segment model for cMRI, unenhanced and contrast echocardiography. Cineventriculography was evaluated on a 7 -segment model. Hypokinesia {{in one or more}} segments defined presence of RWMA. Interobserver agreement among three readers was determined within each imaging modality. Intermethod agreement between imaging modalities was analyzed. A standard of truth for the presence of RWMA was obtained by an independent expert panel decision (EPD) based on clinical data, electrocardiogram, coronary angiography, and <b>blinded</b> <b>information</b> from the imaging modalities. RESULTS Sixty-seven patients were found to have an RWMA by EPD. Interobserver agreement expressed as kappa coefficient was 0. 41 (range 0. 37 to 0. 44) for unenhanced echocardiography, 0. 43 (range 0. 29 to 0. 79) for cMRT, 0. 56 (range 0. 44 to 0. 70) for cineventriculography, and 0. 77 (range 0. 71 to 0. 88) for contrast echocardiography. Contrast enhancement compared to unenhanced echocardiography improved agreement of echocardiography related to cMRI (kappa 0. 46 vs. 0. 29) and related to cineventriculography (kappa 0. 59 vs. 0. 28). Accuracy to detect EPD-defined RWMA was highest for contrast echocardiography, followed by cMRI, unenhanced echocardiography, and cineventriculography.

40|$|Background: Echocardiography based {{myocardial}} perfusion {{imaging and}} regional wall motion analysis {{are used for}} evaluation of coronary artery disease and regional myocardial abnormalities. Aim: This study sought to compare myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) and 2 D echocardiography with regard to interobserver variability and detection of regional myocardial abnormalities. Methods: In 70 patients evenly distributed between three ejection fraction groups based on biplane cineventriculography (> 55 %, 35 - 55 %, < 35 %), unenhanced and contrast enhanced 2 D echocardiography and myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE; SonoVue (R); Bracco) were performed. Regional watt motion and myocardial perfusion were assessed referring to a 16 segment model [...] Interobserver agreement (10 A) among 2 readers was determined within each imaging modality. To define a standard of truth {{for the presence of}} segmental myocardial disease an independent expert-panel decision was obtained based on clinical data, ECG, coronary angiography and <b>blinded</b> <b>information</b> from the imaging modalities. Results: Regional wall motion assessment was possible in 98. 1 % of segments using contrast enhanced 2 D echocardiography and in 87. 2 % using unenhanced 2 D echocardiography (p < 0. 001), while perfusion assessment was possible in 90. 1 % of segments (p < 0. 001). 10 A on presence of any regional wall motion abnormality expressed as Kappa coefficient was 0. 71 (95 % Cl 0. 53 - 0. 89) for contrast enhanced echocardiography and 0. 37 (95 % Cl 0. 14 - 0. 59) for unenhanced echocardiography. 10 A on presence of any perfusion abnormality was 0. 53 (95 % Cl 0. 34 - 0. 73). For MCE there was high 10 A for the apical segments (kappa = 0. 57) and Lower 10 A for the basal segments (kappa = 0. 14), while no such gradient was found for the 10 A on watt motion abnormalities. Mean accuracy to detect expert-pane[defined myocardial abnormalities was 80. 6 % for unenhanced echocardiography, 85. 0 % for contrast enhanced 2 D echocardiography and 80. 6 % for MCE. Conclusions: MCE is inferior to contrast enhanced 2 D echocardiography with regard to visibility of all LV segments and appears slightly inferior with regards to 10 A, white both are superior to unenhanced 2 D echocardiography. The methods demonstrated high accuracy in detection of panel defined regional myocardial abnormalities. (C) 2006 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Broadcasting is an {{important}} operation in wireless networks where control information is usually propagated as broadcasts for the realization of most networking protocols. In traditional ad hoc networks, broadcasts are conducted on a common channel, which is shared by all nodes in the network. However, in cognitive radio (CR) ad hoc networks, unlicensed users may observe heterogeneous spectrum availability, which is unknown to other unlicensed users before the control information was broadcast. Thus, it is extremely challenging that broadcasts can be successfully conducted without knowing the spectrum availability information in advance. In addition, since broadcast collisions (i. e., simultaneous reception of broadcast messages at the same node) often lead to the waste of network resources, they should be efficiently mitigated in multihop scenarios. In this paper, a quality-of-service (QoS) -based broadcast protocol under <b>Blind</b> <b>Information</b> for multihop CR ad hoc networks, i. e., QB(2) IC, is proposed {{with the aim of}} having a high success rate and short broadcast delay. In our design, we do not assume that unlicensed users are aware of the network topology, the spectrum availability information, and time synchronization information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the broadcast issue in multihop CR ad hoc networks under <b>blind</b> <b>information.</b> Simulation results show that our proposed QB(2) IC protocol outperforms other broadcast schemes in terms of a higher success rate and shorter average broadcast delay.

Finally, we model the effects of various signal extraction methods and lossy compression. This allows a fair comparison with respect to payload capacity.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the NTRU encryption scheme as lately suggested for use, {{and study the}} connection between inverting the NTRU primitive (i. e., the one-way function over the message and the <b>blinding</b> <b>information</b> which underlies the NTRU scheme) and recovering the NTRU secret key (universal breaking). We model the inverting algorithms as black-box oracles and do not take any advantage of the internal ways by which the inversion works (namely, {{it does not have}} to be done by following the standard decryption algorithm). This allows for secret key recovery directly from the output on several inversion queries even in the absence of decryption failures. Our oracles might be queried on both valid and invalid challenges e, however they are not required to reply (correctly) when their input is invalid. We show that key recovery can be reduced to inverting the NTRU function. The efficiency of the reduction highly depends on the specific values of the parameters. As a side-result, we connect the collisions of the NTRU function with decryption failures which helps us gain a deeper insight into the NTRU primitive...|$|R
