Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved.

40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} {{giving rise to}} neurons and glia cells have been {{isolated}} from the embryonic and adult central nervous system. The {{extent to which they}} are able to differentiate into cells of non-neural lineages, such as the hematopoietic lineage, is nonetheless unclear. We previously reported the isolation of stem cells from the mouse olfactory bulb neuroepithelium. In the present study, we analysed whether olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells (OBSC) can generate cells with hematopoietic features. Cells were prepared from the olfactory bulbs of transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). In culture, transgenic cells proliferated with the same kinetics as wild-type cells. Following mitogen removal, both cell types gave rise to similar numbers of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating that EGFP overexpression does not alter OBSC proliferation and differentiation patterns. When these cells were injected into the tail vein of irradiated mice, no hematopoietic cells derived from the OBSC could be recovered in their peripheral blood, spleen or bone marrow. By contrast, when OBSC were transplanted into the adult brain, EGFP-positive cells were found in the striatum and corpus callosum; differentiated cells expressed antigenic markers of neurons and astrocytes. These results suggest that embryonic olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells are not endowed with the potential to produce hematopoiesis. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

30|$|Plants {{containing}} {{toxic substances}} in amounts {{that can cause}} illness or death of humans and animals are called poisonous plants (Aplin 1976). Depending on the plant species, the poisonous parts of the plants can be the root, rhizome, <b>bulb,</b> <b>stem,</b> branch, leaf, flower, fruit, seed, pollen, nectar or sap (Seçmen and Leblebici 1987). There are several toxicologically significant plant constituents such as oxalates, alkaloids, glycosides, amino acids, proteins, minerals, acids, terpenes, phytotoxins, photosensitizing compounds, phenolics and tannins. These are generally known as secondary metabolites (Frohne and Pfander 1984). In many plants, oxalates are metabolized very slowly or not. However, they might have a toxic effect when accumulating in excess quantities (Franceschi and Horner 1980). Moreover, free calcium at high concentrations is also toxic to cells. Therefore plants could induce calcium oxalate crystal formation to remove excess oxalate or calcium (Çalışkan 2000).|$|E

40|$|During embryo neurogenesis, neurons that {{originate}} from stem cells {{located in the}} forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) continuously migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB). However, other authors describe the occurrence of resident stem cells in the OB. In the present work we report {{that the absence of}} tumor suppressor protein p 53 increases the number of neurosphere-forming cells and the proliferation of stem cells derived from 13. 5 -day embryo OB. Interestingly, differentiation of p 53 knockout-derived neurospheres was biased toward neuronal precursors, suggesting a role for p 53 in the differentiation process. Moreover, we demonstrate the relevance of p 53 in maintaining chromosomal stability in response to genotoxic insult. Finally, our data show that neurosphere stem cells are highly resistant to long-term epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) deprivation in a p 53 -independent fashion, and they preserve their differentiation potential. Thus, these data demonstrate that p 53 controls the proliferation, chromosomal stability and differentiation pattern of embryonic mouse olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells...|$|E

40|$|Insulin {{was first}} {{identified}} as an anabolic pancreatic hormone responsible for glucose homeostasis, and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-I) as the mediator of the action of Growth Hormone on postnatal growth. New molecular, pharmacological and embryological information has broadened {{the scope of the}} physiological roles of these hormones and their related molecules, particularly the insulin precursor proinsulin, during vertebrate development. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that proinsulin is expressed and functional before emergence of the pancreas. Proinsulin gene expression in the chick and mouse embryo shows fine transcriptional and postrancriptional regulation with generation of specific embryonic transcripts which are differentially translated. The protein product remains as unprocessed proinsulin that protects the cells from excessive apoptosis during neurulation. In contrast, IGF-I is expressed later than proinsulin in the chick embryo and it starts in the nervous system. In the mouse embryo, generation of olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells in culture has allowed the study of these molecules' role in the proliferation and differentiation of neural precursors. Proinsulin and IGF-I can cooperate with mitogens (EGF and FGF 2) in the control of stem/ precursor cells proliferation and IGF-I is an essential factor for neural differentiation. Mice deficient in IGF-I present a disruption of olfactory bulb cytoarchitecture, with decreased numbers of mitral cells and abnormal radial glia. This article gives thus an overview of the important role of insulin family proteins in development. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|NURR 1 is an {{essential}} transcription factor for the differentiation, maturation, and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) {{as it has been}} demonstrated using knock-out mice. DA neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta degenerate in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and mutations in the Nurr 1 gene have been associated with this human disease. Thus, the study of NURR 1 actions in vivo is fundamental to understand the mechanisms of neuron generation and degeneration in the dopaminergic system. Here, we present and discuss findings indicating that NURR 1 is a valuable molecular tool for the in vitro generation of DA neurons which could be used for modeling and studying PD in cell culture and in transplantation approaches. Transduction of Nurr 1 alone or in combination with other transcription factors such as Foxa 2, Ngn 2, Ascl 1, and Pitx 3, induces the generation of DA neurons, which upon transplantation have the capacity to survive and restore motor behavior in animal models of PD. We show that the survival of transplanted neurons is increased when the Nurr 1 -transduced olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells are treated with GDNF. The use of these and other factors with the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) -based technology or the direct reprogramming of astrocytes or fibroblasts into human DA neurons has produced encouraging results {{for the study of the}} cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD and for the search of new treatments for this disease.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of neural stem cells (NSC) to generate {{different types of}} neurons and glia depends on the action of intrinsic determinants and extracellular signals. Here, we isolated adult olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells (aOBSC) that express nestin, RC 2 and Sox 2, and that {{have the capacity to}} generate neurons possessing mature features in culture and in vivo. The differentiation of aOBSC into neurons and glia, as well as their genetic profile, was compared to that of embryonic OBSC (eOBSC) and ganglionic eminence stem cells (GESC). While these eOBSC express neurogenin (Ngn) 1 and 2, two telencephalic dorsal markers, GESC only express Ngn 2. Adult OBSC express either little or no detectable Ngn 1 and 2, and they produced significantly fewer neurons in culture than eOBSC. By contrast, Dlx 2 transcripts (a telencephalic ventral marker) were only clearly detected in GESC. When transplanted into the early postnatal P 5 -P 7 OB, each of the three populations gave rise to cells with a distinct pattern of neuronal migration and/or dendritic arborization. Overall, these findings suggest that cultured NSC partially maintain their regional and temporal specification. Notably, significant neuronal migration and differentiation were only observed in vivo when the NSC were briefly exposed to fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2) before grafting, a treatment that enhanced the neurogenin expression. Hence, the migration and maturation of neurons derived from transplanted NSC can be promoted by upregulating neurogenic gene expression with FGF- 2. © 2009 IBRO. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Neurosphere {{cell culture}} is a {{commonly}} used model to study the properties and potential applications of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, standard protocols to culture NSCs {{have yet to be}} established, and the mechanisms underlying NSC survival and maintenance of their undifferentiated state, in response to the growth factors FGF- 2 and EGF are not fully understood. Using cultures of embryonic and adult olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells (eOBSCs and aOBSCs), we analyzed the consequences of FGF- 2 and EGF addition at different intervals on proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell death and differentiation, as well as on global gene expression. As opposed to cultures supplemented daily, addition of FGF- 2 and EGF every 4 days significantly reduced the neurosphere volume and the total number of cells in the spheres, mainly due to increased cell death. Moreover, partial FGF- 2 and EGF deprivation produced an increase in OBSC differentiation during the proliferative phase. These changes were more evident in aOBSC than eOBSC cultures. Remarkably, these effects were accompanied by a significant upregulation in the expression of endogenous Fgf- 2 and genes involved in cell death and survival (Cryab), lipid catabolic processes (Pla 2 g 7), cell adhesion (Dscaml 1), cell differentiation (Dscaml 1, Gpr 17, S 100 b, Ndrg 2) and signal transduction (Gpr 17, Ndrg 2).

40|$|After late embryogenesis, new neurons are {{continuously}} {{added to}} the olfactory bulb (OB) from stem cells located in the forebrain subventricular zone. Nonetheless, stem cells have not been described within the embryonic olfactory bulb. Here we report the isolation of local olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells from the embryonic day 12. 5 - 14. 5 mouse embryo. These cells were 99. 2 % nestin positive and proliferated extensively in culture to at least 150 cell doublings. Clonal analysis demonstrated that neurons (TuJ 1 +), astrocytes (GFAP+), and oligodendrocytes (04 +) could be generated from single-plated cells, indicating that they are multipotent. At least 90 % of proliferating cells expressed insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), (pro) insulin, and their cognate receptors; these growth factors collaborated with fibroblast growth factor- 2 plus epidermal growth factor (EGF) to promote stem cell proliferation and sphere formation. Cells from Igf-I-/- mice, however, proliferated as extensively as did Igf-I+/+ cells. Differentiation and survival of stem cell-generated neurons and glia showed strong dependence on exogenous IGF-I, but oligodendrocyte differentiation also required insulin at low concentration. Furthermore, the percentages of stem cell-generated neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes were markedly lower in the cultures prepared from the Igf-I-/- mice {{compared with those of}} Igf-I+/+. Concordantly, lack of IGF-I resulted in abnormal formation of the olfactory bulb mitral cell layer and altered radial glia morphology. These results support the presence within the embryonic mouse olfactory bulb of stem cells with specific requirements for insulin-related growth factors for proliferation or differentiation. They demonstrate that IGF-I is an endogenous factor regulating the differentiation of stem and other precursor cells within the olfactory bulb.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor Nurr 1 {{is expressed in}} the mouse olfactory bulb (OB), although it remains unknown whether it influences the generation of dopaminergic neurons (DA) (DA neurons) in cells isolated from this brain region. We found that expressing Nurr 1 in proliferating olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>stem</b> cells (OBSCs) produces a marked inhibition of cell proliferation and the generation of immature neurons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) concomitant with marked upregulations of Th, Dat, Gad, and Fgfr 2 transcripts. In long-term cultures, these cells develop neurochemical and synaptic markers of mature-like mesencephalic DA neurons, expressing GIRK 2, VMAT 2, DAT, calretinin, calbindin, synapsin-I, and SV 2. Concurring {{with the increase in}} both Th and Gad expression, a subpopulation of induced cells was both TH- and GAD-immunoreactive indicating that they are dopaminergic-GABAergic neurons. Indeed, these cells could mature to express VGAT, suggesting they can uptake and store GABA in vesicles. Remarkably, the dopamine D 1 receptor agonist SKF- 38393 induced c-Fos in TH+ cells and dopamine release was detected in these cultures under basal and KCl-evoked conditions. By contrast, cotransducing the Neurogenin 2 and Nurr 1 {{transcription factor}}s produced a significant {{decrease in the number of}} TH-positive neurons. Our results indicate that Nurr 1 overexpression in OBSCs induces the formation of two populations of mature dopaminergic neurons with features of the ventral mesencephalon or of the OB, capable of responding to functional dopaminergic stimuli and of releasing dopamine. They also suggest that the accumulation of Fgfr 2 by Nurr 1 in OBSCs may be involved in the generation of DA neurons. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
