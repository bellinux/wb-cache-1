25|$|Vegetable oil {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners. When vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight vegetable oil (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the viscosity of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight vegetable oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel or <b>bioliquids</b> for use under a wider range of conditions.|$|E

40|$|Biofuels for {{transport}} {{belong to a}} sector, which functions in a volatile global environment (macro). Until the end of 2010, European Union had promoted the production and development of vegetable based biofuels {{for transport}} {{as a way to}} reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (nonobligatory Directive 2003 / 30 /EC, with indicator of replacing 5. 75 % of all transport fossil fuels with biofuels in 2010, reached in about 80 %). Currently, bio-components with high CO 2 emission reduction and biofuels produced from inedible plants and raw material waste are being promoted. The Directive 2009 / 28 /EC, which has been in force since 2011, has imposed mandatory obligation on all subjects, who participate in the cycle of biofuels and <b>bioliquid</b> production, to fulfill criteria of sustainable production, including CO 2 emission reduction to at least the threshold level (e. g. at least 50 % reduction by 2017).

When performing a MST experiment, a microscopic temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser, and the directed movement of molecules is detected and quantified. Thermophoresis, {{the movement of}} the molecule in the temperature gradient, depends on three parameters that typically change upon interaction. Thus, the thermophoresis signal is plotted against the ligand concentration to obtain a dose-response curve, from which the binding affinity can be deduced.|$|E

50|$|When {{liquid fuels}} made from biomass {{are used for}} energy {{purposes}} other than transport, they are called <b>bioliquids.</b> With often minimal modification, most residential furnaces and boilers {{that are designed to}} burn No. 2 heating oil can be made to burn either biodiesel or filtered, preheated waste vegetable oil (WVO). If cleaned at home by the consumer, WVO can result in considerable savings. Many restaurants will receive a minimal amount for their used cooking oil, and processing to biodiesel is fairly simple and inexpensive. Burning filtered WVO directly is somewhat more problematic, since it is much more viscous; nonetheless, its burning can be accomplished with suitable preheating. WVO can thus be an economical heating option for those with the necessary mechanical and experimental aptitude.|$|E
5000|$|Generation by {{renewables}} {{grew from}} 76,965 GWh in 2010 to 106,686 GWh by 2015. Non hydroelectric renewable electricity {{more than doubled}} during the period growing from 25,848 GWh in 2010 to 62,748 GWh in 2015, a rise from around 9.3% to 22.3% of total gross generation. The largest increase in production took place in solar generated electricity followed by bio energy production. Wind power rose by a little over 60% during the period whilst geothermal production rose by a little under 15%. Normalised (averaged) hydroelectric statistics suggest a slight upward trend in generation despite wet and dry years influencing the overall production in any given year.

40|$|Solid {{bioenergy}} from forests plays — and {{is expected}} to continue to play — a key role to fulfil the renewable energy targets at the European Union level. When the Renewable Energy Directive was enacted, sustainability criteria were incorporated solely for biofuels and <b>bioliquids.</b> Sustainability criteria for solid bioenergy are also needed in order to prevent wood and primary forest residues from posing additional environmental risks to ecosystems. Acknowledging this, the European Commission has been working on extending the biofuels and <b>bioliquids</b> provisions to solid biomass. An internal draft was circulated in August 2013 which addressed the ways to both balance and mitigate the risks in three main topics: biodiversity; sustainable forest management; and greenhouse gases.
