5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the <b>books</b> <b>at</b> the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
40|$|In a {{study in}} which {{patients}} were allocated non-systematically to surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5, 7. 5, and 10 minute intervals 623 consultations were taperecorded. In surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> longer intervals doctors used the extra {{time to take a}} fuller history from their patients. In surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 10 minute intervals doctors spent more time explaining the patient's problem, explaining the proposed management, and in discussing prevention and health education, these increases not being evident in surgeries <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 7. 5 minute intervals...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in which patients who were seeking appointments for a consultation in a general practice in south London attended consulting sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5, 7. 5, or 10 minute intervals. The particular session that the patient attended was determined non-systematically. The clinical content of the consultation was recorded on an encounter sheet and on audio-tape. At the end of each consultation patients were invited to complete a questionnaire designed to measure satisfaction with the consultation. The stress engendered in doctors carrying out surgery sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> different intervals of time was also measured. <b>At</b> surgery sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5 minute intervals, compared with 7. 5 and 10 minute intervals, the doctors spent less time with the patients and identified fewer problems, and the patients were less satisfied with the consultation. Blood pressure was recorded twice as often in surgery sessions that were <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 10 minute intervals compared with those <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5 minute intervals. There was no evidence that patients who attended sessions <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> shorter intervals received more prescriptions, were investigated or referred more often to hospital specialists, or returned more often for further consultations within four weeks. There was no evidence that the doctors experienced more stress in dealing with consultations that were <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 5 minute intervals than <b>at</b> consultations <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> 7. 5 and 10 minute intervals, though they complained of shortage of time more often in surgery sessions that were <b>booked</b> <b>at</b> shorter intervals...|$|R

5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 <b>books</b> <b>at</b> Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E

5|$|Wallace {{then moved}} to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old {{apprentice}} builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read <b>books</b> <b>at</b> the London Mechanics Institute. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen and of Thomas Paine. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.|$|E
5|$|Born in Isleworth, Greater London, Mousinho {{was signed}} by then Brentford manager Martin Allen during the 2005–06 season, after {{returning}} from the United States where he was studying and playing at the University of Notre Dame. He was recommended to Brentford by Martin Allen's son, having previously been on the <b>books</b> <b>at</b> Chesham United. He made his Brentford debut in October 2005 in a 1–1 against Oxford United in the Football League Trophy; playing the whole match. He made his league debut for the club two months later in a 4–1 away win over Tranmere Rovers, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute. Initially he acted as cover for regular right-back Kevin O'Connor, but was then played in a central midfield role. He was also the outfield player chosen to play as goalkeeper against Gillingham in 2006, when Clark Masters was sent-off, {{and there was not}} a substitute goalkeeper available; the game ended 2–2 with Mousinho playing 75 minutes in goal.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{continued}} {{to publish the}} poetic works of Aikin and Barbauld {{as well as those}} of George Dyer, Joseph Fawcett, James Hurdis, Joel Barlow, Ann Batten Cristall and Edward Williams. Most of the poets that Johnson promoted and published are not remembered today. However, in 1793, Johnson published William Wordsworth's An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches; he remained Wordsworth's publisher until a disagreement separated them in 1799. Johnson also put out Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Fears of Solitude (1798). They were apparently close enough friends for Coleridge to leave his <b>books</b> <b>at</b> Johnson's shop when he toured Europe.|$|E

5|$|On October 12, 1901, the Salem Woman's Club was {{organized}} with {{the wife of}} Oregon Governor Theodore Thurston Geer serving {{as president of the}} organization. Two years later the group started the Salem Public Library at Geer's home, and then later located at Chemeketa and High streets in downtown Salem in the then city hall, with the library's collection totaling 50 <b>books</b> <b>at</b> that time. The library group hired a librarian, Miss F. Phillips, for a salary of $20 per month to run the library. In 1907, the group explored options to build a stand-alone library building using funds provided by Andrew Carnegie, who was providing funds for building libraries around the world.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 <b>books</b> <b>at</b> the library.|$|E
5|$|With {{full access}} to the American consul's massive library of Spanish history, Irving began working on several <b>books</b> <b>at</b> once. The first {{offspring}} of this hard work, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, was published in January 1828. The book was popular in the United States and in Europe and would have 175 editions published {{before the end of}} the century. It was also the first project of Irving's to be published with his own name, instead of a pseudonym, on the title page. Irving was invited to stay at the palace of the Duke of Gor, who gave him unfettered access to his library containing many medieval manuscripts. Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada was published a year later, followed by Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of Columbus in 1831.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Chester, {{he spent}} time in non-League {{football}} with Runcorn F.C. Halton and Witton Albion. While on the <b>books</b> <b>at</b> Witton, he spent five weeks on trial with Football League One side Crewe Alexandra but was not offered a contract, so he signed for League Two side Accrington Stanley in 2006. Whalley spent almost two years with the Lancashire club, but following his release {{in the summer of}} 2008, he returned to non-League, initially with Wrexham. While at Wrexham, he had a short loan spell with Southport where he helped the team to the Conference North play-offs. He subsequently played at Droylsden, where {{he was part of the}} team that won the Manchester Premier Cup in 2010, and Hyde before joining Southport again on a permanent basis in January 2011. He was signed by Luton Town in the summer of 2013 for an undisclosed fee, and joined AFC Telford United on loan in 2014. Both Luton and Telford won their respective leagues during the 2013–14 season, making Whalley a winner of both the Conference Premier and the Conference North in the same season. He left Luton in May 2015, later joining Shrewsbury.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} to establish himself at Crewe Alexandra, Roberts spent time on loan with Merseyside based outfit Southport. Roberts made his Southport debut {{just three days}} after signing for the club, playing the whole match in a 4–0 away defeat to Accrington Stanley. He featured {{in a total of}} six games for Southport, before then opting to join Chester City on a one-month loan deal. Roberts only started one game for Chester in a 5–0 defeat at Carlisle United, and did not feature again for the Cheshire side subsequent to this match. After his unsuccessful loan spell at Chester, Roberts was loaned out to Southport for a second time in March 2006, making his second debut for the club in a 2–1 win away to Forest Green Rovers, in which he was sent off in the 88th minute for two bookable offences. He returned to first team action in Southport's 1–1 draw against Altrincham, before playing the whole match in a 2–0 victory against Accrington Stanley at Haig Avenue. He played 12 times during his second loan spell at the club, playing his final game in Southport's 1–0 home loss against Aldershot Town in April 2006. Despite still being on the <b>books</b> <b>at</b> Crewe, Roberts had not made a first team appearance for the club since 2004 and was again loaned out ahead of the 2006–07 season, this time to Yorkshire-based Conference National side Halifax Town. He played his first game for Halifax in the club's first game of the 2006–07 campaign, starting in a 2–0 away defeat to Oxford United. He scored his first goal for Halifax in a 2–1 victory over Cambridge United, the first goal of the game. Roberts featured in a total of thirteen games for the Halifax, scoring once, before ending his loan spell at the club.|$|E
5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these <b>books</b> <b>at</b> his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{interested}} in the ministers of the Empire, Phipps was diverted to a deeper interest in Napoleon's marshals, primarily by the difficulty of obtaining facts about them. He capitalized on the growing interest of both Britons and the French in the Napoleonic period by purchasing, as they came out, the many personal memoirs published by {{the descendants of the}} participants. Indeed, by 1920, he had acquired over 2,000 volumes, plus sundry maps and letters. That year, in failing health, he moved to the house of his son, Charles, in Carlyle Square (21), Chelsea, London. There was no room for the <b>books</b> <b>at</b> his son's house, so Phipps gave them to All Souls College, Oxford; the majority of them were placed in the Codrington Library. He selected All Souls for its established reputation in military history, and for the Codrington's collection left to it by Sir Foster Cunliffe, who had been killed in action in 1916. The collection, called the Phipps Collection, numbered more than 2,000 volumes, and includes Napoleon's published correspondence, that of the marshals, and has been kept up to date with modern works issued by the Historical Department of the French General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Mousinho {{began his}} {{professional}} football career at Brentford, having previously {{been on the}} <b>books</b> <b>at</b> Chesham United and Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the latter whilst studying at the University of Notre Dame. He originally played as a midfielder before switching to defence. He spent {{two and a half}} years at Brentford, before joining Wycombe Wanderers in June 2008 on a free transfer. Mousinho played regularly for Wycombe for two seasons; witnessing both a promotion and relegation during his tenure at the Buckinghamshire club. He rejected a contract extension from Wycombe in June 2010, and instead opted to join Stevenage on a two–year contract. In his first season at Stevenage, Mousinho helped guide the club to back-to-back promotions, scoring the winner in the 2010–11 League Two play-off final, as well as finishing as the club's joint top goalscorer for the season. Following an injury-hit season during the 2011–12 campaign, Mousinho left Stevenage and joined Preston North End. In his final season at the club, he was loaned to Gillingham and back to Stevenage before being released and joining Burton in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|William Thomas Stearn {{was born}} at 37 Springfield Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871/2–1922) and Ellen ("Nellie") Kiddy (1886–1986) of West Suffolk. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the River Cam, about two miles north of Cambridge's City Centre, where Springfield Road ran {{parallel}} to Milton Road to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (see image). Despite not having any family background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed {{a keen interest in}} natural history and <b>books</b> <b>at</b> an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the wild flowers of the hedgerows and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when William was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties since his widow had no pension.|$|E
