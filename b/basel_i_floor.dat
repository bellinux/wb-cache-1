50|$|<b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> is {{the round}} of {{deliberations}} by central bankers from around the world, and in 1988, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in Basel, Switzerland, published a set of minimum capital requirements for banks. This {{is also known as}} the 1988 Basel Accord, and was enforced by law in the Group of Ten (G-10) countries in 1992. A new set of rules known as Basel II was later developed with the intent to supersede the <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> accords. However they were criticized by some for allowing banks to take on additional types of risk, which was considered part of the cause of the US subprime financial crisis that started in 2008. In fact, bank regulators in the United States took the position of requiring a bank to follow the set of rules (<b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> or <b>Basel</b> II) giving the more conservative approach for the bank. Because of this it was anticipated that only the few very largest US Banks would operate under the Basel II rules, the others being regulated under the <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> framework. <b>Basel</b> III was developed in response to the financial crisis; it does not supersede either <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> or II, but focuses on different issues primarily related to the risk of a bank run.|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the 1988 <b>Basel</b> Accord (<b>Basel</b> <b>I),</b> the revised risk-based capital standards (Basel II) propose regulatory capital requirements based on credit ratings. This paper develops a theoretical model to analyze how banks will adjust their low and high credit risk commercial loans under the proposed newer standard. Capital-constrained banks respond to an adverse capital shock by reducing high credit risk loans, while under certain circumstances, low credit risk loans may actually increase. When compared to <b>Basel</b> <b>I,</b> it is shown that high-risk loans are reduced more under Basel II, but whether a bank reduces total lending more under <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> or under the revised standards depends on a complex interaction of factors. ...|$|R
50|$|National {{regulators}} began imposing formal {{capital requirements}} in the 1980s, and by 1988 most large multinational banks {{were held to}} the <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> standard. <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> categorized assets into five risk buckets, and mandated minimum capital requirements for each. This limits accounting leverage. If a bank is required to hold 8% capital against an asset, {{that is the same}} as an accounting leverage limit of 1/.08 or 12.5 to 1.|$|R

50|$|The US {{initially}} {{proposed that}} banks {{would need to}} use the advanced approach only if they were to implement Basel II.

40|$|Emerging market {{currency}} crises {{are often}} followed by banking crises. One {{reason for the}} transmission is the increased value of foreign debt measured in local currency. Equity capital is often insufficient to ensure liquidity. This problem is addressed by Basel II, in particular by its minimum capital requirements. In difference to the current regulation (<b>Basel</b> <b>I),</b> <b>Basel</b> II employs a differentiated risk weighing on base of credit ratings. This contribution calculates the hypothetic effects of the new regulation on minimum capital requirements for {{the example of the}} South Korea currency and banking crises of 1997. The results are compared to current regulation. It can be shown that minimum capital requirements in the case of Basel II would have been lower than in the case of <b>Basel</b> <b>I.</b> Additionally, minimum capital requirements would have increased dramatically. The transmission from currency to banking crises would not have been prevented, but would have been accelerated. Thereby, minimum capital requirements under <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> have been relatively low because of South Korea’s OECD membership. It can therefore be concluded that in other emerging market economies, which are not OECD members, the ratio of minimum capital requirements of Basel II to the minimum capital requirements of <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> prior the crises would have been even lower. Therefore, the new instrument of banking regulation would have intensified the transmission from currency to banking crises. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} set to examine the {{developmental}} impact of international Codes and Standards (C&S) as they are applied to the banking system in Brazil. It {{is driven by the}} questions: to what extent has compliance with international C&S affected, or may affect in the future, credit to the SMEs and the poor? Through what mechanisms? What changes (institutional, other) have occurred as a result? The paper focuses on the implementation of the Basel rules – <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> and II. It finds strong indications that, as a result of implementation of <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> in Brazil, credit as a proportion of the country’s GDP declined gradually between 1994 (when <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> was adopted) and early this century. The paper also argues that <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> probably contributed to the {{decline in the number of}} banks in Brazil since 1994, and to banking concentration as well. Furthermore, the paper shows that although <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> has affected credit in Brazil, there is no clear evidence that credit to the SMEs, to rural producers or to the urban poor was negatively affected, at least not in a major way. The paper suggests that a main reason for this outcome is that credit patterns during the period under <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> have been influenced by directed credit policy, which in a number of cases were intended to protect the less favoured segments. In relation to Basel II, the paper shows that Brazil’s regulators are proposing a gradual approach for the full implementation of these new banking rules. The paper sees this approach as appropriate for a developing country like Brazil where banks need time, resources and capacity building to be able to adopt Basel II in its entirety. But it also argues that the proposed framework lacks any countervailing mechanisms or instruments to address three key potentially negative implications concerning the new Basel rules: possible further banking concentration, concentration of banks’ portfolios away from SMEs and towards big corporations, and accentuated bank credit pro-cyclicality.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma {{thesis is}} to analyze the {{evolution}} of banking regulation {{from the turn of}} the 19 th and 20 th century with regard to the introduction of global standards of regulation and supervision. Great emphasis was placed on the status and functionality of the current regulation and also on its future shape as Basel III rules. In the theoretical part <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> and <b>Basel</b> II projects are presented. The first of these is the concept from 1987 (<b>Basel</b> <b>I)</b> with the emphasis on greater stability and reliability of the international banking system. <b>Basel</b> <b>I,</b> however, represented a very simple and straightforward form of regulation, where the only monitored standard is bank's credit exposure. The amendment to <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> and primarily <b>Basel</b> II, introduced a pillar regulation structure, which is still valid and provides national regulator a sufficient power to carry out its activities. The second, practical part of the thesis is devoted to current development and problems of banking regulation.

The new proposal became known as Basel II to differentiate it from the earlier <b>Basel</b> <b>I.</b> To a large extent, the proposed Basel II {{was in response to}} widespread criticism of <b>Basel</b> <b>I.</b> But it also reflected additional thought and analysis of the role of bank capital regulation.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>Basel</b> <b>I,</b> <b>Basel</b> II features with three-pillar framework {{which has been}} acknowledged as superior both by academics and industry. Fundamentally, the three-pillar framework reflects a major shift from simple risk measurement under <b>Basel</b> <b>I</b> to comprehensive risk management under Basel II. However, this obvious aspect of superiority is not a sufficient explanation for the likely success of Basel II as a regulatory system designed for maintaining financial stability. Basel II embraces certain features of "third-way" regulatory strategies which are positioned mid-way between direct government command and self-regulation. This paper will draw on two of those "middle-path" concepts to evaluate Basel II; {{one of these is}} "reflexivity" as explicated by Aalders and Wilthagen (1997), another is "responsive regulation" as developed by John Braithwaite and his co-researchers (Ayres & Braithwaite, 1992).

However, this policy combination brings a more stable economic and financial system. We also analyze the optimal way to implement the countercyclical capital buffer stated by Basel III.
