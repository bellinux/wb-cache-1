50|$|Having taken both eggs, the {{characters}} {{proceed to the}} last chapter, Dragondown Grotto, a grotto formed from a cave collapse where a cabal of wizards hunted down the dracolich centuries ago after having destroyed its phylactery. Targan Klem and his black dragon cohort <b>Blackbone</b> {{are in the midst}} of raising the dracolich, a former blue dragon named Tsaggest Darkweld, when {{the characters}} arrive. <b>Blackbone,</b> as well as a group of dragonnes try to keep the adventurers at bay until the spell is finished and the Dracolich is awakened. Klem attempts to continue the ritual until it is absolutely impossible to avoid combat.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to Saliva, Scott fronted a Memphis-area {{heavy metal}} band called <b>BlackBone</b> {{in the early}} 1990s. He also plays drums and guitar. He made a cameo {{appearance}} on Jay-Z's [...] "Takeover" [...] from his 2001 album The Blueprint. He has also recorded with Lil Wyte ("Homicidal, Suicidal" [...] and [...] "Crazy"), Three 6 Mafia ("Getting Fucked Up" [...] and [...] "Mosh Pit"), and The X-Ecutioners ("(Even) More Human Than Human").|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} series the Meta-Flux {{remained}} in the hands of Sonny <b>Blackbones.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of Clamp and his old partner, the pirate Sonny <b>Blackbones,</b> the Snow Kids escape General Bleylock's machinations and win the Galactik Football Cup.|$|R
50|$|The Meta-Flux is a {{synthetic}} flux created by Professor Yarrit Lobnor (Who {{would later become}} Professor Clamp) and Professor I'Son (Who would later become Sonny <b>Blackbones)</b> during their attempts to create a Flux {{that would allow the}} Technoid Robotic Galactik Football Team to compete on an equal level with those teams in possession of a natural Flux.|$|R
50|$|Targan Klem {{will attempt}} to {{teleport}} away if he is sufficiently injured or if his dragon companion is killed. <b>Blackbone</b> will leave if Klem is killed. If either {{of these is the}} case they will plot revenge on the party. If Darkweld is raised it will leave to build a new phylactery for itself, and then returns from the southern deserts with an army of minions to devastate the region where his enemies once lived. Meepo, if befriended, might return with his draconic wards to help the PCs in the future.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>Blackbone</b> 2, a novel fully decentralized algorithm {{that aims}} at creating a robust backbone in ad hoc networks. Backbone robustness {{is supported by}} a 2 -Connected m-dominating Set, 2,m-CDS, and decentralization relies on the usage of two rules that only require two-hop knowledge {{in order to reduce the}} use of bandwidth. <b>Blackbone</b> 2 deterministic approach guarantees a density-independent valid solution and is proved correct. The algorithm is also characterized by its efficient theoretical computation time, O(Δ^ 2) with Δ the average number of neighbors, which outperforms known solutions. The domination parameter, m, can be increased without changing the theoretical computation time. Efficiency of the <b>Blackbone</b> 2 algorithm compared to the equivalent literature solutions is illustrated through simulations of a large panel of networks with a wide density range...|$|E
40|$|Food {{business}} {{is one of}} the favorite business in Semarang, especially café. It’s proven with the rising of the growth number by 2010 to 2016 in Semarang area. One of the favorite café is <b>Blackbone</b> Coffee, located in Banyumanik. The tight competition in this business become one of the factor of decreasing selling in <b>Blackbone</b> Coffee. Therefore creative ideas are needed to hold the business on. The goal {{of this study is to}} explain the influence of the café’s atmosphere, promotion appeal, and product’s variety to the purchase decision, where the brand image is used as the intervening variable between the café’s atmosphere, promotion appeal, and product’s variety of the purchase decision in the <b>Blackbone</b> café. Those factors have the bisggest impact in the purchase decision by the customers. Sample were collected from 100 repondents. Respondents' answers were analyzed by Multiple Linear Regression using SPSS program. The result show that café’s atmosphere, promotion appeal, and product variety has positive and significant impact on brand image variable. 0, 383 for café atmosphere, 0, 161 for promotion appeal, and 0, 459 for product variety. Brand image as the intervening variable has positive and significant impact on purchase decision variable with 0, 443...|$|E
50|$|As the Snow Kids {{progress}} through the competition, each develops the Breath of Akillian. There are some intra-team tensions caused by Tia and Rocket's burgeoning relationship and Micro-Ice's unrequited crush on Mei. Unknown {{to any of them}} is that all seven of the players have been affected by the Meta-Flux, a synthetic undetectable Flux, inadvertently created by Clamp and pirate Sonny <b>Blackbones,</b> that was the true origin of the Akillian Ice Age. This Flux is now coveted by the ruthless General Bleylock, who happily endangers the Snow Kids to get his hands on it.|$|R
5000|$|Thran - Thran is Ahito's brother. He is {{best friends}} with Micro-ice and D'Jok. Thran is {{a defender of}} the Snow Kids. He {{is one of the}} few {{characters}} that does not seem to have gotten into arguments with anyone due to his likable and cheerful nature. In season 1 he appears to be the smartest Snow Kid and shows interests in technology and gaming. He helps Clamp with his gadgets and can be seen playing games together. Thran also has invented a football with a device that reads the speed in which it is kicked at. He is a great hacker as seen in [...] "The Escape" [...] where he helps Sonny <b>Blackbones</b> and Micro-Ice escape Akillian using blueprints of the ventilation system he had acquired. In season 2 tries to support his brother through the illness that developed. When the illness often affected his brother's strength and skills Thran tried to protect him and helped him hide it. He also spends his time supporting his cousin Yuki as she tries to fit in with the team. In season 3 Thran is still the same cheerfully boy and he is more passionate about new technologies. He was smuggled in a pirate shuttle back on Paradisia with Clamp and helped prevent the ship from exploding in the middle of the Galaxy.|$|R
50|$|D'Jok - D'Jok is {{considered}} to be the star player of the Snow Kids and plays as the striker. He is dedicated to Galactik Football and tries his best to make sure the Snow Kids wins the Galactik Football Cup. In season 1, D'Jok was brought up by his foster mom Maya, who took him in as her adoptive son upon his biological mother's request before she died. Despite refusing to foretell his future, D'Jok later on finds out that Sonny <b>Blackbones</b> is his father. D'Jok's mother died after giving birth to him and Maya took him under her care. In season 2, D'Jok got to take Rocket's place in the All Star Match, due to his suspension, and became the team captain. In season 3, D'Jok leaves the Snow Kids for Team Paradisia but eventually returns to the team. He also teaches a group of kids how to play football along with the help of Warren and Artegor. Towards the end of season 1, D'Jok and Mei shared a kiss and dated till the beginning of season 3. Mei accused D'Jok to be too controlling and left him for Sinedd. However, D'Jok shares a kiss with Nikki 4 whom Mei sees on the screen caught by a paparazzi and got upset about it. D'Jok is seen to be arrogant and sometimes selfish, but he also has a caring side. He is best friends with Micro-Ice and good friends with Thran, Ahito and Mark too. Subsequently, Sinedd is D'Jok's arch enemy, as both of them compete against each other to see who is the better one. Although, at the end of season 3, they get along with each other. D'Jok cites Warren as his favorite Galactik Football player. D'Jok wears the jersey number 9. He is described to have red spiky hair and green eyes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we report on our e orts to test and expand the current {{state-of-the-art}} in eigenvalue solvers applied to the eld of nanotechnology. We singled out the nonlinear conjugate gradients method as the <b>blackbone</b> of our e orts for their previous success in predicting the electronic properties of large nanostructures and made a library of three di erent solvers (two recent and one new) that we integrated into the parallel PESCAN (Parallel Energy SCAN) code [3] to perform a comparison. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} study the quality of CDS-based virtual {{backbones}} generated by fully distributed algorithms in mobile environments. As virtual-backbones {{may be used for}} different purposes, the importance of a characteristic may vary accordingly. In order to deal with this variety issue, we provide a set of quality criteria quantifying different suitable aspects for virtual backbones in mobile ad hoc net- works. Distributed and localized algorithms are then compared through simulations with respect to these measures and criterion-specific optimizations are proposed for the <b>Blackbone</b> 2 algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{mechanical}} {{relaxation behavior}} of two series of amorphous polyolefins, was investigated from 4. 2 K {{to the glass}} transition. Most of the polymers show a damping maximum or plateau in the 40 to 50 K region. Various mechanisms which have been suggested for cryogenic relaxations in amorphous polymers are considered as they might relate to the polyolefins. Two secondary relaxation processes above 80 K are distinguished. A relaxation at about 160 K (beta) {{in the second and}} third member of each series is associated with restricted <b>blackbone</b> motion. This process requires a certain degree of chain flexibility since it is not observed in the first member of each series. A lower temperature process (gamma) is observed in each member of the second series and is attributed to motion of the ethyl side group...|$|E
50|$|Tia - Tia is the {{daughter}} of the Obia Moon Ambassador. In season 1, she secretly runs away to Akillian in order to try out on Aarch's team. She meets Rocket when her spaceship crashes, and Rocket agrees {{to take her to the}} tryouts. However, her parents take her back to Obia Moon as they do not want their daughter to play football, but later agree with her decision. Tia was the first one out of the Snow Kids to already have The Breath. During the Snow Kids' match against the Wombat's Tia gets attacked by Wooamboo, in order to prevent the Snow Kids from winning. In season 2, Tia was about to fall of a cliff but Rocket uses his Breath to save her and he gets suspended. Tia is upset about this and believes it was her fault. She tries her best to bring back Rocket and blames D'Jok for doing nothing. She later beats Rocket in Netherball in hope to bring him back to the Snow Kids, after the Galactik Football League allowing him back to the team. Tia during the GFC tournament leaves the Snow Kids for a while to save her parents in prison with the help from Sonny <b>Blackbones</b> and his team. Yuki had to take her place during the Ryker's match. In season 3, Tia becomes the team captain when D'Jok leaves the team. She also gets jealous of Lun Zia because Tia thinks that she likes Rocket, but later finds out that Lun Zia already has a boyfriend. Tia is seen to be shy and caring. She used to carry a camera with her in season 1. She is in a relationship with Rocket and would do anything for him. Tia in season 1 becomes best friend's with Mei. She even supported Mei in season 3, during her relationship with Sinedd. Tia has blond hair and green eyes. She wears the jersey number 4 and plays in midfield.|$|R
