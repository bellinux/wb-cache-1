However, the luminosity will increase by a factor of two in the coming years. Therefore it is planned to build and install a new detector in the extended year-end technical stop (YETS) in 2016 - 17. Barrel pixel modules are in production since Spring/Summer 2015 in five different centers. Module production requires bump bonding, wire bonding and gluing processes to finally assemble a full module. To have a uniform performance of all modules standard qualification procedures have been developed. All modules will be subjected to 10 termal cycles between + 17 ^∘C and - 25 ^∘C and then electrically tested. In addition, module performance will be verified under high rate X-rays, and internal calibrate signals used for electrical tests will be calibrated in units of electrons using well defined X-ray fluorescence lines from different target materials.

Results showed that although the general flow pattern and trends have been produced with the single and double plate stack system, details of a neighboring solid wall do affect the developments of vortices in the stack region. The symmetric assumption in the computational domain may result in the absence of details that could generate an incomplete explanation of the patterns observed such as shown in this study. This is significant in understanding the solid-fluid interactions that is thermoacoustic phenomena...|$|E

In “The White Cat, ” Scudder employs grotesque elements as well but his application is subtly done unlike Poe whose application is more pronounced. The underlying meaning of this short story is on the spell of enchantment. However, Scudder, like Poe, displays the supernatural events through the characters of the “fairies ” who has magical power to change the once a beautiful princess to a white cat.

40|$|Many of {{the current}} Malaysian {{healthcare}} information are still paper-based and standalone. Majority of the stand-alone systems which used to handle medical information systems do not utilize the Internet or any other real time technologies. Although there is several health information systems used in some of Malaysia's hospitals, none of these information systems handle health records. The progress of Health or Hospital Information Systems (HISs) has been very slow, and {{it is unlikely to}} increase much in the future. Health records are used to store individuals' health data, the data can be important at the time of need. Data management is an important step in maintaining health records but current data health management of healthcare systems in Malaysia is ineffective. Health data are scattered around health providers such as private clinics or government hospitals, individuals are unable to access their complete health records. Without a complete health record, medical officers are unable to grasp the full picture of individual's health, which lead to medical errors, drug interactions and unnecessary tests. Even with electronic health records, they are usually maintained in a computer with Internet connectivity. Countries like Malaysia have a lot of rural areas without internet access and computers are not that common to the people living in rural areas. However, a cellphone is a common device which is not only owned by many people living in Malaysia, but all around the world. PPHR (Portable Personal Health Record) is an application that can be installed in a cellphone and it is designed to manage personal health records. Extensions of the PPHR such as improving the accessibility, availability and usability have been made in this research to focus on Malaysian residents.

The state controls and manages education in the said countries. But, most of the controlling powers have been delegated to the Ic-al school governing bodies (paragraphs 2. 4. 1, 2. 5. 1 and 2. 5. 2. 1). The design of the research instrument as well as the empirical investigation was conducted in chapter three.

40|$|Supporting the {{humanitarian}} community in crisis situations worldwide {{is becoming increasingly}} important as the frequency end extent of crises are growing. The effectiveness of humanitarian aid and rescue missions is dependent on timely and reliable information. After a disaster has happened time is critical. Intervention within the first 48 hours is crucial to save lives. At {{the same time it}} is often difficult to understand how best to send in rescue teams, since in most sudden onset natural disaster the overall situation is complex. In major disasters the requirement for coordination does not cease after the first 48 hours. Instead, many large scale international humanitarian support missions just start after this period. In all cases, information on the location of the event, the amount of damage/casualties and the transport infrastructure still available are critical to send in help. The operational support of humanitarian relief efforts during crisis situations with rapid mapping and communications and navigation is becoming more and more important. Communication between relief forces in the field is essential for coordination as is dissemination of aggregated situation information into the field. Recent work has demonstrated the use of web mapping and satellite based communication services as useful tools. This is reflected in initiatives and projects like the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disasters’ or the GSE RESPOND. Nevertheless, there is still a need for an improvement of the products provided so far and an extension of services. Today most relief organizations employ one or more of the existing satellite communication networks, mostly for voice communications between local and central headquarters. Receivers for GPS (and Galileo in future) are widespread and provide personal navigation in an often unfamiliar environment. Earth observation satellites provide overhead imagery to show type of damage and precise damage location, mostly used in headquarters for assistance with strategic decisions. However, the potential of combining the individual systems to an integrated infrastructure is only utilized to a minimal extent. However, if done optimally it can provide many benefits such as a more accurate damage assessment and the selecting the transport infrastructure that should be used by the rescue teams. A major field for improvements is the extension of the information flow to and from the individual members of a relief team. Our work addresses the existing lack of rapidly deployable infrastructures in order to support the efforts of the relief teams in disaster management. We have been working on such rapidly deployable infrastructures within recent and ongoing projects. Our work builds on both existing and innovative solutions and services to assist the post disaster stages of the crisis life cycle. In this paper we are presenting a disaster management tool “DMT” that is being developed in the framework of the LIMES project and has the following objectives: •	Advance the coordination and data sharing of crisis relevant information within the European and international context to minimize time losses between data acquisition and information extraction •	Development and integration of dedicated telecommunication tools in crisis management for robust bi-directional exchange of information between headquarters and field teams, including transfer of vector/raster information for situation assessment as well as robust communications and information exchange between teams in the field •	A system that is fully accepted by professional disaster management teams for its usability and usefulness. Accordingly, end users have been closely involved starting from the initial concept and are consulted for feedback during the entire implementation. Analysis of rescue operations and interviews with rescue workers were done to derive a comprehensive list of mandatory requirements that have to be met by our system, in order to become operational. As an example of striving to meet such requirements, the system is designed for “zero-configuration” upon setting up when arriving at an incident. In this paper, background information about the need of DMT, purpose and functionality, system design and implementation aspects (software and hardware) will <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>details.</b> Additionally, details on the communications and navigation tools, the smart rapid mapping concept and the different hardware flavors will be illustrated. Field experiences and user feedback from our demonstrations of the DMT in the Assessment Mission Course (AMC) in Cyprus in 2008 and 2009 will be shown. Finally, an outlook of the future work towards extending the system’s capabilities will be given...|$|E
40|$|Classical imaging optics {{has been}} {{developed}} over centuries in many areas, such as its paraxial imaging theory and practical design methods like multi-parametric optimization techniques. Although these imaging optical design methods can provide elegant solutions to many traditional optical problems, {{there are more and}} more new design problems, like solar concentrator, illumination system, ultra-compact camera, etc., that require maximum energy transfer efficiency, or ultra-compact optical structure. These problems do not have simple solutions from classical imaging design methods, because not only paraxial rays, but also non-paraxial rays should be well considered in the design process. Non-imaging optics is a newly developed optical discipline, which does not aim to form images, but to maximize energy transfer efficiency. One important concept developed from non-imaging optics is the “edge-ray principle”, which states that the energy flow contained in a bundle of rays will be transferred to the target, if all its edge rays are transferred to the target. Based on that concept, many CPC solar concentrators have been developed with efficiency close to the thermodynamic limit. When more than one bundle of edge-rays needs to be considered in the design, one way to obtain solutions is to use SMS method. SMS stands for Simultaneous Multiple Surface, which means several optical surfaces are constructed simultaneously. The SMS method was developed as a design method in Non-imaging optics during the 90 s. The method can be considered as an extension to the Cartesian Oval calculation. In the traditional Cartesian Oval calculation, one optical surface is built to transform an input wave-front to an out-put wave-front. The SMS method however, is dedicated to solve more than 1 wave-fronts transformation problem. In the beginning, only 2 input wave-fronts and 2 output wave-fronts transformation problem was considered in the SMS design process for rotational optical systems or free-form optical systems. Usually “SMS 2 D” method stands for the SMS procedure developed for rotational optical system, and “SMS 3 D” method for the procedure for free-form optical system. Although the SMS method was originally employed in non-imaging optical system designs, it has been found during this thesis that with the improved capability to design more surfaces and control more input and output wave-fronts, the SMS method can also be applied to imaging system designs and possesses great advantage over traditional design methods. In this thesis, one of the main goals to achieve is to further develop the existing SMS- 2 D method to design with more surfaces and improve the stability of the SMS- 2 D and SMS- 3 D algorithms, so that further optimization process can be combined with SMS algorithms. The benefits of SMS plus optimization strategy over traditional optimization strategy will <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>details</b> for both rotational and free-form imaging optical system designs. Another main goal is to develop novel design concepts and methods suitable for challenging non-imaging applications, e. g. solar concentrator and solar tracker. This thesis comprises 9 chapters and can be grouped into two parts: the first part (chapter 2 - 5) contains research works in the imaging field, and the second part (chapter 6 - 8) contains works in the non-imaging field. In the first chapter, an introduction to basic imaging and non-imaging design concepts and theories is given. Chapter 2 presents a basic SMS- 2 D imaging design procedure using meridian rays. In this chapter, we will set the imaging design problem from the SMS point of view, and try to solve the problem numerically. The stability of this SMS- 2 D design procedure will also be discussed. The design concepts and procedures developed in this chapter lay the path for further improvement. Chapter 3 presents two improved SMS 3 surfaces’ design procedures using meridian rays (SMS- 3 M) and skew rays (SMS- 1 M 2 S) respectively. The major improvement has been made to the central segments selections, so that the whole SMS procedures become more stable compared to procedures described in Chapter 2. Since these two algorithms represent two types of phase space sampling, their image forming capabilities are compared in a simple objective design. Chapter 4 deals with an ultra-compact SWIR camera design with the SMS- 3 M method. The difficulties in this wide band camera design is how to maintain high image quality meanwhile reduce the overall system length. This interesting camera design provides a playground for the classical design method and SMS design methods. We will show designs and optical performance from both classical design method and the SMS design method. Tolerance study is also given as the end of the chapter. Chapter 5 develops a two-stage SMS- 3 D based optimization strategy for a 2 freeform mirrors imaging system. In the first optimization phase, the SMS- 3 D method is integrated into the optimization process to construct the two mirrors in an accurate way, drastically reducing the unknown parameters to only few system configuration parameters. In the second optimization phase, previous optimized mirrors are parameterized into Qbfs type polynomials and set up in code V. Code V optimization results demonstrates the effectiveness of this design strategy in this 2 -mirror system design. Chapter 6 shows an etendue-squeezing condenser optics, which were prepared for the 2010 IODC illumination contest. This interesting design employs many non-imaging techniques such as the SMS method, etendue-squeezing tessellation, and groove surface design. This device has theoretical efficiency limit as high as 91. 9 %. Chapter 7 presents a freeform mirror-type solar concentrator with uniform irradiance on the solar cell. Traditional parabolic mirror concentrator has many drawbacks like hot-pot irradiance on the center of the cell, insufficient use of active cell area due to its rotational irradiance pattern and small acceptance angle. In order to conquer these limitations, a novel irradiance homogenization concept is developed, which lead to a free-form mirror design. Simulation results show that the free-form mirror reflector has rectangular irradiance pattern, uniform irradiance distribution and large acceptance angle, which confirm the viability of the design concept. Chapter 8 presents a novel beam-steering array optics design strategy. The goal of the design is to track large angle parallel rays by only moving optical arrays laterally, and convert it to small angle parallel output rays. The design concept is developed as an extended SMS method. Potential applications of this beam-steering device are: skylights to provide steerable natural illumination, building integrated CPV systems, and steerable LED illumination. Conclusion and future lines of work are given in Chapter 9. Resumen La óptica de formación de imagen clásica se ha ido desarrollando durante siglos, dando lugar tanto a la teoría de óptica paraxial y los métodos de diseño prácticos como a técnicas de optimización multiparamétricas. Aunque estos métodos de diseño óptico para formación de imagen puede aportar soluciones elegantes a muchos problemas convencionales, siguen apareciendo nuevos problemas de diseño óptico, concentradores solares, sistemas de iluminación, cámaras ultracompactas, etc. que requieren máxima transferencia de energía o dimensiones ultracompactas. Este tipo de problemas no se pueden resolver fácilmente con métodos clásicos de diseño porque durante el proceso de diseño no solamente se deben considerar los rayos paraxiales sino también los rayos no paraxiales. La óptica anidólica o no formadora de imagen es una disciplina que ha evolucionado en gran medida recientemente. Su objetivo no es formar imagen, es maximazar la eficiencia de transferencia de energía. Un concepto importante de la óptica anidólica son los “rayos marginales”, que se pueden utilizar para el diseño de sistemas ya que si todos los rayos marginales llegan a nuestra área del receptor, todos los rayos interiores también llegarán al receptor. Haciendo uso de este principio, se han diseñado muchos concentradores solares que funcionan cerca del límite teórico que marca la termodinámica. Cuando consideramos más de un haz de rayos marginales en nuestro diseño, una posible solución es usar el método SMS (Simultaneous Multiple Surface), el cuál diseña simultáneamente varias superficies ópticas. El SMS nació como un método de diseño para óptica anidólica durante los años 90. El método puede ser considerado como una extensión del cálculo del óvalo cartesiano. En el método del óvalo cartesiano convencional, se calcula una superficie para transformar un frente de onda entrante a otro frente de onda saliente. El método SMS permite transformar varios frentes de onda de entrada en frentes de onda de salida. Inicialmente, sólo era posible transformar dos frentes de onda con dos superficies con simetría de rotación y sin simetría de rotación, pero esta limitación ha sido superada recientemente. Nos referimos a “SMS 2 D” como el método orientado a construir superficies con simetría de rotación y llamamos “SMS 3 D” al método para construir superficies sin simetría de rotación o free-form. Aunque el método originalmente fue aplicado en el diseño de sistemas anidólicos, se ha observado que gracias a su capacidad para diseñar más superficies y controlar más frentes de onda de entrada y de salida, el SMS también es posible aplicarlo a sistemas de formación de imagen proporcionando una gran ventaja sobre los métodos de diseño tradicionales. Uno de los principales objetivos de la presente tesis es extender el método SMS- 2 D para permitir el diseño de sistemas con mayor número de superficies y mejorar la estabilidad de los algoritmos del SMS- 2 D y SMS- 3 D, haciendo posible combinar la optimización con los algoritmos. Los beneficios de combinar SMS y optimización comparado con el proceso de optimización tradicional se explican en detalle para sistemas con simetría de rotación y sin simetría de rotación. Otro objetivo importante de la tesis es el desarrollo de nuevos conceptos de diseño y nuevos métodos en el área de la concentración solar fotovoltaica. La tesis está estructurada en 9 capítulos que están agrupados en dos partes: la primera de ellas (capítulos 2 - 5) se centra en la óptica formadora de imagen mientras que en la segunda parte (capítulos 6 - 8) se presenta el trabajo del área de la óptica anidólica. El primer capítulo consta de una breve introducción de los conceptos básicos de la óptica anidólica y la óptica en formación de imagen. El capítulo 2 describe un proceso de diseño SMS- 2 D sencillo basado en los rayos meridianos. En este capítulo se presenta el problema de diseñar un sistema formador de imagen desde el punto de vista del SMS y se intenta obtener una solución de manera numérica. La estabilidad de este proceso se analiza con detalle. Los conceptos de diseño y los algoritmos desarrollados en este capítulo sientan la base sobre la cual se realizarán mejoras. El capítulo 3 presenta dos procedimientos para el diseño de un sistema con 3 superficies SMS, el primero basado en rayos meridianos (SMS- 3 M) y el segundo basado en rayos oblicuos (SMS- 1 M 2 S). La mejora más destacable recae en la selección de los segmentos centrales, que hacen más estable todo el proceso de diseño comparado con el presentado en el capítulo 2. Estos dos algoritmos representan dos tipos de muestreo del espacio de fases, su capacidad para formar imagen se compara diseñando un objetivo simple con cada uno de ellos. En el capítulo 4 se presenta un diseño ultra-compacto de una cámara SWIR diseñada usando el método SMS- 3 M. La dificultad del diseño de esta cámara de espectro ancho radica en mantener una alta calidad de imagen y al mismo tiempo reducir drásticamente sus dimensiones. Esta cámara es muy interesante para comparar el método de diseño clásico y el método de SMS. En este capítulo se presentan ambos diseños y se analizan sus características ópticas. En el capítulo 5 se describe la estrategia de optimización basada en el método SMS- 3 D. El método SMS- 3 D calcula las superficies ópticas de manera precisa, dejando sólo unos pocos parámetros libres para decidir la configuración del sistema. Modificando el valor de estos parámetros se genera cada vez mediante SMS- 3 D un sistema completo diferente. La optimización se lleva a cabo variando los mencionados parámetros y analizando el sistema generado. Los resultados muestran que esta estrategia de diseño es muy eficaz y eficiente para un sistema formado por dos espejos. En el capítulo 6 se describe un sistema de compresión de la Etendue, que fue presentado en el concurso de iluminación del IODC en 2010. Este interesante diseño hace uso de técnicas propias de la óptica anidólica, como el método SMS, el teselado de las lentes y el diseño mediante grooves. Este dispositivo tiene un límite teórica en la eficiencia del 91. 9 %. El capítulo 7 presenta un concentrador solar basado en un espejo free-form con irradiancia uniforme sobre la célula. Los concentradores parabólicos tienen numerosas desventajas como los puntos calientes en la zona central de la célula, uso no eficiente del área de la célula al ser ésta cuadrada y además tienen ángulos de aceptancia de reducido. Para poder superar estas limitaciones se propone un novedoso concepto de homogeneización de la irrandancia que se materializa en un diseño con espejo free-form. El análisis mediante simulación demuestra que la irradiancia es homogénea en una región rectangular y con mayor ángulo de aceptancia, lo que confirma la viabilidad del concepto de diseño. En el capítulo 8 se presenta un novedoso concepto para el diseño de sistemas afocales dinámicos. El objetivo del diseño es realizar un sistema cuyo haz de rayos de entrada pueda llegar con ángulos entre ± 45 º mientras que el haz de rayos a la salida sea siempre perpendicular al sistema, variando únicamente la posición de los elementos ópticos lateralmente. Las aplicaciones potenciales de este dispositivo son varias: tragaluces que proporcionan iluminación natural, sistemas de concentración fotovoltaica integrados en los edificios o iluminación direccionable con LEDs.
