5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water <b>bottle</b> <b>cap</b> popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a <b>bottle</b> <b>cap,</b> possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Ann and Mark have a {{discussion}} at J.J.'s Diner, a Pawnee restaurant {{that had previously been}} featured in the episodes [...] "The Reporter" [...] and [...] "Summer Catalog". In all three episodes, a different interior set is used, although the exterior building shots are the same. At the Snakehole Lounge, Tom flirts with a woman by giving her a <b>bottle</b> <b>cap</b> [...] "to remember him by", then later unsuccessfully tries to find her again in the nightclub. This {{was not part of the}} script, and was conceived and added to the episode about 10 minutes before the scene was shot. During one of the final scenes, when Ben informs Leslie and Ron that the Pawnee government will be shut down, Ron looks directly at the camera and makes a comical grin. Although Leslie is supposed to be horrified by the news, the scene had to be re-shot many times because she kept laughing at Ron's facial expression.|$|E

500|$|Between 2010 and 2015, the station's {{construction}} site became home to several temporary art installations curated by Sound Transit's art program. In 2009, the empty lot left after site demolition was host to Dan Corson's Oscillating Field, an interactive light artwork that used flourecent light rods to display sine waves at night. The noise and dust wall, painted red and {{known as the}} [...] "Red Wall", was transformed into an outdoor art gallery curated by Sound Transit artist D.K. Pan with the theme [...] "The City: Love, Loss, and the Moveable Future". The Red Wall's art included painted murals, three-dimensional pieces, {{and the use of}} videos screened onto the wall. The Red Wall hosted a spraypainted mural by a former graffiti artist, a <b>bottle</b> <b>cap</b> collage, and hand-painted animated stills from the Seattle Experimental Animation Team.

After checking [...] "90,000" [...] cans, they give up on finding the winning can.

After meeting Slurms McKenzie, who is required by contract to party all night, every night, the crew takes a tour down a river of Slurm through the factory, and see the Grunka-Lunkas (who are a parody of the Oompa-Loompas from [...] "Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory") manufacture Slurm step by step.

2500|$|Téodor is a teddy bear, as {{evidenced}} by [...] He and his family originate from Minsk, Belarus (his father was an actuary) and is apparently of Jewish descent. He is a skilled cook, musician and graphic designer, and is also an all around friendly guy. He was originally quite crazy and uninhibited, exhibiting nudist tendencies in early Achewood strips, though {{he seems to have}} calmed down a bit over the years. While talented and intelligent, Téodor is also portrayed as lacking motivation and direction. A large exception to this is the considerable amount of time he is shown exercising or cooking, of which he is especially fond (every Achewood character has at least a slight interest in cooking, but Téodor's talent in this area is the most proficient). He had an online relationship with a girl named Penny, but it is not shown how the relationship ended up. Penny made Téodor the T-emblazoned sweater he wears, leaving it as a gift for him in the April 18, 2002, comic. While the other stuffed animals of the house treat Phillipe as a roommate, Téodor instead fills the role of Phillipe's guardian while the young otter is separated from his mother; he goes as far as to buy numerous child-care books, and, after being forced to expose the boy to Chick Tracts, diffused the effect of the prejudiced papers by making his own, nonsensical tracts to mix in with them. He has appeared in numerous strips recreationally using marijuana and seems to also be a user of psychedelic mushrooms. [...] Téodor's birthday is in early October. In 2001, Lie Bot predicted Téodor's death would be on April 28, 2005. Téodor did in fact die on that date, after he choked on a Grolsch <b>bottle</b> <b>cap</b> whilst watching a pornographic film. He was revived, however, when Lyle performed a [...] "Longshoreman's Heimlich" [...] (swift kick to the gut), which dislodged the cap and revived him. [...] Téodor listens to The Cure, Joy Division, and The Smiths.|$|E
