500|$|The McCays {{had been}} living in Manhattan, close to the Herald offices; before 1905 they moved to Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, New York, a seaside resort on Long Island. [...] It was an hour commute from the Herald offices, but they {{believed}} it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place</b> to raise children. [...] They lived at a number of addresses before settling into a three-story house at 1901 Voorhies Avenue, where McCay resided {{for the rest of his}} life.

Among those who paid tribute to him was Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who {{described}} King as [...] "a legend": [...] "He educated Londoners with Caribbean food, Caribbean culture, Caribbean music. London <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place,</b> Britain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place</b> thanks {{to him and his}} family." [...] His funeral took place at Southwark Cathedral on Tuesday, 19 July, attended by some 500 mourners representing family, friends, colleagues and dignitaries.|$|R

Yet, Gale felt, any assessment of Hay must include negatives as well, that after his marriage to the wealthy Clara Stone, Hay [...] "allowed his deep-seated love of ease triumph over his Middle Western devotion to work and a fair shake for all." [...] Despite his literary accomplishments, Hay [...] "was often lazy. [...] His first poetry was his best." ...|$|E
500|$|These {{lines have}} led to {{conflicting}} interpretations among Harrison biographers regarding a supposedly superior attitude on the singer's part. Ian Inglis writes of [...] "an increasingly familiar elitism in his apparent perception of himself", adding: [...] "When [...] sings of 'the pure of heart' and tells the Lord that 'there {{are just a few}} who bow before you,' the implied conclusion is that he counts himself among their number." [...] While acknowledging the ambiguity of this message, Leng writes: [...] "This could be taken as Harrison's statement of his own spiritual superiority, or it might be his metaphor for a rejection of conceit. If ego-driven politicians and self-serving military leaders were able to bow before anything, even a 'concept' like God, the world would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place.</b> 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' laments human nature and calls for a little humility." ...|$|E
500|$|After Marty Meehan {{resigned}} in 2007 {{to serve as}} Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Tsongas ran in the special election. Tsongas defeated four other candidates to win the Democratic primary with 36% of the vote. During her initial campaign Tsongas received endorsements from The Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, and the Lowell Sun. During the general election, former President Bill Clinton, who defeated her husband for the Democratic nomination in 1992, campaigned for her. At an event in Lowell Clinton remarked: [...] "Congress will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place</b> because she is there." [...] Tsongas won the special election against Republican Jim Ogonowski with 51% of the vote on October 17; she became the only female Representative from Massachusetts, and the first female representative from Massachusetts since the retirement of Margaret Heckler in 1983, who became Secretary of Health and Human Services under Ronald Reagan.|$|E

500|$|Those {{who opposed}} this {{resolution}} argued that its presence {{would cause the}} other, more rational resolutions to lose support. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, [...] "Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous." [...] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would {{then be able to}} affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting, stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place</b> if women were involved in the political sphere. [...] "In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world." [...] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.|$|E
2500|$|In 1848, Douglass was {{the only}} African American to attend the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, in upstate New York. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked the {{assembly}} to pass a resolution asking for women's suffrage. Many of those present opposed the idea, including influential Quakers James and Lucretia Mott. Douglass stood and spoke eloquently in favor; {{he said that he}} could not accept the right to vote as a black man if women could not also claim that right.

2500|$|On 31 July {{responding}} to a pre-Ramadan crackdown, the bloodiest day of the uprising to date, Obama sharply condemned the violence, warning that Assad was [...] "on {{the wrong side of}} history and his people", and added, [...] "Through his own actions, Bashar al-Assad is ensuring that he and his government will be left in the past, and that the courageous Syrian people who have demonstrated in the streets will determine its future. Syria will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place</b> when a democratic transition goes forward." [...] While he did not explicitly demand that Assad resign, he said the US would step up its efforts on the international stage to [...] "isolate the Assad government and stand with the Syrian people".|$|E

Cruyffian football, they feel, is more beautiful, more fun and more spiritual than other approaches... Until relatively recently, English football was synonymous with long balls, bad ball control and big, clumsy centre-forwards charging into lumbering centre-halves. Now, most of the top coaches at the Premier League's biggest clubs are either Dutch or heavily influenced by the Dutch. There's Arsène Wenger at Arsenal, Van Gaal at Manchester United and Guus Hiddink at Chelsea. Roberto Martínez at Everton and Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool are devout Cruyffians. Next season, Pep Guardiola will start converting Manchester City to tiki-taka. |date=8 March 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016 }} Some notable Cruyffistas include Joan Laporta, Pep Guardiola, Xavi, Luis Enrique, Ronald Koeman, Frank Rijkaard, Dennis Bergkamp, Roberto Martínez, Óscar García, Arsène Wenger, and Jürgen Klinsmann.|$|E
2500|$|Vedder {{is known}} for his social and {{political}} views. Discussing his views on current issues in the United States, Vedder said, [...] "People on death row, the treatment of animals, women's right to choose. So much in America is based on religious fundamentalist Christianity. Grow up! This is the modern world!" [...] In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled [...] "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion. Vedder and Pearl Jam have consistently supported abortion rights and performed at Rock for Choice in 1994. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 and played at Green Party super rallies in Chicago and New York City. Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the 2004 Vote for Change tour, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. Vedder told Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in." [...] In 2005, during Pearl Jam's first South American tour, Vedder stated, to the immediate and effusive support from the crowd in Rio de Janeiro, that [...] "next time we come to Brazil, the world will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place</b> to live, as George Bush will no longer be the President of the United States."

The Nakashima Foundation for Peace, currently housed in the Minguren Museum in New Hope, had its beginnings in 1984. [...] In 1984, George Nakashima had the opportunity to purchase the largest and finest walnut log he had ever seen and sought to use the immense planks to their fullest potential. He dreamed then that if Altars for Peace were made for each continent of the world, as centers for meditation, prayer, and activities for peace, the world would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>place.</b> Over the past decade, his furniture has become ultra-collectible and his legacy of {{what became known as the}} [...] "free-edge" [...] aesthetic influential.

To do so the company has procured yet another extremely valuable walnut log that almost matches the size and magnificence of the original.|$|E

[...] More messages of this type were sent, some of Megan's messages were shared with others, and bulletins were posted about her. Tina told her daughter to sign off, and went to the orthodontist. She called her daughter to ask her if she signed off, and she didn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, [...] "You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to be on my side!"
