40|$|Abstract Background A {{systematic}} {{mapping of}} the phytochemical composition of different sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) fruit subspecies is still lacking. No data {{relating to the}} fatty acid composition of main lipid fractions from the berries of ssp. carpatica (Romania) have been previously reported. Results The fatty acid composition of the total lipids (oils) and the major lipid fractions (PL, polar lipids; FFA, free fatty acids; TAG, triacylglycerols and SE, sterol esters) of the oils extracted {{from different parts of}} six sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> subspecies (ssp. carpatica) cultivated in Romania were investigated using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The dominating fatty acids in pulp/peel and whole berry oils were palmitic (23 - 40 %), oleic (20 - 53 %) and palmitoleic (11 - 27 %). In contrast to the pulp oils, seed oils had higher amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (65 - 72 %). The fatty acid compositions of TAGs were very close to the compositions of corresponding seed and pulp oils. The major fatty acids in PLs of berry pulp/peel oils were oleic (20 - 40 %), palmitic (17 - 27 %), palmitoleic (10 - 22 %) and linoleic (10 %- 20 %) acids, whereas in seeds PLs, PUFAs prevailed. Comparing with the other lipid fractions the SEs had the highest contents of saturated fatty acids (SFAs). The fatty acid profiles of the FFA fractions were relatively similar to those of TAGs. Conclusions All parts of the analyzed sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> cultivars (ssp. carpatica) exhibited higher oil content then the other European or Asiatic sea buckthorn subspecies. Moreover, the pulp/peel oils of ssp. carpatica were found to contain high levels of oleic acid and slightly lower amounts of linoleic and α-linolenic acids. The studied cultivars of sea buckthorn from Romania have proven to be potential sources of valuable oils. </p...|$|R
40|$|Carbonyl {{compounds}} {{formed in}} sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> (Hippophae rhamnoides) and oil samples {{as a result}} of lipid oxidation were determined by enzymatic hydrolysis followed by derivatisation with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine and analysed by LC-UV and electrospray ionisation (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Several classes of carbonyl compounds such as saturated, unsaturated, linear and branched aldehydes and ketones, aromatic aldehyde, dicarbonyls and carboxy aldehydes were identified based on fragmentation pattern, molecular weight and retention time. The lower carbonyls such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were found to be predominant in the berry samples and acetaldehyde was found to be the most abundant carbonyl. In the sea buckthorn pulp oil sample, longer aldehydes and carboxy aldehydes dominated, thus clearly demonstrating the benefit of the enzymatic step when analysing oxidation products originating from triglycerides.

40|$|Sarazm is an {{agricultural}} settlement {{located in the}} Zerafshan Valley of northwestern Tajikistan; it was occupied from the fourth {{to the end of}} the third millennia BC. Located on the northeastern edge of a chain of agricultural settlements (Namazga IV) that span the northern foothill ecotone of the Kopet Dag, Sarazm sat on a crossroads of exchange and interaction. Being at the eastern extremity of this chain of sedentary villages, Sarazm is the key site for understanding the eventual diffusion of agriculture north into the mountains and steppe. The main purpose of this article is to present a long-awaited (previously unpublished) macrobotanical data set analysed in the late 1980 s by George Willcox. Domesticated seeds in the assemblage (wheat and barley) are important both in terms of understanding the northeastern spread of agriculture into Central Eurasia and illustrating the role of agriculture in the Early Bronze Age economy at Sarazm.

40|$|Introduction - Sea {{buckthorn}} (Hippophaë rhamnoides L.) {{is known}} to be rich in many bioactive compounds (such as vitamins, phenolics, carotenoids) important for human health and nutrition. Among the phenolics, berries and leaves contain a wide range of flavonols that are good quality and authenticity biomarkers. Objective - To compare the composition of the main flavonols of Romanian sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> and leaf varieties and to identify the specific biomarkers that contribute to sample differentiation among varieties. Material and methods - Six varieties of cultivated sea <b>buckthorn</b> (ssp. Carpatica) <b>berries</b> and leaves were analysed by UHPLC/PDA–ESI/MS. Results - Berries and leaves contained mainly isorhamnetin (I) glycosides in different ratios. Whereas I- 3 -neohesperidoside, I- 3 -glucoside, I- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside, I- 3 -sophoroside- 7 -rhamnoside and free isorhamnetin were predominant for berries (out of 17 compounds identified), I- 3 -rhamnosylglucoside, I- 3 -neohesperidoside, I- 3 -glucoside, quercetin- 3 -pentoside, kaempferol- 3 -rutinoside, and quercetin- 3 -glucoside were predominant in leaves (out of 19 compounds identified). Berries contained, on average, 917 ¿mg/ 100 ¿g DW flavonol glycosides. Leaves had higher content of flavonol glycosides than berries, on average 1118 ¿mg/ 100 ¿g DW. The variation of the quantitative dataset analysed using principal component analysis accounted for 91 % of the total variance in the case of berries and 73 % in case of leaves, demonstrating a good discrimination among samples. Conclusion - Based on quantitative analysis, by principal component analysis, the flavonol derivatives can be considered as biomarkers to discriminate among varieties and to recognise specifically the berry versus leaf compositio...|$|R

As berry temperature increased from 4. 5 to 34. 5 °C, the rupture force decreased 20. 7 %. There {{were no significant}} differences in rupture energy at temperatures of 16. 5, 25, or 34. 5 °C; but the rupture energy was significantly higher at 4. 5 °C. Average berry deformation was 1. 5 mm and did not vary with temperature. Consequently, berry firmness decreased as temperature increased. The rupture force and energy for large berries was significantly higher than that for small berries at 16. 5 oC, however, the small berries were firmer. Loading velocity had a significant effect on rupture force, rupture energy, deformation, and firmness of berries of the Sinensis cultivar, but there was no effect on berries of the Indian Summer cultivar. For these two cultivars, berry masses and geometric mean diameters ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 38 g and from 6. 2 to 8. 8 mm, respectively; with the Sinensis berries being more spherical...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{filtration}} {{processes are}} widely {{applied for a}} variety of industries. These processes are used by the food industry, particularly in the dairy industry. However, increased interest in these processes is in vegetable raw materials, in order to reduce transport costs by eliminating unnecessary materials or purification of components. Membrane filtration process are several: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. These processes take place is characterised by a high pressure and a special membrane. In particular membrane, depending on the chemical composition of the fluid and the particle size is limited by the fouling of processes, i. e. the formation of cake layer and thus slowing the specific process. In order to evaluate some of the plant-based raw materials influence on the filtering parameters, the juices of lingonberry and sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> were selected. During the process, there was determined that the formation of fouling had negative effect on the filtration of lingonberry raw material. Then, the fractionation of juice were performed using microfiltration and ultrafiltration and fractions were evaluated by various methods. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were assessed comparing fractions obtained from fractions of lingonberry and sea buckthorn. It was found that the highest total phenolic compounds is in lingonberry juice retentate (BSR) and the lowest fraction of lingonberry juice permeate (BSP 2). The highest total phenolic compounds set buckthorn juice fraction, and the smallest in the permeate fraction of sea buckthorn juice. It was found that the best DPPH• free radicals scavanged by fraction of lingonberry juice retentate. Applying gas chromatography with mass spectrometry was compared juice and fraction composition of the chemical compounds from headspace. Lingonberry juice fractions had 15 volatiles compounds. 23 volatile compounds were found at the fractions of juice of sea buckthorn. The powders of obtained lingonberry juice and their retentate fractions were applied in the yogurt production technology.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased {{at an alarming rate}} in developed countries. It seems in the light of current knowledge that metabolic syndrome may not develop at all without NAFLD, and NAFLD is estimated to be as common as metabolic syndrome in western population (23 % occurrence). Fat in the liver is called ectopic fat, which is triacylglycerols within the cells of non-adipose tissue. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values correlate positively with liver fat proportions, and increased activity of ALT predicts type 2 diabetes independently from obesity. Berries, high in natural bioactive compounds, have indicated the potential {{to reduce the risk of}} obesity-related diseases. Ectopic fat induces common endocrine excretion of adipose tissue resulting in the overproduction of inflammatory markers, which further induce insulin resistance by multiple mechanisms. Insulin resistance inducing hyperinsulinemia and lipolysis in adipocytes increases the concentration of free fatty acids and consequently causes further fat accumulation in hepatocytes. Polyphenolic fractions of berries have been shown to reverse inflammatory reaction cascades in in vitro and animal studies, and moreover to decrease ectopic fat accumulation. The aim of this thesis was to explore the role of northern berries in obesity-related diseases. The absorption and metabolism of selected berry polyphenols, flavonol glycosides and anthocyanins, was investigated in humans, and metabolites of the studied compounds were identified in plasma and urine samples (I, II). Further, the effects of berries on the risk factors of metabolic syndrome were studied in clinical intervention trials (III, IV), and the different fractions of sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> were tested for their ability to reduce postprandial glycemia and insulinemia after high-glucose meal in a postprandial study with humans (V). The marked impact of mixed berries on plasma ALT values (III), as well as indications of the positive effects of sea buckthorn, its fractions and bilberry on omental adiposity and adhesion molecules (IV) were observed. In study V, sea buckthorn and its polyphenol fractions had a promising effect on potprandial metabolism after high-glucose meal. In the literature review, the possible mechanisms behind the observed effects have been discussed with a special emphasis on ectopic fat accumulation. The literature review indicated that especially tannins and flavonoids have shown potential in suppressing diverse reaction cascades related to systemic inflammation, ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance development...|$|R
40|$|Many {{essential}} micronutrients {{found in}} {{fruits and vegetables}} exhibit antioxidant properties, protecting against oxidation and oxidative stress. Their ability to react with electrons also enables them to act as pro-oxidants, causing damage opposed to preventing it. While fruit and vegetables rich in micronutrients generally protect against oxidative damage and related diseases, supplementation studies with micronutrients have not been verified {{to have the same}} health beneficial effect. In fact, even harmful consequences have been seen. The reason for the ambiguous results is still not fully understood and this thesis investigates some of the factors believed to be involved. The focus is on the effect of micronutrients on DNA lesions, potential contributors to cancer development. The thesis takes you into chemical properties of micronutrients (paper I and II), it also explores their health effects in two human studies (paper III and IV). When investigating pro-oxidant properties of thirteen micronutrients in this thesis, two of them stood out oxidising the DNA nucleoside deoxyguanosine in a dose-dependent manner – namely vitamin A and vitamin C. Compounds permitted in supplements as either ‘vitamin A’ (four compounds) or ‘vitamin C’ (five compounds) also differed in their potencies to act as pro-oxidants. The combination of vitamin C and copper particularly stood out, inducing oxidation to pure deoxyguanosine, but also to the DNA of cells in culture, a potential concern since both are commonly found in multivitamin supplements. In an observational study, the impact of folate/folic acid status, intake or genes on DNA lesions (uracil misincorporation, oxidative DNA lesions, DNA breaks) in mononuclear cells of 36 infertile women was explored. Folate and related parameters were found not to correlate with DNA lesions in these women with adequate folate status. Our results add to the carefully accumulating evidence indicating that, even though folate status has been associated with DNA lesions, the effect seems to be more evident in subjects with folate deficiency. An increased interest has been drawn towards micronutrient supplements imitating the natural content of fruit, vegetables and berries, as for example with berry extracts. This thesis report on a cross-over intervention study where chronic kidney disease patients were administered a supplement containing oil extracts from the sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berry</b> rich in micronutrients and fatty acids. An eight-week administration did not affect their levels of DNA lesions (oxidative DNA lesions, DNA breaks) in minor salivary glands, nor mouth dryness or disease specific parameters. Taken together, the results within this thesis add to the somewhat confusing evidence on micronutrient supplements and their properties and health effects. It emphasises that each micronutrient has unique properties, some with strong pro-oxidant activity dependent on factors in their immediate surrounding. The results also add to the growing evidence of a lack of effect on health from micronutrient supplements. It might be that supplementation with micronutrients provides best benefit in those with initially low nutrient levels...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{buckthorn}} (Hippophaë) berries are {{ingredients of}} the Chinese traditional medicine. In addition to China, they are nowadays cultivated for food in several European countries, Russia, Canada, the USA, and Japan. Sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> are {{a rich source}} of flavonoids, mainly flavonol glycosides and proanthocyanidins. Depending on the genetic background, growth conditions, and ripeness of the berries, vitamin C concentrations up to over 1 g/ 100 ml juice, have been reported. Sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> contain inositols and methyl inositols, components of messenger molecules in humans. Sea buckthorn seed oil is rich in essential aplha-linolenic and linoleic acids, whereas the most abundant fatty acids in the berry oil are palmitoleic, palmitic and oleic acids. Other potentially beneficial lipophilic compounds of sea buckthorn seeds and berries include carotenoids, phytosterols, tocopherols and tocotrienols. The effects of sea buckthorn fractions on inflammation, platelet aggregation, oxidation injuries, the liver, skin and mucosa, among others, have been reported. The aim of the thesis work was to investigate the health effects of sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> and oil in humans. The physiological effects of sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries,</b> berry components, and oil have mostly been studied in vitro and in animal models, leaving a demand for more clinical trials. In the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of this thesis healthy adults consumed 28 g/day of sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> for three months. The main objective was to investigate the effects on the common cold. In addition, effects on other infections, inflammation and circulating lipid markers associated with cardiovascular disease risk were studied. In the second randomized, placebocontrolled trial participants reporting dry eye symptoms consumed 2 g/day of sea buckthorn oil from the seeds and berries for three months. The effects on symptoms and clinical signs of dry eye were monitored. In addition, the effects on circulating markers of inflammation and liver functions were analyzed. Sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> did not affect the common cold or other infections in healthy adults. However, a decrease in serum C-reactive protein was detected, indicating effects on inflammation. Fasting concentrations of serum flavonols, typical to sea buckthorn berry, increased without affecting the circulating total, HDL, LDL cholesterol, or triacylglycerol concentrations. Tear film hyperosmolarity and activation of inflammation at the ocular surface are among the core mechanisms of dry eye. Combined sea buckthorn berry and seed oil attenuated the rise in tear film osmolarity taking place during the cold season. It also positively affected some of the dry eye symptoms. Based on the tear film fatty acid analysis, the effects were not mediated through direct incorporation of sea buckthorn oil fatty acids to tear film lipids. It is likely that the fatty acids, carotenoids, tocopherols and tocotrienols of sea buckthorn oil affected the inflammation of the ocular surface, lacrimal and/or meibomian glands. The effects on the differentiation of meibomian gland cells are also possible. Sea buckthorn oil did not affect the serum concentrations of inflammation markers or liver enzymes investigated. In conclusion, this thesis work suggests positive effects of sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> and oil on inflammation and dry eye, respectively, in humans...|$|E

40|$|Consumption {{of fruits}} and berries have {{positive}} effects on human health by {{reducing the risk of}} e. g. cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration and cataracts, and different forms of cancer. These positive effects are believed {{to be related to the}} high content of bioactive compounds such as different antioxidants in fruits and berries. Increased intake of bioactive compounds can be promoted by selecting species/cultivars with high contents and by harvesting at the optimal time. Recent interest for cultivating sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> and rose hips partly depends on their more or less well documented health related statements. Products containing sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> or rose hips are steadily growing in number on the market and there is a need for increasing the knowledge of the content of the bioactive compounds in the fruit and berry raw material. This thesis investigated the content of carotenoids, tocochromanols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and chlorophylls in berries from different cultivars of sea buckhorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) and fruits from different species of roses (Rosa sp.) during the harvest period of three consecutive years. The carotenoid and tocopherol content were also investigated during processing and storage in juices with sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> and rose hips as ingredients. Carotenoids and tocochromanols are fat-soluble antioxidants, some of which have activity as pro-vitamin A and vitamin E. All analyses were carried out by HPLC on extracts made from lyophilised material. The concentration of carotenoids, tocochromanols and chlorophylls generally varied depending on cultivar/species and over the ripening period in both sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> and rose hips. This variation was not simultaneous for different compounds of the same type, e. g. all carotenoids did not show similar variation. For carotenoid content, harvesting time and choice of cultivar were more important than year of harvest, and a general increase occurred over the season. The tocochromanol content was mostly influenced by cultivar/species and year of harvest, although vitamin E activity generally decreased during ripening. The chlorophyll content decreased during ripening, when the fruits/berries changed colour from green to yellow-red, and proved suitable for use as a maturity marker of optimal harvesting time...|$|E

The sea buckthorn berry showed a negative firmness-temperature coefficient (FT) which ranged between – 0. 362 and- 0. 627 % per degree. The puncture force and energy for the large berries of the Sinensis cultivar was significantly higher than that for the small berries. With an increase in loading velocity from 0. 3 to 9 mm/s, the puncture force and energy increased significantly. Puncture force and energy also increased as probe diameter increased. As expected, puncture force and energy decreased as storage time increased to 14 d. The mean values obtained for Kc and Ks ranged from – 1. 079 to- 1. 575 N/mm 2 and from 0. 657 to 0. 817 N/mm, respectively. The apparent modulus of elasticity of the sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> ranged between 0. 24 and 1. 25 MPa...|$|E
40|$|Sea {{buckthorn}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent plants containing important nutrients essential for our health. Bioactive compounds are found in the pulp and in the seeds of the fruit. Sea buckthorn oil can be used in food supplementation, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. In this study supercritical CO 2 extraction of oil from sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> was performed at pressure 300 bar, temperature 40 °C and CO 2 flow rate 2 kg/h. Fatty acid composition of oil was determined by gas chromatography, and amount of tocopherols using HPLC. In defatted cake after supercritical extraction the amount of remained oil, fibre and protein content were also determined. The initial oil content in sea <b>buckthorn</b> <b>berries</b> was 11. 60 %. The major fatty acids in oil were palmitic (35 %), palmitoleic (20 %) and oleic acids (32 - 35 %). The amount of α-tocopherol was 35. 99 mg/ 100 g oil, and total tocopherol amount was 71. 62 mg/ 100 g oil. In defatted cake cellulose content was determined to be 11. 56 %, proteins 14. 78 %, moisture 5. 68 % and ash 3. 16 %. Because of high content of bioactive compounds and unique oil composition, this oil is connected with benefits on certain diseases. Defatted cake, which is also rich in many components, can be used as by-product in food industry...|$|E
