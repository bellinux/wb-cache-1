500|$|The {{start of}} the war in September 1939 alarmed many Americans, but the {{majority}} thought the U.S. should not get involved. Willkie spoke often about the threat to America and the need to aid Britain and other Allies. Willkie biographer Steve Neal wrote that the war [...] "transformed Willkie from a big-business critic of the New Deal into a champion of freedom. And it gave his candidacy new purpose." [...] Despite the chatter about Willkie, there were many who were skeptical about his chances should he seek the nomination. Kenneth F. Simpson, Republican National Committeeman from New York, initially thought the idea of a Willkie run to <b>be</b> <b>silly.</b> Indiana Senator James Watson stated that he did not mind if [...] "the town whore" [...] joined the church, but she should not lead the choir the first week.|$|E
500|$|Loxton was {{the manager}} of the 1959–60 Australian team that toured Pakistan and India. By this time, only two colleagues from the 1948 Invincibles tour—Harvey and Ray Lindwall—remained. The Victorian was the first manager since World War II to not also {{be a member of the}} Australian Board of Control. It was widely {{believed}} that the high-ranking administrators saw the Indian subcontinent as an unenviable appointment; on past tours, many players had fallen seriously ill, suffered food poisoning, and found the oppressive heat and third world living conditions hard to bear. Some players were reluctant to tour and wanted to opt out. Loxton felt that his experience with the Commonwealth XI six years earlier was a factor in his selection and suspected that he was the only applicant, quipping [...] "what board member would <b>be</b> <b>silly</b> enough to go there?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>silly</b> to go out against yourself in the form of The Beatles. So I fell in with the idea and thought, 'Great, I don't even have to think about an album.'" [...] McCartney was occupied with working on Standing Stone in the interim.|$|E

So I put on a boy's bathing-suit under my dress--and--I'm terribly embarrassed." ...|$|R

500|$|Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song, stating that [...] "the girls are going to love the lyrics. It brings total sex appeal and groove that starts the hips swinging and is so meant to break the set into a dark drive and into sensual exploration of a grind close contact dance rhythm". Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is [...] "sure to fit right into club DJ mixes and get people dancing"; however, he criticized that Gaga was [...] "all over the song ... as if Lopez went into the booth trying to emulate her delivery." [...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd <b>be</b> <b>silly</b> not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer". She additionally wrote that it was [...] "impossible to get [...] out of your head after more than one listen" [...] although becoming [...] "increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes" [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view, stating that [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is not anything [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release.|$|E
2500|$|Boyer {{was found}} guilty and sentenced to death. The {{incident}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Halloween II Murders" [...] and was featured in a short segment on TNT's Monstervision, hosted by film critic Joe Bob Briggs. Following the trial, moral critics came to the defense of horror films and rejected calls to ban them. Thomas M. Sipos, for instance, stated,It would <b>be</b> <b>silly,</b> after all, to ban horror films just because Boyer claims to have thought that he was reenacting Halloween II, or to ban cars because Texas housewife Clara Harris intentionally ran down and killed her husband. Nor does it make sense to ban otherwise useful items such as drugs or guns just because some individuals misuse them.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{appearing}} in Punch-Out!!, Piston Hondo has received mostly positive reception. He {{has been described}} as a notable character to the series by media outlets including Official Nintendo Magazine and the New York Daily News. One of the producers of Punch-Out!! for the Wii chose Piston Hondo as his favourite character in the game. GameDaily listed him as one of the greatest Japanese patriots in video games, stating that he is one of the series' [...] "most determined combatants." [...] The change from Honda to Hondo was found to <b>be</b> <b>silly</b> by GameSpy editor Ryan Scott who stated that Honda is a common family name in Japan. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that the change was a good idea, however.|$|E

2500|$|Edgar Wright {{initially}} was [...] "torn" [...] about making more Spaced, saying [...] "we have genuinely {{talked about it}} and have some neat ideas that could work in a Before Sunset/Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? kind of way". However, in April 2007, Wright confirmed that the show no longer had any possibility of returning in any form, as the actors were all now [...] "too old", and he and Pegg feared it would ruin a good thing. In August of that same year, Wright told Rotten Tomatoes that [...] "there's {{not going to be}} a third season, it would <b>be</b> <b>silly</b> now" [...] but that they could [...] "do something that sort of like catches our heroes ten years later." ...|$|E
2500|$|A more {{positive}} review came from Wolverhampton Express and Star: [...] "Slade haven't {{had a big}} hit for some time now, but it would <b>be</b> <b>silly</b> to write them off just yet, to judge by their new album Return to Base. There is definitely a Sixties feel {{to some of the}} songs, though others are vintage Slade. Most striking thing about the album is its variety, for Slade have loosened up a bit for this one and included much more variety of mood. It certainly pays off. Another striking factor is the guitar playing of Dave Hill, who has really been allowed to branch out on this disc. In all, it's an album which will please Slade's still huge army of fans, both for its fidelity to the Slade sound and for its inventiveness and freshness." [...] In May 1980, Jon Young of New York magazine Trouser Press reviewed the album and stated: [...] "On Return to Base, seven of the eleven cuts connect in every possible way, for a batting average of [...]636. If it had been released in 1973, the classic [...] "Nuts, Bolts and Screws" [...] would've easily topped the UK charts. Okay, there's nothing here quite as wonderful as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize". But whose fault is that? This kind of music isn't meant for a vacuum! It's meant to be enjoyed! Give Slade some encouragement! You will be glad that you did!!" ...|$|E
