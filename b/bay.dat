It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas <b>Bay,</b> and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the <b>bay</b> {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the <b>bay.</b> Copano <b>Bay</b> is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the <b>bay</b> were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the <b>bay</b> as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Copano <b>Bay</b> is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast.

The peninsula is located on the eastern shore of Copano <b>Bay</b> and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas <b>Bay.</b> This opening is spanned by the Copano <b>Bay</b> Causeway and the Copano <b>Bay</b> Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano <b>Bay</b> on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano <b>Bay</b> Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the <b>bay.</b> Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission <b>Bay,</b> Bayside stretches along the coast to the mouth of the Aransas River.

5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes {{around the}} <b>bay,</b> producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park and west of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little industry can be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and oil wells are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part of the purchase of St. Charles Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing the <b>bay,</b> which encourage tourism. The privately owned St. Charles <b>Bay</b> Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and fishing on the <b>bay,</b> while striving to protect the ecosystem.
