This reef associated species inhabits very shallow coastal habitats, often in large schools near freshwater run-offs. Adults inhabit coral reefs, while juveniles frequent inshore areas over sand, silt or coral rubble bottoms, occasionally in mangrove-lined streams and estuaries. This species may enter freshwater areas to consume small fish and invertebrates. This species reaches sexual maturity at approximately 2 {{years of age and}} reaches a maximum age of at least 11 years. Growth trajectories are significantly different between sexes for L. ehrenbergii with females achieving a larger asymptotic size than males. This species is a component of fisheries to varying degrees throughout its range. It is highly sought after in some areas, such as the Persian Gulf, and is commonly seen in subsistence fisheries and markets through other parts of its range. Food: L. ehrenbergii eat from small prey fishes and crustaceans in juveniles to mostly crustaceans in adults. They may enter freshwater for feeding...|$|E
