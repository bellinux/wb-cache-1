5|$|Mochizuki and Ohe {{originally}} {{assigned the}} viper dogfish {{to the family}} Squalidae, {{which at the time}} was used for all members of the order Squaliformes aside from the <b>bramble</b> and rough sharks. In a 1992 morphological study, Shigeru Shirai and Osamu Okamura placed this species in the squalid subfamily Etmopterinae, which most taxonomists now recognize as the separate family Etmopteridae.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bramble</b> shark is {{not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that <b>bramble</b> shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

40|$|Background: Antagonistic species often {{interact}} via matching of phenotypes, {{and interactions}} between brood parasitic common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and their hosts constitute classic examples. The {{outcome of a}} parasitic event is often determined by the match between host and cuckoo eggs, giving rise to potentially strong associations between fitness and egg phenotype. Yet, empirical efforts aiming to document and understand the resulting evolutionary outcomes are in short supply. Methods/Principal Findings: We used avian color space models to analyze patterns of egg color variation within and between the cuckoo and two closely related hosts, the nomadic <b>brambling</b> (Fringilla montifringilla) and the site fidelic chaffinch (F. coelebs). We found that there is pronounced opportunity for disruptive selection on <b>brambling</b> egg coloration. The corresponding cuckoo host race has evolved egg colors that maximize fitness in both sympatric and allopatric <b>brambling</b> populations. By contrast, the chaffinch has a more bimodal egg color distribution consistent with the evolutionary direction predicted for the <b>brambling.</b> Whereas the <b>brambling</b> and its cuckoo host race show little geographical variation in their egg color distributions, the chaffinch’s distribution becomes increasingly dissimilar to the brambling’s distribution towards the core area of the <b>brambling</b> cuckoo host race. Conclusion: High rates of <b>brambling</b> gene flow is likely to cool down coevolutionary hot spots by cancelling out th...|$|R
5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil.

5|$|The diet of the <b>bramble</b> shark {{includes}} smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, {{which this}} slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, {{it is an}} occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers, and {{may be used for}} fishmeal and liver oil. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing.|$|E
5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few crack willow, goat willow, {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick <b>bramble,</b> with ivy in denser shade.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

5|$|Records of the <b>bramble</b> shark {{are fairly}} rare and {{originate}} from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, {{save for the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. Most {{have come from the}} eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, southern Australia, New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bramble</b> shark has a thick, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} somewhat flattened head. The snout is blunt and shorter than {{the width of the}} mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack nictitating membranes; the tiny spiracles are located well behind them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20–26 upper and 22–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E

25|$|Havens {{with the}} {{touching}} definition {{are closely related}} to brambles, families of connected subgraphs of a given graph that all touch each other. The order of a <b>bramble</b> is the minimum number of vertices needed in a set of vertices that hits all of the subgraphs in the family. The set of flaps '(X) for a haven of order k (with the touching definition) forms a <b>bramble</b> of order at least k, because any set Y of fewer than k vertices fails to hit the subgraph '(Y). Conversely, from any <b>bramble</b> of order k, one may construct a haven of the same order, by defining '(X) (for each choice of X) to be the X-flap that includes all of the subgraphs in the <b>bramble</b> that are disjoint fromX. The requirement that the subgraphs in the <b>bramble</b> all touch each other can be used to show that this X-flap exists, and that all of the flaps '(X) chosen in this way touch each other. Thus, a graph has a <b>bramble</b> of order k if and only if it has a haven of orderk.|$|E
