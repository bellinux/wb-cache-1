While Ukraine was undergoing substantial economic development, Cossacks and peasants were by and large not among the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{by means}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conversation Analytical {{perspective}} (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974), we analyze phone calls initiated by female callers to a toll free, government-run health helpline that offers information about transmission, symptoms {{and prevention of}} diseases, and referrals to health centers. The paper aims at analyzing how the participants (callers and call takers) refer to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requested information. Some callers, despite being informed that all calls are anonymous, avoid revealing that they themselves are <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information, and thus attribute to third parties {{the need for the}} information, a phenomenon we call here ‘third party referencing’. Other callers refer to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information as ‘women’, ‘people’, ‘someone’ etc., a phenomenon we call here as ‘generalization’. When making use of third party referencing or of generalizations to talk about <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information, callers exempt themselves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responsibility for something that might be seen as ‘morally questionable’ (Bergmann, 1992), e. g., having unprotected sexual intercourse. An analysis of how such negotiation unfolds becomes particularly relevant for the context investigated here, as <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> an actual <b>beneficiary</b> for the information reveals itself as decisive for referrals to health centers to happen...|$|R

Two more operators were taken over in 1994, namely coach operators Airport Coaches of Stansted Airport and Biss Bros of Bishops Stortford.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opportunities offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Trianon {{was signed}} in 1920, {{at the end of}} World War I, between the Allies of World War I and Hungary (as one of the {{successor}} states of Austria-Hungary). The treaty regulated the status of the independent Hungarian state and defined its borders. Compared to the prewar Kingdom of Hungary (as a part of Austria-Hungary), post-Trianon Hungary lost 72 percent of its territory. The principal <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial division of the prewar Kingdom of Hungary were Romania, Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The treaty established the southern border of Hungary along the Drava and Mura rivers (except in Baranya, where only {{the northern part of the}} county was retained by Hungary). On 4 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (comprising present-day Croatia) joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community maintained that Rajoelina's legitimacy was conditional to {{free and fair}} elections. A number of key international organizations in which Madagascar had been a member, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union, withheld recognition of Rajoelina's legitimacy throughout his tenure. The United States, Madagascar's largest bilateral donor and provider of humanitarian aid, also refused to acknowledge the Rajoelina administration. The United Nations responded to the power transfer by freezing 600 million euros in planned aid. The United States suspended Madagascar {{from the list of}} <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had ensured preferential tariffs for the import of Malagasy textiles. This sanction resulted in the loss of over 50,000 jobs and dealt a severe blow to the textile sector, which had accounted for half of Madagascar's exports. Rajoelina initially sought to persuade former donors to recommence their support; when these efforts failed to yield results, he explored the possibility of foregoing the support of traditional partners through new or strengthened relations with such alternatives as Libya, China and Saudi Arabia but was again unable to secure the desired partnerships.|$|E
