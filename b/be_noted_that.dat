5|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the figure}} above for Chongqing's Administrative Area {{includes}} the entire Municipality of Chongqing whereas the City Population only counts the urbanized districts making up Chongqing city. Thus {{the population of}} the administrative area shown will be significantly larger. Chengdu is similar.|$|E
5|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the medals}} claimed were not all ones {{that had been}} targeted, with Team GB falling short of targets in some {{disciplines}} whilst exceeding them in others. Nine out of seventeen disciplines met their targets.|$|E
30|$|It <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> age and APACHE II {{score at}} {{admission}} significantly {{are associated with}} high mortality.

5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{buildings}} that once held the title of tallest building in Tokyo. It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> since its completion in 2012, Tokyo Skytree has been the tallest structure in Tokyo as well as in Japan, overtaking Tokyo Tower.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} is the most {{populated}} of Extremadura, it has a relatively low population density (102.30 hab/km²), due to the extension of its municipality, {{one of the largest}} in Spain, with an area of 1,470km². It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is Guadiana del Caudillo, which had 2,524 people as of 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.|$|E

5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It should also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the {{developers}} of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly's {{version of the}} GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional protection against buffer overflow based attacks. It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> , the kernel is no longer built with this protection by default.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E

5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It should also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in the {{original}} Akkadian, Ú-a-a-te is {{used to refer to}} the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The transliteration of {{the original}} Akkadian into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E
5|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the {{relative}} atomic mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant {{is set in the}} new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of {{the relative}} atomic mass and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E

It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the medals claimed were not all ones that had been targeted, the team fell short of targets in some sports whilst it exceeded them in others; out of the fifteen sports set a target eight succeeded in meeting them.|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, it should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It should also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this is the very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E
