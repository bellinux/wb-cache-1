5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood.

Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain <b>biochemicals,</b> or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E
5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of <b>biochemicals.</b> Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: After {{external}} beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer, a short interval to <b>biochemical</b> fail-ure of < 18 months {{has been proposed}} as a surrogate for cause-specific survival. Because EBRT dose influences <b>biochemical</b> failure, the authors investigated the interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure in a cohort of patients treated with dose-escalated EBRT. METHODS: From 1998 to 2008, 710 patients were treated with EBRT (75 grays) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at the University of Michigan. <b>Biochemical</b> failure was defined using the Phoenix consensus definition (nadir þ 2 ng/mL). A short interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure was defined as < 18 months after completing radiotherapy and/or ADT. The associations between <b>biochemical</b> failure, the interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure, and clinical factors with cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 149 bio-chemical failures (21 %), and short interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure accounted for 14 % and 40 % of <b>biochemical</b> failures in those with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, respectively. <b>Biochemical</b> failure impacted CSS (P <. 0001) but not OS (P. 36). However, a short interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure predicted decreased CSS (P <. 0001; hazard ratio [HR], 5. 6; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 4 - 13. 0) and OS (P <. 0001; HR, 4. 8; 95 % CI, 2. 3 - 10. 3) when compared with a long interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure. The 8 -year OS was 78 % without <b>biochemical</b> failure, compared with 87 % with a long interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure (P. 1; HR, 0. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 4 - 1. 1) and 38 % with a short interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure (P <. 0001; HR, 3. 7; 95 % CI, 2. 3 - 5. 9). On multivariate analysis, a short interval to <b>biochemical</b> failure increased the risk of prostate cancer death (P <. 0001; HR, 18. 1; 95 % CI, 8. 4 - 39) and all cause mortality (P. 0027; HR, 1. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 2. 1) ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster {{examined}} the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating hypercycle in a prebiotic soup. In a hypercycle, the information storing system (possibly RNA) produces an enzyme, which catalyzes {{the formation of}} another information system, in sequence until {{the product of the}} last aids {{in the formation of the}} first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create quasispecies, which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex <b>biochemicals,</b> such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.|$|E
25|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) is {{a widely}} employed laboratory technique used to separate different <b>biochemicals</b> {{on the basis of}} their size and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity. Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, high-performance TLC can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).|$|E
