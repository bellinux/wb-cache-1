40|$|Setting for Success John Gay s ballad opera, The <b>Beggar</b> <b>s</b> Opera {{was staged}} in London in 1728 {{and had a}} run of sixty two performances. It was {{recognised}} as being a sharp satire of the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, and his Whig regime. The thesis places the opera in it s geographical and historical setting. The success of The <b>Beggar</b> <b>s</b> Opera is explained by its relevance to the theatre-goer who recognised the sordid London life portrayed in short dialogue and songs sung to well-known folk melodies, some in existence today. John Gay s motivation for writing the piece is examined in its context, and the play is analysed {{to tell the story}} and bring out the satirical element. This is also included in a description of London, both as a social anthropologic exercise and as seen through the eyes of contemporary poets (The Scriblerians) in opposition to the government. John Gay s own description of London is also included. The question posed by this thesis is what made the opera such a success. The answer is given as its readily recognisable setting and satire. This was in strong contrast to theatre at the time which was often in Italian, and in the form of serious opera. The vulgar, bawdy nature of The <b>Beggar</b> <b>s</b> Opera as described in this thesis must have been a refreshing innovation,contributing to its success...|$|R
40|$|Background: Caligid copepods, {{also called}} sea lice, are fish ectoparasites, some species of which cause {{significant}} {{problems in the}} mariculture of salmon, where the annual cost of infection is in excess of € 300 million globally. At present, caligid control on farms is mainly achieved using medicinal treatments. However, the continued use of a restricted number of medicine actives potentially favours the development of drug resistance. Here, we report transcriptional changes in a laboratory strain of the caligid Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer, 1837) that is moderately (~ 7 -fold) resistant to the avermectin compound emamectin benzoate (EMB), {{a component of the}} anti-salmon louse agent SLICE® (Merck Animal Health). Results: Suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) was used to enrich transcripts differentially expressed between EMB-resistant (PT) and drug-susceptible (S) laboratory strains of L. salmonis. SSH libraries were subjected to 454 sequencing. Further L. salmonis transcript sequences were available as expressed sequence tags (EST) from GenBank. Contiguous sequences were generated from both SSH and EST sequences and annotated. Transcriptional responses in PT and <b>S</b> salmon <b>lice</b> were investigated using custom 15 K oligonucleotide microarrays designed using the above sequence resources. In the absence of EMB exposure, 359 targets differed in transcript abundance between the two strains, these genes being enriched for functions such as calcium ion binding, chitin metabolism and muscle structure. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -gated chloride channel (GABA-Cl) and neuronal acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits showed significantly lower transcript levels in PT <b>lice</b> compared to <b>S</b> <b>lice.</b> Using RT-qPCR, the decrease in mRNA levels was estimated at ~ 1. 4 -fold for GABA-Cl and ~ 2. 8 -fold for nAChR. Salmon lice from the PT strain showed few transcriptional responses following acute exposure (1 or 3 h) to 200 μg L- 1 of EMB, a drug concentration tolerated by PT lice, but toxic for <b>S</b> <b>lice.</b> Conclusions: Avermectins are believed to exert their toxicity to invertebrates through interaction with glutamate-gated and GABA-gated chloride channels. Further potential drug targets include other Cys-loop ion channels such as nAChR. The present study demonstrates decreased transcript abundances of GABA-Cl and nAChR subunits in EMB-resistant salmon lice, suggesting their involvement in avermectin toxicity in caligids...|$|R

5|$|In Shanghai {{during the}} 1930s, Sing {{and his friend}} Bone attempt to join the Deadly Axe Gang, which ruthlessly {{controls}} the city {{under the leadership of}} Brother Sum. Sing seeks to restore his confidence after being humiliated as a young boy while trying to protect a mute girl from bullies, due to the failure of the Buddhist Palm method he had learned from a pamphlet he bought from a <b>beggar.</b> <b>Sing</b> and Bone attempt to intimidate the residents of Pig Sty Alley but are chased off by its Landlady. Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of Sing and Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of the tenants, Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and Donut are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal that they too are martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and Donut die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|R

40|$|Continuing {{pressure}} on wool producers to reduce production costs, {{together with a}} progressive withdrawal of government resources directed to the regulation of sheep lice and a need to reduce reliance on chemical methods, have seen significant changes in approach to louse control {{over the past two}} decades. Key among these have been a change from plunge and shower dipping to widespread use of more labour-efficient backline treatments and a {{reduction in the number of}} wool producers treating routinely after shearing each year, whether or not lice been detected. Approximately 70 % of wool producers treating for lice use backline applications, and the prevalence of lice is now heavily dependent on the availability of effective backline products. Future limitations on their use, either because of residue concerns or loss of effectiveness from the development of resistance, could see a resurgence in the prevalence of lice similar to that which occurred in the early 1990 <b>s.</b> <b>Louse</b> treatments contribute more than half of the total insecticide residue load of the Australian wool clip in most years. Reducing residue levels will necessitate finding new or more insecticide-efficient methods of control and will likely lead to increased numbers of growers treating only when lice are found. Unless improvements are made in other areas of louse control, this is likely to cause a progressive increase in the prevalence of infested flocks. However, there are currently no alternatives to chemicals for the control of lice; and poor knowledge of the biology of sheep lice hampers the development of good integrated pest management (IPM) programs. A significant research effort will be required to develop new methods of louse control and to provide the knowledge on which to base sound IPM programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to look at}} how selected Anglo-American and Luso-Brazilian authors use fictions of non-violence and violence to create myths of “ambition and success” and “struggle and failure” in the world of street orphans. In Anglo-American novels such as Charles Dickens 2 ̆ 7 The Adventures of Oliver Twist, Horatio Alger 2 ̆ 7 s Ragged Dick or Street Life in New York with the Bootblacks, Theresa Nelson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Beggar</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Ride, and Sherman Alexie 2 ̆ 7 s Flight, the main characters Oliver Twist, Ragged Dick, Clare Caldwell, and Zits have different desires, leading them to respond positively to the outcast. 1 They are the cases who are mostly looking for life with happy endings. The authors make-believe that these children can strive and succeed by themselves, and so they are rewarded by society because they fit in by non-violent acts (i. e., the citizenship models). Their desires for situations such as family, work, love, and ethnicity are optimistic in terms of constructing self-identities. ^ 1 See Charles Dickens, The Adventures of Oliver Twist (New York: Heritage Press, 1939 – first published 1838).

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess the {{efficacy}} of alphacypermethrin (ACYP) on pediculosis due to Haematopinus tuberculatus and to evaluate the influence of the treatment on productive and reproductive performance in buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) reared in an intensive system. The trial was performed on 56 pluriparous buffaloes at 86. 8 ± 8. 1 d in milk. The animals underwent individual louse count and were divided into 2 homogenous groups according to louse count, age, number of lactations, days in milk, live BW, BCS, pregnancy status, and milk yield. Group A (n = 28) was treated by a pour-on formulation of ACYP, and Group S (n = 28) was treated by pour-on saline solution. Individual louse counts were performed weekly on 10 buffaloes in each group. Feed intake was recorded daily and the total mixed ration, individual ingredients, and orts were analyzed to calculate DM ingestion. Individual milk yield was recorded daily and milk samples were analyzed {{at the beginning of the}} trial, after 4 wk, and at the end of the trial to assess milk composition. Individual BCS was also evaluated simultaneously. Finally, the animals underwent synchronization of ovulation starting 4 wk after treatment and the pregnancy rate and the calving-conception interval were evaluated. Data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test and ANOVA for repeated measures. The infestation was constant in Group <b>S,</b> whereas no <b>lice</b> were present in Group A throughout the study. Daily DMI was similar in the 2 groups (16. 7 ± 0. 4 vs. 16. 3 ± 0. 3 kg/d in Group A vs. Group S, respectively), although buffaloes in Group A showed higher (P < 0. 05) BCS score at the end of the trial (7. 39 ± 0. 1 vs. 7. 14 ± 0. 1 in Group A vs. Group S, respectively). The average milk yield/buffalo was higher (P < 0. 05) in Group A compared to Group S (10. 58 ± 0. 1 vs. 10. 39 ± 0. 1 kg in Group A vs. Group S, respectively) and this was mainly due to the higher milk production recorded in buffaloes at less than 75 d in milk (11. 81 ± 0. 1 vs. 11. 45 ± 0. 1 kg in Group A vs. Group S, respectively). Despite of a similar fertility rate (90. 5 vs. 80. 9 % in Group A vs. Group S, respectively), a lower (P < 0. 05) calving-conception interval was recorded in Group A compared to Group S (118 ± 16 vs. 177 ± 16 d in Group A vs. Group S, respectively). In addition to the pour-on treatment against pediculosis, productive and reproductive performance were also improved. This represents a significant improvement in dairy buffalo herd management...|$|R
