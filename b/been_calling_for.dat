5|$|Cuba and Venezuela {{were the}} {{founding}} {{members of the}} Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA sought to redistribute wealth evenly throughout member countries, to protect the region's agriculture, and to oppose economic liberalization and privatization. ALBA's origins lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries, and was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' Bolivia in April 2006. Castro had also <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> greater Caribbean integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only country to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.|$|E
5|$|Peter Law, {{the former}} Assembly Member (AM) for Blaenau Gwent, had <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> {{passenger}} services between Ebbw Vale and Newport to resume {{on the line}} since the 1980s, {{while he was still}} a councillor. An initial feasibility study of the proposal was carried out for Blaenau Gwent council by infrastructure project management company Capita Symonds in 1998. Stations at Ebbw Vale, Cwm, Aberbeeg, Abercarn, Risca and Maesglas were suggested, and the plans included running some trains to Cardiff Central via a new station at Celtic Lakes on the South Wales Main Line. Law made fighting for the line's re-opening one of his major election promises during the National Assembly for Wales election campaign in 1999. A plaque at Ebbw Vale Parkway commemorates Law, who died in 2006, and his work to re-open the line. It was unveiled by Jocelyn Davies AM on 10 December 2007, four days before the Ebbw Valley Railway's planned official re-opening.|$|E
5|$|For the Battle of Romani, Chauvel {{chose his}} ground carefully, reconnoitring {{it from the}} ground and the air, and {{selecting}} both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commander— Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein— selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General Edward Chaytor's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130British casualties, it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside West Africa Campaign.|$|E

25|$|Schäuble has <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> more muscular {{policies}} to combat terrorism since {{he joined the}} first Merkel government in 2005. Shortly after he assumed the position of Minister of the Interior, the 2006 German train bombing plot became the closest Germany {{is known to have}} come to a large-scale terrorist attack since 11 September 2001, and Schäuble publicly stated the country escaped that one only through luck.|$|E

They were eventually restored on 9 July 1923, four and a half years after hostilities had ceased. They did not last long as they were withdrawn again on 21 September 1925, never to be resumed. Freight trains continued to operate through the station until 8 February 1932 and the track was lifted shortly afterwards.|$|E

Elbegdorj banned the use of all alcoholic beverages at state dinners and state ceremonies under his name. Also he called upon government and its agencies not to serve alcohol at official ceremonies and functions.

25|$|The {{construction}} of the extension was not without political fallout. For a long time, the politicians representing residences in the North-East area of the island had <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> the {{construction of}} a planned North East Line. The announcement of the Woodlands Extension led to protests especially from opposition members of parliament, in particular from Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Khiang, representatives of Potong Pasir and Hougang constituencies respectively, with both areas potentially benefiting from such a line. The opposition members accused the government of favouring the Woodlands Extension over the North East Line due to opposition representation in the north-east area, arguing that there were far more residents in the north-east compared to the north, and questioned the rationale of building the Woodlands extension when the north was relatively undeveloped.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} the anti-Hungarian {{sentiment}} was the hatred of all the statues and monuments representing Austria-Hungary or Hungarian historical people. National socialist MPs of the Czechoslovak National Assembly have <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> the conservation of such works of art, moving and preserving them in suitable place as early as 1920. The hatred however {{was not limited to}} sculptures only: Hungarian books were burned in Poprad and possibly other locations as well. Concurrently some of the statues were destroyed as well: the millennium monument along with the Árpád statue in Devín was blown up using dynamite,. The statue of Maria Theresa in Bratislava (pictured) was preserved until October 1921 when information about trial to restore monarchy spread in successor states of Austria-Monarchy. In the atmosphere of partial mobilization, martial law and fresh memories to invasion of Béla Kun's army, it was brought down using ropes tied to trucks. In Slovakia, memorials were destroyed mainly after intervention of Red Guards of Béla Kun in spring and summer 1919, when statues of Lajos Kossuth were destroyed in Rožňava, Lučenec, Dobšiná and Nové Zámky, also a statue of Ferenc Rákóczi in Brezno and numerous others. In almost all of these cases the perpetrators were the soldiers of the Czechoslovakian legion. Idleness of state authorities encouraged destroyers of statues. The government started to act only when the mob had begun to take over shops and properties of German entrepreneurs. Thereafter, Czechoslovak army and police intervened and destruction of symbols of monarchy stopped nearly for a year.|$|E

The trains were scheduled to connect with similar Metro-North specials at New Haven. Year-round weekend service began on July 4, 2008, with 9 daily Old Saybrook – New Haven round trips on weekends. No weekend service was run to New London, but weekday service was increased as cross-honoring of multiple-ride and monthly tickets was added on two Amtrak trains.|$|E

[...] Script producer Peter Mattessi {{promised that the}} second series would take the characters to darker, scarier and more unattractive parts of their personalities, writer Muge Ahmet {{said it would be}} sexier, and Sathe stated there would be big secrets, while writer Alex Oates said that the show and the writers had grown up a lot since the first series. The Daily Star newspaper reported that the second series would be more controversial than the first, including scenes of drug dealing and violence.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family {{criticized the}} ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating {{because it has}} a vested {{interest}} in the video game industry, stating that [...] "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took explicit porn to get [...] an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> AO ratings for the Grand Theft Auto series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." [...] The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization [...] "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was [...] "imposing its own narrow values and morality {{on the rest of the}} country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and [...] "report card" [...] used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.|$|E
500|$|Moran {{cared for}} Poe at the for-profit Washington College Hospital on Broadway and Fayette Street. He was denied any {{visitors}} and was confined in a prison-like room with barred windows {{in a section}} of the building reserved for drunk people. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with Jeremiah N. Reynolds, a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds, one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan's Tavern, who may have met Poe on Election Day. Poe may have instead <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Herring", as the author had an uncle-in-law in Baltimore named Henry Herring. In later testimonies Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a [...] "Misses Herring". He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during {{one of the few times}} Poe was awake. When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends, Poe allegedly replied that [...] "the best thing his friend could do would be to blow out his brains with a pistol".|$|E

500|$|The Christian Democrats, {{believing that}} the coup was merely a {{temporary}} measure, demanded that new elections to the Seimas be held, but Smetona stalled. He predicted that his party would not be popular {{and that he would}} not be re-elected president. In the meantime, the Nationalists were discussing constitutional changes that would increase the powers of the executive branch while curbing the powers of the Seimas. In April, a group of populists tried to organize a coup [...] "to defend the constitution," [...] but the plans were discovered and the rebels were arrested. Among the detainees was a member of the Seimas, Juozas Pajaujis. On 12 April 1927, the Seimas protested this arrest as a violation of the parliamentary immunity by delivering a motion of no confidence against the Voldemaras government. Smetona, using his constitutional right to do so, dissolved the Seimas. The constitution was violated, however, when no new elections were held within two months. In April, Christian Democratic newspapers, which had <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> new elections, were censored. On 2 May 1927, Christian Democrats withdrew from the government, thinking that the Nationalists acting alone would not be able to sustain it. As a result, the Lithuanian National Union took the upper hand in its dispute with a much larger and influential rival and assumed the absolute control of the state.|$|E

And we’re elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on Twitter—if anyone deserves global notoriety it’s Kony." [...] She added: [...] "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge {{of one of the most}} brutal rebel groups in Africa." [...] HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, [...] "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA."

Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: [...] "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," [...] but added: [...] "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights", especially because [...] "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.|$|E
