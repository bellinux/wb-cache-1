5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid.

The EPA responded to the suit <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> a report blaming the Varroa mite for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.|$|E

5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity <b>by</b> <b>issuing,</b> {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1917, George appeased British {{nationalist}} feelings <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> a royal proclamation {{that changed}} {{the name of the}} British royal house from the German-sounding House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. He and all his British relatives relinquished their German titles and styles, and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated his male relatives by creating them British peers. His cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, who earlier in the war had been forced to resign as First Sea Lord through anti-German feeling, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Queen Mary's brothers became Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge, and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone.|$|E

Roosevelt responded to fears of a fifth column composed of Japanese-Americans <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. This executive order authorized the military to create zones of exclusion, which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the West Coast to internment camps inland. On March 23, 1942, General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, set restrictions on aliens and Japanese-Americans including a curfew from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.|$|E

5|$|The Indian National Congress won the 1937 {{elections}} in Madras Presidency. Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937. He was {{a supporter of}} propagating Hindi in South India. On 11 August 1937, within a month of coming to power, he announced his intention to introduce Hindi language teaching in secondary schools <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> a policy statement. On 21 April 1938, he issued a government order (G.O.) making the teaching of Hindi compulsory in 125 secondary schools in the Presidency. Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by A. T. Panneerselvam immediately opposed the move. They started statewide protests against Rajaji and Hindi.|$|E
5|$|The Port of New York and New Jersey {{comprised}} {{the main point}} of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I, via the New York Port of Embarkation. The congestion at the port led experts to realize {{the need for a}} port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges, highways, subways, and port facilities in the New York-New Jersey area. The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority {{under the supervision of the}} governors of the two states. <b>By</b> <b>issuing</b> its own bonds, it was financially independent of either state; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees, not from taxes. It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large-scale projects.|$|E

These included former Republican governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, who was convicted for complicity in the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading Democrats to portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan. Goebel's likeness was also removed from state checks and documents {{and was replaced by}} likenesses of either Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, or John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, {{but then in}} electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and eventually pure silver. Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a deterioration in the proportion of precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king to respond to this crisis <b>by</b> <b>issuing</b> a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E
