5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} contiguous atoms of a ligand <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of linezolid <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> the 50S subunit of a ribosome from the archaean Haloarcula marismortui was elucidated {{by a team}} of scientists from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> a 50S subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} can be <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> {{the nucleus}} of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
