5000|$|Glamorganshire {{mountain}} sheep wandered over the countryside from early times, some being horned and others being polled. In the 1840s, Youatt described the sheep of Glamorganshire: [...] "Some are nearly white, {{and others are}} between a dirty white and a perfect black. The head is small; the neck long, erect, and delicate; the fore-quarters light, with narrow breast and shoulders; the sides flat; the back and loins narrow; the legs slight and long; the animals possessing considerable agility. The fleece weighs about 2 lbs kg. On the Gelligaer and Eglwysilan mountains {{the quality of the}} wool is fine; but on the hills lying on the western side of the Taff valley it is kempy, which deteriorates its value. The <b>breech</b> <b>wool</b> is still more hairy and coarse." [...] Dre-fach Felindre in the Teifi valley became known as the [...] "Huddersfield of Wales" [...] when the wool industry was prosperous there.|$|E
40|$|Objective To test {{strategies}} {{for the application of}} dicyclanil and mid-season crutching to maximise protection of unmulesed sheep against breech strike. Procedure Three hundred and eighty unmulesed Merino weaners were randomly allocated to four groups either left untreated or treated by different strategies with 50 g/L dicyclanil. Treatments included breech treatment alone and breech plus body treatment, with two application times, immediately after shearing and 6 weeks after crutching or shearing. To assess protection, larval implants with newly hatched Lucilia cuprina larvae were applied to 10 different sheep from each group at 3, 4, 5 and 6 months after crutching and shearing and assessed for the development of strike at 48 hours. The concentration of dicyclanil was measured in wool samples clipped from the breeches of the test sheep. Results All dicyclanil treatments gave significant reduction in strike in comparison to controls up until 4 months after crutching but protection in the sheep treated immediately after shearing had waned at 5 months. Treating at 6 weeks after crutching provided significant reduction (P < 0. 05) in strike for 6 months. Results for strike incidence immediately after shearing and concentration of dicyclanil in the <b>breech</b> <b>wool</b> also suggested improvements in protection by delaying treatment for 6 weeks. Conclusion In most environments {{it should be possible to}} protect unmulesed sheep against breech strike with a carefully planned integrated control program incorporating strategically timed crutching, shearing and dicyclanil application. Delaying treatment with dicyclanil to at least 6 weeks after shearing or crutching increased the protection provided in comparison to treatment immediately after shearing...|$|E
