For the purpose of analysis, the widths of the gaps are assumed to be infinitesimal, but there is no physical contact between abutting edges of neighbouring sections of the plate.

The theory determines the attenuation of the <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> by the gaps and the sound radiated into the ambient fluid during the interaction. Specific results are given for a steel plate which has a single gap in air and in water, such that either (1) the abutting edges are free to vibrate independently, (2) both edges are clamped, or (3) one edge is clamped and the other free. In each of these cases the coupling between the two halves of the plate is provided solely by the fluid loading: the <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> would be totally reflected at the gap in vacuo.

Unless the plate is very heavily damped, the transverse vibration of the plate is dominated by the freely propagating waves. However below the critical frequency of the plate, the direct airborne sound transmission of the plate is dominated by the forced waves because their radiation efficiency is very much greater than that of the freely propagating waves.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the suppression of a <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> in a beam using resonators. Particular focus is put on the separation length between resonators. It is demonstrated that, for a beam with identical resonators attached at equal intervals, the <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> transmission efficiency varies with respect to the separation length. The phenomena and the underlying physics are investigated by resorting to a simple beam model having two resonators resting on it. The two resonators are coupled over the segment through various <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> components, comprising both propagating waves and evanescent waves, generated at the resonator locations where the beam encounters impedance discontinuities. The separation length, specifying the phase change of the propagating waves and the amplitude decay of the evanescent waves travelling from one resonator to the other, is thereby the parameter determining {{the extent to which the}} resonators would be coupled and the degree of the power that is transmitted. Results show, qualitatively, the difference in the working mechanism of the resonators in different separation length regions, with criteria being defined to distinguish those regions.

40|$|Non-destructive {{testing has}} been used for many years to {{evaluate}} the in situ condition of timber piles. Longitudinal impact is usually applied on the top of piles to induce longitudinal wave to detect faults in piles {{due to the fact that}} the longitudinalwave has less dispersive nature at lowfrequency. On the other hand,when it comes to evaluation of poles in situ, it is different as poles are partly embedded in soil and it is more practical to produce bending waves, as the top of the pole is not easily accessible. However, <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> is known for its highly dispersive nature; especially in the low frequency range which is usually induced in low strain integrity testing. As <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> can be considered as a hybrid of longitudinal and shear waves, it will be helpful, if it could detect the component of these twowaves separately. To do so, components of displacements or accelerations along radial and longitudinal directions need to be determined. By applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the signals, the dominant frequencies can be obtained.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a parametric model {{to study the}} transient <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in a viscoelastic sandwich plate due to impact loading. The effect of partial constrained layer damping (PCLD) geometry on wave propagation is investigated by comparing with propagation in single layer elastic plate. Several boundary conditions are also considered, and their effect on wave propagation is highlighted. The equation of motion is obtained from Lagrange’s equations. For the single layer plate, the governing equation is solved in time domain using Newman and Wilson method. For the plate with PCLD, the frequency dependant viscoelastic behavior of the core is represented by Prony series; the equation of motion is converted into frequency domain using Fourier transform the displacement is obtained in the frequency domain and is converted into time domain with the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform. The model was validated in our previous paper (Khalfi and Ross (2013)) with experimental results, additional validation is carried in this paper with literature, and good agreement is recorded. The {{results show that the}} plate covered with PCLD remains a dispersive medium. The shape of the wave is mainly related to the sandwich stiffness while the viscoelastic layer contributes in reducing the amplitude and speed of propagation. The particularity of this transient model lies in its ability to follow the shape of the <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> at all times to observe formation, propagation and disappearance. With this model, the influence of any structural input parameters on the <b>bending</b> <b>wave</b> can be studied.
