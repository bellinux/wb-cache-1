After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person <b>brave</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> tell him the truth.|$|E
5|$|But {{during this}} period Japan's Navy Air Service was {{launching}} frequent air raids on the city, eventually totaling 50 raids according to the Navy's own records. The Navy Air Service had struck Nanking {{for the first time}} on August 15, and after winning air supremacy over the city on September 19 it began bombing the city night and day with impunity, hitting both military and civilian targets. In the face of Japanese bombs and the ongoing advance of the Japanese Army, the large majority of Nanking's citizens fled the city. By early December Nanking's population had dropped from its former total of more than one million to less than 500,000, a figure which included Chinese refugees from rural villages burned down by their own government's scorched earth policies. Most of those still in the city were very poor and had nowhere else to go. Foreign residents of Nanking were also repeatedly asked to leave the city which was becoming more and more chaotic under the strain of bombings, fires, looting by criminals, and electrical outages, but those few foreigners <b>brave</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stay behind strived to find a way to help the Chinese civilians who had been unable to leave. In late-November a group of them led by German citizen John Rabe established the Nanking Safety Zone in the center of the city, a self-proclaimed demilitarized zone where civilian refugees could congregate in order to hopefully escape the fighting. The safety zone was recognized by the Chinese government, and on December 8 Tang Shengzhi demanded that all civilians evacuate there.|$|E

She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion.

The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl.
