40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the possibility of}} applying selected tools of chaos theory {{in the process of}} modeling a frictional pair by monitoring its operating condition aspects. These tools are suggested with regard to the friction process, which subtracts a variety of noises currently treated as a stochastic phenomenon. This assumption significantly reduces the possibility of a precise description and modeling of friction phenomena. The fundamental assumption that enables the application of chaos theory tools is that of treating the friction phenomenon as a non-linear dynamic one. This assumption allows for an analysis of the basic values that characterize the operation of a frictional pair in phase space. Such a manner of presenting and analyzing the parameters of the operation of a frictional pair allows for a prediction of the system’s condition (the parameters describing the operating conditions of the frictional pair) {{in a short period of}} time. In this article, the authors implemented the above-mentioned method to the modeling of an automotive disk <b>brake</b> <b>couple.</b> This tribo-system was selected because of the great intensiveness of the friction process and the non-trivial impact of noises. The article proves that the friction process, according to the performed tests, comes under chaos theory properties. Moreover, a successful prediction of the operating conditions of the frictional pair was carried out...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical analysis {{is carried out}} to study the response of a multi-cylinder, turbocharged, IDI (indirect injection) compression ignition engine, under transient operating conditions. To this aim, a comprehensive digital computer model is developed which solves the governing differential equations individually for each cylinder, providing thus increased accuracy over previous 'single-cylinder' simulations. Special {{attention has been paid}} for diversifying the transient operation from the steady-state one, providing improved or even new relations concerning combustion, heat transfer to the cylinder walls, friction, turbocharger and aftercooler operation, and dynamic analysis for the transient case. An extended steady state and transient experimental work is conducted on a specially developed engine test bed configuration, located at the authors' laboratory, which is connected to a high-speed data acquisition and processing system. The steady-state measurements are used for the calibration of the individual submodel constants. The transient investigation includes both speed and load changes operating schedules. During each transient test four major measurements are continuously made, i. e. engine speed, fuel pump rack position, main chamber pressure and turbocharger compressor boost pressure. The hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>coupled</b> to the engine possesses a high mass moment of inertia and long nonlinear load-change times, which together with the indirect injection nature of the engine are important challenges for the simulation code. Explicit multiple diagrams are given to describe the engine and turbocharger transient behaviour including smoke predictions. The agreement between {{experimental and}} predicted responses is satisfactory, for all the cases examined, proving the validity of the simulation process, while providing useful information for the engine response under various transient operations.

40|$|The {{sugar cane}} {{industry}} uses <b>brake</b> vans, <b>coupled</b> {{to the end}} of cane trains, to produce a given constant braking force to improve the cane bin ride dynamics and to assist the braking of trains.

Currently brake vans operate using compressed air, supplied by an on board compressor, which activates a brake calliper, which clamps a ventilated disc rotor on each of the four wheel sets. This system needs maintenance due to wear on the brake pads and rotors. An electrical braking implemented using self-excited induction generator is proposed.

50|$|A rescue {{train was}} {{attempting}} to connect to the stalled train when the driver was told to release the <b>brake</b> while <b>coupling</b> {{had not yet been}} successful. It was then that the empty train began to roll backwards at a speed of ten metres per second, before smashing into the other train, which was carrying passengers. Therefore, it was believed that the incident was caused by negligence due to insufficient training of operation staff. This accident also resulted in two damaged trains with heavily damaged areas limited to the two leading cars. The colliding speed was suspected to be about 60 km/h due to the appearance of damaged areas. However, one train, which was rebuilt from the repair of the minor-damaged cars, was already fitted for operation at the end of 2006 and the remaining one was still under heavy repair until mid of 2007; it was released into service in October 2007. The cost resulting from the accident might be a much higher figure than BMCL quoted, and it was expected to be at least 400 million baht, which was totally insured by a local insurance company.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{the robust}} {{control of the}} output valve of a water brake is {{investigated}} for the transient loading of a marine diesel engine. Experimental models of the water brake - engine array are derived, corresponding to different operating points. Those models are processed in order to derive an uncertain model that characterizes the system {{in a wide range}} of operating points. A μ-synthesis controller is developed, based on the uncertain model derived. The controller is tested on a water <b>brake</b> <b>coupled</b> with a marine diesel engine at LME/NTUA in order to evaluate the controller performance and the software simulation results. Initially, datasets were obtained by providing the open-loop system with an appropriate Pseudo-Random Binary Signal (PRBS) signal. Datasets were then pre-processed and split for identification and validation use. Multiple models were derived using both subspace (Numerical algorithm for Subspace State Space System IDentification (N 4 SID)) and polynomial (Prediction Error Method (PEM)) algorithms. Those models were evaluated against a validation dataset and the models providing the best fit were selected. Then, depending on the operating point that each model was based on, models were separated into two pools: “average” and “extreme”. The “average” model pool was used to select nominal models and the “extreme” model pool was used as a representation of worst-case scenarios. By combining these pools appropriately, uncertain models were derived. Given the complexity of the system examined and the presence of non-linearities, all controllers developed were 2 -Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) μ-synthesis controllers. Different controllers were derived based on different uncertain models. Consequently, different stability and performance properties were observed. A software simulation setup was developed in order to evaluate the controllers against the models derived. By testing a controller against a model from the “extreme” pool, its robustness was evaluated. Finally, the controllers that showed the most merit during software simulation, were evaluated at the experimental testbed of LME. The controllers functioned satisfactorily and the software simulation results approached those obtained experimentally, proving the soundness of the modeling.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{disc brake}} is a device for slowing or {{stopping}} {{the rotation of}} a wheel. A brake disc (or rotor), usually made of cast iron or ceramic composites (including carbon, Kevlar and silica), {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To stop the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted on a device called a brake caliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop. Brakes convert friction to heat, but if the brakes get too hot, they will cease to work because they cannot dissipate enough heat. This condition of failure is known as brake fade. Disc brakes are exposed to large thermal stresses during routine braking and extraordinary thermal stresses during hard braking. The aim of the project is to model a disc <b>brake</b> used. <b>Coupled</b> field analysis (Structural + Thermal) is done on the disc brake. The materials used are Cast Iron, stainless steel and aluminum alloy. Analysis is also done by changing the design of disc brake.
