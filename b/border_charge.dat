50|$|The New Zealand {{government}} recoiled from a plan {{to follow}} Australia in imposing a departure tax. Cabinet papers show the government planned to implement a NZ$35 <b>border</b> <b>charge</b> in its May 2013 budget, but withdrew from the plan after the country’s Economic Development Ministry found the tax would have run counter to New Zealand’s tourism promotion efforts. This was particularly true of travel from Australia, the ministry's modelling found.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on China Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts (WT/DS 342 /AB/R, 15 December 2008). This dispute {{concerns}} {{a set of}} regulatory measures imposing a 25 % 'charge' on imported automobile parts used {{in the manufacture of}} motor vehicles in China. The main legal question in this case consisted of the nature of this charge as either a <b>border</b> <b>charge</b> subject to China's tariff concessions or an internal charge, subject to the basic nondiscrimination requirement of GATT Article III. In our report, we examine the reasoning of the Appellate Body relating to the difference between these two types of charges. We discuss the role and relevance of this distinction in the GATT/WTO legal system in general, and for the purposes of resolving this dispute in particular. We also address the important systemic question relating to the review of a Member's domestic laws for purposes of determining their GATT/WTO consistency. This was an important issue in this case, as China claimed that the Panel misunderstood the meaning of the relevant Decree and requested the Appellate Body to review the Panel's erroneous reading of this Decree. We discuss the Appellate Body's reasoning relating to the review of domestic laws by Panels and the Appellate Body and express concern over the distinction drawn by the Appellate Body between legal and factual elements of relevance in the interpretation of such laws. The 'economic bone' in this case is less straightforward to split than the legal one. In legal terms, the Appellate Body's decision is a time-consistent one, but, in economic terms, it is not clear if it is also a welfare-optimal one. The main reason is that many questions relevant to the case were left unaddressed by the Appellate Body. Due to the lack of factual evidence to substantiate its allegations, the Panel's ruling remains rather speculative on certain accounts. For this purpose, we engage in our own examination of the facts, using mainly a unique dataset of Chinese firm-level data. We analyze issues of ownership in China's car industry, the growth of the import-competing Chinese industry over time, the elasticity of the demand for cars, and duty pass-through, etc. The purpose is to verify more closely who 'benefits' and who 'loses' from the Chinese import duty so as to understand the economic incentives involved. In this respect, we attempt to determine whether the economics support the conclusion that China pursued a beggar-thy-neighbor policy in the car-part industry...|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio <b>border,</b> <b>charging</b> a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey <b>border,</b> <b>charging</b> a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} timber trade liberalisation on economic welfare and forest conservation in Sri Lanka. A partial equilibrium market simulation model was used to analyse the welfare impacts. Results show that removal of all <b>border</b> <b>charges</b> reduce timber price by about 25 %. Decline in timber price reduces the incentives for illegal logging and enhances forest conservation in Sri Lanka. The price reduction also results in an increase of consumer surplus by about US $ 40 million per year. Timber trade liberalisation reduces local supply by about 12 % to 31 % depending on the elasticity of supply. The reduction of local supply can prevent 6, 985, 13, 971 and 17, 469 ha of deforestation under the inelastic, unitary elastic and elastic demand and supply assumptions, respectively...|$|R

5000|$|In 1922 {{the borough}} {{obtained}} an official grant of arms from the College of Arms. The lamb {{was moved to}} the crest, on top of the helm. It was transformed into a paschal lamb supporting a pennon of St George. As a number of other crests featured a paschal lamb, a silver and blue wave, for the River Thames, was added. The arms themselves retained references to the Duchy of Cornwall (the black <b>border</b> <b>charged</b> with bezants or gold discs) and the Archbishop of Canterbury (the mitre and crozier). The red cross in the first quarter was taken from the arms of the London County Council, showing that the borough was in the county. The fourth quarter contained a gold and blue chequered pattern, the arms of the de Warennes, Earls of Surrey. This was included to show that Lambeth lay in the county of Surrey until 1889. The ermine patterning in the other quarter was said to stand for [...] "purity and honour".|$|R

The English selectors once again chopped and changed their line-up, including the addition of two new debutants – Michael Atherton, and Devon Malcolm. Despite the series having already been decided, it was the fifth test at Trent Bridge which truly defined the 1989 Ashes series. Having won the toss and confidently decided to bat, <b>Border's</b> <b>charges</b> piled on the runs once again. The opening stand of 329 between Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh which lasted for nearly four sessions, the highest opening stand in an Ashes test, in any test in England, and the fifth highest partnership for the first wicket in all tests.
