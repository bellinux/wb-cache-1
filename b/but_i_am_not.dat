I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
25|$|Why do {{you retire}} from me? I can easily follow you anywhere, and be where you are. It {{is much better}} for you to return to your own estate, and not be quitting it on my account. You see well that if I wished it I could take away all you have, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> {{inclined}} to do so.|$|E
60|$|SCHUTZMACHER. Oh, <b>not</b> at all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{talking of}} criminals. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{comparing}} honest Englishmen with honest Jews.|$|R
60|$|Cousin Edie {{laughed at}} all this, and I laughed because she did; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{so sure that}} it was funny.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> often {{a dismal}} failure when I {{make up my}} mind to do a thing. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> noted for that.|$|R
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not.</b> Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Wood {{described}} {{herself as}} Jewish. In 2012, Evan stated, [...] "I believe in God <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> religious. I am spiritual. My definition of God isn't in any religion. It's very personal." [...] Wood's {{mother is a}} convert to Judaism, and Wood's father is Christian.|$|E
500|$|She {{considered}} {{converting to}} Buddhism after having gained {{an interest in}} that religion during the shooting of The Painted Veil. [...] She said of her religious beliefs, [...] "I have some belief <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a strict Buddhist or anything yet". She practices the Transcendental Meditation technique.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir. Only Mr. Wildeve is twanky because 'tisn't a boy--that's {{what they}} say in the kitchen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{supposed}} to notice that." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Detention {{in custody}} in {{circumstances}} not involving some {{breach of the}} criminal law and not coming within well-accepted categories of the kind to which Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ refer is offensive to ordinary notions of what {{is involved in a}} just society. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> presently persuaded that legislation authorizing detention in circumstances involving no breach of the criminal law and travelling beyond presently accepted categories is necessarily and inevitably offensive to Ch.III." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told that I am going to be killed before the regime is over <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> going to run away." ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{how would}} Sally Langdon meet me now, after my regretted {{exhibition}} before her cousin? There {{was no use}} to conjecture, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> hopeful.|$|R

500|$|Vidya {{is trained}} in carnatic music and briefly studied the dance forms of Bharatnatyam and Kathak. Regarding her {{religious}} affiliations, Vidya said, [...] "I am {{a person with a}} lot of faith and I have conversations [...] all the time <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> so religious in the conventional, organised sense". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as [...] "India's hottest vegetarian" [...] in polls conducted by PETA in 2011 and 2012. Her weight fluctuations over the years {{have been the subject of}} substantial media coverage in India.|$|E
500|$|Although {{in later}} life he had a {{reputation}} for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner. Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions. He commented, [...] "I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not,</b> I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Girty I knew, of course; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{sure the}} other was the Shawnee who {{captured}} you and your brother," [...] replied Heckewelder, drawing Jim into another room.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of Disraeli's condition, the doctors concocted optimistic bulletins, for public consumption. The Prime Minister, Gladstone, called several times to enquire about his rival's condition, and wrote in his diary, [...] "May the Almighty be near his pillow." [...] There was intense public {{interest}} in the former Prime Minister's struggles for life. [...] Disraeli had customarily taken the sacrament at Easter; when this day was observed on 17 April, there was discussion among {{his friends and family}} if he should be given the opportunity, but those against, fearing that he would lose hope, prevailed. On the morning of the following day, Easter Monday, he became incoherent, then comatose. Disraeli's last confirmed words before dying in the early morning of 19 April were [...] "I had rather live <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> afraid to die". The anniversary of Disraeli's death is now commemorated in the United Kingdom as Primrose Day.|$|E
500|$|Nhu's agents soon {{reported}} Có's {{activities to}} the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, {{because you have}} suspected me. I have not really gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> against you. I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
500|$|On 14 March 2013, Torres {{scored the}} third goal as Chelsea {{defeated}} Steaua București 3–1 to advance 3–2 on aggregate to the quarter-final of the Europa League. With this goal, Torres {{became the first}} player to score in seven different competitions in one season. In April 2013, Torres acknowledged his struggles at Chelsea, saying, [...] "I want to do the things I used to do. I did them at Atlético, I did them at Liverpool, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> doing them at Chelsea," [...] but he vowed to [...] "try his heart out" [...] to regain his best form. He scored twice against Rubin Kazan in the 3–1 win in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final on 4 April 2013, before scoring again in the second leg 3–2 defeat, with Chelsea progressing to the semi-final 5–4 on aggregate.

60|$|MY DEAR SISTER,--I had no {{idea that}} Charley's case <b>was</b> so serious. <b>I</b> knew it <b>was</b> bad, and persistent, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> aware of the full size of the matter.|$|R

500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
2500|$|Raised as a Catholic by his parents, Zelazny later {{declared}} himself a lapsed Catholic and remained {{that way for}} the rest of his life. [...] "I did have a strong Catholic background, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a Catholic. Somewhere in the past, I believe I answered in the affirmative once for strange and complicated reasons. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a member of any organized religion." ...|$|E
