Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality.

The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish. In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object (called pithing or ike jime in Japanese).|$|E

500|$|The jack jumper ant and its {{relatives}} in the genus Myrmecia {{are among the most}} dangerous ant genera and have fearsome reputations for their extreme aggression; Guinness World Records certifies the ant Myrmecia pyriformis as the world's most dangerous ant. The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species, such as [...] Brachyponera chinensis, Brachyponera sennaarensis, and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in jack jumpers, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Their venom contains haemolytic and eicosanoid elements and histamines. It contains a range of active ingredients and enzymatic activity, which includes phospholipase A2 and B, hyaluronidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase. The venom of the ant also contains several peptides; one being pilosulin 1, which causes cytotoxic effects, pilosulin 2, which has antihypertensive properties and pilosulin 3, which is known to be a major allergen. Other pilosulins include pilosulin 4 and pilosulin 5. The peptides have known molecular weights. The LD50 (lethal dose) occurs at a lower concentration than for melittin, a peptide found in <b>bee</b> <b>venom.</b> Its LD50 value is 3.6 mg/kg (injected intravenously in mice).|$|E

40|$|AbstractMyelin is the self-stacked {{membrane}} surrounding axons; it is {{also the}} target of several pathological and/or neurodegenerative processes like multiple sclerosis. These processes involve, among others, the hydrolytic attack by phospholipases. In this work we describe the changes in isolated myelin structure after treatment with several secreted PLA 2 (sPLA 2), by using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. It was observed that myelin treated with all the tested sPLA 2 s (from cobra and <b>bee</b> <b>venoms</b> and from pig pancreas) preserved the lamellar structure but displayed an enlarged separation between membranes in certain zones. Additionally, the peak due to membrane asymmetry was clearly enhanced. The coherence length was also lower than the non-treated myelin, indicating increased disorder. These SAXS results were complemented by Langmuir film experiments to follow myelin monolayer hydrolysis at the air/water interface by a decrease in electric surface potential at different surface pressures. All enzymes produced hydrolysis with no major qualitative difference between the isoforms tested...|$|R

2500|$|All {{honey bees}} live in colonies where the workers sting intruders {{as a form}} of defense, and alarmed bees release a {{pheromone}} that stimulates the attack response in other bees. The different species of honey bees are distinguished from all other bee species (and virtually all other Hymenoptera) by the possession of small barbs on the sting, but these barbs are found only in the worker bees. The sting and associated venom sac of honey bees are also modified so as to pull free of the body once lodged (autotomy), and the sting apparatus has its own musculature and ganglion, which allows it to keep delivering venom once detached. The gland which produces the alarm pheromone is also associated with the sting apparatus. The embedded stinger continues to emit additional alarm pheromone after it has torn loose; other defensive workers are thereby attracted to the sting site. The worker dies after the sting becomes lodged and is subsequently torn loose from the bee's abdomen. [...] The honey <b>bee's</b> <b>venom,</b> known as apitoxin, carries several active components, the most abundant of which is melittin, and the most destructive is phospholipase A2.|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the use of}} antivenoms is {{the only}} {{available}} treatment for envenomation caused by venomous animals namely, snake, scorpion, spider, tick and jelly fish. Antivenoms are generally produced in large animals, mostly in horses. A {{large percentage of the}} population is allergic to horse proteins. Several animals are known to be resistant to snakebites and the antihemorrhagic and anti-lethal components have been isolated from sera of opossum, mongoose, meerkat and hedgehog, as well as from venomous and non-venomous snakes. Anti-lethal factor named Lethal Toxin Neutralizing Factor (LTNF) has been isolated in purity from opossum (Didelphis virginiana) serum by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The molecular weight of LTNF is 63 kDa, and it does not form precipitation with venoms or toxins by immunodiffusion. Death due to intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a predetermined lethal dose of venom from major families of snakes, for instance Crotalidae, Elapidae, Viperidae and Hydrophiidae, is prevented in mice by subsequent IP inoculation of LTNF. Furthermore, LTNF neutralizes the lethality of scorpion and <b>bee</b> <b>venoms</b> and toxins from various animals, plants and bacteria.

40|$|The Africanized honeybee, {{popularly known}} as the "killer bee," is already well {{established}} in Texas and has recently entered California and Arizona. As the Africanized honeybee spreads in North America, the medical community must {{become aware of the}} problems associated with this insect and ensure that sting emergencies can be handled quickly and appropriately. The major differences between Africanized and European honeybees are that the former are more irritable, they swarm more readily and frequently, they defend their hives more vehemently, and they sting more collectively.

Authorities will prepare for the bees' arrival by expanding public awareness, teaching risk-avoidance behavior, providing for the removal of troublesome hives, and developing sting treatment protocols that can be initiated rapidly in the field or emergency departments.
