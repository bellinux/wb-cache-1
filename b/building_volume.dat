25|$|Automatic {{multi-storey}} car parks provide lower {{building cost}} per parking slot, as they typically require less <b>building</b> <b>volume</b> and less ground area than a conventional facility {{with the same}} capacity. However, {{the cost of the}} mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs {{to be added to the}} building cost to determine the total cost. Other costs are usually lower too, for example there is no need for an energy-intensive ventilating system, since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed.|$|E

Furthermore, laser datasets allow to compute <b>building</b> <b>volumes</b> either approximately as simple difference between DTM and DEM or more properly as 3 D polyhedral models.

50|$|In {{the process}} of {{creating}} an urban plan or urban design, carrier-infill is one mechanism of spatial organization in which the city's figure and ground components are considered separately. The urban figure, namely buildings, are represented as total possible <b>building</b> <b>volumes,</b> which are left to be designed by architects in following stages. The urban ground, namely in-between spaces and open areas, are designed to a higher level of detail. The carrier-infill approach is defined by an urban design performing as the carrying structure that creates the shape and scale of the spaces, including future <b>building</b> <b>volumes</b> that are then infilled by architects' designs. The contents of the carrier structure may include street pattern, landscape architecture, open space, waterways, and other infrastructure. The infill structure may contain zoning, building codes, quality guidelines, and Solar Access based upon a solar envelope. Carrier-Infill urban design is differentiated from complete urban design, such as in the monumental axis of Brasília, in which the urban design and architecture were created together.|$|R

40|$|Power {{authorities}} are highly interested in figures that indicate the energy requirements {{and especially the}} heat requirements on a local, regional and country-wide level. Such numbers are needed for their planning of new sites of power plants or for planning alternative energy modes. Existing methods for estimating those requirements heavily rely on local sampling methods {{as well as on}} the use of statistical estimates and models. The traditional way of acquiring area wide data is to use statistics and punctually acquired data and extrapolate it to wider areas. E. g. several districts of a city are investigated based on aerial photos and classified into different building and settlement typologies; the cities, in turn are classified according to certain types, which in the end will lead to a country wide statistics. In order to determine more accurate base information, in this project we are using laser scanning as a basic data acquisition method to determine <b>building</b> <b>volumes,</b> i. e. the volumes to be heated. This is due to the fact that laser scanning potentially allows for an areawide data capture, and also has a high potential of automated data analysis and interpretation. The heat demand of an individual building depends primarily on its age and its type. Therefore, in order to assign head demands to individual buildings measured from laser scanning, the building type first has to be inferred from the available geometric characteristics. The paper will present the results of the automatic extraction of <b>building</b> <b>volumes,</b> and concentrates on the identification of the given building and settlement types that can be used to link the <b>building</b> <b>volumes</b> with specific heat coefficients. The results achieved with our approach will be compared with results derived in the traditional way. 1...|$|R
