40|$|The sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil,</b> Lixus incanescens B., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of sugar beet plant in Iran. The petioles and leaves of sugar beet are attacked by larvae and adults of the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil.</b> Chemical application is currently used for controlling the pest. Digestion in the alimentary canal of the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil</b> is facilitated by some carbohydrases. Results of the in vitro studies indicated the presence of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase in the digestive tract of the pest. Highest activities of alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase were at pH 5, pH 5 and pH 4, respectively. No significant alpha-glucosidase and alpha-galactosidase activity was detected in the pest's digestive system. Optimum temperatures for alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activity were determined at 45, 50 and 40 oC, respectively. alpha-amylase was more stable under acidic condition (pH 4 to pH 6) than under highly acidic and alkaline condition. Na+ and K+ increased alpha-amylase activity, but sodium dodecyl sulfate significantly decreased amylase activity. Also, the activity of alpha-amylase was inhibited by the other compounds such as MgCl 2, CaCl 2 and EDTA. Zymogram analysis using native-PAGE revealed one band of alpha-amylase activity in Lixus incanescens. High activity of carbohydrases in the digestive system of adults was determined and further researches are needed to be applied to design new strategies for controlling the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil</b> based on natural carbohydrase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of an aggregation attractant for Bothynoderes punctiventris Germ. raised several questions for possible improvements of IPM of Bothynoderes punctiventris in sugar beet. First results on exploration of possibilities {{for its use}} for monitoring purposes {{as well as for}} mass trapping of adults of the pest are described in this paper. Trap design effectiveness was evaluated in the overwintering fields of sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil</b> for two years in localities in Serbia and Hungary. Among trap designs tested it was proved that baited CSALOMON® TAL trap design was optimal...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} 2001 - 2004, {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the region of Bačka (northern Serbia) to assess the efficiency of insecticide treatment of sugar beet seeds in controlling soil pests (larvae of Elateridae family) and reducing the damage caused by <b>beet</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bothynoderes punctiventris G e r m) and flea beetle (Chaetocnema tibialis I l l i g). Several insecticides mostly systemic ones (carbofuran, thiamethoxam, fipronil, imidacloprid and clothianidin), and their combinations with pyrethroids in different doses were tested in field conditions. Stand density, percentages of plants damaged by B. punctiventris and C. tibialis, injury level and weight of juvenile plants served as parameters for evaluation of insecticide efficiency. Most of the insecticides applied to seeds provided a significantly better stand density compared with the untreated control. Because of their systemic action, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and their mixtures with pyrethroids provided very good protection of juvenile plants from C. tibialis and in some cases from B. punctiventris...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{insecticides}} monocrotophos, cypermethrin and their ready -made mixtures applied against sugar <b>beet</b> root <b>weevil</b> (B. punctiventris G e r m) adults at different temperatures were studied. The experiments {{were conducted in}} laboratory conditions at three different temperatures: 14, 20 and 25 °C. In 1996 and 1997, the adults used in experiments were collected in Bačka Topola fields with sugar beet as previous crop. The adults were exposed to insecticides by method of insecticide soaked blotting paper and fed with sugar beet cotyledons. The mortality of adults, depending on product was observed every half an hour, starting from 0. 5 up to 28 hrs of exposition. Applying probit analyses, ld-p and lt-p lines were constructed, which reflected the changes of toxity depending on insecticides and temperatures. According to position and slope (b) of ld-p lines in 1996, higher toxity of cypermethrin than of monocrotophos was found. The response was more homogeneous to cypermethrin than to monocrotophos. Ld-p lines for mixture run closer to ld-p line for cypermethrin independent of temperature. In 1997, at 14 °C and 25 °C, higher toxity of cypermethrin than of monocrotophos was observed, the effect of mixture was additive. No mortality was induced with monocrotophos at 20 °C. The reason could be in sugar <b>beet</b> root <b>weevil</b> population sensitivity decrease to monocrotophos in 1997, or the insects derived from two different populations exposed to different selection pressure (species, volume and exposition length to insecticides). Based on lt-p lines in both experimental years, it could be concluded that cypermethrin, independent of temperature had higher initial toxity than monocrotophos, the mixture achieved additive effect, except in 1996 at 20 °C where the effect was synergised compared to single component effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{the region}} of Vojvodina, sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bothynoderes punctiventris G e r m) is the most {{important}} sugar beet pest. Therefore, it would be of great practical benefit if we could establish some regularity in their population dynamics, if it exists and then organize the control of this pest more successfully. During the period of 1961 - 2004, in Vojvodina, the population density of B. punctiventris was monitored. The annual average of population density varied between 0 and 15 insects per square meter. Analyzing the obtained data it was noticed that there existed a certain periodicity of population outbreaks (maximal densities), approximately of 11 years. Regarding the fact that the solar activity, known as solar flux (observed at 2800 MHz) has a similar periodicity, a statistical processing in the paper of the collected data (periodograms, cross periodograms /real and imaginary ones/, cross densities, cross quadratures, cross amplitudes, squared coherencies as well as cross correlations) was carried out. Inter alia, it was concluded that the population outbreaks of B. punctiventris follows the maximal solar activity (known as solar flux on 2800 MHz), with a lag of seven years...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{mass-production}} and formulation {{technology of}} entomopathogenic nematodes, {{the discovery of}} numerous isolates/strains and the desirability of reducing pesticide usage {{have resulted in a}} surge of scientific and commercial interest in these nematodes. The lessons learned from earlier problems have encouraged scientists and leading commercial companies to increase their efforts toward improving cost efficiency and better product positioning in the market within the confines of product capabilities. The successes or failures of the nematodes against 24 arthropod pest species of agriculture and animals and against a major slug pest in agriculture are discussed in this review. Commercial successes are documented in markets such as citrus (Diaprepes root weevil), greenhouses and glasshouses (black vine weevil, fungus gnats, thrips, and certain borers), turf (white grubs, billbugs, and mole crickets), and mushrooms (sciarid flies). In addition, the successful commercialization of a nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) against slugs in agricultural systems is presented. Despite this progress, the reality is that nematode-based products have limited market share. Limited share is attributed to higher product cost compared to standard insecticides, low efficacy under unfavorable conditions, application timing and conditions, limited data and cost benefit in IPM programs, refrigeration requirements and limited room temperature shelf life (product quality), use of suboptimum nematode species, and lack of detail application directions. One or more of these factors affected the market introduction of the nematodes despite promising field efficacy against insects such as black cutworm in turf, sugar <b>beet</b> <b>weevil</b> in sugar beet, sweet potato weevil in sweet potato, and house fly adult in animal-rearing farms. Insects such as cabbage root maggots, carrot root weevil, and Colorado potato beetle are listed on the label of certain commercial products despite low efficacy data, due to insect susceptibility, biology, and/or behavior. To make entomopathogenic nematodes more successful, realistic strategies through genetic engineering, IPM programs, and new delivery systems and/or training programs to overcome their inherent cost, formulation instability, and limited field efficacy toward certain insects are neede...|$|E
