50|$|One of the {{problems}} with a significant number of technologies is that they are installed through a nozzle and are exposed to products. This can create several problems, especially when retrofitting new equipment to vessels that have already been stress relieved, as it may not be possible to fit the instrument at the location required. Also, as the measuring element is exposed to the contents within the vessel, it may either attack or coat the instrument causing it to fail in service. One of the most reliable methods for measuring level is using a Nuclear gauge, as it is installed outside the vessel and doesn't normally require a nozzle for <b>bulk</b> <b>level</b> measurement. The measuring element is installed outside the process and can be maintained in normal operation without taking a shutdown. Shutdown is only required for an accurate calibration.|$|E
50|$|Agitation, heat, special baffling, {{coalescing}} packs, and {{filtering materials}} {{can assist in}} the removal of nonsolution gas that otherwise may be retained in the oil because of the viscosity and surface tension of the oil. Gas can {{be removed from the}} top of the drum by virtue of being gas. Oil and water are separated by a baffle at the end of the separator, which is set at a height close to the oil-water contact, allowing oil to spill over onto the other side, while trapping water on the near side. The two fluids can then be piped out of the separator from their respective sides of the baffle. The produced water is then either injected back into the oil reservoir, disposed of, or treated. The <b>bulk</b> <b>level</b> (gas-liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel. Valves on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation. The smaller droplets of water will not settle by gravity and will remain in the oil stream. Normally the oil from the separator is routed to a coalescer to further reduce the water content.|$|E

40|$|It is {{relatively}} easier to measure experimentally viscoelastic properties of a material. However, when a hollow profile/structure {{is made of}} this material, it is not straightforward to predict the viscoelastic response of the cellular structure at the <b>bulk</b> <b>level.</b> This {{is because of the}} fact that the cellular material has two different length scales: one at the <b>bulk</b> <b>level</b> and another at the cell level, and hence, the cell level properties significantly affect the bulk behaviour. The aim of this study is to predict the stress relaxation characteristics of the cellular material at the macroscopic level in terms of the stress relaxation characteristics of the cell wall material i. e. at the cell level, topology and cell size. The primary interest is to investigate the out-of-plane viscoelastic properties of the core material. This is because when a sandwich panel is subjected to bending, the core carries primarily the major shear loading in its out-of-plane, whereas the skins carry the major flexural load. Honeycomb made of hexagons (of equal sides) is chosen as topology as it is the most common topology among the cellular cores...|$|E

On the <b>bulk</b> <b>level,</b> only a partial quenching of the fluorescence is observed, similarly to what is observed for other published switches and is supposed to be due to intermolecular interactions between oligonucleotide strands.

A small hybridization gap splits the degeneracy of the central n= 0 LL with dependence on the film thickness and the field strength that can be obtained analytically.

The degree of surface enrichment of both oil and sodium caseinate was found to increase with decreasing <b>bulk</b> <b>levels</b> of the respective components. Surface enrichment of oil was also affected by processing conditions (emulsion drop size and drying temperature), but surface enrichment of sodium caseinate was relatively insensitive to these.
