40|$|Generating {{realistic}} animations {{of passive}} dynamic {{systems such as}} rigid <b>bodies,</b> <b>cloth</b> and fluids is an important problem in computer graphics. Although several techniques for animating these phenomena have been developed, achieving the level of realism exhibited by objects {{in the real world}} has proved to be incredibly hard. We argue, therefore, that an effective method for increasing the realism of these types of computer animations is to infer the behavior of real phenomena from video. This thesis presents two techniques for using video to create realistic animations of phenomena such as rigid <b>bodies,</b> <b>cloth,</b> waterfalls, streams, smoke and fire. The first technique, inverse simulation, estimates the parameters of physical simulations from video. Physical simulation techniques are widely used in computer graphics to generate animations of passive phenomenon using physical laws and numerical integration techniques. The behavior of a physical simulator is governed by a set of parameters, typically specified by the animator. However, directly tuning the physical parameters of complex simulations like rigid <b>bodies</b> or <b>cloth</b> to achieve a desired motion is often cumbersome and nonintuitive. The inverse simulation framework uses optimization to automatically estimate the simulatio...|$|R

40|$|Deficient cloth-to-cloth {{collision}} {{response is}} the most serious shortcoming of most cloth simulation systems. Past approaches to clothcloth collision have used history to decide whether nearby cloth regions have interpenetrated. The biggest pitfall of history-based methods is that an error anywhere along the way can give rise to persistent tangles. This is a particularly serious issue for production character animation, because characters' bodies routinely selfintersect, for instance in the bend of an elbow or knee, or where the arm or hand rests against the <b>body.</b> <b>Cloth</b> that becomes pinched in these regions is often forced into jagged self-intersections that defeat history-based methods, leaving a tangled mess when the body parts separate. This paper describes a history-free cloth collision response algorithm based on global intersection analysis of cloth meshes at each simulation step. The algorithm resolves tangles that arise during pinching as soon as the surrounding geometry permits, and also resolves tangled initial conditions. The ability to untangle cloth after pinching is not sufficient, because standard clothsolid collision algorithms handle pinches so poorly that they often give rise to visible flutters and other simulation artifacts during the pinch. As a companion to the global intersection analysis method, we present a cloth-solid collision algorithm called collision flypapering, that eliminates these artifacts. The two algorithms presented have been used together extensively and successfully in a production animation environment...|$|E
40|$|This paper focuses upon {{means and}} {{ways in which}} {{knowledge}} gained through textile practice can be expressed using language and imagery drawn from within that practice itself. In this it draws upon écriture feminine to develop a matrix of knowledge upon and within which text and textile intertwine. Here cloth and stitch are considered as co-agents for a disorderly text that dissolves boundaries between theoretical and practice-based concerns through a process that Bracha Ettinger refers to as ‘borderswerving’ (Ettinger 2006). In this paper such disorderly text or working in and through <b>body,</b> <b>cloth</b> and stitch, will be addressed through three points for departure: folding, fraying and seaming. Folding offers a focus upon {{ways in which the}} communication of tacit knowledge within practice initiates and generates new understandings and expressions of that tacit knowledge. The concept of fraying or frayage will be considered in terms of breaking down resistance at the edge, enabling a porosity between practice-based and theoretical perspectives. Seaming will consider how the processes of making can act as agency for written and aural modes of communication. The material processes of seaming suggest a generative and communicative conceptual-material model. These three models offer a materialisation and matrixiation of Barthes ‘Text means Tissue’ (1973, p. 64), suggesting that the material activities of writing textile and making text are allied and intertwined modes of knowledge-generation. Such a disorderly text offers a space for tacit and communicable knowledge and meaning to mingle. Cited Texts Barthes, R., 1973. The Pleasure of the Text, New York: Hill and Wang. Ettinger, B., 2006.

By using "layering" techniques, one-sided interactions between different domains are easily produced.

Game physics applications are very compute and memory intensive. The ever growing quest for a high degree of realism requires more complex physics algorithms and also larger datasets. To meet the demands of game physics applications requires a computer architecture which can deliver high floating point performance and memory bandwidth. However, generalpurpose many-core architectures are quickly evolving to overcome these constraints. Larrabee is one such highly-threaded many-core architecture. It consists of an array of multiple IA Intel processor cores, each augmented with a 16 -wide vector processor unit. In this paper, we analyze several key game physics applications. We show how Larrabee’s extensive thread and data parallelism are well suited for a broad set of physics algorithms.

40|$|A {{variety of}} dynamic objects, such as faces, <b>bodies,</b> and <b>cloth,</b> are {{represented}} in computer graphics {{as a collection of}} moving spatial landmarks. Spatiotemporal data is inherent in a number of graphics applications including animation, simulation, and object and camera tracking. The principal modes of variation in the spatial geometry of objects are typically modeled using dimensionality reduction techniques, while concurrently, trajectory representations like splines and autoregressive models are widely used to exploit the temporal regularity of deformation. In this article, we present the bilinear spatiotemporal basis as a model that simultaneously exploits spatial and temporal regularity while maintaining the ability to generalize well to new sequences. This factorization allows the use of analytical, predefined functions to represent temporal variation (e. g., B-Splines or the Discrete Cosine Transform) resulting in efficient model representation and estimation. The model can be interpreted as representing the data as a linear combination of spatiotemporal sequences consisting of shape modes oscillating over time at key frequencies. We apply the bilinear model to natural spatiotemporal phenomena, including face, <b>body,</b> and <b>cloth</b> motion data, and compare I. Akhter and T. Simon contributed equally to this work...|$|R

We develop a light-weight interface so that the rigid <b>body</b> and <b>cloth</b> simulators communicate on a demand-driven manner to achieve two main goals: allow the rigid bodies to impart friction forces to the cloth and avoid unsolvable collision situations between the rigid <b>bodies</b> and the <b>cloth.</b> We demonstrate a set of basic manipulation skills including gripping, pinching, and press-ing, that are frequently seen in daily activities such as dressing and folding clothes...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{simulation}} {{techniques are}} widely used in computer graphics to produce realistic animations of complex natural phenomenon. The behavior of a physical simulator is governed {{by a set of}} parameters, typically specified by the animator. Tuning complex simulations, like rigid <b>bodies</b> and <b>cloth</b> is extremely laborious because of the large number of parameters that must be adjusted to achieve the desired motion. This proposal presents a set of techniques to create physically realistic animations from video. Our first technique uses optimization to estimate the simulation parameters from a video sequence of the real physical phenomenon. This framework has been applied to estimate the parameters of rigid <b>body</b> and <b>cloth</b> simulations from video using simple image features like silhouettes or local curvature measurements. Our optimization framework tunes the parameters of the simulation by minimizing the least square error between the features from simulation and video. This framework has produced compelling simulations of tumbling rigid bodies and fabrics (linen, satin, fleece and knit) that closely match their real-world footage. Our second technique is a video editing framework for creating animations of chaotic natural systems like fluids. Here, the goal is to create new animations by editing existing video footage. The proposed algorithm obtains velocity fields from the original footage and modifies them to satisfy a set of user specified flow constraints, while preserving the local statistics of the original velocity field. It then uses color from the original video to render the modified sequence in simulation. The velocity fields in the proposed editing framework can be defined in 2 D or 3 D, depending on the phenomenon that is being modelled. We have already implemented our framework for estimating the parameters of rigid <b>bodies</b> and <b>cloth</b> simulations from video. During the course of this thesis, we plan to implement the video editing framework and test it on several interesting video sequences of complex fluid motion with both stationary and transient temporal dynamics. ...|$|R
