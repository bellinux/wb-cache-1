This study aims to answer four (4) research questions: First, how the auditors understand the meaning of fair value in accounting measurements. Secondly, how auditors see the role of fair valuein increasingthe relevance ofaccounting information. Third, whether auditors face problems in the application of fair value. Fourth, potential solutions that can be offered to overcome the problems arising in the application offair value. This research used a fenomenology intepretif approach. The informants consisted of seven auditors accounting educators who work at Public Accounting firms in Semarang. Data obtained using deep and direct interviews and were analyzed using techniques of analysis suggested by Moustakas (1994). The results showed that all informants can explain how to estimate fair value. However, not all informants are able to understand the meaning of fair value in the context of fair value required by the IASB (IFRS 13). In addition, all informants recognized the importance of fair value in Indonesia. Secondly, all informants agreed that the use of fair value as a <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> infinancial reportingis believed to improvethe relevance offinancial reporting. Fair value is considered moreable to reflect the value of an assetorliability in accordance with the actual conditions. Third, there are problems that arised from the application of fair value as regards to the time difference between the date of the appraisal report and the cut-off date of the financial statements, audit reports pending, tax regulation, additional costs and difficulties in obtaining guidelines for the implementation of fair value.

40|$|The {{value of}} a share is given by the {{dividend}} discount model as a simple function of future dividends; but the actual determination of the share price is rarely based upon the direct estimation of these future dividends. A ranking <b>of</b> the <b>valuation</b> models used by analysts and fund managers shows a preference for 'unsophisticated' valuation using, for example, the dividend yield rather than the dividend discount model. This finding is shown to depend upon the practical difficulty of using currently-available information to forecast future cash flows. This difficulty limits the quantitative <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuations</b> to short forecast horizons, while the subjective, qualitative estimation of terminal value assumes great importance. Crucially, both analysts and fund managers use their own assessment of management quality to underpin the estimation of terminal value, {{on the basis that}} superior quality causes outperformance and that, whereas management quality can be assessed now, future performance itself is unobservable. Linked with this and with information asymmetry, valuation is a dynamic, company-specific process, focused on personal communication with management and embodying ongoing signalling and implicit contracting, using both dividends and other variables. This method <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> causes formal valuation models such as the dividend yield to play only a limited role. They offer a benchmark of relative price differences, which serves as a basis from which to conduct subjective, company-specific analysis and to make investment decisions; but valuation models are not used exclusively, in themselves, to value shares. ...|$|R

These two indicators represent a way of measuring impacts on natural resources, through the exploitation of mineral and metal resources. These indicators were chosen because of their ability to assess metal and mineral resource needs in two separate indicators but on the same <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation,</b> namely energy. Energy is in principle the share of energy that can be converted into work in relation to a defined reference surrounding. This is dependent on the chemical composition and the concentration. In this case, the indicator considers energy in the chemical conversion of the refining processes, i.e., the embodied energy of the refining processes. It is measured in the unit MJ-equivalent.

30|$|Economies {{are complex}} {{man-made}} systems where organisms and markets interact according to motivations and principles not entirely understood yet. The increasing {{dissatisfaction with the}} postulates of traditional economics i.e. perfectly rational agents interacting through efficient and stable markets, has created new incentives for different approaches in economics. For example, behavioral economics [1] builds on cognitive and emotional models of agents, neuroeconomics [2] addresses the neurobiological <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> of choices, and evolutionary economics [3] studies economies as a complex evolutionary system, composed of agents that adapt to endogenous patterns out of equilibrium regions. Social science, and in particular economics, is undergoing a decisive historical moment. A new approach in economic theory able to palliate the dissatisfaction with core tenets in classical economics is sorely needed. In what follows we briefly describe four problems—agent-economy separation, causality, equilibrium and perfectly rational maximizers- {{that need to be}} specifically addressed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{accruals}} anomaly using insider trading patterns {{to distinguish between}} the fixation and agency explanations. There is a strong negative relationship between the purchase ratio and accruals which is asymmetric with the magnitude of accruals increasing as selling increases. The asymmetry is consistent with the agency perspective where insiders sell overvalued equity prior to price correction. Tests of the relationship between valuation ratios, trading and accruals also support the agency hypothesis. The relationship between accruals and trading is only significant within the growth (low BM) firms. There is also evidence that value (high BM) firms manage their earnings upward compared to growth firms. When the overvalued and undervalued firms are isolated on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> and past growth measures, a strong negative relationship between trading and accruals arises for the overvalued group while there is no relationship between accruals and trading for the undervalued group...|$|E

Specifically, {{in the context of}} cognitive tasks offering monetary gains, improved behavioral performance has been repeatedly observed in conjunction with elevated neural activations in task-relevant perceptual, cognitive, and reward-related regions. We address the neural basis of motivation-cognition interactions by suggesting various modes of communication between relevant neural networks: (1) global hub regions may integrate information from multiple inputs providing a communicative link between specialized networks, (2) point-to-point interactions allow for more specific cross-network communication, and (3) diffuse neuromodulatory systems can relay motivational signals to cortex and enhance signal processing.

40|$|Issues {{relating}} to zakah on equity shares {{are far from}} being settled if one considers the available fatawa and observed practices in many Muslim countries. The most basic questions pertain to the correct method of valuation of equity shares {{for the purpose of}} estimation of zakah liability. This paper reviews alternative methods of valuation and argues in favour of marketbased valuation. It also raises serious questions on the permissibility of exemption of fixed assets from zakah liability in the accounting based framework, notwithstanding its actual use in some Muslim countries. A market-based valuation framework is rooted in the notion of market efficiency, which dominates modern finance theories for over a century. The paper seeks to push forward the concept of "average price" as the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> as also of estimating zakah liability. It argues that the concept not only follows logically from the efficient market theory, but also is backed by sound Shari'ah evidence. ...|$|E

This in turn implies severe restrictions on the incentive effects of the performance fee. In particular, the fee does not motivate the manager to use superior information for investment decisions concerning the managed portfolio. On the other hand, better incentives can only be generated under conditions which exclude market valuation. In this case, the analysis has to be based on expected utility valuation.
