40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} and calculates dual unipolar and bipolar coded {{configurations of}} spectral-amplitude-coding optical code {{division multiple access}} (SAC-OCDMA) systems by using simulation methods. The important feature of the SAC-OCDMA systems is that multiple access interference (MAI) can be eliminated by code sequences of a fixed in-phase cross-correlation value. This property can be effectively canceled multiple access interference by using balance detection schemes. This study uses Walsh-Hadamard codes as signature codes for the unipolar and bipolar schemes. The coder and decoder structures are based on optical filters of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). The simulation results of unipolar/bipolar coding structures are first presented by commercial simulation obtained using OptiSystem software. The simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) through use of the <b>bipolar</b> <b>coding</b> method is superior to the unipolar scheme, especially when the received effect power is large. When the system needs good performance to transmit multimedia data, we can use bipolar scheme in the network. If the users only transmit voice data, the unipolar method can be employed.

40|$|Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) {{is capable}} of {{providing}} future local area networks with higher connectivity, asynchronous multiple access and flexible bandwidth management. Much of the increased activity in this area has resulted from improvements in Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) fabrication technology driven mainly by the stringent requirements of DWDM. It is now possible to design and reliably fabricate superstructured fibre Bragg gratings (SSFBGs) with truly complex amplitude and phase responses [1], opening {{the possibility of using}} SSFBG components to perform fundamental OCDMA functions such as the coding and decoding of chip patterns described herein. In earlier work we demonstrated the generation of seven-chip, direct sequence, unipolar (amplitude) code OCDMA bits at 125 MHz using a SSFBG, and demonstrated optical pattern recognition using a matched SSFBG filter as a decoder [2]. In this paper we present results on upgrading the SSFBG approach to both far higher data rates (10 Gbit/s) and far shorter chip-lengths (6. 4 ps) with far higher grating reflectivity (up to 50 %) than previously demonstrated by fabricating bipolar (phase) coding and decoding SSFBGs using our continuous scanning technique. We present the results of BER measurements at 10 GBit/s on a decoded pulse sequence both before and after transmission through 25 km of standard fibre which show there to be no noise-penalty associated with the either the coding:decoding process, or due to transmission of the coded pulse itself. Our experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1 a and comprises a 10 Gbit/s, ~ 2 ps pulse transmitter (based on a regeneratively mode-locked, soliton fibre ring laser operating at 10 GHz), <b>bipolar</b> <b>coding</b> and decoding gratings, and an (optional) 25 km standard fibre transmission span which had its dispersion compensated with a chirped FBG. We fabricated seven-chip M-sequence, <b>bipolar</b> <b>coding</b> and decoding gratings. The total grating length in each instance was 4. 64 mm (corresponding to a temporal code length of 44. 8 µs) and the individual chip width was 0. 66 mm (corresponding to a chip length of 6. 4 ps). The bipolar grating design is shown inset in Fig. 1 a, and is a pure phase-encoded structure with discrete n phase shifts at the (NRZ) chip transition boundaries. The experimental and theoretical plots are shown in Fig. lb. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental spectral responses of the bipolar SSFBG is seen to be excellent, highlighting the precision of our grating writing process. The decoder grating is essentially identical to the encoder grating other than it has a spatially-reversed refractive index superstructure. Note that all of gratings used in these experiments (including the dispersion compensating FBG) were written by appropriate W exposure through the same, uniform period phase mask. Since the SSFBGs are relatively weak and within the Fourier theory grating design limit, the impulse response of the grating in the time domain is given by the superstructure modulation profile used to write the grating. We examined the intensity autocorrelation functions of the incident 2 ps pulses on reflection from the individual coding:decoding gratings, and found the profiles to be in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions as shown in Fig. 2 a. This includes the decoder response to the code after it has propagated over the 25 km dispersion-compensated transmission line, there is evidence of some correlation signal degradation, however the effects are slight, and in fact negligible in terms of overall system performance. The spectral response of the decoded signal is also compared to the theoretical plot as shown inset in Fig 2 a. BER measurements were taken on the code:decode process, both with and without the 25 km transmission. The results are summarised in Fig. 2 b where it is seen that no power penalty associated with code-decode process is observed in either instance. Eye diagrams for both the simple code:decode and transmitted code:decode case are shown inset within Fig. 2 b. No evidence of temporal features away from the main, chip-length long, correlation peak is observed as expected. In conclusion we have demonstrated high-quality, 10 Gbit/s bipolar OCDMA coding and decoding using superstructured FBGs with a code chip rate of 160 Gbit/s. Error-free operation with no power penalty was obtained for the coding:decoding process after propagation of the code through 25 km of fibre. These results highlight the precision and flexibility of our particular grating writing process and point to further applications of SSFBGs in future high-speed optical networks. For example our results demonstrate the possibility of using SSFBGs for header recognition in 160 Gbit/s OTDM based networks. Fig 1 (a) Experimental set up.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis explores avenues to efficiently use code-division as the multiple-access technique in optical communication systems. Coding in the time domain is first considered. Novel architectures that allow the use of <b>bipolar</b> <b>codes</b> with simple direct detection receivers are first presented, for the case of coherent optical sources. We show that a proper combination of electro-optic elements and all optical processing elements leads to encoder and decoder complexities much reduced compared to the all optical solutions, without sacrificing the chip rate. This is further enhanced when we propose the use of Kronecker sequences whose inner sequences are chosen to be perfect autocorrelation sequences. In that case, even programmability of the delay lines is not required. We then modify the proposed architecture {{so that they can}} be used with incoherent optical sources. Although the sources can only be modulated in power, we show that still <b>bipolar</b> <b>codes</b> can be used and maintain their properties. A detailed performance analysis of the proposed architectures is made, including multiple-access interference, shot noise and thermal noise. Two types of modulation: amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) and orthogonal coding (OC) are considered. Results presented give the probability of bit error as a function of the number of simultaneous users, for many code lengths values. Performances obtained using different combinations of inner and outer sequences are compared, and requirements in terms of number of delay lines and bandwidth of electro-optic elements are identified. The effect of partial cross-correlation due to non optimized optical filtering is studied by means of an upper bound on the probability of bit error. A new analytical technique is derived to analyze optical CDMA systems using coherent optical sources with direct detection. A new and highly efficient coding technique based on amplitude spectral encoding of incoherent optical sources such as light-emitting diodes is then proposed. This is one of the major contributions of this thesis. Architectures for the encoder and decoder are given, and suitable codes are identified. The proposed system is insensitive to near-far effects and has a spreading gain independent of the bit rate. This property makes this coding technique a suitable one for networks serving users with different bit rates requirements. Detailed evaluation of the probability of error is done, and practical considerations such as the spectral shape of the sources, finite extinction ratio of the amplitude mask as well as its programmability speed are quantified. We show that more than 100 simultaneous users can be accommodated with a probability of error of 10 - 9, for a code length as small as 127.

Thus, FBGs can be used for applications involving coherent control of short or ultrashort pulses, such as pattern generation and pulse shaping at high speeds. Key benefits offered by this filtering approach are full integration with fiberised systems, and precise control of the amplitude and phase of the filter responses. Due to their coherence properties, superstructured FBGs are monolithic devices, and consequently their operation does not require any external configurations (e. g. adjustable delay lines, etc.).

30|$|In this paper, {{the issue}} of {{synchronization}} in time-hopping IR-UWB systems employing pulse shape modulation is addressed and two low-complexity algorithms are compared. The first algorithm exploits a judiciously designed signal format to enable synchronization using simple overlap-add operation followed by energy detection. This algorithm is particularly interesting for systems using high-order orthogonal PSM modulation. On the other hand, the modified signal format results {{in the loss of}} one frame per symbol, so an alternate algorithm is proposed to avoid this small data loss. Exploiting impulsive autocorrelation function of <b>bipolar</b> <b>codes,</b> we develop a synchronization criterion using a series of code matching, overlap-add and energy detection operations. Based on this criterion, a new low-complexity NDA synchronization algorithm is then proposed. Code matching and averaging greatly suppress the interference and noise, resulting in an improved performance. Both the proposed algorithms remain functional in the presence of TH codes, unknown channel, and distortion due to Tx/Rx antennas. Simulation results confirm precise synchronization of the two algorithms and their robustness in the presence of IFI and MUI. Furthermore, a new low-complexity demodulation scheme was also derived using synchronized aggregate templates. This receiver bypasses the cumbersome task of channel estimation and can collect the full multipath energy. Also, it inherently captures the pulse distortion caused by antennas and other receiver effects. Results show that it can achieve performance comparable to the widely adopted Rake in medium-to-high SNR range. In the future, we plan to investigate synchronization performance in the presence of severe IFI and ISI. Also, the large search space due to fine timing resolution of UWB systems leads to an increased synchronization time. Thus, {{it would be interesting to}} investigate rapid synchronization schemes for UWB. Additionally, the analytic performance analysis of SAT receiver is necessary to conclude on its advantages and drawbacks compared to conventional Rake.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} theoretical and experimental aspects of code-division multiple access (CDMA) {{communication in the}} incoherent, or direct detection, optical domain. We develop new modulation and detection principles that permit all-optical implementation of the bipolar, + 1 /$-$ 1, code and correlation detection available in the radio frequency (RF) CDMA systems. This is possible {{in spite of the}} non-negative, or unipolar, + 1 / 0, nature of the incoherent optical system that only detects and processes the signal intensity. The unipolar optical system using the new principles is equivalent to the bipolar RF system in that the correlation properties of the codes are completely preserved. The optical CDMA system can be realized either in time or frequency domain encoding with all-optical components. All-optical implementation is extremely important in practice because the symbol rates of the individual users are far less than the bandwidth of the optical fiber. Frequency domain or spectral amplitude encoding significantly increases the number of available codewords that can be assigned to the subscribers, and is the focus of this work. The spectral amplitude encoding uses incoherent, broad bandwidth superfluorescent fiber source (SFS) that has the limiting signal-to-noise ratio characteristics associated with thermal light. Measurements of the photodetector illuminated by an erbium-doped SFS confirm that the noise distribution follows a negative binomial probability mass function as predicted for the photoelectron counting statistics of thermal light. The analysis based on this statistical model results in improved performance over the Gaussian assumption, which predicts a performance floor. The analysis also shows that optical CDMA system, even with the use of orthogonal codes, is interference limited. We implement an experimental prototype system that demonstrates the first use of <b>bipolar</b> <b>codes</b> for spectral amplitude CDMA. The experimental results validate the modulation and detection principles and demonstrate the feasibility of optical CDMA systems based on those principles...|$|R
