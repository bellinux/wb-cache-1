5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (<b>but</b> <b>see</b> below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} thought that {{competition}} with early bird species might {{have resulted in}} the extinction of many of the pterosaurs. By the end of the Cretaceous, only large species of pterosaurs are known (<b>but</b> <b>see</b> below). The smaller species were thought to have become extinct, their niche filled by birds. However, pterosaur decline (if actually present) seems unrelated to bird diversity, as ecological overlap between the two groups appears to be minimal. At the end of the Cretaceous period, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and most avian dinosaurs as well, and many other animals, seems also to have taken the pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, 300,000 men {{had signed}} up to fight, and another 450,000 had joined-up {{by the end of}} September. Recruitment {{remained}} fairly steady through 1914 and early 1915, but it fell dramatically during the later years, especially after the Somme campaign, which resulted in 360,000 casualties. A prominent feature of the early months of volunteering was the formation of Pals battalions. Many of these pals who had lived and worked together, joined up and trained together and were allocated to the same units. The policy of drawing recruits from amongst the local population ensured that, when the Pals battalions suffered casualties, whole towns, villages, neighbourhoods and communities back in Britain were to suffer disproportionate losses. With the introduction of conscription in January 1916, no further Pals battalions were raised. Conscription for single men was introduced in January 1916. Four months later, in May 1916, it was extended to all men aged 18 to 41. The Military Service Act 1916 specified that men from the ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service in the army, unless they were married (or widowed with children), or served in {{one of a number of}} reserved occupations, which were usually industrial but which also included clergymen and teachers. This legislation did not apply to Ireland, despite its then status as part of the United Kingdom (<b>but</b> <b>see</b> Conscription Crisis of 1918). By January 1916, when conscription was introduced, 2.6 million men had volunteered for service, a further 2.3 million were conscripted before the end of the war; by the end of 1918, the army had reached its peak strength of four million men.|$|E

25|$|A {{term with}} no indeterminates and a {{polynomial}} with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a constant term and a constant polynomial. The degree of a constant term {{and of a}} nonzero constant polynomial is 0. The degree of the zero polynomial, 0, (which has no terms at all) is generally treated as not defined (<b>but</b> <b>see</b> below).|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} sound in fluids {{differs from the}} physics of sound in solids, {{although}} both are density waves: sound waves in fluids only have longitudinal components, whereas sound waves in solids have longitudinal and transverse components. This is because fluids can't support shear stresses (<b>but</b> <b>see</b> viscoelastic fluids, which only apply to high frequencies).|$|E

25|$|The word jury {{derives from}} Anglo-Norman juré ("sworn"). Juries are {{most common in}} common law adversarial-system jurisdictions. In the modern system, juries act as triers of fact, while judges act as triers of law (<b>but</b> <b>see</b> nullification). A trial without a jury (in which both {{questions}} of fact and questions of law are decided by a judge) {{is known as a}} bench trial.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} known {{sufficient}} {{conditions for the}} Fourier series of a function to converge at a given point x, for example if the function is differentiable at x.
