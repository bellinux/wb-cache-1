40|$|On 23 December 1994, Gordon Brown and I {{were walking}} the North Platte River below Keystone Dam {{as part of}} the Lake McConaughy Christmas Bird Count (CBC). At {{approximately}} 8 : 30 a. m. MST, about 0. 5 mi below the dam, we observed a group of 8 Killdeer and a smaller shorebird, which we immediately recognized as a 2 ̆ 2 peep. 2 ̆ 2 We studied the bird for about 30 minutes at distances as close as 40 feet and then returned in the afternoon to photograph it. The size and black legs immediately eliminated Least Sandpiper, and the dark rump eliminated White-rumped Sandpiper. The remaining possibilities were semipalmated, western, and Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> or the remote possibility of something like a stint. The bill was straight, thin, and pointed, very unlike the bill of a Semipalmated. Additionally, the bird had a very elongate body shape like a Baird 2 ̆ 7 s and unlike either Semipalmated or Western. This and other features led us to conclude that it was a Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Calidris bairdii). The following is {{a detailed description of the}} bird. Its size was about half that of a Killdeer, though it was proportionally slimmer and longer-winged. The slender shape was accentuated by the short legs, and by wingtips that extended beyond the tail tip. The bill was black, straight, and thin, pointed at the tip. The throat was white, neatly separated from the buff-colored breast. The crown, face, and upper breast were buff-colored. There were no obvious darker streaks on the breast. The lower belly and undertail were white. A clear line separated the buff upper breast from the white underparts, like that of a Pectoral Sandpiper. The supercilium was faintly white and most visible when looking at the bird head-on. The mantle was uniformly gray-brown, lacking pale feather edgings. The scapulars were paler and appeared worn. The upperwing on the perched bird was uniformly dark brown, except that the outer two primaries (and possibly the third) were worn, and appeared pale brown and tattered near the tips. We were unable to ascertain the amount of wear on the inner primaries. The legs were short and jet black. The bird vocalized several times when flushed, uttering a high-pitched 2 ̆ 2 kreep, 2 ̆ 2 short and abrupt. The call seemed shorter and higher-pitched than that of a Pectoral Sandpiper, and was immediately recognizable as the call note of a Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpiper...</b>|$|R

40|$|I wish {{to remind}} {{observers}} to report dates of breeding evidence, such as nests with eggs and adults feeding fledglings. There is surprisingly little known {{about these things}} for Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s breeding birds, even the common ones. Please report these regardless of the season! This summer produced many interesting sightings; we 2 ̆ 7 ll lead off with significant breeding records: Snowy Plover provided a 2 nd state breeding record; Black-necked Stilt a first for Keith Co; Acadian Flycatcher first for Thurston Co; Summer Tanager first for Otoe Co; and Eurasian Collared-Dove 3 rd nesting locality, at Elmwood. Late spring migrants included a record late Tennessee Warbler and a 2 nd latest Hudsonian Godwit and Stilt Sandpiper.

40|$|First of all, I want {{to thank}} Joel Jorgensen for helping write these reports {{for the last few}} years. Joel has decided to spend his limited free time on Records Committee matters; he is {{currently}} Chairman. Over the last few years, Joel has made significant contributions to Nebraska ornithology, particularly through his! meticulous counts of shorebirds in the Rainwater Basin. This season proved interesting in terms of ranges of breeding birds, as discussed in the accounts. See, for example, Little Blue Heron, the dOWitchers. Black-billed Magpie, White-breasted Nuthatch, Sedge Wren, and the towhees. There seems to be an increasing number of 2 ̆ 2 displaced 2 ̆ 2 birds, either early or late 2 ̆ 7 migrants or birds just in the wrong places. Could this situation result from an increasingly unstable atmosphere? Very late in spring were Hudsonian Godwit and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, while very early in fall were Willet, Semipalmated Sandpiper. and Orange-crowned Warbler. Birds in the wrong places were numerous, but significant were a 2 ̆ 2 small race 2 ̆ 2 Canada Goose, ducks such as American Wigeon. Green-winged Teal, Bufflehead, and Common Goldeneye, Mississippi Kite away from Ogallala, adult Golden Eagle eastward, adult American Golden-Plover in July. westerly Least Terns, northerly Acadian Flycatcher, singing mid-June Blue-winged Warblers, Yellow-breasted Chats in Harlan Co, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow in the RWB. Interesting breeding or possible breeding records involved Eurasian Collared Dove 2 ̆ 7 s 2 nd breeding location, Long-eared Owl, Pileated Woodpecker, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire, and MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler. 2 ̆ 2 Good birds 2 ̆ 2 were King Rail, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpecker, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Hooded Warbler, and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, and, best till last, the White Ibis, only the state 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd report, but first with extant documentation. Finally, where were the Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpipers?</b> When was the last time only one was reported for the early fall? Presumably the adults went elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|First, some {{housekeeping}} is in order.... You {{will also}} notice {{the new order}} of species (AGAIN!!), reflecting the latest American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Checklist, published this spring. The most noticeable change concerns the placement of shrikes and vireos between flycatchers and corvids; but the order of species within some genera also differs, especially among the waterfowl, where, for instance, swans now follow the geese. And now let 2 ̆ 7 s turn to the birds! As in most summers, many species went about their business in routine fashion, hence the notation 2 ̆ 2 Routine Reports 2 ̆ 2 for many. We encourage observers to note and to forward evidence of breeding for all species, including dates for nests, eggs, and young. These data help us document changing patterns for various species. Interesting developments this summer in terms of breeding populations include {{the expansion of the}} Eurasian Collared-Dove 2 ̆ 2 colony 2 ̆ 2 at the Newcomb residence in Kearney; the continued presence of an outlying population of Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widow at Morse Bluff; further evidence of the northward spread of Acadian Flycatcher in the Missouri Valley; expansion of the Cordilleran Flycatcher population in the western Pine Ridge; continuation of the outlying Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebe group in Dixon Co; an increased population of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher in the Panhandle, and expansion (probably temporary) of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow into the southwest Sandhills. In addition, three species of shorebirds arrived early: Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpiper,</b> Greater Yellowlegs, and Buff-breasted Sandpiper. A noticeable number of warblers also migrated late, including Orange-crowned and Nashville (both 2 nd latest ever), Blackpoll, Black-and-white (possibly breeding), and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s. While few rarities reached us, those that did were of interest: the 3 rd documented White-winged Dove at Dove City (Kearney), and the 3 rd record Cave Swallow [...] all banded by Charles Brown in the Keith Co area [...] as well as a Laughing Gull at Keystone L, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s 8 th documented record...|$|R
40|$|This {{fall season}} was amazing, or as Stephen Dinsmore put it: 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 The birding was simply {{spectacular}} in western Nebraska this fall, 2 ̆ 2 There was something for everyone, whether rarity-chasers, taxonomists, listers, or whatever. There were {{no fewer than}} four new species for the state list (pending NOURC approval, of course!), a total of 315 species reported, and fascinating information on western subspecies in the Panhandle. Numbers of western migrants reached record levels, exemplified by fall totals of 53 Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, 25 MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and 28 Western Tanagers. By contrast, eastern migrant warblers in the east were almost non-existent. At L McConaughy, the exposed flats at {{the west end of}} the reservoir attracted myriads of shorebirds and waterbirds, including record fall counts of Western Grebe (44, 000 !), Green-winged Teal, and a near-record count of Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sandpipers.</b> Several species also had new fall high counts, notably Cliff Swallow (30, 000 !) and Blue-winged Teal (14, 500 !). Stephen Dinsmore 2 ̆ 7 s diligent coverage of the Panhandle yielded no fewer than four first state records: Reddish Egret, Arctic Tern, Dusky Flycatcher (using mist-nettting, photography, and measurements!), and Black Rosy-Finch. The state total now stands at a healthy 445 species. There was also a host of significant distributional or seasonal reports, notably a first western White-eyed Vireo, first Panhandle documented Eastern Wood-Pewee, a first August-September Pacific Loon, a first August Red-breasted Merganser, a first fall record for Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, and a second fall Hudsonian Godwit for the state. Not to mention all three jaegers! Sparrows were in mediocre numbers, with not much of interest in that group. Of concern are the few reports of Black-billed Cuckoo in recent years; only two were reported this fall. Despite the total of 315 species reported, no fewer than 17 species of regular, though generally rare, occurrence were not found. Most surprising among these were American Black Duck, American Woodcock, Broad-tailed Hummingbird, Veery, Wood Thrush, Northern Parula, Magnolia Warbler, Yellow-throated Warbler, Prothonotary Warbler, and Summer Tanager. Many of the missed species either depart early in fall or become inconspicuous. Were their breeding seasons unsuccessful...|$|R
50|$|Following the split, {{additional}} confusion existed {{over the}} correct scientific name for present species. The name Sporophila aurita (<b>Bonaparte,</b> 1850) predates <b>S.</b> corvina by 10 years, and was {{widely believed to}} be the correct scientific name. However, the type for S. aurita has since disappeared and the original description was very vague, making it impossible to judge which population the name refers to. The name therefore becomes invalid, instead leading to S. corvina being the correct name.|$|R
40|$|Sea-Level Predictions. We predict {{relative}} sea-level (RSL) {{change at}} Barbados, New Guinea, Tahiti, Sunda Shelf and <b>Bonaparte</b> Gulf (Fig. <b>S</b> 1) using a state-of-the-art theory that incorporates time varying shoreline geometry and the feedback of rotation onto sea level (1). The calculations are performed using the pseudo-spectral algorithm described in (1), with a truncation at spherical harmonic degree and order 256. The predictions are generated using an ice model adapted from (2) {{to include a}} realistic glaciation phase {{while at the same}} time retaining the excellent fits to post-LGM RSL curves obtained in that earlier study. Our ice model assumes that LGM begins at 26 ka, and it is characterized by a peak eustatic sea level fall of ~ 130 m over the LGM period. The Earth model used in the calculations is the preferred model of (2); it includes an elastic lithosphere of 95 km, upper mantle viscosity of 5 x 1020 Pa s, and lower mantle viscosity of 4 x 1022 Pa s. Our predictions highlight the important point that GIA will introduce a spatially varying component into post-glacial sea-level change, and the difference in the predictions at Barbados versus the other sites reflects an interesting aspect of the physics of GIA. At sites within the far-field of the late Pleistocene ice sheets during a period of relative ice sheet stability (e. g., th...|$|R
