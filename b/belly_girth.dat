5000|$|The Duke of Wellington and Copenhagen {{were the}} subject of a [...] "colossal" [...] bronze statue {{designed}} by Matthew Cotes Wyatt and his son James. Construction of the statue began in 1840, four years after Copenhagen's death, and lasted until 1843. The 40 t, 8 m and 9 m statue was unveiled on 28 September 1846 with much fanfare and was hoisted into a prominent position on top of the Triumphal Arch, then located a short distance from the Duke's London residence, Apsley House, on Hyde Park Corner. Copenhagen's <b>belly</b> had a <b>girth</b> of 22 feet and eight inches and the section was used to host a [...] "celebratory dinner" [...] for Wyatt before the work was completed, and a [...] "rider on horseback could readily pass under Copenhagen's torso without danger of scraping his beaver hat." [...] The portrayal was generally ridiculed in the press and by the public with a French spectator to the unveiling reportedly saying, [...] "We have been avenged!" [...] A young soldier reportedly said Wyatt's statue was [...] "warning ambitious young officers of the fate that awaits them if ever they are so unfortunate as to achieve greatness." [...] The statue was viewable from Apsley House and remained at the Hyde Park location {{for the remainder of the}} Duke's life.|$|R

5000|$|A 2007 {{study shows}} Germany {{has the highest}} number of {{overweight}} people in Europe. However, the United Kingdom, Greece and certain countries in Eastern Europe have a higher rate of [...] "truly obese" [...] people. In 2007, The German obesity rate was considered at the same level as with the American obesity rate. In Germany, 60% of men and 43% of women are considered overweight while in France, 38.5% of men and 26% of women are considered overweight. Germans are considered thinner than people in the United Kingdom. The obesity level in Germany is in the middle compared to other European countries. Out of 44 countries, Germany is ranked 39th for women and 42nd for men for cholesterol levels. The waist of female Germans between the ages of 14 and 70 grew by 4.1 centimetres thicker between 1994 and 2009. The <b>belly</b> <b>girth</b> of men between 16 and 70 grew by 4.4 centimetres between 1980 and 2009.|$|E
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study. The {{prevalence of obesity}} in companion animals, including horses and ponies has risen drastically {{in recent years and}} risk factors have been little investigated. Horses are unique amongst companion animals in that many are outdoor-living and forage independently on pasture; they also have a dual utility and companionship role. The body condition of wild and free-living equines is known to vary seasonally, yet previous estimates of the prevalence of obesity and associated risk factors in domestic animals do not consider this. Most previous studies were conducted during the summer months when pasture quality is greater and obesity prevalence is likely to be highest. In addition, many previous estimates do not use validated body condition scoring methods and rely on owner reporting. Objectives. To examine the prevalence and risk factors predictive of equine obesity at both the end of winter and the end of summer, in a domestic population of leisure horses with daily access to pasture. Using validated body condition scoring methods and a single, trained observer. Methods. Body condition and <b>belly</b> <b>girth</b> measurements were taken at the end of winter and during the summer in a population of leisure horses (n = 96) with outdoor pasture access for ≥ 6 h per day. Risk factor information was obtained by two owner questionnaires and analysed statistically using a mixed effects logistic regression model. The dependent variable was obese (BCS ≥ 7 / 9) or non-obese (BCS < 7 / 9). Risk factors associated with seasonal change in <b>belly</b> <b>girth</b> were also explored using a mixed effects linear regression model. Results. Obesity prevalence rose significantly from 27. 08 % at the end of winter to 35. 41 % during summer (p < 0. 001). Breed was the risk factor most strongly associated with obesity (p < 0. 001). Supplementary feed was not a strong predictor and there was no association with low intensity structured exercise. As winter BCS increased, the percentage seasonal change in <b>belly</b> <b>girth</b> decreased. Conclusions. Obesity prevalence differed between winter and summer in domestic equines. Supplementary feed and low intensity structured exercise in equines living outdoors for ≥ 6 h per day had limited or no effect on obesity levels. Seasonal variation in body condition was lower in obese equines. Potential relevance. It is important to consider season when studying equine obesity and obesity-associated disorders. Risk factor analysis suggests preventative measures may need to be breed specific. The metabolic implications of a lessened seasonal change in body condition in obese animals, warrants investigation...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{percent of}} American women are obese and {{at risk for}} type II diabetes, {{impaired}} immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether obesity induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~ 4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~ 2000 kcal/pig/day) diet {{for a total of}} 9 estrous cycles (~ 6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and <b>belly</b> <b>girth</b> but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL- 1 β, TNF-α, IL- 4, IL- 10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of vaccenic acid. Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of obesity and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Dairy calves in the U. K. are {{currently}} reared on ‘least cost’ principles, with minimal milk feeding and early weaning to solid foods. This {{has been described}} as maintaining the calf in ‘a state of chronic hunger’. As well as repercussions on calf health, growth and welfare, human studies suggest that underfeeding the newborn is a major risk factor for metabolic disease in the adult. The aims of this study were to determine current dairy calf rearing practices across the U. K., to investigate the performance of Holstein heifer calves fed increased milk replacer (MR) compared to restricted volumes, and to determine the impact of this on key performance indicators (KPIs) of these animals as calves and growing heifers. A postal questionnaire was offered to one thousand U. K. dairy farmers to determine current calf rearing practices. The response rate was 72 % and revealed that housing and feeding practices were variable between farms. The majority of farmers (93 %) fed restricted volumes of milk or milk replacer to their pre-weaned calves. The body weight, withers and loin height, heart and <b>belly</b> <b>girth,</b> crown to rump length, hock-fetlock length and body condition score (BCS) were recorded weekly from birth to 12 weeks and monthly from 12 weeks until conception in two groups of Holstein heifer calves on one commercial dairy farm in the north-west of England, U. K. Calves were assigned to a restricted, Group R (n = 50) or ad libitum, Group A (n = 50) MR feeding strategy from birth until weaning. Growth rates were greater for Group A (0. 72 kg/day) from birth until 3 weeks than Group R (0. 17 kg/day). Body condition score increased for Group A during this period (0. 1 points) while it decreased for Group R (0. 3 points). Thereafter, growth rates were similar between dietary groups although no catch-up growth was observed for Group R animals. Changes in morphometric measures were greater for Group A calves than Group R from birth to 12 weeks. From 12 weeks of age onwards, dietary group differences in morphometric measures disappeared but body weight differences remained until conception. The glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity of a subset of heifer calves (n = 6 Group A, n = 6 Group R) was investigated at 3, 12 and 39 weeks of age and was shown not to be affected by dietary group. The carcass composition of Holstein bull calves assigned to one of the two dietary groups was assessed. Calves were studied at birth (n = 3), 3 weeks, 9 weeks or 12 weeks (n = 3 per dietary group at each age). Carcass composition was assessed using spiral CT technologies. Group A calves had greater internal adipose deposition at all ages but {{there was no difference in}} carcass associated adipose tissue. The age at puberty, first service and conception was between 2 and 3 weeks lower for Group A animals than for Group R. Increased MR feeding of Holstein heifers allows for greater growth rates and earlier entry into the milking herd...|$|E
