40|$|The phase {{junction}} of nanocomposite materials {{is key to}} enhanced performance but is largely ignored in recent theoretical examinations of photocatalytic interactions in titania-based composites. Computational advances now allow more precise modeling of the electronic and optical properties of composites, and focusing on mixed-phase TiO 2 as a model, we use density functional theory (DFT) to interrogate the essential structural feature, namely, the rutile anatase interface, {{and its relationship to}} photogenerated charge localization, bulk <b>band</b> <b>alignments,</b> and defect formation. The interfacial region is disordered and distinct from rutile and anatase and contains low coordinated Ti sites and oxygen vacancies, both drivers of charge localization. The relaxations of the interface upon formation of excited electrons and holes determine the final location of charges which cannot always be predicted from bulk <b>band</b> <b>alignments.</b> A detailed understanding of the interfacial phase junction lays the foundation for directed synthesis of highly active and efficient composite photocatalysts...|$|R

50|$|Band bending {{models in}} {{solid-state}} electronics: The {{behavior of a}} solid-state device {{is strongly dependent on}} the size of various Schottky barriers and band offsets in the junctions of differing materials, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Some commonly used heuristic approaches to predict the <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> between materials, such as Anderson's rule and the Schottky-Mott rule, are based on the thought experiment of two materials coming together in vacuum, such that the surfaces charge up and adjust their work functions to become equal just before contact. In reality these work function heuristics are inaccurate due to their neglect of numerous microscopic effects. However. they provide a convenient estimate until the true value can be determined by experiment.|$|E
50|$|Replacing {{the silicon}} dioxide gate {{dielectric}} with another material adds complexity to the manufacturing process. Silicon dioxide can be formed by oxidizing the underlying silicon, ensuring a uniform, conformal oxide and high interface quality. As a consequence, development efforts {{have focused on}} finding a material with a requisitely high dielectric constant {{that can be easily}} integrated into a manufacturing process. Other key considerations include <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> to silicon (which may alter leakage current), film morphology, thermal stability, maintenance of a high mobility of charge carriers in the channel and minimization of electrical defects in the film/interface. Materials which have received considerable attention are hafnium silicate, zirconium silicate, hafnium dioxide and zirconium dioxide, typically deposited using atomic layer deposition.|$|E

30|$|Different <b>band</b> <b>alignments</b> {{result in}} a variety of charge {{transport}} characteristics accompanied by the process of energy transfer. On the one hand, the single-particle transportation, including interlayer tunneling effect and charge trapping phenomena, has been widely reported and novel devices based on those transportation mechanisms have been fabricated that exhibit low energy-assumption with high performance; on the other hand, the many-body transport and the separation of electron–hole pairs in 2 D heterostructures have also been theoretically predicted and practically demonstrated [11], which enable the prospect of broad applications in optoelectronic field [46, 47, 48, 49, 50].|$|R
5000|$|In each cascade stage, {{the thin}} InAs layers act as {{confined}} quantum well (QW) layers for electrons and barriers for holes. The GaSb (or GaInSb) layers conversely act as QWs for holes and barriers for electrons, while the AlSb layers serve as barriers for both electrons and holes. The key feature {{that enables the}} realization of cascading within an interband diode is the so-called [...] "type-II", or broken-gap, <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> between InAs and GaSb. Whereas in the more usual class of type-I QWs both the electrons and holes are confined within the same material layer, the InAs-GaSb system is type-II because the conduction band minimum of InAs lies at a lower energy than the valence band maximum of GaSb. This less common arrangement {{makes it easy to}} re-inject electrons from the valence band of one stage of the ICL into the conduction band of the next stage via simple elastic scattering.|$|E
40|$|Titanium dioxide {{materials}} {{have been studied}} intensively and extensively due to photocatalytic applications. A long-standing open question is the energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> of rutile and anatase TiO 2 phases, which can affect the photocatalytic process in the composite system. There are basically two contradictory viewpoints about the alignment of these two TiO 2 phases supported by respective experiments: 1) straddling type and 2) staggered type. In this work, our DFT plus U calculations find that the perfect rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces have the straddling type <b>band</b> <b>alignment,</b> whereas the surfaces with defects can turn the <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> into the staggered type. The electric dipoles induced by defects {{are responsible for the}} reversal of <b>band</b> <b>alignment.</b> Thus the defects introduced during preparations and post-treatment processes of materials are probably the answer to above open question regarding the <b>band</b> <b>alignment,</b> which can be considered in real practice to tune the photocatalytic activity of materials.

40|$|Here {{we report}} about the {{interface}} reconstruction in the recently discovered superconducting artificial superlattices based on insulating CaCuO 2 and SrTiO 3 blocks. Hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the valence <b>bands</b> <b>alignment</b> prevents any electronic reconstruction by direct charge transfer between the two blocks. We demonstrate that the electrostatic built-in potential is suppressed by oxygen redistribution in the alkaline earth interface planes. By using highly oxidizing growth conditions, the oxygen coordination in the reconstructed interfaces may be increased, resulting in the hole doping of the cuprate block and thus in the appearance of superconductivity.

40|$|The energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> at {{interfaces}} {{between different}} materials {{is a key}} factor, which determines the function of electronic devices. While the energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> of conventional semiconductors is quite well understood, systematic experimental studies on oxides are still missing. This work presents an extensive study on the intrinsic energy <b>band</b> <b>alignment</b> {{of a wide range}} of functional oxides using photoelectron spectroscopy with in-situ sample preparation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The growth, {{structural}} and optical properties, and energy <b>band</b> <b>alignments</b> of tensile-strained germanium (ε-Ge) epilayers heterogeneously integrated on silicon (Si) were demonstrated {{for the first}} time. The tunable ε-Ge thin films were achieved using a composite linearly graded InxGa 1 −xAs/GaAs buffer architecture grown via solid source molecular beam epitaxy. High-resolution X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopic analysis confirmed a pseudomorphic ε-Ge epitaxy whereby the degree of strain varied {{as a function of}} the InxGa 1 −xAs buffer indium alloy composition. Sharp heterointerfaces between each ε-Ge epilayer and the respective InxGa 1 −xAs strain template were confirmed by detailed strain analysis using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Low-temperature microphotoluminescence measurements confirmed both direct and indirect bandgap radiative recombination between the Γ and L valleys of Ge to the light-hole valence band, with L-lh bandgaps of 0. 68 and 0. 65 eV demonstrated for the 0. 82 ± 0. 06 % and 1. 11 ± 0. 03 % strained Ge on Si, respectively.
