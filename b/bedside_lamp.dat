60|$|The Innocents, the conquering babes in the wood, put out all {{the lights}} except the <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> on the table between their twin beds. These aristocratic beds were close enough {{together}} {{so that they could}} lie with their out-stretched hands clasped. They had left the door into the living-room open, and the low lights from the coals in the fireplace made a path across the polished floor and the new rugs--a vista of spaciousness and content.|$|E
60|$|Old Grammont as he {{appeared}} upon the pillow {{of his bed}} {{by the light of}} a rose-shaded <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> was a small-headed, grey-haired gentleman with a wrinkled face and sunken brown eyes. Years of business experience, mitigated only by such exercise as the game of poker affords, had intensified an instinctive inexpressiveness. Under the most solitary circumstances old Grammont was still inexpressive, and the face that stared at the ceiling of his cabin and the problem of his daughter might have been the face of a pickled head in a museum, for any indication it betrayed of the flow of thought within. He lay on his back and his bent knees lifted the bed-clothes into a sharp mountain. He was not even trying to sleep.|$|E

6000|$|The room {{displayed}} a modest and pleasant color-scheme, {{after one of}} the best standard designs of the decorator who [...] "did the interiors" [...] for most of the speculative-builders' houses in Zenith. The walls were gray, the woodwork white, the rug a serene blue; and very much like mahogany was the furniture--the bureau with its great clear mirror, Mrs. Babbitt's dressing-table with toilet-articles of almost solid silver, the plain twin beds, between them a small table holding a standard electric <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> a glass for water, and a standard bedside book with colored illustrations--what particular book it was cannot be ascertained, since no one had ever opened it. The mattresses were firm but not hard, triumphant modern mattresses which had cost a great deal of money; the hot-water radiator was of exactly the proper scientific surface for the cubic contents of the room. The windows were large and easily opened, with the best catches and cords, and Holland roller-shades guaranteed not to crack. It was a masterpiece among bedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium Incomes. Only {{it had nothing to do}} with the Babbitts, nor with any one else. If people had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and lain in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of it. It had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel. One expected the chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who would stay but one night, go without looking back, and never think of it again.|$|E

New red or pink bedsheets are used and a plate of dried longans, lotus seeds, red dates, persimmons, sprig of pomegranate leaves together with 2 red packets are placed on the bed. A pair of <b>bedside</b> <b>lamps</b> (子孙登) is lit to symbolize the addition of sons to the family.|$|R
40|$|Extract] This compact {{soft cover}} book (14 x 9 x 2 cm; 200 g, 456 pages) {{consists}} of 23 chapters, appendices, some WHO maps, many useful addresses/websites/contacts, {{and a number}} of drawings to illustrate the text. It is part of a series with three other volumes dealing with Africa, Asia & India, and Australia, NZ & the Pacific (these titles are not covered in this current review). The book fits easily in the tightest luggage. Due to the small size, the font size consequently is at a just acceptable level. A pretty green colour is used to highlight and decorate. Particularly important paragraphs are typed in this colour as well. Unfortunately, poor lighting such as from as a small <b>bedside</b> table <b>lamp</b> makes it very difficult to read these paragraphs, a lone 40 Watt bulb dangling from the ceiling of an Andean budget accommodation will wipe out this part completely, a shame considering that these are usually paragraphs of particular importance. The boxed texts have this colour as a background which may make then equally difficult to read (a >light-test= with the other titles revealed a similar problem, particularly the sandy beige of the volume on Africa) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1941, a Jewish {{boy named}} Lenny is {{watching}} a newsreel at a theatre in Brooklyn {{with his mother}} when one featuring Adolf Hitler appears. The crowd boos. The child questions why no one likes him and wonders what Santa will give him for Christmas. His mother tells him {{that no one will}} get Hitler anything for Christmas. The boy travels to Germany to give Hitler a kitten for Christmas. Once he arrives, he presents the boxed gift to Hitler, who initially thinks it is a bomb, and throws it to Eva Braun. She opens it and gives the kitten to Hitler, who is apparently deeply moved. Hitler's mood changes when he discovers that the child is Jewish and has a swastika-shaped birthmark on his stomach. Hitler orders Eva to kill the child and make his skin into a lampshade, which the couple then have on their <b>bedside</b> table <b>lamp.</b> Following the war, the lamp is returned to the boy's mother who keeps it as a memento. When she touches it, it supernaturally lights up of its own accord and the swastika magically transforms into a Star of David. A miracle is proclaimed. The president awards the Purple Heart to the lampshade.|$|R
50|$|Some of Malibran's {{personal}} objects, familiar or {{charged with}} history, form {{the very core}} of the collection: a small salt flask, an incised crystal <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> a score briefcase in leather, a travel writing desk, the riding whip used during her fatal cavalcade, a long hairpiece cut after her death, a death mask, a shred from the pall torn in pieces by the crowd attending her funeral at the Laeken Cemetery, where de Bériot had an impressive cenotaph erected to her memory.|$|E
50|$|As Bethany drifts to sleep, she {{dreams of}} her abusive {{childhood}} and unintentionally sends a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> flying into Lilah, {{who was watching}} her fitful sleep. Terrified, Bethany flees from the apartment, throwing on a jacket. Bethany seeks Angel's help and they discuss her lack of control over her telekinetic powers. Holland stresses that if Lilah's work with Bethany is unsuccessful it could damage their other projects. Wesley deduces that Bethany has been sexually abused; when he pointedly mentions her father she loses control, sending both him and Angel flying through the air.|$|E
5000|$|Barnes's {{conviction}} {{was based}} on forensic evidence and witness testimony placing him at the crime scene. His fingerprints were on a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> {{that was used to}} bludgeon Bass, traces of his semen were present at the scene, and two patches of blood on his clothing were confirmed by DNA analysis to have been hers. Prosecution witnesses described seeing Barnes trespassing in Bass's yard about one hour before she returned from work. When arrested, he was in possession of a [...]32 caliber pistol belonging to Bass. Barnes had previously done construction work on Bass's house.|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{subjects}} who lived singly in an isolation unit without temporal cues {{were asked to}} note every day after awakening how many hours {{they thought they had}} slept, and in the evening before retiring how many hours they had been awake. These estimates of the duration of sleep and wakefulness were compared with the intervals between two signals given by the subjects by pressing a button at the time of waking up and when turning off their <b>bedside</b> reading <b>lamp.</b> The results can be summarized as follows: (a) the daily estimated durations of sleep and wakefulness were positively correlated with the actual durations in all but one subject; (b) sleep and wake times were better estimated {{in the presence of a}} light-dark cycle even if the subjects were not entrained by the zeitgeber; (c) for both episodes, there was a consistent trend from an overestimation of relatively short to an underestimation of long durations; (d) with equal durations in the two episodes, sleep was estimated to be shorter than wake time; (e) the most accurate estimates centered around 10. 5 h of sleep and 13. 5 h of wake time; (f) the sleep and wake times added up to 24 h in {{subjects who}} did not deliberately "compensate" for relatively long sleep estimates with a short wake estimate, with the full cycle being adjusted to 24 h...|$|R
50|$|Staff as well {{as guests}} {{frequently}} report <b>bedside</b> table <b>lamps</b> and televisions being unplugged, shampoo bottles rolling across the floor or flying across the room. The sound of doors opening/closing while the room is otherwise vacant are common. Guests have found electronics such as cell phones and camcorders dead center beneath the bed. Front Desk staff, particularly the graveyard shift, have reported hearing coughing and sneezing from the hotel's laundry room, seeing shadows {{in the same area}} of whom they believe to be Claude Harvey, the hospital's maintenance man who was found dead on April 3, 1935, pinned beneath the Otis elevator, presumably murdered. They see and hear Claude roaming the stairwells and the boiler room as though still at work. Many guests have reported seeing the apparitions of two ladies, one in a white gown, and another one in a nurses outfit, {{as well as}} someone who appears to be a doctor or nurse, in a long lab coat carrying a clipboard, roaming the halls. A Spirit Cat is a frequent visitor to the hotel. Its origin unknown, the cat has been heard meowing, hissing and scratching at doors and walls. Both staff and guests have heard and felt the cat brushing against their legs and snuggling against them while on the bed. Most notable is the imprint on the bedding of what {{is believed to be the}} cat curled up, that bedding moments earlier, smooth and straight. A photo, provided by a guest staying in Rm 20 in 2008, shows the cat very clearly. This photo is still at the front desk.|$|R
50|$|Frank Arkell, {{a former}} Wollongong Mayor and {{former member of}} the New South Wales State Parliament, was murdered in his Wollongong home on 26 June 1998. His head had been smashed in with a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> with the {{electric}} cord wrapped tightly around his neck. Tie pins were stuck in Arkell's eyes and cheeks. Arkell had been mentioned in the Wood Royal Commission's report; he had been embroiled in child pornography and paedophilia scandals in the years leading up to his death, and he had been acquitted of child sex offences six months before his murder, but investigations were continuing, with further charges to be laid.|$|E
50|$|She {{attempted}} {{to maintain a}} long-distance relationship with her then-boyfriend Chris, and the roommates surprised her by having him visit San Francisco on her birthday, putting on a mock presentation of This is Your Life, with a tuxedo-wearing Winick as the announcer, and her boyfriend as the final person to appear. Unbeknownst to anyone, Winick had developed feelings of his own for Ling, and after she would get home late at night from work and fall asleep with a book across her lap and a pen in her hand, Winick would turn off her <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> put the book away and cover her up. Ling and Winick supported Zamora by attending his lectures whenever they could.|$|E
50|$|Cooke's {{killing spree}} {{involved}} {{a series of}} seemingly unrelated hit-and-runs, stabbings, stranglings, and shootings. Victims were shot with different rifles, stabbed with knives and scissors, and hit with an axe. Several were killed after waking up as Cooke was robbing their homes, two were shot while sleeping without their homes being disturbed, and one was shot dead after answering {{a knock on the}} door. After stabbing one victim, Cooke got lemonade from the refrigerator and sat on the veranda drinking it. One victim was strangled to death with the cord from a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> after which Cooke raped the corpse, dragged it to a neighbour's lawn, then sexually penetrated it with an empty whiskey bottle, which he left cradled in the victim's arms.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, he {{dismisses the}} {{scratching}} noises as a rat and the lamp {{as having a}} loose connection, both of which he asks the hotel receptionist to investigate. He begins to venture out to the beach again, but once he gets there he becomes hesitant and decides {{to spend the day}} elsewhere instead. That night, Parkin falls asleep while reading in bed. He is woken in the night again by strange noises, and finds his <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> is once again turned off even though he fell asleep with it on. This time, somebody tries to enter his hotel room. Though they are unsuccessful, he feels shaken by the incident. Eventually, he manages to fall asleep again, but has a disturbing dream that involves his wife, a young child, and the figure on the beach.|$|E
5000|$|The andon {{became popular}} in the Edo period. Early on, the andon was handheld; {{it could also be}} placed on a stand or hung on a wall. The okiandon was most common indoors. Many had a {{vertical}} box shape, with an inner stand for the light. Some had a drawer on the bottom to facilitate refilling and lighting. A handle on top made it portable. A variety was the Enshū andon. One explanation attributes it to Kobori Enshu, who lived in the late Azuchi-Momoyama Period and early Edo period. Tubular in shape, it had an opening instead of a drawer. Another variety was the Ariake andon, a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp.</b> The kakeandon under the eaves of a shop, often bearing the name of the merchant, was a common sight in the towns.|$|E
50|$|At 22:30 of Saturday, 29 March 2008, Isabella Oliveira Nardoni {{fell from}} the sixth floor of Edifício London, where her father Alexandre Nardoni lived with Isabella's {{stepmother}} Anna Carolina Jatobá and their two newborn sons Cauã and Pietro. She was found suffering from cardiac arrest in the front garden of Edifício London. Rescue personnel tried to resuscitate her for 34 minutes, but were unsuccessful. She died {{on the way to}} the hospital. Nardoni and Jatobá were taken to a local police station. Nardoni told police officers that when he arrived with the family at the building, Isabella was already sleeping, so he went up with her first. He left Jatobá with their sons in the car, placed Isabella in the guest room, turned on the <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> and a lamp in the boys' room, locked the door and went back down to the car.|$|E
50|$|Adding to {{the legend}} of McRaven being haunted, at least five {{occupants}} have died inside the house, and former owner John Bobb was murdered just outside its premises. It's also very likely that a few Confederate soldiers died on the property during {{the time it was}} used as a field hospital. Reports of ghostly activity are said to spread throughout the house, but the center of activity seems to be the middle bedroom upstairs, the room where Mary Elizabeth Howard (age 15) died during childbirth. Her ghost is believed to be responsible for the <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> in this room, which has been reported to turn on and off, seemingly at will. In the time before Leyland French bought the house and started living there in 1984, the previous owners who didn't reside in the home, were frequently awakened by calls {{in the middle of the}} night telling them the lights at McRaven had come on. Mary Elizabeth's ghostly apparition has appeared on the house's flying wing staircase, and in the dining room. While handling Mary Elizabeth's wedding shawl, some people say it emits heat, while others claim it about jumped out of their hands.|$|E
5000|$|However, Williams’ {{films have}} also {{been the subject of}} criticism. Richard Corliss, writing in Time magazine, stated: [...] "Aesthetically, much of Williams' work vacillates between inert and abysmal. The rural comedy of Juke Joint is logy, as if the heat had gotten to the movie; even the musical scenes, {{featuring}} North Texas jazzman Red Calhoun, move at the turtle tempo of Hollywood's favorite black of the period, Stepin Fetchit. And there were technical gaffes galore: in a late-night scene in Dirty Gertie, actress Francine Everett clicks on a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> and the screen actually darkens for a moment before full lights finally come up. Yet at least one Williams film, his debut Blood of Jesus (1941), has a naive grandeur to match its subject." [...] It should also be realized that Williams often worked on a very meager budget. The Blood of Jesus was filmed for a cost of $5,000; most black films of that era had budgets of double and triple that amount. Williams began writing a book about his 55 years in show business in 1959; it is not known whether it was published.|$|E
5000|$|The {{night before}} he is due to depart, Parkin struggles to relax in his hotel room. He picks up the ring he found on the beach, but quickly tries to dispel any irrational {{thoughts}} he is having and eventually falls asleep. Later in the night, he is once again awakened by the scratching sounds and then somebody trying to enter his hotel room. This time, a spectral apparition enters his room from underneath the door. As his <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> goes off again by itself, Parkin shuts his eyes in terror and implores the apparition to leave him alone, but as {{he opens his eyes}} he sees a figure sitting on the end of his bed. The figure appears to be his wife, who angrily says over and over again [...] "I'm still here" [...] as she crawls towards him. Parkin tries in vain to escape, his fingernails scratching on the wooden floor making a sound identical to the scratching noises he kept hearing. The following morning, the receptionist finds Parkin lying dead in his bed, while his wife seemingly vanishes from the care home.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} fist (presumably Stewart's) {{pounding}} on a table, with the camera panning up to reveal Lennox in a boardroom, with images of a Saturn V launch projected on a screen behind her, which are later replaced by a shot of a crowd walking down a street. Stewart is shown typing on a computer (actually an MCS drum computer). The camera cuts to Lennox and Stewart meditating on the table. Stewart is next shown playing a cello in a field. The scene then returns to the boardroom, with Lennox and Stewart lying down on the table, and a cow walking around them. Stewart is shown again typing on the computer, with the cow chewing something right next to him. The scene cuts to the duo in a field, with a herd of cows, and Stewart still typing. Lennox and Stewart are then seen floating in a boat, with Stewart again playing a cello. The video ends with Lennox lying in bed, with the last shot being a book on a nightstand bearing a cover identical to the album. The screen then fades to black as Lennox turns off the <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp.</b> The video has more than 155 million views as of August, 2017.|$|E
5000|$|In this version, retired {{astronomer}} James Parkin goes on {{a respite}} holiday after leaving his aged wife (who {{appears to be in}} the advanced stages of senile dementia) in a care home. When revisiting one of their favourite coastal towns during the off-season, he goes for a walk on the beach and discovers a wedding ring in the sand, which he keeps. As he is walking back along the desolate beach to his hotel, he senses he is being followed and sees a motionless white-clad figure in the distance behind him. However, as he walks further, the seemingly motionless figure gets closer to him each time he turns to look back. Nervous, he runs back to the steps that exit the beach, but as he turns around again, the figure has disappeared. Back at his hotel room, he cleans the ring he has found and sees it is inscribed with the Latin words for [...] "Who is this, who is coming?", which he reads out loud. Later that night, he is awoken by noises. Initially this seems to be caused by a storm outside, but he then hears scratching noises inside his room. He goes back to sleep with his <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> turned on, but when he awakens again later, the lamp is inexplicably off again.|$|E
40|$|Light Conversation, an {{interactive}} multimedia installation, dynamically transforms language into light. Individuals unfamiliar with new media installation generate narrative {{content for the}} piece through interviews with the artist and by loaning a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp</b> to the installation. Eight table lamps form the interactive interface for the piece. In the installation, the gesture of turning on a light - a century-old technology - is loaded with emotion, narrative, and consequence. By switching one lamp off and another on, viewers navigate the domestic world of the lamp-owners. Blinking bulbs transmit stories in ASCII code as images of specific bedspreads and nightstand reading zoom {{in and out of}} view. Viewers who engage a lamp spark {{an interactive}} dialogue that must be sensed, felt, read, and observed...|$|E
30|$|Highly {{connected}} with technology and engineering, {{the discipline of}} design (e.g., industrial design, product design, and interaction design) has been inspired by the mindset of positive psychology: from preventing pain towards promoting happiness, from material sufficiency towards experiential value (Pohlmeyer 2012), from immediate response towards long-term impact, and from designing solutions towards designing possibilities (Desmet and Hassenzahl 2012; Jensen 2014). Human flourishing has essentially changed the traditional design process, exemplified by recent scholarly advice, such as “think experience before product” (Hassenzahl 2010) and “first decide what kind of experience to be aimed for and then design certain features to evoke the targeted experience” (Desmet and Schifferstein 2011). Design approaches, such as experience-based design (Bate and Robert 2007), experience-centered design (Wright and McCarthy 2010), experience-driven design (Desmet and Schifferstein 2011), positive design (Desmet and Pohlmeyer 2013), experience design (Hassenzahl et al. 2013) and design for profound experiences (Jensen 2014), prioritize quality experience goals over material-level requirements. One typical experience design case introduced by Hassenzahl (2010) is Philips wake-up light simulating sunrise and bird singing for natural wake-up experience in the morning. Combining an alarm clock and a <b>bedside</b> <b>lamp,</b> it guides user gently out of a deep sleep phase by progressively increasing in light intensity and volume of bird singing. Adding to this understanding of experience design, Lu and Roto (2014) defined an experience goal addressing in-depth meaning {{as the starting point}} and driver of design process. Functionality and usability requirements are submissive to ultimate experience goals.|$|E
