5|$|Minnesota's winters are {{the setting}} of several {{television}} programs and Hollywood films, including the 1996 film Fargo which features the backdrop of a Minnesota winter, but {{like most of the}} characters in the movie, the climate is portrayed as <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> inhospitable.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even when things appear to be <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E
5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
50|$|Everyone {{is getting}} ready {{to move out of the}} flats and into their decantment properties. Except for Tex, that is, who has nowhere to go.

50|$|Make Death Love Me (1979) is a {{psychological}} crime novel by English author Ruth Rendell, regarded {{by some as}} one of her <b>bleakest</b> <b>and</b> most powerful stories. The novel was shortlisted for an Edgar and won Sweden's prestigious Martin Beck Award.|$|R
60|$|Another day brought dull-gray {{scudding}} clouds, and {{gusts of}} wind and squalls of rain, and a wailing through the bare aspens. It grew colder <b>and</b> <b>bleaker</b> <b>and</b> darker. Rain changed to sleet and sleet to snow. That night brought winter.|$|R
5|$|Carisbrook, the city's former main rugby union venue and {{a former}} Test cricket ground, is at {{the eastern end of}} the suburb between The Glen and the Hillside Railway Workshops. It was the home of Otago Rugby Union until a new stadium opened in North Dunedin (the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza) in 2011. The new stadium is the new home of the Otago Rugby Union and Highlanders Super Rugby franchise, and met with some {{opposition}} within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely on the cost. The future of Carisbrook looks <b>bleak,</b> <b>and</b> many of the former facilities {{are in the process of}} being dismantled or removed.|$|E
5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 a {{testimonial}} {{match was}} organised by Everton on Lawton's behalf {{to help him}} pay off his debts of around £6,000. However his financial situation was still <b>bleak,</b> <b>and</b> on two occasions he narrowly avoided a prison sentence for failing to pay his rates after an Arsenal supporters club and later an anonymous former co-worker stepped in {{to pay the bill}} for him. In August 1974, he was again found Guilty of obtaining goods by deception after failing to repay a £10 debt to a publican, and was sentenced to 200 hours of Community service and ordered to pay £40 costs. In 1984, he began writing a column for the Nottingham Evening Post. Brentford also organised a testimonial match for him in May 1985.|$|E
50|$|British author Pinborough {{manages to}} make this deeply {{disturbing}} sequel to 2013’s Mayhem even <b>bleaker</b> <b>and</b> more unsettling than its predecessor...The author’s ingenuity in weaving her macabre plot becomes fully evident by the powerful, jaw-dropping end, and she skilfully instils fear in the reader even with innocuous phrases. - Review of Murder in Publishers Weekly.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is divided}} into two tunnel of {{multiple}} zones each.

60|$|In {{his bedroom}} at the Carlton Hotel George Bevan was packing. That is to say, {{he had begun}} packing; but for the last twenty minutes he had been sitting {{on the side of}} the bed, staring into a future which became <b>bleaker</b> <b>and</b> <b>bleaker</b> the more he {{examined}} it. In the last two days he had been no stranger to these grey moods, and they had become harder and harder to dispel. Now, with the steamer-trunk before him gaping to receive its contents, he gave himself up whole-heartedly to gloom.|$|R
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E
25|$|Dow {{is noted}} for being {{particularly}} cold, <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> exposed, especially in summer, {{typical of the}} Cumbrian season. Dow Crag is usually approached from the Walna Scar road which connects the Duddon Valley with Coniston.|$|E
25|$|The early zoo was a <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> uninspiring {{place and}} had been founded with an initial fund of £10,000. However, in 1923, the staff quickly set about {{planting}} 5,000 trees and developing the grounds to a pleasant setting.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 72 is a {{continuation}} from Sonnet 71. Both sonnets are an anticipatory plea regarding death and the afterlife from the writer to the reader. The overarching subject of Sonnet 72 is The Poet's fixation with how he will be remembered after death. Subsequently the tone remains <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> self-depreciating.|$|E
25|$|The Army of the South {{initiated}} the assault of Málaga {{from the west}} at Ronda on February 3. Attacking from the north {{on the night of}} February 4, the Italian Blackshirts achieved a massive breakthrough because of the Republicans being unprepared for armoured warfare. The Nationalists continued a steady advance towards Málaga and by February 6 had reached the heights around the city. Fearing encirclement, the Republican commander, Colonel Villalba, ordered the evacuation of Málaga. On February 8, Queipo de Llano and the Army of the South entered a <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> barren Málaga.|$|E
25|$|The llama and alpaca {{are only}} {{known in the}} {{domestic}} state, and are variable in size and of many colors, being often white, brown, or piebald. Some are grey or black. The guanaco and vicuña are wild, the former being endangered, and of a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below. They certainly differ from each other, the vicuña being smaller, more slender in its proportions, and having a shorter head than the guanaco. The vicuña lives in herds on the <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, {{in the southern part}} of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia. Its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid. The fiber is extremely delicate and soft, and highly valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal.|$|E

25|$|Born in Grimsby, England to {{a family}} of fishermen, Hills grew up sailing the <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> {{turbulent}} North Sea. In 1940 he enrolled as a cadet in nautical school and joined the British Merchant Navy during World War II. At sea, Hills had several life and death experiences that formed his views on karma, divinity and destiny. On one occasion a rogue wave swept him off the deck hundreds of yards (metres) away from the vessel, but another wave picked him up and threw him back onto the ship, cutting open his forehead but saving him from freezing to death. As German U-boats sank 2,828 merchant ships, he watched tanker crew colleagues incinerated in the flaming oil-slicked Atlantic. At {{the end of the}} war, as navigating officer for an Esso oil tanker, Hills found himself docked in Curaçao, where he set up shop as a commodities trader with branch offices in Venezuela and Aruba.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the album}} cover, {{journalist}} Dave Rimmer wrote in British music magazine Smash Hits, [...] "Iceland does seem an appropriate location for this group. It's isolated, cold, <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> fits perfectly with the moody image they've attracted to themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Wormshill's {{elevated}} {{and exposed}} {{position on the}} North Downs means it occasionally experiences extreme weather conditions such as the heavy snowfalls of 1114 January 1987, March 2005, February 2009 and January 2010. In the late 18th century Hasted commented: [...] "Being exposed to the northern aspect, it lies very <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> cold." ...|$|E
5000|$|A British yachtsman visiting Peschany Island {{recently}} {{commented on}} the weather and on the desolation of the place: [...] "I have been anchored off Ostrov Peschany for a week now {{and during that time}} have had to move position eight times. There is, as a rule of thumb, a gale per day lasting between 8 and 12 hours" ... "Ostrov Peschany must be one of the <b>bleakest</b> <b>and</b> least inviting islands anywhere in the world." ...|$|R

50|$|Loudon Wainwright III (also {{known as}} Album I) is the debut album of Loudon Wainwright III. It was {{released}} on vinyl in 1970 on Atlantic Records. Like his second effort Album II, the album is a solo acoustic effort. Though his ironic sense of humour is evident, this is an altogether <b>bleaker</b> <b>and</b> more acerbic album ('Black Uncle Remus', 'Four Is A Magic Number', 'Glad To See You've Got Religion') than most of his 1970s work.|$|R
500|$|In 1995 {{a medical}} clinic at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, {{was named for}} <b>Bleak,</b> <b>and</b> {{following}} his death, the Governor of Oklahoma declared 14 June 2007 [...] "Sergeant David Bruce Bleak Day" [...] for the 55th anniversary of Bleak's accomplishments. On 14 June 2006, Bleak's family presented his Medal of Honor to the Idaho Military History Museum, {{where it is now}} displayed, alongside that of fellow Idaho recipient Gurdon H. Barter.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1847, the clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville Jones {{said that}} St Mary's, {{which he called}} [...] "a rather long and low building", was situated [...] "in an uneven, rocky, and exposed locality" [...] within a parish that had a [...] "peculiarly <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> desolate appearance". He also thought that {{the roof of the}} church was [...] "remarkable for the quantity of good, but light, timber used in its construction." ...|$|E
500|$|Chatterjee {{argues that}} [...] "It {{is under the}} defeatist veneer of his poetry that the {{positive}} side of Larkin's vision of life is hidden". This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works. Over the course of Larkin's poetic career, [...] "The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably <b>bleak</b> <b>and</b> pessimistic in The North Ship, became more and more positive with the passage of time".|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic - [...] "Far <b>bleaker</b> <b>and</b> more minimalist {{than its}} first inception, Black Aria II relies less on string-fueled dread {{and more on}} operatic vocals and {{experimental}} sounds...there's not a lot to sink your teeth into, but {{if there were a}} subcategory in the new age section of your local record store that was reserved for meditation music for the hooded, the damned, and the downright evil, then Black Aria II would must definitely have its own kiosk." ...|$|R
2500|$|The terrain traversed {{is among}} the <b>bleakest</b> <b>and</b> wildest in England, and {{construction}} was halted {{for months at a}} time due to frozen ground, snowdrifts and flooding. One contractor had to give up as a result of underestimating the terrain and the weather—Dent Head has almost four times the rainfall of London. Another long-established partnership dissolved under the strain; that of Eckersley and Bayliss. They were contracted to construct the [...] section from Kirkby Thore to Petteril Bridge in Carlisle.|$|R
50|$|Culteranismo used <b>bleak</b> {{language}} <b>and</b> hyperbaton. These works largely included neologisms and mythological topics. Such characteristics {{made this}} form of poetry highly complex, making comprehension difficult.|$|R
