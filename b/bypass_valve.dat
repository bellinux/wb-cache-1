25|$|A manual {{shutdown}} {{was initiated}} {{during the middle}} of a start-up operation. The cause was a high pressure alarm that was caused by the shutting of a turbine <b>bypass</b> <b>valve.</b> The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual reactor shutdown. An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1970s, when {{submersible}} {{pressure gauges}} on regulators came into common use, diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty. The gas supply was automatically cut-off by a spring loaded valve when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure. To release the reserve, the diver pulled {{down on a}} rod that ran {{along the side of}} the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a <b>bypass</b> <b>valve.</b> The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve (typically [...] ) was consumed. On occasion, divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and, not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed, could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever. These valves became known as [...] "J-valves" [...] from being item [...] "J" [...] in one of the first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs. The standard non-reserve yoke valve at the time was item [...] "K", and is often still referred to as a [...] "K-valve". J-valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility, where the submersible pressure gauge (SPG) can not be read. While the recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of the J-valve, the US Department of Defense, the US Navy, NOAA (the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) and OSHA (the national Occupational Health and Safety Administration) all still allow or recommend the use of J-valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge. They are generally not available through recreational dive shops, but are still available from some manufacturers. They can be significantly more expensive than K-valves from the same manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, {{a member}} of a feminist {{reproductive}} health self-help group, Lorraine Rothman, modified equipment found in an underground abortion clinic that was developed for a new non-traumatic, manually-operated-suction abortion technique. Rothman took the thin, flexible plastic Karman cannula (about the size of a soda straw), and the syringe (50 or 60ml), and added a one-way <b>bypass</b> <b>valve,</b> to fix two main problems. The contraption could prevent air from being pumped into the uterus, and also suctioned uterine contents directly into the syringe, thus limiting the amount that could be removed. Rothman's and Downer's group dubbed the new invention the [...] "Del Em." [...] Rothman added two lengths of clear plastic tubing, one from the cannula to the collection jar and another to go from the collection jar to the syringe. With this new set-up, the contents of the uterus went directly into the jar, allowing for the extraction of more material, and the two-way <b>bypass</b> <b>valve</b> diverted any air that may have been inadvertently pushed back toward the body to exit harmlessly into the air; this would prevent air from entering the uterus. By making it possible for more than one person to operate the device, the skill level of the operators was greatly reduced. One person could concentrate on guiding the sterile cannula through the vaginal cavity into the cervical os while another could pump the syringe to develop the vacuum. The Del Em made the procedure more comfortable, with personal control of the suction.|$|E
50|$|Reactor {{pressure}} in a BWR {{is controlled by}} the main turbine or main steam <b>bypass</b> <b>valves.</b> Unlike a PWR, where the turbine steam demand is set manually by the operators, in a BWR, the turbine valves will modulate to maintain reactor pressure at a setpoint. Under this control mode, the turbine will automatically follow reactor power changes. When the turbine is offline or trips, the main steam bypass/dump valves will open to direct steam directly to the condenser. These <b>bypass</b> <b>valves</b> will automatically or manually modulate as necessary to maintain reactor pressure and control the reactor's heatup and cooldown rates while steaming is still in progress.|$|R
40|$|Several years ago, a {{training}} session {{was being held}} at an electric generating plant in the Midwest. One of the subjects covered in the session was steamline drain traps. One of the trainees checked several of the steam traps when he went back on shift following the training session. He found that 2 of those that he checked had the <b>bypass</b> <b>valves</b> open, directly <b>bypassing</b> steam from the steamline to the condenser. He closed the <b>bypass</b> <b>valves</b> to put the traps into operation, as {{they should have been}} since the traps were operable. The condenser vacuum went up by one inch of mercury vacuum. The estimated savings {{as a result of this}} action were about $ 12, 000 per week in coal costs...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally {{the turbine}} is {{overloaded}} for short durations.

2500|$|Two-stage {{variable}} twin-turbos {{employ a}} small turbocharger at low speeds {{and a large}} one at higher speeds. They are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbocharger is multiplied by another, hence the name [...] "2-stage." [...] The distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable, so the transition from using the small turbocharger to the large one can be done incrementally. Twin turbochargers are primarily used in Diesel engines. For example, in Opel bi-turbo Diesel, only the smaller turbocharger works at low speed, providing high torque at 1,500–1,700rpm. Both turbochargers operate together in mid range, with the larger one pre-compressing the air, which the smaller one further compresses. A <b>bypass</b> <b>valve</b> regulates the exhaust flow to each turbocharger. At higher speed (2,500 to 3,000 RPM) only the larger turbocharger runs.|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal <b>bypass</b> <b>valve</b> in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E

40|$|Large primary-secondary {{chilled water}} systems often suffer from low chilled water {{temperature}} difference (i. e., known as low delta-T central plant syndrome) during operation. This paper presents a detailed study {{to investigate the}} feasibility and potential benefits related {{to the use of}} a <b>bypass</b> check <b>valve</b> in the chiller decouple line to solve this operational problem and hence, to improve the overall system operating efficiency. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide some guidance and necessary confidence as well as the awareness of potential problems that may arise when a <b>bypass</b> check <b>valve</b> is considered to handle the low delta-T syndrome. Based on testing the effects of the low delta-T syndrome, the performances of the systems with and without the <b>bypass</b> check <b>valve</b> are then evaluated by using a simulated virtual system. In the tests, the low delta-T syndrome was introduced through air-side fouling by changing the air-side thermal resistance coefficient in the cooling coil model.

50|$|In April 2010, a Puget Sound Energy began a US$200 {{million project}} to {{rehabilitate}} and upgrade the power plant. The project included retrofitting {{the first four}} of the generators in Plant 1 and replacing the fifth. A turbine-generator would be replaced in Plant 2 as well. The weir was lowered to 16 ft in height, lengthened by 37 ft and the water-intake structure was replaced. Lowering the weir will help reduce flood waters upstream of the falls. The penstocks, which feed the power plants with water, were to be upgraded as well. Finally, automatic shut-off and <b>bypass</b> <b>valves</b> were installed for Plant 2. The shut-off valves will better prepare the plant for emergencies and the <b>bypass</b> <b>valves</b> will allow water to flow downstream in the case that Plant 2 is offline. To promote tourism, recreation and culture, several upgrades to include new visitor centers, hiking trails, a boardwalk and improved landscaping were implemented. Renovations on Plant 2 were completed in April 2013. The new 6.5 MW Francis turbine generator in Plant 1 and the entire project was finished in mid-2014.

50|$|In some cases, a {{so-called}} <b>bypass</b> <b>valve</b> {{acts as a}} relief valve by being used to return {{all or part of}} the fluid discharged by a pump or gas compressor back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or gas compressor.

40|$|A V-type engine with a bi-turbocharger {{configuration}} utilizes {{the exhaust}} energy well which gives a fast torque response. An unwanted instability, called co-surge, {{can occur in}} such engines where the two interconnected compressors alternately go into flow reversals. If co-surge occurs, the control system must quell the oscillations with as little disturbance in engine torque as possible. A model of a bi-turbocharged engine is presented, combining a mean value engine model and a Moore-Greizer compressor model for surge. The model is validated against measurements on a vehicle dynamometer, showing that it captures the frequency and amplitude of the co-surge oscillation. The model is used to develop detection and control strategies for co-surge that rapidly returns the turbo to a stable operating point. Both simulations and experimental evaluation on the vehicle show that the developed strategies are successful in rapidly detecting and quelling co-surge. The selection of actuators is also studied. With no or small pressure drops over the throttle, {{it is necessary to}} use the <b>bypass</b> <b>valves.</b> However, for operating conditions with moderate and high pressure drops over the throttle, it is shown that it is sufficient to only open the throttle. This has the advantage, compared to opening the <b>bypass</b> <b>valves,</b> that it reduces the drop in boost pressure and thus reduces the drop in engine torque...|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} wastegate is {{a built-in}} <b>bypass</b> <b>valve</b> and passage within the turbocharger housing which allows excess exhaust pressure {{to bypass the}} turbine into the downstream exhaust. Control of the internal wastegate valve by a pressure signal from the intake manifold is identical to that of an external wastegate. Advantages include simpler and more compact installation, with no external wastegate piping. Additionally, all waste exhaust gases are automatically routed back into the catalytic converter and exhaust system. Many OEM turbochargers are of this type. Disadvantages in comparison to an external wastegate include a limited ability to bleed off exhaust pressure due to the relatively small diameter of the internal <b>bypass</b> <b>valve,</b> and less efficient performance under boost conditions.|$|E
50|$|When the {{ignition}} is first turned on, the ECU energizes a relay {{that runs the}} fuel pump {{for a short time}} to pressurize the fuel rail.
