5|$|A {{standard}} {{match between}} Daivari and Tommy Dreamer followed with The Great Khali accompanying Daivari {{to the ring}} but was ejected from ringside early on for interfering. After Daivari won the match using a roll-up, Khali came <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring and gave Dreamer a chokebomb. EMTs came out to help Dreamer get up, but he ended up getting up {{on his own and}} headed backstage.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1959, the I-94/US12 freeway {{opened on}} the south side of Kalamazoo, and US12 was shifted to follow the new freeway. The former route through {{downtown}} Kalamazoo and along Stadium Drive was redesignated Bus. US12. The next year, it was renumbered BL I-94. In 1963, the US131 freeway {{opened on the}} northwest side of Kalamazoo. US131 followed M-43 eastward from the end of the freeway into the downtown area to reconnect to its original routing along Westnedge and Park. The next year, another section of US131 opened southwest of Kalamazoo, and US131 was rerouted out of downtown completely. The freeway section north of downtown opened in 1964, and Bus. US131 was designated along it into downtown and along BL I-94 <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US131 freeway west of downtown. Later in 1965, Kalamazoo and Michikal avenues were transferred to state jurisdiction to set up the one-way pairing east–west through downtown. Kalamazoo and Michikal are then signed as southbound Bus. US131 from Westnedge Avenue to Stadium Drive while Main Street and Michigan Avenue continued to serve northbound traffic only between Stadium Drive and Park Street.|$|E
25|$|The salvage {{operations}} commenced almost right away on 13 July 1870; the ketch Comet departed Sydney {{to salvage the}} cargo. This was sollowed by the schooner Scotia almost a fortnight later to assist, and by mid-September the Comet had again proceeded <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E
50|$|Bud Parker was {{a farmer}} with a farm near {{what is now}} Nowata, Oklahoma. Though he was {{initially}} part of <b>the</b> plan <b>to</b> rob <b>the</b> McDonald County Bank, he eventually <b>backed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scorn of his new bride.|$|R
50|$|The station had an all-over roof, {{sheltering}} {{a platform}} {{and a single}} track. There was a bay at each end. The broad gauge of the B&ER and the narrow gauge of the L&SWR were separate at the Joint station, except that the turntable was of mixed gauge, accessible from each company's track. The connecting line passed the original Town station, leaving it on a stub. L&SWR trains from Chard Junction entered the Town station, and then <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> through line, and then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Joint station.|$|R

25|$|McMahon {{then began}} a feud with Kurt Angle. By the King of the Ring, on June 24, McMahon's feud with Angle had culminated. After already {{participating}} in two tournament matches that night, Angle wrestled McMahon in a Street Fight. After a suplex {{on the hard}} floor, Angle was thought to have cracked his tailbone. Angle also delivered an overhead belly to belly suplex through the plated glass stage set, but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to put him through a second plate <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage and again failed two more times. The match also had Shane missing a shooting star press and ended with Angle performing the Angle Slam off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.|$|E
25|$|While under cover, an {{improved}} system was devised for removing Mayfly from the shed. This {{consisted of a}} series of electric winches that could gently ease it out, even in windy conditions, and on 24 September 1911 it was decided to move Mayfly from the hangar for full testing. Just as the nose cleared the hangar door, a gust caused the ship to roll virtually onto its beam ends. It eventually righted, but as it was being swung round so that the nose would point <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dock, there were cracking sounds amidships and it broke in two. At that point the centre started to rise, and the crew in the aft gondola dived overboard causing the stern to rise. Subsequent damage was caused by a bracing cable {{on the top of the}} hull, which held fast causing several frames to be severely damaged as the hull was moved by the wind. There were no fatalities, and the wreck was returned to the shed the same day.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

60|$|And then he bumped {{his nose}}. Yes, Sir, Peter bumped his nose against {{the end of}} that hall. You see, it was an old house, and like most old houses it was rather a tumble-down affair. Anyway, the back door had been blocked with a great stone, and the walls of the back hall had fallen in. There was no way out there. Sadly Peter <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little bedroom. He would wait until night, and perhaps then the Yellow Jackets would be asleep, and he could steal out the front way without getting any more stings. Meanwhile he would try to get a nap and forget his aches and pains.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{dictionary}} definition of the word [...] "diva", before cutting to a parking lot outside of a warehouse. Beyoncé, {{wearing a pair of}} [...] "dangle shades", walks past a car full of mannequin parts into the warehouse. From here, she is accompanied by her two dancers and a variety of high fashion outfits. When she states [...] "Diva's gettin' money..." [...] she waves a fan made of $100 bills. During the bridge to the climax, Beyoncé dances on a single light and then during the climax, she is seen very glossy in another wardrobe choice dancing in robotic movements to the beat with gold punctuating the black and white scene. In one scene, Beyoncé is seen dancing robotically in front of a set of gold-tinted mannequins; while in another, she dances against a wall with two large chains hanging from the ceiling. During the last chorus, Beyoncé is in her last wardrobe change in front of window which is where the paparazzi had taken photos of her. At the end of the song, Beyoncé walks <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parking lot. She lights up a cigar and throws the lighter into the car, letting it explode. As she walks away, the intro to [...] "Video Phone" [...] (a track from I Am... Sasha Fierce) plays. The explosion retains its original fiery colors in contrast with the black and white.|$|E

2500|$|Orci {{described}} the film's theme as [...] "being away from home", with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college. He wanted the focus between the robots and humans [...] "much more evenly balanced", [...] "the stakes [...] be higher", and {{more focused on}} the science fiction elements. Orci added he wanted to [...] "modulate" [...] the humor more, and felt he managed the more [...] "outrageous" [...] jokes by balancing them with a more serious plot approach to the Transformers mythology. Bay concurred {{that he wanted to}} please fans by making the tone darker, and that [...] "mums will think its safe enough to bring the kids <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies."

2500|$|On August 3, 1964, the MBTA succeeded the MTA, with an {{enlarged}} service area intended to subsidize continued commuter rail operations. The original 14-municipality MTA district was expanded to 78 cities and towns.

[...] The MBTA bought the Penn Central (New York Central and New Haven) commuter rail lines in January 1973, Penn Central equipment in April 1976, and all B commuter assets in December 1976; these purchases served {{to make the system}} state-owned with the private railroads retained solely as operators. [...] Only two branch lines were abandoned after 1976: service on the Lexington Branch (also with only one round trip daily) was discontinued in January 1977 after a snowstorm blocked the line, while the Lowell Line's full-service Woburn Branch was eliminated in January 1981 due to poor track conditions.|$|E
