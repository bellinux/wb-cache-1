Without it, up to 90% of frozen cells will become inactive. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10%DMSO, a freezing medium, and 30% fetal <b>bovine</b> <b>serum.</b> In the cryogenic freezing of heteroploid cell lines (MDCK, VERO, etc.) a mixture of 10%DMSO with 90%EMEM (70%EMEM + 30%fetal <b>bovine</b> <b>serum</b> + antibiotic mixture) is used.

The initial pool can also be derived from amplification of a single oligonucleotide strand. As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through in vitro evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the mRNA transcript of <b>bovine</b> <b>serum</b> albumin was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through deep sequencing analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.|$|E
25|$|In general, Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is {{advantageous}} if {{the sample}} is sensitive to pH change or harsh solvents typically used in other types of chromatography but not high salt concentrations. Commonly, it {{is the amount of}} salt in the buffer which is varied. In 2012, Müller and Franzreb described the effects of temperature on HIC using <b>Bovine</b> <b>Serum</b> Albumin (BSA) with four different types of hydrophobic resin. The study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of BSA onto the matrix. It was concluded that cycling temperature from 50 degrees to 10 degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all BSA from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times. Using temperature to effect change allows labs to cut costs on buying salt and saves money.|$|E

Cancer Inat. 28 r 679 - 697, 1962. ALTHOUGH SOME animal cells can be grown in serum-free medium (1 - 4), serum components are generally essential for growth, particularly from small inoculums (5), as is evident from various studies (6 - 8). In this laboratory, colonial propagation of animal cells frequently depends on supplementation of medium with human adult and <b>bovine</b> fetal <b>serums</b> in mixture. This report describes {{the effect of these}} serums on colony formation in a line of continuously cultivable cottontail rabbit cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS A line of epithelial-type cells (Minn. 57 - 8 - 19), established from the skin of an adult, papilloma-free cottontail rabbit by Syverton and asso-ciates, was designated CRE. A subline of the parental line was obtained by 2 serial isolations (passages 73 and 74) of colonies whose macroscopic morphology was designated as microcytic.

25|$|Microdispensing {{was used}} to create micropatterns on {{polystyrene}} culture dishes by dispensing droplets of adhesive laminin and non-adhesive <b>bovine</b> <b>serum</b> albumin (BSA) solutions. The microdispenser is a piezoelectric element attached to a push-bar {{on top of a}} channel etched in silicon, which has one inlet at each end and a nozzle in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate. With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{membrane}} has been chosen {{for its ability}} to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins, steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between {{the membrane}} and the antibody used for detection of the target protein. Blocking of non-specific binding is achieved by placing the membrane in a dilute solution of protein – typically 3–5% <b>bovine</b> <b>serum</b> albumin (BSA) or non-fat dry milk (both are inexpensive) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) or I-Block, with a minute percentage (0.1%) of detergent such as Tween 20 or Triton X-100. Although non-fat dry milk is preferred due to its availability, an appropriate blocking solution is needed as not all proteins in milk are compatible with all the detection bands. [...] The protein in the dilute solution attaches to the membrane in all places where the target proteins have not attached. Thus, when the antibody is added, there is no room on the membrane for it to attach other than on the binding sites of the specific target protein. This reduces background in the final product of the western blot, leading to clearer results, and eliminates false positives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{toxicity}} of snake venom is assessed by a toxicological test called the median lethal dose, LD50, (an abbreviation for [...] "lethal dose, 50%"), which determines {{the concentration of}} a toxin required to kill half {{the members of a}} tested population of animals. [...] The potency of the venom of wild snakes varies considerably, even within any single species. This is because of assorted influences such as biophysical environment, physiological status, ecological variables, genetic variation (either adaptive or incidental) and various other molecular- and ecological evolutionary factors. Such variation necessarily is smaller in captive populations in controlled laboratory settings though it cannot be eliminated altogether. However, studies to determine snake venom lethality or potency need to be designed to minimise variability and several techniques have been designed to this end. One approach that is considered particularly helpful is to use 0.1% <b>bovine</b> <b>serum</b> albumin (also known as [...] "Fraction V" [...] in Cohn process) as a diluent in determining LD50 values for various species. It results in far more accurate and consistent median lethal dose (LD50) determinations than for example using 0.1% saline as a diluent. Fraction V produces about 95% purified albumin, which is the dried crude venom. Saline as a diluent consistently produces widely varying LD50 results for nearly all venomous snakes; it produces unpredictable variation in the purity of the precipitate (range from 35-60%). Fraction V is structurally stable because it has seventeen disulfide bonds; it is unique in that it has the highest solubility and lowest isoelectric point of all the major plasma proteins. This makes it the final fraction to be precipitated from its solution. <b>Bovine</b> <b>serum</b> albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, which is near the pI of the proteins, and maintaining the ethanol concentration to be 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction. When the ultimate goal of plasma processing is a purified plasma component for injection or transfusion, the plasma component must be highly pure. The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. It is known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5oC and 3oC. [...] The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the [...] is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. [...] At each stage certain proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses less steps, and replaces centrifugation and bulk freezing with filtration and diafiltration. Some newer methods of albumin purification add additional purification steps to the Cohn Process and its variations. Chromatographic albumin processing {{as an alternative to the}} Cohn Process emerged in the early 1980s, however, it was not widely adopted until later due to the inadequate availability of large scale chromatography equipment. Methods incorporating chromatography generally begin with cryo-depleted plasma undergoing buffer exchange via either diafiltration or buffer exchange chromatography, to prepare the plasma for following ion exchange chromatography steps. After ion exchange there are generally further chromatographic purification steps and buffer exchange.|$|E
40|$|Amounts {{of rapidly}} rumen degradable protein in forage plants breed {{to a lower}} N-Use-Efficiency (NUE). Secondary plant metabolites, like tannins are able to protect forage protein against inefficient ruminal degradation. Feeding forage plants {{containing}} moderate concentrations of tannins may increase the sustainability in organic dairy production. This study was carried out to investigate the potential of several home-grown plants to bind forage protein and thus decrease ruminal N losses. A choice of six weeds and nine legumes were analyzed {{in terms of the}} composition of crude protein according to the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System, levels of condensed tannins (CT), total phenols (TP) and the ability to precipitate the model protein <b>Bovines</b> <b>Serum</b> Albumin (BSA). As it was expected sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) showed above-average CT- and TP-concentrations as well as high protein precipitation capacities (PPC). Across the entire spectrum of species, a positive correlation between the CT concentration and the PPC was observed (p ≤ 0, 001). Without any CT but highest TP concentration measured Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor) also showed protein precipitation capacities. This result indicates that CT concentration cannot be considered as the sole criterion for evaluating the protein binding capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{short term}} {{kinetics}} of labelling RNA fractions of HeLa cells with [5 ‐ 3 H]uridine have been studied, {{as well as}} the distribution of 32 P among their nucleotides after 30 minutes incubation. The fractions were obtained from a methylated <b>bovine</b> albumin <b>serum</b> column after amyl alcohol‐chloroform isolation. Emphasis was given especially to a “DNA‐bound RNA” stable in caesium sulfate and to a “free RNA component”, both eluting with the DNA from the methylated <b>bovine</b> albumin <b>serum</b> column. The results indicate that the “DNA‐bound RNA” is rich in [32 P]uridylic plus adenylic acid, whilst the free component is rich in [32 P]cytidylic plus guanilic acid; [3 H]uridine appears in both these fractions before it can be detected in the other RNA and both become more rapidly saturated with the label. After very short incubation times, the “DNA‐bound RNA” is completely resistant to ribonuclease, but its susceptibility to the enzyme increases progressively at longer incubations. These results are compatible with a possible precursor role of the “DNA‐bound RNA” for mRNA and perhaps for rRNAs and tRNAs as well. Copyright © 1968, Wiley Blackwell.
