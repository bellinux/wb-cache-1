40|$|We {{introduce}} mapping-variable ring polymer {{molecular dynamics}} (MV-RPMD), a model dynamics for the direct simulation of multi-electron processes. An {{extension of the}} RPMD idea, this method {{is based on an}} exact, imaginary time path-integral representation of the quantum Boltzmann operator using continuous Cartesian variables for both electronic states and nuclear degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the accuracy of the MV-RPMD approach in calculations of real-time, thermal correlation functions for a range of two-state single-mode model systems with different coupling strengths and asymmetries. Further, we show that the ensemble of classical trajectories employed in these simulations preserves the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> and <b>provides</b> a direct probe into real-time coupling between electronic state transitions and nuclear dynamics.

40|$|Estimation of {{distribution}} algorithms construct an explicit {{model of the}} problem to be solved, and then use this model to guide the search for good solutions. For an important class of fitness functions, namely those with k-bounded epistasis, {{it is possible to}} construct a complete explicit representation of the fitness function by sampling the fitness function. A very natural model of the problem to be solved is the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> of the fitness function, which is an exponential of the fitness normalized to a probability distribution. As the exponentiation factor (inverse temperature) of the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> is increased, probability is increasingly concentrated on the set of optimal points. We show that for fitness functions of k-bounded epistasis that satisfy an additional property called the running intersection property, an explicit computable exact factorization of the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> with an arbitrary exponentiation factor can be constructed. This factorization allows the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>distribution</b> to be efficiently sampled, which leads to an algorithm which finds the optimum with high probability. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We present biRNA, a novel {{algorithm}} for {{prediction of}} binding sites between two RNAs based on minimization of binding free energy. Similar to RNAup approach [29], we assume the binding free energy {{is the sum}} of accessibility and the interaction free energies. Our algorithm maintains tractability and speed and also has two important advantages over previous similar approaches: 1) it is able to predict multiple simultaneous binding sites and 2) it computes a more accurate interaction free energy by considering both intramolecular and intermolecular base pairing. Moreover, biRNA can handle crossing interactions as well as hairpins interacting in a zigzag fashion. To deal with simultaneous accessibility of binding sites, our algorithm models their joint probability of being unpaired. Since computing the exact joint probability distribution is intractable, we approximate the joint probability by a polynomially representable graphical model namely a Chow-Liu tree-structured Markov Random Field. Experimental results show that biRNA outperforms RNAup and also support the accuracy of our approach. Our proposed Bayesian approximation of the <b>Boltzmann</b> joint probability <b>distribution</b> <b>provides</b> a powerful, novel framework that can also be utilized in other applications. ...|$|R
