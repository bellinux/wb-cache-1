On adding ventilation slots a comparable drag reduction is achieved but at a greatly reduced cavity depth.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{turbulent}} base flows and the drag {{associated with it}} have been of significant interest in missile as well as fighter aircraft design. Numerous studies in the literature have been devoted to aspects of reducing base drag on two-dimensional {{as well as on}} axisymmetric bodies. This paper presents a review of the developments that have taken place on the use of passive techniques or devices for axisymmetric base and net afterbody drag reduction in the absence of jet flow at the base. In particular, the paper discusses the effectiveness of base cavities, ventilated cavities, locked vortex afterbodies, multi-step afterbodies and afterbodies employing a non-axisymmetric <b>boat-tailing</b> concept for base and net drag reduction in diflerent speed regimes. The broad features of the flow and the likely fluid-dynamical 13; mechanisms associated with the device leading to base drag reduction are highlighted. Flight-test results assessing the effectiveness of some of the devices are compared with data from wind tunnels. The present survey indicates that base and net afterbody drag reduction of considerable engineering significance in aerospace applications can be achieved by various passive devices even when the (unmanipulated) base flow is not characterised by vortex shedding...|$|R
40|$|Supersonic {{axisymmetric}} base flows are prototypical for flows behind projectiles and missiles. For these flows, drag reduction can {{be achieved}} by means of passive control of the near wake. Thereby, large (turbulent) coherent structures play a dominant role. The objective of the present investigation is to elucidate if and how successful passive flow control techniques modify these structures. To this end, first Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) for a Reynolds number of ReD = 100; 000 and Mach number of Ma = 2 : 46 were performed using a high-order accurate and highly parallelized research code which was developed at the University of Arizona. Thereby, roughly 52 million grid points were employed. The DNS data serve to visualize typical structures of the unsteady flow field and to verify that the use of less computational costly RANS/LES methods is applicable for this flow. Two of these methods, the Flow Simulation Methodology (FSM) and Detached Eddy Simulations (DES), were then employed to investigate the supersonic base flow at ReD = 3 : 3 106 and Ma = 2 : 46 using between 460, 000 and seven million grid points. For the DES, the commercial CFD-code Cobalt was employed. This unstructured grid solver allowed then to perform simulations with <b>boat-tailing.</b> The obtained mean flow data is compared to available experimental result...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} fluidic {{actuation}} on the wake and drag of a 3 D blunt body is experimentally investigated. The wake is forced by jets pulsed tangentially {{to the main}} flow with variable frequency and velocity. Depending on the forcing conditions, two flow regimes can be identified. First, for a broadband range of frequencies comprising the natural wake instabilities, the convection of the jet structures enhances wake entrainment, shortening the recirculating flow length with an augmentation of the bluff body drag. Further increase of the actuation frequency induces a wake fluidic <b>boat-tailing</b> by shear-layer deviation. It additionally lowers turbulent intensity and entrainment of high momentum fluid in the shear layer, leading to an overall reduction of the wake fluctuating kinetic energy. The association of both mechanisms is responsible for a raise of base pressure and decrease of the model's drag. The physical features of such regimes are discussed {{on the basis of}} drag, pressure and velocity measurements at several upstream conditions and control parameters. By adding curved surfaces at the jet outlets {{to take advantage of the}} so-called Coanda effect, periodic actuation can be further reinforced leading to drag reductions of about 20 % in unsteady regime. In general, the unsteady Coanda blowing not only intensifies the base pressure recovery but also preserves the effect of unsteady high frequency forcing on the turbulent field. The present results encourage the development of fluidic control in road vehicles' aerodynamics as well as provide a complement to our current understanding of bluff body drag and its manipulation.

40|$|Passenger {{vehicles}} {{are considered to}} be bluff bodies, and therefore their total aerodynamic resistance is dominated by the pressure drag, which is basically the difference between the stagnation pressure at the front and the pressure at the base. In particular, the base wake of a vehicle has a significant influence on the total drag, and the ways to reduce and to control the drag {{have been the subject of}} numerous investigations. The present work focuses on the identification and analysis of unsteady-flow structures acting on the base wake of a sport utility vehicle with rear-end extensions and without rear-end extensions. Tapered extensions have proved to be an effective way to reduce the drag since they act as a truncated <b>boat-tailing</b> device which improves the pressure recovery zone and reduces the wake size. In this investigation, wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics were used to study the forces acting on the vehicle and the non-stationary behaviour of the rear wake flow. For analysis of the unsteady base pressures, a data-structure-sensitive filtering approach based on empirical mode decomposition in combination with fast Fourier transform and proper orthogonal decomposition was used. The numerical results and the experimental results complement each other well, and both revealed an antisymmetric mode in the transverse plane related to a flapping of the wake at a Strouhal number of around 0. 23. Furthermore, a pumping effect, which is a main contributor to the drag, was observed at Strouhal values of between 0. 04 and 0. 07. This is in good agreement with the results from the research on more simplified model shapes. The rear extensions proved to be a productive way to reduce the drag coefficient and the magnitude of the wake flapping for the yaw angles investigated...|$|R
40|$|Political {{legislation}} and consumer requirements for a sustainable society require that vehicle manufacturers focus on reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. A {{reduction in the}} overall energy consumption can be directly linked to a decrease of the driving resistance, where the aerodynamic drag significantly contributes at velocities above 70 km/h. On passenger vehicles, and {{this is particularly true}} for Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), the total aerodynamic drag mainly consists of the so called pressure drag, which is the difference between the stagnation pressure at the front and a pressure deficit in the base wake. This thesis experimentally and numerically investigates the wake shape behind a Volvo XC 60 in order to further improve the understanding of the main flow physics, both for time-averaged flow and in unsteady conditions. To increase the base pressure, and hence, to reduce the aerodynamic drag, tapered extensions are implemented. Their effect on the surrounding near-wake and their impact on the global forces under different yaw angles are studied and discussed. All experimental measurements are conducted in the Volvo Cars Aerodynamic Wind-Tunnel, where in addition to the traditional time-averaged measurements, a procedure for the determination of the fluctuating pressure is used. Numerically, a methodology based on Spalart-Allmaras Delayed-Detached Eddy Simulation, SA-DDES, suitable for complex geometries at high Reynolds numbers, is developed. The results confirm that the extensions reduce drag and act as a truncated <b>boat-tailing</b> device smoothing out the pressure recovery zone. It is found that key to the design of the extensions is the guidance of the flow such that the flow enters the separation zone in a longitudinal direction. This is accomplished through a guiding vane or "kicker". It is also shown that this device enables a better yaw response of the vehicle that is less sensitive to changes in yaw conditions, while rear-lift values are kept within acceptable limits. With respect to the numerical results, an unsteady methodology that can handle the complex geometries typical for automotive flows has been developed. The methodology is tuned to fit the requirements in lead time that are acceptable and feasible for industrial applications. The results confirm an improved representation of the flow field that is comparable to the wind tunnel measurements...|$|R
