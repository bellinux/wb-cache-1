5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Trent {{is widely}} {{known for its}} {{tendency}} to cause significant flooding along its course, {{and there is a}} well documented flood history extending back for some 900 years. In Nottingham the heights of significant historic floods from 1852 have been carved into a <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment</b> next to Trent Bridge, with flood marks being transferred from the medieval Hethbeth bridge that pre-dated the existing 19th-century crossing. Historic flood levels have also been recorded at Girton and on the churchyard wall at Collingham.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of the new}} bridge {{began in}} November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment</b> encroached on its right-of-way; {{eventually}} the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, {{and the federal government}} paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find solid ground on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction of a cofferdam and extensive excavation and investigation of the riverbed. A major flood in 1888 damaged some of the work, and caused further delays.|$|E

25|$|Bridgnorth tunnel was relined in two {{separate}} places during operation and {{was a source of}} some trouble over the years, but the most recent regularly scheduled inspection by Network Rail has found it to be in general good order. Both portals are currently blocked off and the southern end has been encroached onto by the garden of the house located adjacent to the former <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment.</b> The northern suburbs of Bridgnorth low town block the trackbed around 100 yards north of the tunnel, with 22 houses and a new road on the original alignment. The proponents have identified solutions that would avoid much of the existing housing. The next section to the north is covered by a golf course that regularly suffers flooding in the winter. There are no sizable populations in the valley above Bridgnorth before Coalport.|$|E
25|$|As Ferrel was docking at the Port of Corpus Christi in Texas on 17 September 1986, Evelyn Langanke {{fell from}} a <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment</b> near the ship into a 35-foot- (10.7-meter-) deep ship channel. Ferrels {{executive}} officer, Lieutenant Commander Ted I. Lillestolen, NOAA Corps, noted that Langanke was in trouble, {{ran from the}} ship, entered the water, and swam to the woman, who was thrashing feebly when he reached her. He made a proper lifesaving approach and towed the unconscious woman to shore. Commander Robert E. Hunt, NOAA Corps, and Lieutenant Paul E. Pegnato, NOAA Corps, both also of Ferrel, came to Langankes medical assistance, with Hunt using cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive her and Pegnato administering oxygen and first aid to stabilize her condition. Langanke had suffered a partially collapsed lung, and their rescue and medical actions were crucial in saving her life. For saving and assisting Langanke, the three men received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|The bridge {{design process}} {{had begun in}} 1853, during the {{administration}} of President Franklin Pierce and the Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis. [...] Captain Meigs' 1861 order also called for a tablet on the west <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment,</b> with the title, [...] "Washington Aqueduct" [...] and listing the political leaders that were in office both {{at the start of}} the project and at its completion (i.e., Pierce and Davis; President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Simon Cameron). [...] By 1862, however, Davis had left the Union to become President of the Confederate States of America. [...] There was resentment among some members of Congress about the inscription of Davis' name on the bridge, and this led to an order that his name be removed from the tablet. The Department of the Interior, which was managing the aqueduct at that time, ordered the removal of the inscription.|$|E

[...] Along the route of the Waimate Gorge Branch out of Waimate, the line's formation including a cutting, a <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment,</b> and some brick culverts can be located, and for about 5km, a walkway follows the route of the line beside the Waihao River. [...] At Waihao Forks, the old station still sits on a hillside with a carriage nearby, and at Waihao Downs, the loading bank and goods shed both exist in relatively good condition, though the goods shed has been added to on one side. [...] Continuing past Waihao Downs, some of the formation created for the never-built extension is still visible.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the bridge}} was being {{designed}} and constructed, it {{was referred to as}} [...] "Union Arch", [...] "Bridge No. 4" [...] or [...] "Cabin John Bridge" [...] in drawings and government correspondence. The latter two names, however, do not appear in any of the stone carvings that were eventually placed on the bridge. [...] In 1861, as {{the bridge was}} nearing completion, the Army drew up initial plans for inscription of commemorative stone tablets to be installed on the bridge. Meigs, who had been promoted to the rank of Captain, issued an order in March 1861 for a tablet on the east <b>bridge</b> <b>abutment.</b> [...] The text was to consist of a title, [...] "Union Bridge," [...] and the names of the principal designers, namely Meigs and Assistant Engineer Alfred L. Rives. [...] By the time the war began, however, Rives had joined the Confederate Army. [...] The final tablet design was modified with the title [...] "Union Arch" [...] and [...] "Alfred L. Rives" [...] was replaced with [...] "Esto Perpetua" [...] ("Let it last forever.").|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} is an investigation {{on the possible}} use of MSE <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments</b> as direct support of bridges on Indiana highways. First, analysis was performed following conventional design methods, {{in order to assess}} the performance of MSE <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments</b> with respect to ultimate limit states, i. e. external and internal stability. In {{the second part of the}} study, finite element analysis was performed, in order to assess the performance of the structures with respect to serviceability limit states, i. e. immediate and consolidation settlements. In both parts, analysis was performed on case examples that reflect relatively typical situations. The main findings confirm that the currently available methods of design provide the necessary methodology in order to design MSE <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments</b> by satisfying external and internal stability criteria. In terms of deformations, the main findings of the finite element analysis indicate that the fraction of settlements that are caused due to the bridge loads is small compared to the fraction that is caused by the MSE self-weight. Overall, the implementation of the work reported herein, would require a detailed site investigation. Based on these findings and information already available from the literature, it was concluded that the use of MSE walls as direct <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments</b> would be reliable under certain conditions.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the range of}} scour types that may occur at <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments,</b> and addresses the extensive attendant difficulties confronting accurate estimation of abutment-scour depth. The difficulties, which include similitude aspects of laboratory experiments on scour at <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments,</b> complicate the development of reliable scour-estimation relationships. In a practical sense, the difficulties imply that estimation relationships can only be of approximate accuracy. They stem from {{the nature of the}} approach flow–field, the soil and sediment conditions at typical abutments, and thereby from the mix of scour and slope-stability failure processes potentially at play in the vicinity of <b>bridge</b> <b>abutments.</b> The full set of failure processes has yet to be determined and documented, and inevitably entails extensive investigative experiments using laboratory flumes. Arguably, the difficulties have muddled perceptions of scour extents observed at bridge sites, and have contributed to a certain level of skepticism regarding existing relationships used for scour-depth estimation...|$|R
