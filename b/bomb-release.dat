5000|$|... 1 March-June 1943: VP-203 {{commenced}} regular operational duties {{under the}} operational control of FAW-5, escorting convoys and conducting ASW patrols. The ﬁrst {{attack on a}} U-boat took place on 10 June 1943, but with negative results due to a defective <b>bomb-release</b> mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Swiatecki bomb slip, a <b>bomb-release</b> {{system was}} invented by Władysław Świątecki in 1925 and {{patented}} in the 1926 in Poland and abroad. Some components {{was used in the}} pre-war Polish PZL.37 Łoś (Elk) bomber. In 1940 Świątecki's invention was taken over by the British, who used it in the Avro Lancaster bomber. In 1943, an updated version was created by Jerzy Rudlicki for the American B-17 Flying Fortress.|$|E
5000|$|The Soviet Air Force soon {{expressed}} interest in the design {{as an alternative to}} the Polikarpov R-Z then replacing the Polikarpov R-5 in the reconnaissance-bomber role. A single prototype was built of a KhAI-1VV (for Военный Вариант - Voennii Variant - [...] "Military Variant"), armed with a rear-mounted machine gun, and bombs carried in internal racks. While performance was impressive, the <b>bomb-release</b> mechanism proved troublesome, and as development dragged on, the Air Force gradually lost interest.|$|E
5000|$|After {{climbing}} {{to regain the}} height lost, Brown decided to test the tail-mounted, clamshell-like dive brake and automatic pull-out equipment. The Dornier entered the dive automatically when the dive switch was selected and soon attained its [...] "braked condition", limiting the airspeed to 575 km/h. The pull-out was initiated by hitting the <b>bomb-release</b> stick on the control column or selecting the [...] "level flight" [...] switch, which also retracted the dive-brake. Brown stated, [...] "All very sedate and totally unimpressive as a precision weapon".|$|E
5000|$|Świątecki {{designed}} a <b>bomb-release</b> system in 1923. His invention was patented in 1926 in Poland and abroad. The first use was {{planned for the}} Karaś P.23 light bomber and for Łoś bomber [...] but not used. From 1930 the inventor produced the [...] "Swiatecki bomb slip" [...] in own branch in Lublin. First use of his invention took place in 1925 when the Polish Navy mounted it in imported aircraft - Cant Z-506B. Świątecki sold licences from 1937 to France - Gardy, and Italy - Caproni.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} Luftwaffe's He 111, the Sparviero's bomb bay was {{configured}} to carry bombs vertically, preventing large bombs from being accommodated internally. The aircraft could hold two 500 kg, five 250 kg, 12 100 or 50 kg bombs, {{or hundreds of}} bomblets. The bombardier, with an 85° forward field of view, had a [...] "Jozza-2" [...] aiming system {{and a series of}} <b>bomb-release</b> mechanisms. The machine gun {{to the rear of the}} gondola prevented the bombardier from lying in a prone position, and as a result, the bombardier was provided with retractable structures to support his legs while seated.|$|E
5000|$|Originally a B-24 Liberator bomber {{squadron}} in the Pacific Theater of World War II, assigned {{directly to}} Headquarters, Thirteenth Air Force. The squadron {{was equipped with}} radar equipped Liberators (unofficially designated as the SB-24 [...] "Snooper") with an extra crew member to operate the SCR-717 10 cm radar; the SCR-729 aircraft radar beacon {{and a number of}} other specialized devices. The mission of the squadron was for low level, anti-shipping strikes under the cover of darkness. They had this capability because the radar-sighting devices permitted operation of the <b>bomb-release</b> mechanism irrespective of visual sighting of the target.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} factor {{was the need}} for a specially adapted version of the Lancaster, the B.III (Special), officially the [...] "Type 464 (Provisioning)". The bomb bay doors were removed and the ends of the bay were covered with fairings. Upkeep was suspended on pivoted, vee-shaped struts which sprang apart when the <b>bomb-release</b> button was pressed. A drive belt and pulley to rotate the bomb at 500 rpm was mounted on the starboard strut and driven by a hydraulic motor housed in the forward fairing. The mid-upper turret was removed and a more bulbous bomb aimer's blister was fitted. The first adapted aircraft arrived at Scampton on 8 April.|$|E
50|$|Hans Plendt at the German Laboratory for Aviation {{investigated}} {{changes in}} the LEF commercial system to allow more direct guidance for Luftwaffe aircraft and also to give relatively precise location to the aircraft; this was particularly useful for <b>bomb-release</b> points. Code-named X-Leitstrahlbake (Directional Beacon), in 1937 this was accepted by the Luftwaffe. Lorenz received a contract for supplying the ground equipment, and the aircraft receivers {{were the same as}} used in the LEF. By 1939, Germany had installed X-Leitstrahlbake stations radiating into other countries, including Great Britain, but they did not raise suspicions since the signals were essentially the same as those from the standard Lorenz LEF system. The X-Leitstrahlbake was used when night-time bombing began in 1940. The British developed countermeasure beams, followed by further improvements by the Germans.|$|E
5000|$|Around April 1945, Captain Ariizumi, the man {{appointed}} {{to carry out}} the attack, decided the Seiran pilots would make kamikaze ramming attacks against the gates, rather than conventional bombing runs, a tactic becoming increasingly common as the war went against the Japanese. The Seiran squadron leader had already suggested as much to Ariizumi earlier that month, though for a time this was kept secret from the other pilots. At the end of May, however, one pilot happened to observe a Seiran having its <b>bomb-release</b> mechanism removed and replaced with a fixed mount. Realizing the implications of this change, he angrily confronted the executive officer of the squadron, who explained that the decision to withhold this intention from the other men was made to [...] "avoid mental pressures on the aircrews." ...|$|E
50|$|When the {{aircraft}} was reasonably {{close to the}} target, a light on the contact altimeter came on to indicate the <b>bomb-release</b> point, usually at a minimum height of 450 m. The pilot released the bomb and initiated the automatic pull-out mechanism by depressing a knob on the control column. An elongated U-shaped crutch located under the fuselage swung the bomb {{out of the way}} of the propeller, and {{the aircraft}} automatically began a 6 g pullout. Once the nose was above the horizon, dive brakes were retracted, the throttle was opened, and the propeller was set to climb. The pilot regained control and resumed normal flight.

50|$|It was {{normally}} {{operated by}} a three-man crew; the seating arrangement could be altered in orders to suit various purposes, such as to better enable a specific training role. The cockpit was outfitted with dual flying controls {{and a pair of}} seats, intended to accommodate a pilot and either a navigator or second pilot alongside. When used for bomb aimer training, the second set of controls would be removed and the freed-up space was instead used to accommodate a prone bomb-aimer. When used as a navigation trainer, the second seat was pushed back so that it would line up with the chart table. Aft of the cockpit was a wireless operator station, facing aft on the starboard side of the fuselage. On the Oxford I, a dorsal turret was located amidships; it could be used for training navigators, bomb-aimers, wireless operators, air gunners and camera operators. The center section can contain up to 16 11 lb. practice bombs, which are controlled via <b>bomb-release</b> switches installed at the pilot and bomb-aimers' stations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1943, 617 Squadron {{was created}} to carry out Operation Chastise, the raid against the Ruhr dams. This unit was {{equipped}} with B.III (Specials), officially designated the [...] "Type 464 (Provisioning)", modified to carry the 9250 lb [...] "Upkeep" [...] bouncing bomb. The bomb bay doors were removed and {{the ends of the}} bomb bay were covered with fairings. [...] "Upkeep" [...] was suspended on laterally pivoted, vee-shaped struts which sprang apart beamwise when the <b>bomb-release</b> button was pressed. A drive belt and pulley to rotate the bomb at 500 rpm was mounted on the starboard strut and driven by a hydraulic motor housed in the forward fairing. The mid-upper turret was removed and a more bulbous bomb aimer's blister was fitted; this, as [...] "Mod. 780", later becoming standard on all Lancasters, while the bombsight was replaced by a simple aiming device. Two Aldis lights were fitted in the rear bomb bay fairing; the optimum height for dropping [...] "Upkeep" [...] was 60 ft and, when shone on the relatively smooth waters of the dam's reservoirs, the light beams converged into a single spot when the Lancaster was flying at the correct height.|$|E

The lost art of campaign analysis was revived in the 1990 s, but often over- emphasizes high fidelity or comprehensive simulation. OA 460...|$|E
