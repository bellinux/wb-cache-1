6000|$|I {{hope that}} in {{describing}} {{the spirit of the}} English Press I {{do not seem to be}} writing with any personal bitterness. I admit that there might be a certain reason for such a bias. During my stay in England I was most anxious to appear as a contributor to some of the leading papers. This is, with the English, a thing that always adds prestige. To be able to call oneself a [...] "contributor" [...] to the Times or to Punch or the Morning Post or the Spectator, is a high honour. I have met these [...] "contributors" [...] all over the British Empire. Some, I admit, look strange. An ancient wreck in the <b>back</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> an Ontario tavern (ancient regime) has told me that he was a contributor to the Times: the janitor of the building where I lived admits that he is a contributor to Punch: a man arrested in Bristol for vagrancy while I was in England pleaded that he was a contributor to the Spectator. In fact, it is an honour that everybody seems to be able to get but me.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, {{the museum}} {{changed the way}} it {{displayed}} its Russell works. [...] Previously, the museum had displayed the best-known and biggest pieces more prominently, with smaller pieces surrounding them to enhance their appearance. The museum now began displaying pieces chronologically, to show how Russell developed as an artist. Among the early works were two small oil paintings Russell did {{at the age of}} 13 and another painted when he was 14. That same year, the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences (an agency of the U.S. federal government), gave the museum $150,000 to enhance is curatorial capacity. The museum raised another $305,000 to match the grant. A month later, the Dufresne Foundation (a local philanthropic foundation) gave the museum $100,000. Restructuring of the galleries continued in 2005. [...] The museum moved the 200-piece Browning Firearms Collection {{to the front of the}} museum and installed the original <b>back</b> <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> the Mint Saloon in one of the galleries. The museum also opened a cafe in the museum, which proved to be highly popular.

In the book he gave the example of the toll-free telephone number on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bar</b> <b>of</b> Ivory soap, which one could call with questions or comments about the product. Gladwell's opinion is that only those who are passionate or knowledgeable about soap would bother to call and that this is a method by which the company could inexpensively glean valuable information about their market.|$|R

40|$|In {{shipbuilding}} {{and many}} other industries, copper weld <b>backing</b> <b>bars</b> are used to draw the heat out of the weld. The problem that some users <b>of</b> these <b>bars</b> encounter is that these bars, on occasion, actually melt in spots and become welded to the weld plates. After this happens a number <b>of</b> times, the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> becomes so degraded {{that it must be}} either discarded or machined, both of which are very costly and time-consuming actions. To avoid this fusion between the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> and the weld plate, the weld processes that are used cannot be ones of high beat input. This requirement is very limiting when thick plates are being welded. The plates must be beveled, and more weld passes must be run. These problems are also costly and time consuming. The aim of this project is {{to find a way to}} produce <b>backing</b> <b>bars</b> with nearly the same `chilling` effect but with both a greater resistance to molten metal and resistance to arcing to the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> itself. A possible solution currently being tested is to coat the copper bars with a thin layer of a ceramic coating.

40|$|During strong earthquakes, {{structural}} pounding {{may occur}} between {{the equipment and}} the surrounding moat wall because of the limited separation distance and the deformations of the isolator. A potential mitigation measure for this problem is the incorporation <b>of</b> collision <b>bumpers.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the paper is to study the experimental dynamic response and to formulate numerical model of a base-isolated SDOF oscillator excited by a harmonic base acceleration and symmetrically bounded by two unilateral deformable and dissipative constraints. Static tests have been first performed to determine the static characteristics and the support conditions <b>of</b> the <b>bumpers,</b> and successively, shaking table tests {{have been carried out}} to investigate two different configurations: the absence and the presence <b>of</b> <b>bumpers.</b> In both configurations, tests were carried out with the same type of excitation to the base. Different values of the table acceleration peak were applied, different amplitude values of the total gap between mass and bumpers were considered, and also two different types <b>of</b> <b>bumpers</b> were employed. The experimental dynamic responses in the absence and in the presence <b>of</b> <b>bumpers</b> have been compared, and the results obtained in the presence <b>of</b> <b>bumpers</b> have also been used to identify some characteristics of the dynamics with impact (force and time of contact between mass and bumpers, energy dissipated by the bumpers during the impact, and coefficient of restitution).
