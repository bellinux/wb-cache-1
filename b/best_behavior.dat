The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held {{as something of a}} hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's <b>best</b> <b>behavior.</b> Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E

40|$|Reinforcement Learning {{techniques}} such as Q-learning are commonly studied {{in the context of}} two-player repeated games. However, Q-learning fails to converge to <b>best</b> response <b>behavior</b> even against simple strategies such as Tit-for-two-Tat. Opponent Modeling (OM) can be used to overcome this problem. This article shows that OM based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) can represent a large class of opponent strategies. A variation of McCallum’s Utile Distinction Memory algorithm is presented as a means to compute such a POMDP opponent model. This technique is based on Baum-Welch maximum likelihood estimation and uses a t-test to adjust the number of model states. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can identify the structure of strategies against which pure Q-learning is insufficient. This provides a basis for <b>best</b> response <b>behavior</b> against a larger class of strategies. ...|$|R

In this industry, all functions (e. g., planning, scheduling and maintenance) are automated {{and in order}} to remain competitive researchers attempt to design an adaptive control system which optimizes the process, but also able to adapt to rapidly evolving demands at a fixed cost. In this paper, we present a multi-agent approach for the dynamic task scheduling in petroleum industry production system. Agents simultaneously insure effective production scheduling and the continuous improvement of the solution quality by means of reinforcement learning, using the SARSA algorithm. Reinforcement learning allows the agents to adapt, learning the <b>best</b> <b>behaviors</b> for their various roles without reducing the performance or reactivity.

40|$|Managing the {{response}} to natural, man-made and technical disasters becomes increasingly important {{in the light of}} climate change, globalization, urbanization and growing conflicts. Sudden onset disasters are typically characterized by high stakes, time pressure and uncertain, conflicting or lacking information. Since the planning and management of response is a complex task, decision makers of aid organizations can thus benefit from decision support methods and tools. A key task is the joint allocation of rescue units and the scheduling of incidents under different conditions of collaboration. We present an approach to support decision makers, who coordinate response units, by (a) suggesting mathematical formulations of decision models, (b) providing heuristic solution procedures and (c) evaluating the heuristics against both current <b>best</b> practice <b>behavior</b> and optimal solutions. Our computational experiments show that, for the generated problem instances, (1) current <b>best</b> practice <b>behavior</b> can be improved substantially by our heuristics, (2) the gap between heuristic and optimal solutions is very low for instances without collaboration and (3) our heuristics are capable of providing solutions for all generated instances in less than a second on a state-of-the-art PC...|$|R

The generalized RPS game is a representative mathematical model to illustrate the game dynamics, appearing widely in textbook. However, how actual motions in these games depend on the incentive has never been report quantitatively. Using the data from 7 games with different incentives, including 84 groups of 6 subjects playing the game in 300 -round, with random-pair tournaments and local information recorded, we find that, both on social and individual level, the actual motions are changing continuously with the incentive. More expressively, some representative findings are, (1) in social collective strategy transit views, the forward transition vector field {{is more and more}} centripetal as the stability of the system increasing; (2) In the individual behavior of strategy transit view, there exists a phase transformation as the stability of the systems increasing, and the phase transformation point being near the standard RPS; (3) Conditional response behaviors are structurally changing accompanied by the controlled incentive.
