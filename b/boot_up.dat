25|$|Dolphin {{was first}} {{released}} in September 2003 by programmers Henrik Rydg√•rd (ector) and F|RES as an experimental Nintendo GameCube emulator that could <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> and run commercial games. Audio {{was not yet}} emulated, and there were performance issues. Many games crashed on start up or barely ran at all; average speed was from 2 to 20 frames per second (FPS). Its name refers to the development code name for the GameCube.|$|E
25|$|Flash drives {{implement}} the USB mass storage device class so that most modern operating systems can {{read and write}} to them without installing device drivers. The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices. The operating system can use any file system or block addressing scheme. Some computers can <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> from flash drives.|$|E

25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 2012, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 8 to the public. One edition, Windows RT, runs on some system-on-a-chip devices with mobile 32-bit ARM (ARMv7) processors. Windows 8 {{features a}} redesigned user interface, {{designed to make}} it easier for touchscreen users to use Windows. The interface introduced an updated Start menu known as the Start screen, and a new full-screen application platform. The desktop interface is also present for running windowed applications, although Windows RT will not run any desktop applications not included in the system. On the Building Windows 8 blog, it was announced that a computer running Windows 8 can <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> much faster than Windows 7. New features also include USB 3.0 support, the Windows Store, the ability to run from USB drives with Windows To Go, and others. Windows 8 was given the kernel number NT 6.2, with its successor 8.1 receiving the kernel number 6.3. So far, neither has had any service packs yet, although many consider Windows 8.1 to be a service pack for Windows 8.|$|E
500|$|Morrowinds soundtrack was {{composed}} by Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose previous soundtracks for Total Annihilation and Icewind Dale had earned some acclaim from the gaming press. In a Bethesda press release, Soule stated that the [...] "epic quality" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series was [...] "particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music" [...] that Soule enjoys composing [...] "the most". Outside Bethesda press releases, some have criticized Morrowinds soundtrack. In their reviews of the game, both GameSpot and GameSpy criticized {{the length of the}} game's soundtrack and praised its general production quality. In the words of GameSpot's Greg Kasavin: [...] "The very first time you <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> Morrowind, you'll be treated to a memorable, stirring theme filled with soaring strings and booming percussion. You'll proceed to hear it literally every five minutes or so during play." [...] Soule was aware of the problem and chose to create a soft and minimalist score so as not to wear out players' ears.|$|E

2500|$|The 64DD has a chip {{containing}} {{an enhanced}} font and audio library for all software to share, further saving the potential available space of mass storage on cartridges and disks. The 64DD has a 32-bit coprocessor {{to help it}} read disks and to transfer data to the main console. The main Nintendo 64 deck uses its RCP and NEC VR4300 to process data from the top cartridge slot and the I/O devices. [...] Like nearly all disc-based consoles, the 64DD can <b>boot</b> <b>up</b> without a cartridge on the top deck, {{because it has a}} boot menu.
