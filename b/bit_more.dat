In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E

Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary.

It became a depression on August 16, turned a little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E

According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a <b>bit</b> <b>more,</b> reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
