5|$|At 09:00, Washington {{arrived from}} Manhattan. He {{realized}} that he had <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always <b>been</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had <b>been</b> <b>wrong,</b> possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E

5000|$|The {{architectural}} historian Nikolaus Pevsner {{was very}} critical of the building's architecture, saying: [...] "The scale <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> the symmetry <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> The proximity to a classical façade put up by the same firm {{at the same time}} <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the goings-on of a store behind such a façade (and below those twisted Tudor chimneys) <b>are</b> <b>wrongest</b> of all".|$|R

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law in so far as they applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had <b>been</b> <b>wrong,</b> and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E
5|$|U 956 {{was first}} {{documented}} by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the inscription was legible {{in spite of the}} stone having been split in two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in south-eastern Europe from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being split in two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E

5|$|Later {{commenting on}} this source, Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author {{did not appear}} to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending double play. This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to have <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> by video replays.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, news of Henry's {{death had}} reached Stephen of Blois, {{conveniently}} placed in Boulogne, {{and he left}} for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December {{and over the next}} week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return, and his brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.|$|E

5|$|The {{crowds in}} London {{traditionally}} claimed {{a right to}} elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return. Henry of Blois delivered {{the support of the}} church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, who was both the Bishop of Salisbury and the Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury to be handed over to Stephen. On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> to insist that his court take the oath.|$|E

In the United States, on the other hand, mainstream economics goes on as if the controversy had never occurred. Macroeconomics textbooks discuss 'capital' {{as if it were}} a well-defined concept [...] which it is not, except in a very special one-capital-good world (or under other unrealistically restrictive conditions). The problems of heterogeneous capital goods have also been ignored in the 'rational expectations revolution' and in virtually all econometric work." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{combination}} of a barbiturate induction agent and a nondepolarizing paralytic agent is used in thousands of anesthetics every day. Supporters {{of the death penalty}} argue that unless anesthesiologists have <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> for the last 40 years, the use of pentothal and pancuronium is safe and effective. In fact, potassium is given in heart bypass surgery to induce cardioplegia. Therefore, the {{combination of}} these three drugs is still in use today. Supporters of the death penalty speculate that the designers of the lethal-injection protocols intentionally used the same drugs as used in everyday surgery to avoid controversy. The only modification is that a massive coma-inducing dose of barbiturates is given. In addition, similar protocols have been used in countries that support euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.|$|E
