40|$|Planting genetically {{modified}} (GM) or transgenic forest trees for wood production is now feasible {{on a commercial}} scale worldwide. What are the benefits? What are the risks? This became an open question two years ago on December 10, 2003, when the United Nations declared that every sovereign nation should decide on its own {{whether or not to}} use {{genetically modified}} forests for carbon sequestration. Although feasible on a commercial scale, we are still {{in the early stages of}} GM technology for forest trees. Some of the major determinants shaping risks of commercial-scale use include type(s) of inserted DNA construct or transgene, 1 but also 1) reproductive biology of the forest species, and 2) the forest production or silvicultural systems. 2 To date, GM forest trees are being tested in small trials worldwide. Only China is planting GM forest trees on a commercial scale. Central to the issue of GM forest trees is the question of biosafety.

Current Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) guidelines recommend classifying admitted patients at triage into suspect and highly-suspect categories pending laboratory confirmation. We investigated {{the performance of}} the MSF triage system to separate patients with subsequent EBOV-positive laboratory test (true-positive admissions) from patients who were initially admitted on clinical grounds but subsequently tested EBOV-negative (false-positive admissions). We calculated standard diagnostic test statistics for triage allocation into suspect or highly-suspect wards (index test) and subsequent positive or negative laboratory results (reference test) among 433 patients admitted into the MSF EMC Kailahun, Sierra Leone, between 1 July and 30 September 2014. 254 (59 %) of admissions were classified as highly-suspect, the remaining 179 (41 %) as suspect. 276 (64 %) were true-positive admissions, leaving 157 (36. 3 %) false-positive admissions exposed to the risk of nosocomial EBOV infection. The positive predictive value for receiving a positive laboratory result after being allocated to the highly-suspect ward was 76 %. The corresponding negative predictive value was 54 %.

40|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) assay {{was performed to}} detect and identify the genetically modified maize (Bt 11). Primer pair Bt 11 1 - 5 ΄ and Cry 1 Ab 1 - 3 ΄ detected {{the region of the}} insect resistant Cry 1 Ab gene sequence inserted in GM Bt 11 maize and a primer pair ZE 01 -ZE 02 were used to detect the maize intrinsic zein (Ze 1) gene in maize DNA. The presence of the corresponding DNA segments was specifically detected in GM maize by the designed primers. It was concluded that this method is useful for fast and easy screening of Bt gene in the food products and GM Bt crops. The methods of plant genetic transformation are applied for the insertion of genes of interest into specific crop plants for their improvement (Estruch et al. 1997). These transformed plants are commonly known as genetically modified plants or GM plants. A number of GM plants have already been developed for commercial use {{in different parts of the}} world (James 2006). Before commercialization, the expression of the introduced trait(s) is needed to be assayed. This detection of the expression of genetically modified trait is essential not only to determine the existence of transgenes in crop plants before commercial exploitation but also to satisfy the required <b>biosafety</b> <b>protocols</b> for the safeguard of human and animal health as well as in protecting the environment. Thus, for the safety assessment of GM products detection of genetically modified trait is very important and it is regarded as the first step of the safety assessment procedure and also for the identification of GM and non-GM plants and their products. Freeze-dried flour from genetically modified (GM) maize and non-GM (Bt 11) maize isoline were used as GM and non-GM reference materials for the present study.

The adoption of the Cartagena <b>Protocol</b> on <b>Biosafety</b> (Cartagena <b>Protocol)</b> contributes to the development of an international regulatory framework to enable international trade in environmentally sound applications of biotechnology. This book analyses the legal aspects of implementing the Cartagena Protocol. It provides a serious contribution to current legal and academic debates on biosafety by analysing key issues under the Cartagena Protocol that affect the design and implementation of national biosafety regulatory regimes, in a manner that takes the principles of sustainable development law into account, and can inform future evolution of the international regime.

The specific objectives of the study were: to provide an overview of international and African regional approaches to regulation of modern biotechnology; to establish the extent to which such legislation is consistent with or at variance with key provisions of the Protocol, and to assess whether the above legislations are relevant and workable domestically. The study utilized the {{comparative study}} methodology. Analysis was guided by a conceptual framework which captured variance and consistency of the Kenyan Biosafety Bill 2005 on one hand and the Genetically Modified Organisms Act together with the Genetically Modified Organisms Amendment Bill 2005 on the other hand as against the Protocol. The study noted that whereas Legal regulation of modern biotechnology is a complex and a sensitive issue globally, translating science into the normative language of law is itself a complex process. The intricacies of legal regulation are exacerbated by the competing and quite often, irreconcilable socio-economic, cultural, ethical and political imperatives that affect biosafety legislation. Biosafety legislation in Africa is at its infancy yet attempts to establish and maintain a balance; grapples with the above competing imperatives thereby raising political questions that leave African states (Kenya and South Africa included) caught up in the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) cold war. In essence, modern biotechnology raises and leaves more questions than can be answered. The findings of this thesis are threefold: the Protocol is itself inadequate; variance significantly outweighs consistency in attempts to comply with the Protocol by Kenya and South Africa, and establishing relevant and workable biosafety legislations in the two countries is problematic and unforeseeable in the near future if not mired in controversy...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable {{biodiversity}} {{conservation and}} management {{has become a major}} global concern. As a developing country hoping to become a developed one by the year 2020, Malaysia faces a dichotomy between protecting its environment and executing its development master plan. The fear that protecting the environment may hinder development has in fact turned out to be dubious in light of evidences, particularly in the developed countries, showing that environmental protection and development are mutually reinforcing. In the areas of environmental management and pollution control, our imperfect science has nevertheless become a major source of uncertainty in our society. The advance in biotechnology, especially in genetically-modified organisms or transgenic food has resulted in fear that the existing biodiversity will eventually be transgressed. While research will continue and, in some urgent cases, be intensified to provide answers and resolve uncertainties, decision-makers need to decide between allowing or prohibiting certain activities that are, in some respects, of immediate benefit to society but are nevertheless perceived as possibly harmful {{to the future of the}} environment albeit the absence of any scientific proof. To deal with such predicaments, decision-makers in many jurisdictions and in many situations resort to the Precautionary Principle, which in essence allows decision-makers to err on the side of caution. As a Contracting Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Cartagena <b>Protocol</b> on <b>Biosafety</b> (the <b>Protocol),</b> Malaysia has carried out, to a certain extent, her specific and broad obligations under both CBD and the Protocol by enacting the Biosafety Act 2007.

The CBD is indeed the first international legal instrument apart from the then European Community’s relevant directives to suggest that biotechnology is a matter of concern for the international community while providing a basis upon which more detailed procedures would be elaborated in the field of biosafety. While the CBD includes international rules on access to genetic resources, access to and the transfer of technology, the handling of biotechnology and the distribution of its benefits, it does not include a detailed regulation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their possible adverse effects on the environment, human and animal health. It was only with the coming into existence of the Cartagena <b>Protocol</b> on <b>Biosafety</b> (Cartagena <b>Protocol)</b> to the CBD in 2000 that the safe transfer, handling and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) such as genetically engineered plants, animals, and microbes were at last being catered for, albeit leaving aside the broader categories of GMOs. Due to the need for the negotiators of this protocol to make compromises, there were still key issues on the international biosafety framework pertaining mainly to the scope of the GMOs to be covered by this protocol and by the Advanced Informed Agreement procedure; identification and traceability issues; and liability and redress issues. Nine years after the entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol the transboundary movements of GMOs have clearly increased with new categories of GMOs and genetically modified products to regulate. The debate on the safety of GMOs used for food and feed as well as the effects of GMOs on the receiving environment is still very lively throughout the world, amidst a lack of traceability of GMOs or epidemiological studies in the GMO-producing countries. However, there has been some progress on liability and redress with regard to damage resulting from the transboundary movement of LMOs with the adoption of rules and procedures for liability and redress in 2010 with the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol "(hereafter the Nagoya SP) " to the Cartagena Protocol, which is yet to enter into force.

Is the international legal framework for transboundary movements of GMOs adequate for the protection of the environment while taking into account human and animal health? The interaction between direct international legal instruments regulating transboundary movements of LMOs and international trade laws, different interests at stake, the variety of domestic or regional biosafety schemes, authorization, labelling and traceability obligations doubtlessly bring many challenges to the existing international framework. A better governance of transboundary movements of GMOs at the international level would certainly need a consensus on the regulation of transboundary movements of additional categories of GMOs as well as the harmonization of identification and traceability standards, a harmonized risk assessment and management system and a liability and redress regime for damages resulting from transboundary movements of GMOs. Its implementation is limited to the extent that there is a lack of consensus on approaches to be adopted and dispute resolution procedures. When the Cartagena Protocol came into existence to provide for an international legal biosafety framework, key issues mainly pertained to the scope of the GMOs covered by this protocol and by the Advanced Informed Agreement (AIA) procedure, identification and traceability issues, the relationship of this protocol with other prior international agreements and liability and redress issues.

The Protocol therefore constitutes a new element in the conflict, pre-existing and unsolved, which sets the implicit supremacy of the GATT against the international environmental norms. It confirms the necessity to find a solution enabling the equal authority and mutual respect of the international environmental and trade rules.

40|$|Nowadays, {{science has}} been {{evolving}} in {{faster and more}} effective ways {{in order to find}} innovative solutions to reduce the impact that every human activity and new technology have on the environment. This scenario should be the same in the field of environmental law. However, the evolution of environmental laws and policies has been different. Particularly, the harmonization of laws to assess risks of damage to the environment has developed significantly compared to the existing liability systems to address environmental damage. Traditionally, the actions of liability for environmental damage at an international level have been governed by civil liability provisions which have led to unnecessary complexity, overlap of jurisdictions and an unsuccessful restoration of the environment in some cases. This is shown in the efforts of the International Law Commission (ILC) to develop international law to address environmental damage by effective response measures for restoration in addition to compensation. Some other examples followed the same tendency to the administrative approach to liability by means of response measures. The Protocol on Civil Liability and Compensation for Damage Caused by the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters included the concept of response measures following an industrial accident notwithstanding the civil liability nature of the protocol. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty rephrases a similar procedure to the administrative approach to liability implementing response actions in case of an environmental emergency. However, the first legal instrument addressing environmental damage via an administrative approach to liability is the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena <b>Protocol</b> on <b>Biosafety</b> (The Nagoya <b>Protocol).</b> This paper will analyze the Nagoya Protocol as an example of administrative approach to liability in case of damage to biodiversity and will examine the challenges to implement this Protocol in domestic legislation. Key issues will be explored such as the distinction between administrative approach to liability and administrative liability in the sense of State liability, the concept of operator linked to causality, and a clear distinction between, regulatory measures targeted to minimizing risk; and, liability measures applicable after the damage has occurred, in order to provide for restoration or compensation...|$|R
40|$|Albania {{declared}} its independence on 28 November 1912. It was proclaimed Popular Republic {{at the end}} of World War II, on 11 January 1945. For a period of about 45 years the communist regime was conducted in terms of one of the strongest Stalinist dictatorships of the time. The elections of March 1991 sanctioned the change of the political and economic system. Albania began the process of building the rule of law, based on private property, free initiative and open market. Currently Albania is part of the NATO. After having satisfied the demands of the Stabilization and Association Agreement it has applied to obtain the EU member candidate status. Albania adheres to different International Organizations such as FAO and the WTO. In order to meet the demands arising from the ratification of various Conventions on Biological Diversity such as, Cartagena <b>Protocol</b> on <b>Biosafety,</b> Nagoya <b>Protocol</b> etc [...] ., Albania has started an intensive legislative process. The study object of this thesis was carried out aiming at the realization of a scientific paper that can serve to the Albanian legislator for future legislative developments on Conservation and Sustainable Use of Farm Animal Genetic Resources. The main objectives of this work are listed as follows: -	Study and evaluation of the current Albanian legislation addressing issues of conservation and sustainable use of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. -	Assessment of the level of approximation of this legislation with the institutional and legal international framework and the EU legislation. -	Comparative analysis of the national legislation with that of other countries of the Balkan region. -	Study and development of key issues to be addressed in the middle-term legislative process in order to align the Albanian legislation with the International and EU one. -	Recommendations for legislative interventions and institutional developments in order to fulfill the obligations stemming from its accession to International Organizations and / or Conventions / Protocols. The thesis is conceived and realized {{in the form of a}} document in which are treated issues related to the identification, conservation, management and sustainable economic use of biodiversity in farm animals. The study is conducted by applying a research methodology, in which are combined: (i) 	analysis of developments and achievements of the Albanian legislation, (ii) 	comparative analysis of the legislation of different countries of the region and the EU one, and (iii) 	 evaluation of the Albanian resources and opportunities for the implementation of the Global Strategy and Plan of Action for animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Briefly, the issues addressed are as follows: The introduction provides a summarized data of the agricultural sector in Albania. It presents a synthesis of the major reforms developed in this sector, carried during the political and economic changes occurred in Albania after the fall of the communist system and the transition, from the centrally planned economy to the free market and private initiative. The first chapter provides a general view of the agricultural policy conducted in Albania during 1990 - 2013 and the major achievements in the development of the necessary legal framework. It addresses issues related to the agriculture privatization process. Albania's strategic goal was the full privatization of the agricultural economy. Given the fact that Albania during the period of the centralized economy nationalized almost 100...|$|R
