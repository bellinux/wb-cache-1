60|$|The {{reason why}} the one are ordinarily taken for real qualities, and the other only for bare powers, seems to be because the ideas we have of {{distinct}} colours, sounds, &c. containing nothing at all in them of bulk, figure, or motion we are not apt to think them {{the effects of these}} primary qualities; which appear not, to our senses, to operate in their production, and with which they have not any apparent congruity or conceivable connexion. Hence it is that we are so forward as to imagine, that those ideas are the resemblances of something really existing in the objects themselves since sensation discovers nothing of bulk, figure, or motion of parts in their production; nor can reason show how bodies BY THEIR BULK, FIGURE, AND MOTION, should produce in the mind the ideas of blue or yellow, &c. But, in the other case in the operations of bodies changing the qualities one of another, we plainly discover that the quality produced hath commonly no resemblance with anything in the thing producing it; wherefore we look on it as a bare effect of power. For, through receiving the idea of heat or light from the sun, we are apt to think IT is a perception and resemblance of such a quality in the sun; yet when we see wax, or a fair face, receive change of colour from the sun, we cannot imagine THAT to be the reception or resemblance of anything in the sun, because we find not those different colours in the sun itself. For, our senses being able to observe a likeness or unlikeness of sensible qualities in two different external objects, we forwardly enough conclude the production of any sensible quality in any subject to be an effect of <b>bare</b> <b>power,</b> and not the communication of any quality which was really in the efficient, when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that produced it. But our senses, not being able to discover any unlikeness between the idea produced in us, {{and the quality of the}} object producing it, we are apt to imagine that our ideas are resemblances of something in the objects, and not the effects of certain powers placed in the modification of their primary qualities, with which primary qualities the ideas produced in us have no resemblance.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{approaches}} some of Herman Melville’s {{best known}} sea stories (mainly “Benito Cereno” and “Billy Budd, Sailor”) from a Law & Literature perspective. The first section is mainly focused on “Benito Cereno” and, through {{an analysis of}} the literary text, deals with the ambiguity of any form of social construction of hierarchy, power distribution, exclusion, stigmatization, and roles, inside and outside what Goffman called ‘total institutions’. Criminal law as an instrument for reaffirming existing balances of power is explored, as well as the relevance of a critical approach to social and legal institutions. The second section is mainly devoted to an analysis of “Billy Budd” which, through the figures of Vere, Billy and Claggart, provides a ‘parable’ of the three different elements which criminal law is made up of, and whose lack of balance can’t but produce injustice, albeit in different forms: Captain Vere represents the formal element of law, the need for positive rules and a well-defined set of legal prescriptions and procedures, without which the free pursuit of each person’s values and interests could degenerate into abuse and violence, but which always harbors the risks of empty legalism and blind enforcement of laws contrary to basic human rights; Billy Budd, the ‘natural’ man, symbolizes the force of natural law and of the values and rights which demand recognition and protection, even, in case, against the letter of unjust positive laws, but whose pursuit regardless of formal limitations whatsoever may lead, in turn, to violence and injustice; Claggart, the Master-at-Arms and Billy’s slanderer, stands for the darkest side of criminal law, the component of force, <b>bare</b> <b>power</b> and cruelty which is intrinsic to it, and particularly to its sanctions. Like the Mutiny Act which Vere chooses to enforce on Billy, Claggart embodies all the risks steaming from a conception of criminal law as an instrument of war on people reduced to ‘entities’ (‘hands’ in the maritime jargon of the time), to personal or social enemies. The third section therefore deals with the intrinsic relational nature of any rule, and with the dangers of a legal system forgetting such a dimension, as well as with possible ways of developing the relational and restorative potential of criminal law...|$|E

Objectives: This study aimed to detect the effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser, 1064 nm, with specific laser parameters, in the treatment of dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN) in some Sudanese patients. Material and methods: Twenty patients, clinically diagnosed as cases of dermatosis papulosa nigra, were selected from different dermatology clinics in Khartoum state and were considered as study population. Nd: YAG laser, with 1064 nm wavelength, was used in this study. The laser parameters were: non-contact applications of <b>bare</b> fiber, <b>power</b> of 25 Watt and duty cycle of 0. 2 second.

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that even properly manufactured bond interconnections are getting destroyed through fatigue as a result of alternating thermal load, an appropriate model for the forecast of the lifetime of wire bonds of power transistors has been developed. Alternating temperature is leading to different strain of materials. And this results in mechanical stress in the assembly. The stress is causing material fatigue and finally a fracture of the interconnection. An established calculation for failure accumulation has been applied to aluminum wire bond interconnection. A respective model was developed and tested by experiment. In this case the data analysis was conducted online and in-situ by applying a data logger or so called Life Cycle Unit (LCU). Due to this approach the concept of the model has to reflect the computing architecture, memory capacity, clock speed, bus bandwidth and signal processing. Finally the power consumption is a critical aspect as well. The requirements on the thermal test configuration have been defined and vali-dated by simulation afterwards. An appropriate test bed was developed, con-structed and put into operation in order to conduct the experiments. <b>Bare</b> die <b>power</b> transistors were glued to a specially designed ceramic test assembly. Af-terwards the aluminium wire bonds were made. These test assemblies were ac-tively cycled. Routines have been identified with methods of Design-of-Experiment.

40|$|Surface {{passivation}} of photoelectrodes {{is widely}} used to improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). We use the organic and inorganic materials as a surface-passivating layer of photoelectrodes and introduce the effect of surface passivation on the power conversion efficiency of DSCs. TiO 2 nanotube arrays are fabricated by anodic oxidation of Ti foil for photoelectrodes of DSCs. Surface passivating layers are conducted by immersing photoelectrode in various precursor solutions. MgO and WO 3 are selected for inorganic passivation. PC 61 BM is used for organic passivation. In case of inorganic passivation, a basic material (MgO) which has a high isoelectric point (pl > 7) shows higher power conversion efficiency of 2. 63 % by increasing of open circuit voltage (V-oc) to 0. 74 V than bare sample of 2. 55 %. But, an acidic material (WO 3) shifts V-oc to low potential resulting in a worse efficiency of DSCs.

40|$|We develop {{numerical}} {{tools for}} Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo simulations of non-Abelian lattice field theories in the t'Hooft large-N limit {{based on the}} weak-coupling expansion. First we note that the path integral measure of such theories contributes a bare mass term in the effective action which {{is proportional to the}} bare coupling constant. This mass term renders the perturbative expansion infrared-finite and allows to study it directly in the large-N and infinite-volume limits using the Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo approach. On the exactly solvable example of a large-N O(N) sigma model in D= 2 dimensions we show that this infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion contains, in addition to <b>powers</b> of <b>bare</b> coupling, also <b>powers</b> of its logarithm, reminiscent of re-summed perturbation theory in thermal field theory and resurgent trans-series without exponential terms. We numerically demonstrate the convergence of these double series to the manifestly non-perturbative dynamical mass gap. We then develop a Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo algorithm for sampling planar diagrams in the large-N matrix field theory, and apply it to study this infrared-finite weak-coupling expansion for large-N U(N) xU(N) nonlinear sigma model (principal chiral model) in D= 2. We sample up to 12 leading orders of the weak-coupling expansion, which is the practical limit set by the increasingly strong sign problem at high orders. Comparing Diagrammatic Monte-Carlo with conventional Monte-Carlo simulations extrapolated to infinite N, we find a good agreement for the energy density {{as well as for the}} critical temperature of the "deconfinement" transition.

40|$|The Metacolonial State" is a genealogical {{project that}} is {{concerned}} with understanding the nature of political space in contemporary Pakistan. My contention is that political Islam, and specifically the Deoband and Taliban ‘ulama, have taken on an increasingly biopolitical character. As “a history of the present” I show how the crisis in Pakistan today is itself {{a manifestation of the}} biopoliticization of Islam. While the Deoband ‘ulama remain the primary thematic subject and focus of the work, they are largely signposts towards a broader attempt to disclose a cartography of power. Within the multiplicity of Islamist practices in Pakistan, the Deoband movement has {{emerged as one of the}} most highly organized and yet remarkably polycentric institutions that claim orthodox religious authority. Until September 11 2001, scholarship on political Islam in Pakistan had been focused on ‘modernist’ and ‘fundamentalist’ movements; traditional ‘ulama were considered to be politically and culturally insignificant. The dramatic rise of the Taliban and its fateful alliance with Al-Qaeda have however resulted in a proliferation of new discourses about the ‘ulama, their traditions and educational institutions. Precisely because of the imperial gaze directed towards the control, reform and regulation of Islam, this study places our understanding of Islamist politics within a broader, complex, and overlapping set of governmentalities and competing sovereign powers. The work aims to be a material, embodied history and politics of the ‘ulama as a form of power. I argue that while ‘ulama practices have undergone a series of dramatic transformations since 1947, these cannot be understood in isolation from the broader militarization of political space; hence the need for opening this investigation with an analysis of the mullah-military complex that emerged in the 1980 ’s. The ‘metacolonial’ is itself a neologism that articulates two influential critical paradigms: Foucault’s concern with biopolitics and governmentality and Agamben’s illuminating thesis on sovereign <b>power,</b> <b>bare</b> life and the state of exception. Pakistan is shown to be an exemplary space of biopolitical sovereignty where the state of exception takes on a near permanent localization and where distinctions between dictatorship and democracy, between ‘secular’ and ‘religious’ forces becomes indistinc...|$|R
