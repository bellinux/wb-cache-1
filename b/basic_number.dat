5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E

25|$|Polyploidy, {{where there}} are more than two sets of {{homologous}} chromosomes in the cells, occurs mainly in plants. It has been of major significance in plant evolution according to Stebbins. The proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by Stebbins to be 30–35%, but in grasses the average is much higher, about 70%. Polyploidy in lower plants (ferns, horsetails and psilotales) is also common, and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants.Polyploidy in animals is much less common, but it has been significant in some groups.Polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> are known as euploid.|$|E

When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.|$|E
25|$|Weil {{introduced}} the adele {{ring in the}} late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his <b>Basic</b> <b>Number</b> Theory in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle avant la lettre) Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited Weil conjecture, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (resp. of Serre) {{became known as the}} Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.|$|E

60|$|Not {{only are}} the first {{distinct}} ideas of number co-ordinate with ideas of likeness and equality, but the first efforts at numeration displayed the same relationship. On reading the accounts of various savage tribes, {{we find that the}} method of counting by the fingers, still followed by many children, is the aboriginal method. Neglecting the several cases in which the ability to enumerate does not reach even to the number of fingers on one hand, there are many cases in which it does not extend beyond ten--the limit of the simple finger notation. The fact that in so many instances, remote, and seemingly unrelated nations, have adopted ten as their basic number; together with {{the fact that in the}} remaining instances the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> is either five (the fingers of one hand) or twenty (the fingers and toes); almost of themselves show that the fingers were the original units of numeration. The still surviving use of the word digit, as the general name for a figure in arithmetic, is significant; and it is even said that our word ten (Sax. tyn; Dutch, tien; German, zehn) means in its primitive expanded form two hands. So that originally, to say there were ten things, was to say there were two hands of them.|$|E

5000|$|First, by basic numbering, {{which is}} used in most of Gyeonggi Province, a number is {{assigned}} to -gil diverging from -daero or -ro based on the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> of the position diverging from -daero or -ro. Since the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> increases by 2 every 20 meters, the <b>basic</b> <b>number</b> multiplied by 10 meters comes to {{the distance from the}} start point of the street to the current position.

40|$|We {{consider}} a n-patches model, {{to study the}} impact of human population movements between cities (patches) in the spread of Chikungunya or even Dengue diseases. In previous works, it was showed that the <b>basic</b> reproduction <b>number</b> can vary from place to place, but this result was obtained without taking into account human movements. We provide a theoretical study of the patchy model, and derive the <b>basic</b> reproduction <b>number,</b> which may depend on Human movement rates between the patches and on local population sizes. We show that the <b>basic</b> reproduction <b>number</b> is bounded by the maximum of local <b>basic</b> reproduction <b>number.</b> We also show that there exists a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) that is locally asymptotically stable whenever the <b>basic</b> reproduction <b>number</b> is less than 1. Under suitable assumptions, DFE is even globally asymptotically stable. We emphasize that Human movements are of particular importance to evaluate the spreading or not of Chikungunya or Dengue diseases, and thus movement rates have to be estimated very accurately. We confirm also {{the importance of the}} local <b>basic</b> reproduction <b>numbers</b> and show that even local field interventions can be of benefit to control/reduce the spread of a disease. A complete analytical study for a 2 -patches model and several examples are provided to illustrate our conclusion. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
