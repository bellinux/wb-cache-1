40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} and clinical relevance of tumor <b>cells</b> contaminating the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> products {{of patients with}} advanced breast cancer treated with high-dose chemotherapy is uncertain because prior studies used small sample sizes and lacked standardization of the immunocytochemistry (ICC) detection method used. We evaluated <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> and bone marrow samples obtained from 535 women with metastatic breast cancer who received high-dose chemotherapy and unmanipulated mobilized <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> support. Of the patients tested, 20. 6 % and 26. 3 % had <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> and bone marrow contamination, respectively. <b>Blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> contamination was significantly more frequent in patients with marrow involvement than in patients without marrow involvement (35 % versus 18. 4 %, respectively; P =. 009). In fact, according to multivariate analysis results, marrow involvement was the only significant predictor for <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> product contamination. Patients without marrow involvement who had fewer apheresis procedures were also observed to have a significantly lower incidence rate of <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> contamination than patients who had more procedures (P < or =. 008), and patients who received combined chemotherapy and cytokine mobilization therapy had less contamination than patients who received cytokine alone (P =. 0001). Combined mobilization therapy appears {{to be associated with}} a lower incidence of contamination as a result of fewer apheresis procedures rather than through an antitumor effect of chemotherapy (P < or =. 001). Patients with ICC-negative <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> products had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than did patients with ICC-positive <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> products (median PFS, 401 versus 291 days, respectively, P =. 007; median OS, 1060 versus 697 days, P =. 009). However, multivariate analysis did not reveal any significant independent predictors of survival outcomes. Thus, further study is needed to determine if contaminating tumor <b>cells</b> in the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> products of breast cancer patients ever directly impact survival outcomes or are only indicative of residual in vivo disease in high-dose chemotherapy recipients.

25|$|Peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are now {{the most}} common source of stem cells for HSCT. They are {{collected}} from the blood through {{a process known as}} apheresis.

The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily subcutaneous injections of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Currently {{available}} {{treatment options}} for decompensated hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis are limited and largely ineffective. Recently, <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation {{has emerged as}} a promising treatment for cirrhosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation can improve liver functional reserve in patients with hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis. Material/Methods: In this study, 51 patients with hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis were assigned to the treatment group (n= 23) or the control group (n= 28). The treatment group underwent autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplan-tation in addition to comprehensive medical treatment, and the control group received comprehensive med-ical treatment alone. Liver functional reserve was monitored for 48 weeks after autologous peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation. Results: After transplantation, most patients showed improvements in symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, and ab-dominal distension. The retention rate of indocyanine green at 15 minutes, a common indicator of liver func-tional reserve, declined from 41. 99 ± 4. 68 at baseline to 37. 79 ± 3. 75 by 48 weeks after transplantation, show-ing significant improvement.

2500|$|Some parents {{choose to}} have this blood {{diverted}} from the baby's umbilical blood transfer through early cord clamping and cutting, to freeze for long-term storage at a cord blood bank should the child ever require the cord <b>blood</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (for example, to replace bone marrow destroyed when treating leukemia). This practice is controversial, with critics asserting that early cord blood withdrawal {{at the time of}} birth actually increases the likelihood of childhood disease, due to the high volume of blood taken (an average of 108ml) in relation to the baby's total supply (typically 300ml). [...] The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated in 2006 that [...] "there is still insufficient evidence to recommend directed commercial cord blood collection and stem-cell storage in low-risk families".|$|E
