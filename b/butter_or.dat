5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). Originally grown using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, {{only a small portion of}} those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E
5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
5|$|Several {{ingredient}} variations {{exist in}} carrot soup preparations. Some carrot soups are prepared using coconut milk, coconut water, coconut cream, coconut <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> coconut pieces. Some versions include ginger as an ingredient, and some include curry. Green carrot leaves (greens) {{from the top}} of carrots can be used as an ingredient in the dish. Chopped mint leaves are used in some versions. It can be served hot or chilled. Salt and pepper can be used to season the dish, and nutmeg is sometimes used as a seasoning. It is sometimes topped with yogurt, a yogurt sauce, crème fraîche, sour cream, and other ingredients.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the mushroom food, are more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E
5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in <b>butter,</b> <b>or</b> used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E

25|$|Butter is {{used for}} sautéing and frying, {{although}} its milk solids brown and burn above 150°C (250°F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The smoke point of butterfat is around 200°C (400°F), so clarified <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> ghee is better suited to frying. Ghee {{has always been a}} common frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or religious reasons.|$|E

Sweetened compound butters can be served with desserts; such hard sauces are often flavored with spirits.|$|E

The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the tava, so it softens but does not break.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin K1 {{is found}} chiefly in leafy green {{vegetables}} such as spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) {{and often the}} absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> oils. Some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the recommended amounts.|$|E
