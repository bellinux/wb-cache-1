40|$|The {{catalytic}} oxidation of bio-ethanol to acetaldehyde entails a promising route for valorization of biomass into many important chemicals {{that are currently}} mainly being produced from fossil-based ethylene feedstock. We employ here DFT calculations to understand the unprecedented synergy between gold clusters and a MgCuCr 2 O 4 spinel support, which shows excellent catalytic performance for the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde (space-time yield of 311 gacetaldehyde. ggold- 1. h- 1 at 250 °C). The investigations support a mechanism involving catalytic reactions at the gold-support interface. Dissociative adsorption of ethanol is facilitated by cooperative action of a gold atom at the metal cluster-support interface and a basic oxygen atom of the support.

The oxygen vacancy formation energy is found to be a good performance descriptor for ethanol oxidation of Au/MgMeCr 2 O 4 (Me = Cu, Ni, Co) catalysts.

Phthalates are esters of 1, 2 -Benzenedicarboxylic acid (phthalic acid).

Hybrid p-type CuO/Cu 2 O semiconductor nanorod arrays, prepared by a three-step synthesis method (sol-gel synthesis, thermal anneal, and cathodic electrodeposition) were used as photocathodes. Scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction were used to characterize these hybrid materials at various stages of the preparation protocol as well as before and after being subjected to photoelectrolysis for selected periods of time. The performance of the CFPR with the hybrid photocathode was analyzed in CO 2 -saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution at − 0. 3 V vs Ag/AgCl under simulated AM 1. 5 solar irradiation for periods up to 5 h. The hybrid photocathode formulation facilitated efficient photoelectron injection to CO 2 while its robustness and high photoelectrochemically active surface area enhanced the formation of alcohols.
