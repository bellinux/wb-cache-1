The INR was coupled to Dr Kirkwood's simultaneous invention of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI), which provided the means to calibrate different batches of thromboplastins to an international standard. The INR became widely accepted worldwide, especially after endorsement by the World Health Organization.|$|E

40|$|Following German re-unification, East Germany {{moved from}} a state-socialist to a market-based {{economic}} system. Using West Germany as a "control group", we examine how the change affected the level and the equality of the <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living. We find that before unification, East Germany had a lower but somewhat more equally distributed <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living than the West. After unification, East Germany rapidly caught up in terms of height but {{at the expense of}} equality. This suggests that a trade-off exists between a high and an equally distributed <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living. Unlike previous research, we find that West Germany's pre-unification height advantage was smallest in towns with 5000 - 20, 000 inhabitants and largest in cities with 20, 000 - 100, 000 inhabitants (females) or in cities with more than 100, 000 inhabitants (males). Between regions, height converged both in East and West Germany, but particularly markedly among East-German males. Equality convergence, like height convergence, is significantly larger for East than for West-German males.

The long-term trend in average height was upwards for all social groups but differences in stature between social groups were about as large as in Communist Czechoslovakia as in market economies, such as the UK. Sons of blue-collar fathers and of parents employed in agriculture were generally shorter than sons of clerks and professional employees (teachers, doctors, lawyers). The anthropometric record also suggests that in the immediately post-war years inequality was greater than in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s.

40|$|Using 19 th century {{state prison}} records, this study {{contrasts}} the <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living of comparable US African-American and white females {{during a period}} of relatively rapid economic development. White females were consistently taller than black females by about 1. 5 Â cm (0. 6 Â in.). Whites from Great Lakes and Plains states and black Southwestern females were the tallest. US females were tall compared to their European counterparts. The height of females began to decline in the antebellum period, possibly before that of males. The recovery of physical stature was also earlier among females than among males. This implies that the <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of lower-class men and women did not move in parallel during the onset of modern economic growth. It also implies that the antebellum puzzle was most likely rooted in the endogenous forces of socio-economic change rather than the exogenous changes in the disease environment.

40|$|Running Title: The <b>Biological</b> <b>Standard</b> of Living {{in the two}} Germanies. Abstract: Physical stature {{is used as a}} {{proxy for}} the <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living in the two Germanies before and after {{unification}} in an analysis of a cross-sectional sample (1998) of adult heights, as well as among military recruits of the 1990 s. West Germans tended to be taller than East Germans throughout the period under consideration. Contrary to official proclamations of a classless society, there were substantial differences in physical stature in East-Germany. Social differences in height were greater in the East among females, and less among males than in the West. Spatial inequality was greater in the East than in the West, pointing to the relatively underdeveloped nature of the East-German rural sector. The difficulties experienced by the East-German population after 1961 is evident in the increase in social inequality of physical stature thereafter, {{as well as in the}} increasing gap relative to the height of the West-German population. After unification, however, there is a tendency for East-German males, but not of females, to catch up with their West-German counterparts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigate}}s the <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living {{toward the end}} of Spanish rule. We investigate levels, trends, and determinants of physical stature from the birth cohorts of the 1860 s to the 1890 s using data on 23, 000 Filipino soldiers enlisted by the U. S. military between 1901 and 1913. We use truncated regression technique for estimating average height and use province level information for investigating the determinants of biological wellbeing. The results indicate a decline of more than 1. 5 cm (0. 6 inches) in the height of soldiers born between the early 1870 s and the late 1880 s. The decline in heights {{at the end of the}} 19 th century occurred at a time when there was an expansion of commercial activity in cash crop production for export. Heights did not regain the level of the 1870 s until the late 1930 s and early 1940 s. We also find that at 159. 3 cm (62. 7 inches), the average height of soldiers born in the mid- 1870 s was very short even for the time. The low <b>biological</b> <b>standard</b> of living observed in late 19 th century Philippines was not due to the tropical disease environment alone since greater average heights were recorded for the same period in other parts of Asia with a similar climate...|$|R
