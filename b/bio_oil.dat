40|$|Abstract This study {{concentrates}} on developing and tuning various oil analysis methods {{to meet the}} requirements of modern industry and environmental analytics. Oil analysis methods form a vital part of techniques used to monitor the condition of machines and may help to improve the overall equipment effectiveness value of a factory in a significant manner. Worm gears are used in various production machines, and their breakdowns may cause significant production losses. Wearing of these gears is relatively difficult to monitor with vibration analysis. Analysis of two indicator metals, copper and iron, may reveal wearing phenomena of worm gears effectively, and savings can be significant. Effective wear metal analysis requires good tools. ICP-OES with kerosene dilution is widely used in wear metal analysis, but purchasing and using of ICP-OES is expensive. A cheaper FAAS technique with similar pre-treatment of oil samples was tested and it proved to be useful especially in analyzing small amounts of samples. The accuracy of FAAS was sufficient for quantitative work in machine diagnostics and waste oil characterization. Solid debris analyses are useful in oil contamination control as well as in detection of wearing mechanisms. Membrane filtration, optical microscopy, SEM and automatic particle counting were applied in analysis of rolling and gear oils. Particle counting is an effective way to detect oil contamination, but in the studied cases even larger particles than those detected in normal ISO classes would be informative. However, membrane filtration and optical microscopy may reveal the wearing machine element exactly. Additives provide oils with desired properties thus they should be monitored intensively. A FTIR method for quantitative analysis of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters in machinery oils was developed during this work. It has already been used successfully in quantitative and qualitative analysis of machinery oil samples. Various kinds of oils may be spilled into the soil during use and in accident situations, and they can migrate to groundwater layers. Biodegradation of oils can remove them from the soil or water completely or at least diminish the amount of harmful substances. An automatic, respirometric BOD OxiTop method was used to evaluate the biodegradability of various oils in water and soil media. The biodegradation of certain bio and mineral hydraulic oils was evaluated in groundwater, where <b>bio</b> <b>oils</b> usually biodegraded more effectively than mineral oils. The use of oils in machines weakened especially the biodegradability of <b>bio</b> <b>oils.</b> Biodegradability of <b>bio</b> <b>oils</b> was also studied in standard conditions of OECD 301 F and <b>bio</b> <b>oils</b> usually biodegraded moderately good in these conditions. The biodegradation of forestry chain oils and wood preservative oils was evaluated in forest soils.

The catalyst was characterized using techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). The fuel gas obtained were analysed via Gas-Chromatography-Thermal Conductivity Detector (GC-TCD) while the fuel grade <b>bio</b> <b>oil</b> produced were analysed via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The findings suggest that a temperature of 700 oC with catalyst Ni-Ce/Al 2 O 3 using a mass ratio of 20 wt. %, 5 wt. %, and 75 wt. % respectively was the most optimum temperature to run plastic pyrolysis and obtain high quality fuel gas and biofuel yield...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{demand is}} {{increasing}} continuously due to {{rapid growth in}} population and industrialization development. The major energy demand is provided from the conventional energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, etc. Two major problems, which every country is facing with these conventional fuels, are depletion of fossil fuels and deterioration of environment. Pyrolysis of biomass {{will be one of}} the alternative ways to encounter this problem. The pyrolysis of palm-oil industrial waste was investigated in a static batch reactor is. The effect of pyrolysis parameter on the product yields and composition were investigated. PKS was pyrolysed at moderate range of temperatures of 200 ˚C, 300 ˚C, 400 ˚C, 500 ˚C and 600 ˚C. The effects of various temperatures towards the yield of pyrolysis process of palm kernels were investigated. The compositions and properties of the pyrolytic oils and solid chars are determined with respect to pyrolysis temperatures. The static batch reactor shows that the temperature of 400 ˚C gives the highest percentage of PKS bio-oil yield which attributes to 37. 2 %. EFB with sample length of L 10 mm were pyrolysed at constant temperature of 400 ˚C. The highest yield of the <b>bio</b> <b>oil</b> for the empty fruit bunches is obtained at the range of length between 5 - 10 mm whish attribute to 39. 525 wt%. Preliminary experiment was conducted using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to determine the volatility, ash content, moisture and fixed carbon. The functional groups of the product which is <b>bio</b> <b>oil</b> are identified by using Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The chemical characterization studies show that the <b>bio</b> <b>oil</b> obtained from the palm kernels has the potential to be a valuable source renewable fuel and as feedstock for specialty of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Matrix {{assisted}} laser desorption ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) laser desorption ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF-MS) {{and temperature}} resolved analytical pyrolysis field ionisation mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) {{have been applied}} {{for the first time}} on two pyrolytic lignins (PL's), precipitated from different aged <b>bio</b> <b>oil,</b> and four PL-fractions for molar mass characterization. The results were compared with data from size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC was the only method that allowed a mathematical calculation of molar mass characteristics such as average molecular weight (Mw), dispersity (D), and the molar mass at the peak maximum of the elugram (Mp). The SEC Mp values of PL-fractions differ from visually interpolated MALDI-TOF-MS measurements by 20 %. MALDI-TOF-MS spectra showed detailed structures of the molar mass distribution (MMD) of PL and PL-fractions. Especially, the spectrum of one PL showed various local maxima with intervals of 170 - 200 Da. The size of these intervals could represent the average absolute molar mass of PL-monomers. MALDI-TOF-MS was limited by the influence of superposing matrix signals in the spectrum at low molar masses. LDI-TOF-MS showed clearer spectra than MALDI-TOF-MS in mass ranges below 400 Da. No signals were obtained for fractions with higher masses or whole PL. Intervals between main signals were mostly 14 - 16 Da. In spectra of different PL-fractions, corresponding main signals can vary between 2 and 4 Da. These mass differences indicate variations in the aliphatic region of the PL molecules. Py-FIMS spectra contained masses of thermally ejected, but unfragmented monomers and dimers. It was the only method, which allowed partial identification of monomeric and dimeric structures of all samples. The detected monomers correspond to known lignin derived compounds in <b>bio</b> <b>oil,</b> the detected dimers have some similarities to phenylcoumaran structures. PL from aged <b>bio</b> <b>oil</b> showed an increased content of higher oligomers and a higher average molecular weight. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of biofuels becomes more acute, {{especially in the}} European Union. Beside them, the <b>bio</b> gas <b>oil</b> is a promising product that is a fuel with high isoparaffin content in the gas oil boiling range, which can be produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of different triglycerides. In this paper the isomerization of different intermediate products obtained over different hydrogenation catalysts and having high n-paraffin content was studied on SAPO- 11 catalyst at 300 – 380 °C temperature, 20 – 80 bar pressure, 0. 5 – 3. 0 h- 1 of liquid space velocity and 400 Nm 3 /m 3 of H 2 /feed ratio. It {{was found that the}} oxygen containing intermediate products significantly changed the degree of isomerization, but the hydrocarbon composition and the aromatic content of the n-paraffin mixtures had no noticeable effect on the conversion. During the experiments excellent quality diesel gas oil blending components were produced with high i-paraffin content and they were practically free of heteroatom content...|$|R
30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using waste bio materials as viscosity reducing agents was investigated on light and heavy crude oils of Oman. The selected materials are fiber of palm tree, date palm kernel and walnut shell. The utilization of waste bio materials {{is not only}} considered as a cost effective, but, environmentally friendly and has less effect on crude oil processing as {{compared to that of}} chemical additives. In this study, special piping structure was constructed to measure flowabilty time of crude oil. It was observed that use of <b>bio</b> materials reduced <b>oil</b> flowability time by range of 42 – 50 % using particle size 75  µm and by 66 % using particle size 150  µm. Moreover, the effect of different additives and various concentrations of <b>bio</b> materials on <b>oil</b> rheological properties, for instance viscosity and yield stress, were also studied. Results showed that the light crude oil exhibits a non-Newtonian viscoplastic behavior following (Bingham plastic model) whereas the heavy crude oil exhibits a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior (shear thinning model). The use of bio materials reduced the limiting viscosities of the light crude oils by 62 % using particle size 75  µm and 75 % using particle size 150  µm. However, limiting viscosity of heavy crude oil was reduced by 15 %. In addition, it was observed that using bio materials lowered yield shear; light crude reduced by average 32 % while heavy crude oil reduced by 10 %.|$|R
40|$|Lignocellosic ethanol {{production}} {{is now at}} a stage where commercial or semi-commercial plants are coming online and, provided cost effective production can be achieved, lignocellulosic ethanol will become {{an important part of}} the world bio economy. However, challenges are still to be overcome throughout the process and particularly for the fermentation of the complex sugar mixtures resulting from the hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Here we describe the continuous fermentation of glucose, xylose and arabinose from non-detoxified pretreated wheat straw, birch, corn cob, sugar cane bagasse, cardboard, mixed <b>bio</b> waste, <b>oil</b> palm empty fruit bunch and frond, sugar cane syrup and sugar cane molasses using the anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter Pentocrobe 411. All fermentations resulted in close to maximum theoretical ethanol yields of 0. 47 - 0. 49 g/g (based on glucose, xylose, and arabinose), volumetric ethanol productivities of 1. 2 - 2. 7 g/L/h and a total sugar conversion of 90 - 99 % including glucose, xylose and arabinose. The results solidify the potential of Thermoanaerobacter strains as candidates for lignocellulose bioconversion...|$|R
