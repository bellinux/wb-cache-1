5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea <b>breeze</b> fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea <b>breeze</b> fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes. Rainbands {{associated}} with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due {{to the formation of}} a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea <b>breeze</b> and land <b>breeze</b> boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea <b>breeze</b> rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E
5|$|The next match saw Tyler <b>Breeze</b> {{taking on}} Xavier Woods. As the match started, they were {{interrupted}} by Alexander Rusev and Lana. Rusev caused a no contest when he attacked both <b>Breeze</b> and Woods; <b>Breeze</b> received a Samoan drop and Woods {{was placed in}} The Accolade submission hold.|$|E

When he had {{crawled into}} the hollow chestnut and only his funny, ringed tail hung out, the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> tweaked it sharply just for fun, and then danced {{away down the}} Lone Little Path to join the other Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> around the Smiling Pool.|$|R
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea <b>breeze</b> to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land <b>breeze,</b> as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY590 between the Can of Worms and NY104 {{is part of}} the northeastern {{quadrant}} of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY104 through Irondequoit. The Sea <b>Breeze</b> Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester â€“ Sea <b>Breeze</b> highway was designated as part of NY47. It was redesignated as NY590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea <b>Breeze</b> Drive, and NY590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.|$|E

5|$|On the October 22 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Ziggler started a feud with the debuting Tyler <b>Breeze,</b> who aligned with Summer Rae and {{attacked}} Ziggler. Ziggler entered a tournament for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship, defeating The Miz {{in the first}} round match before being eliminated by Dean Ambrose. Ziggler and <b>Breeze</b> continued their feud, which culminated in a match between the two at Survivor Series, which Ziggler lost. Ziggler would then enter a feud with Kevin Owens with the pair trading victories throughout the rest of December and beginning of 2016.|$|E

60|$|Lightfoot the Deer {{traveled}} {{on through the}} Green Forest, straight ahead in the direction from which the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> were blowing.

60|$|Lightfoot {{knew that}} he had nothing to fear in that {{direction}} so long as the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> brought him none of the dreaded man-scent, and he {{knew that he}} could trust the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> to bring him that scent if there should be a man anywhere in front of him.

5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea <b>breeze</b> (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea <b>breeze</b> from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E

5|$|Annual {{rainfall}} is {{the third}} lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart) but is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall. Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April, owing {{to the effect of}} summer and the mountains. The area is not very windy and the <b>breeze</b> is at its strongest from August to November. Canberra is less humid than the nearby coastal areas.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a whaling ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the <b>breeze</b> and sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The <b>breeze,</b> however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem's {{average annual}} {{relative}} humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels {{are at their}} lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city {{is influenced by the}} Mediterranean Sea <b>breeze</b> that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land <b>breeze</b> and sea <b>breeze</b> boundaries.|$|E

He just waited until the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> were out of sight, then he slipped into the Green Forest to look for the stranger seen by the Merry Little <b>Breezes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} {{surrounding}} the interchange {{and the location}} of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, NY104 is forced to run parallel to NY590 for a short distance between the Keeler Street Expressway and NY590's next exit, a diamond interchange connecting to East Ridge Road. Through this stretch, NY590â€”now just four lanes wideâ€”runs in between NY104 westbound and NY104 eastbound. At East Ridge Road, NY104 turns to the northeast to cross Irondequoit Bay while NY590 continues north through residential areas toward Sea <b>Breeze.</b> The road has an at-grade intersection with Sunrise Crescent, a private residential street, before meeting Titus Avenue at a roundabout that serves as NY590's northern terminus. Past this point, the right-of-way of NY590 continues north to Culver Road at the Lake Ontario shoreline as a divided two-lane street named Sea <b>Breeze</b> Drive.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Channel 4 {{television}} programme What Sank the Mary Rose? attempted {{to investigate the}} causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models {{of the ship and}} metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a <b>breeze</b> similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up {{on the day of the}} sinking as the real Mary Rose went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the <b>breeze</b> in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the waterline and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.|$|E
