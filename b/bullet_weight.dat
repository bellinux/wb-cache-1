25|$|There {{are three}} aspects to ballistics: {{internal}} ballistics, external ballistics, and terminal ballistics. Internal ballistics refers {{to things that}} happen inside the firearm during and after firing but before the bullet leaves the muzzle. The handloading process can realize increased accuracy and precision through improved consistency of manufacture, by selecting the optimal <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> and design, and tailoring bullet velocity to the purpose. Each cartridge reloaded can have each component carefully matched {{to the rest of}} the cartridges in the batch. Brass cases can be matched by volume, weight, and concentricity, bullets by weight and design, powder charges by weight, type, case filling (amount of total usable case capacity filled by charge), and packing scheme (characteristics of granule packing).|$|E

2500|$|Based on ideal {{terminal}} ballistic {{performance in}} ordnance gelatin during lab {{testing in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s, the [...]40 S earned status as [...] "the ideal cartridge for personal defense and law enforcement". Apart from the imperfect relationship between ordnance gelatin ballistics and actual stopping power, critics pointed to the reduced power of the round compared with the 10mm Auto it was based on. Ballistically the [...]40 S is almost identical to the [...]38-40 Winchester introduced in 1874, as they share the same bullet diameter and <b>bullet</b> <b>weight,</b> and have similar muzzle velocities. The energy of the [...]40 S exceeds standard-pressure [...]45 ACP loadings, generating between [...] and [...] of energy, depending on <b>bullet</b> <b>weight.</b> Both the [...]40 S and the 9mm Parabellum operate at a [...] SAAMI maximum, compared to a [...] maximum for [...]45 ACP.|$|E
50|$|Original loads were 125, 150 and 165 grain <b>bullet</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When the [...]338 Winchester was {{introduced}} {{there was a}} general preference for heavier <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> between 250 - 300 gr g. However, since that time preferred <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> have decreased to weights between 200 - 225 gr g. This {{is due in part to}} the bullet technology available today. Lighter bullets made today are able to hold together and penetrate deeper than heavier bullets of the past.|$|R

2500|$|It {{offers more}} {{velocity}} and energy than the [...]32 S, {{which was a}} popular round for pocket defensive revolvers {{at the time of}} the [...]32 ACP's development. [...] Although of lighter <b>bullet</b> <b>weight,</b> the [...]32 ACP also compares favorably to the [...]32 S Long in performance. Some European 73 grain [...]32 ACP loads provide similar performance to the [...]32 H Magnum 77 grain lead flat point and 90 grain lead semiwadcutter.|$|E
2500|$|Newton {{recommended}} loading 100 grain (6.5 g) bullets at 2800ft/s (850m/s); but Savage Arms reduced <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> {{to obtain}} velocity of 3000ft/s (910m/s), {{making it the}} first American cartridge capable of that velocity. Achieving that velocity {{may have been the}} reason for the choice of the light-for-caliber 87 grain (5.6 g) bullet. [...] Newton questioned if the publicity advantages of velocity compensated for reduced penetration of the lighter bullet in larger game animals.|$|E
2500|$|Given its higher {{pressure}} and larger case which holds more powder than the [...]270 Winchester, the [...]270 Weatherby has about 200ft/s faster performance with any particular <b>bullet</b> <b>weight.</b> This performance {{comes at the}} cost of more recoil and barrel heat. In addition, a long barrel is necessary to take advantage of extra powder to gain maximum velocity. The cartridge is excellent at long-range hunting, but is not well suited to high-volume shooting such as varmint hunting.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} limited hand-loading information, <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> (hunting) are from between 300 gr (19.4) to 647 gr (41.9).|$|R

25|$|Shrapnel {{was also}} varied with <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> ranging from 35 to 41 bullets/pound and total loads varying from 616 (Mk ID) to 992 (Mk I) bullets.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with other}} most other cartridges, the Weatherby’s {{performance}} with mono-metal bullets is slightly poorer than with conventional bullets. Mono-metal bullets {{tend to be}} longer for a given <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> than conventional lead core bullets. For this reason, the mono-metal bullets similar to the Barnes TSX {{may have to be}} seated more deeply into the case displacing volume which could be filled with the propellant. A loss of velocity of [...] can be expected with these mono-metal bullets. Likewise bullets which have a higher specific gravity than lead, such as the tungsten core Speer African Grand Slam solids being shorter than conventional FMJ bullets will allow for more powder capacity and therefore a higher velocity.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 Winchester is {{extremely}} versatile {{and has been}} adopted by {{a wide range of}} users including hunters, target shooters, [...] military units, and law enforcement departments. Hunters found the cartridge to be an effective all-around choice with bullet options ranging from the flatter shooting 165 grain to the harder hitting 200+ grain selections available from the factory. [...] The [...]300 Win Mag remains the most popular [...]30 caliber magnum with American hunters, despite being surpassed in performance by the more powerful [...]300 and [...]30-378 Weatherby Magnums and the newer [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum. It is a popular selection for hunting moose, elk, and bighorn sheep as it can deliver better long range performance with better <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> than most other [...]30 caliber cartridges. Military and law enforcement departments adopted the cartridge for long range sniping and marksmanship. As a testament to its accuracy, since its introduction it has gone on to win several [...] competitions.|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{to other}} {{production}} [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) cartridges, only the [...]30-378 Weatherby Magnum surpasses the [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum. Factory loaded [...]30-378 Weatherby Magnum ammunition has a [...] velocity {{advantage over the}} [...]300 RUM cartridge with any given <b>bullet</b> <b>weight.</b> However, the [...]30-378 Weatherby Magnum is considered the most overbore production sporting cartridge available and is not considered as efficient as the [...]300 RUM cartridge. [...] In part due to its excessive freebore lengths the claimed velocities by Weatherby is a resultant factor of this freebore length. [...] If chambered to allow bullets to seat to the lands of the rifling the large Weatherby cartridges would exhibit overpressure signs immediately. [...] All things equal the [...]300 RUM and [...]30-378 Weatherby if chambered with the same throat and freebore would be comparable. [...] Known freebore lengths of older Weatherby rifles have been in excess of 1 inch. [...] The [...]30-378 {{is one of the}} most extreme cases of overbore and has among the highest throat erosion levels of any rifles.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{ammunition}} types were inherently {{designed with}} heavier, slower standard <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> and velocities. For example, the traditional military standard [...]45 ACP ammunition load, of a 230 grain bullet, was subsonic.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]338 Winchester Magnum {{is capable}} of {{launching}} heavier bullets than the [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) cartridges. The most common bullets loaded for the [...]338 Winchester range from 200 gr g to 250 gr g. Typical <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> for factory ammunition are 200 gr g, 210 gr g, 225 gr g and the 250 gr g. Typical velocities for these <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> range from 2960 ft/s for the 200 gr g to about 2660 ft/s for the 250 gr g bullet each generating approximately [...] of energy. This is approximately 25% more energy generated than the 30-06 Springfield.|$|R
50|$|Subsonic {{ammunition}} usually uses heavier bullets {{to retain}} {{as much energy}} as possible at the lower velocities. Some subsonic ammunition is used in non-suppressed firearms to gain the advantages of heavier <b>bullet</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Mk II round-nosed bullet {{was found}} to be {{unsatisfactory}} when used in combat, particularly when compared to the dum-dum rounds issued in limited numbers in 1897 during the Chitral and Tirah expeditions of 1897/98 on the North West Frontier of India. [...] This led to the introduction of the Cartridge S.A. Ball [...]303inch Cordite Mark III, basically the original 215-grain (13.9 g) bullet with the jacketing cut back to expose the lead in the nose. [...] Similar hollow-point bullets were used in the Mk IV and Mk V loadings, which were put into mass production. The design of the Mk IV hollow-point bullet shifted <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> rearwards, improving stability and accuracy over the regular round-nose bullet. [...] These soft-nosed and hollow-point bullets, while effective against human targets, had a tendency to shed the outer metal jacket upon firing; the latter occasionally stuck in the bore, causing a dangerous obstruction. [...] The Hague Convention of 1899 later declared that use of expanding bullets against signatories of the convention was inhumane, and as a result the Mk III, Mk IV, and Mk V were withdrawn from active service. The remaining stocks (over 45 million rounds) were used for target practice.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]338 Lapua Magnum case is {{also used}} as the parent case {{for a host of}} {{modified}} variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as wildcats. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the [...]338 Lapua offers a large and exceptionally sturdy, pressure resistant cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times it has become quite popular amongst wildcatters. With the [...]338 Lapua Magnum as the parent case wildcatters have created 7mm (7mm Allen Magnum, 7mm Katzmeier, 7mm Fatso), [...]30 (.30-338 Lapua (Triebel), [...]30 Wolf, 300 Allen Express), 8mm (8mm-338 Lapua (Triebel), LM-101), [...]338 (.338 Yogi, LM-105), [...]343 (.343 Lapua Magnum LM-107), 9.3mm (9,3-338 Lapua Magnum (Triebel)), [...]375 (9.5×70 ELR) and [...]50 calibre (.510 Whisper) variants. The current (2008) benchrest [...] 5-shot group world record holder Tom Sarver used a [...]300 Hulk wildcat cartridge, which is basically a necked-down, blown out, shortened [...]338 Lapua Magnum variant, to achieve a [...] diameter 5-shot group on 7 July 2007.|$|E
5000|$|As noted above, the Grendel case is {{very closely}} related to the [...]220 Russian case. In general, each {{additional}} grain of <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> will reduce muzzle velocity by 10 ft/s (47 m/s for each gram) and each additional inch of barrel length will increase muzzle velocity by 20 ft/s (2.4 m/s for each centimeter). Therefore, a handy rule of thumb is [...] "one inch of barrel length equals two grains of <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> (1 mm → 5 mg)". Specific details are available as graphs derived from Alexander Arms' public domain load table linked below.|$|E
2500|$|Note: {{standard}} Japanese ball ammunition {{was very}} similar to the British Mk 7 cartridge. The two had identical <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> and a [...] "tail-heavy" [...] design, {{as can be seen in}} the cut-away diagram.|$|R
5000|$|Because the [...]357 SIG {{fires at}} {{relatively}} high pressures, muzzle flash and report can be significant with standard loads, even with longer barrels. Utilizing loads with specialized powders and various <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> might reduce flash.|$|R
5000|$|While various <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> were used, {{a typical}} load for the [...]45-90 was a powder charge [...] {{gunpowder}} (black powder) {{with a bullet}} weighing [...] Such a load would have about 1300 ft/s muzzle velocity.|$|R
50|$|Canada's Cartridge S.A. Ball 9 m/m CDN Mark I (9-mm Ball CDN MK 1), {{made since}} 1955, has similar ballistics. <b>Bullet</b> <b>weight</b> is 115 gr g. Nominal muzzle {{velocity}} is 1246.7 ft/s.|$|E
5000|$|David E. Petzal of Field & Stream, wrote, [...] "The {{virtues of}} the 7mm/08 include very light recoil, not much muzzle blast, plenty of <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> to do the job, and gilt-edged accuracy." ...|$|E
50|$|For these {{ammunition}} loads, balancing <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> {{and velocity}} {{are required to}} ensure that the ammunition will still reliably cycle semi-automatic firearms. Subsonic ammunition with normal bullet weights often fails to properly function in such firearms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bullet</b> <b>weights</b> {{available}} for this cartridge {{range from a}} [...] jacketed hollow point to a [...] hardcast lead bullet. Moderate velocity, heavy bullet loads for the [...]500 S&W Magnum are similar in performance to the black powder [...]50-70 Government.|$|R
5000|$|Factory-made {{ammunition}} {{is available}} from Cor-Bon {{in a variety of}} <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> and types: [...] Glaser Safety Slugs; [...] DPX; [...] Pow'RBall; 130, 150, and [...] tradition JHPs; and [...] Performance Match; and is sold by major mail-order retailers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{table below shows}} common {{performance}} parameters for several [...]45 ACP loads. <b>Bullet</b> <b>weights</b> ranging from 185 to 230 grains are common. Penetration depths from 11 inches to over 27 inches are available for various applications and risk assessments.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} table below are examples, {{and for the}} same caliber {{different}} bullet weights can be used. Bullet velocity depends amongst other on <b>bullet</b> <b>weight,</b> powder types used and barrel length for the particular firearm.|$|E
50|$|It is {{considered}} {{as the first}} 3D printed bullet, according to the creator each plastic slug was 3D-printed but a small lead shot was then added to give the <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> and enable it to travel and pierce the target.|$|E
50|$|Many such {{cartridges}} {{were designated}} by a three-number system, e.g., 45-120-3¼ Sharps: 45-caliber bore, 120 grains of (black) powder, 3¼-inch long case. Other times a similar three-number system indicated bore (caliber), charge (grains), and <b>bullet</b> <b>weight</b> (grains). The 45-70-500 Government is an example.|$|E
50|$|Articles, statements, and {{opinions}} vary widely on this firearm. Any {{of the available}} <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yd, a feat matched by {{only a handful of}} other handguns.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]400/360 Nitro Express {{cartridges}} are all rimmed, bottlenecked cartridges {{designed for}} use in single shot and double rifles.

5000|$|Early Model 444 rifles {{utilized}} a 1 in 38" [...] rifling {{twist and}} were handicapped {{by a lack}} of suitable <b>bullet</b> <b>weights.</b> In addition, nearly all existing bullets for the [...]444 had been originally designed solely for use in handguns; used in the Model 444, the bullets tended to break up at higher rifle velocities. A new 265-grain bullet greatly improved the utility of the Model 444 as a hunting rifle, and other <b>bullet</b> <b>weights</b> have since been introduced. In 1971, Model 444's barrel length was reduced to 22 inches, and the rifle's buttstock was changed to a full pistol-grip design.
