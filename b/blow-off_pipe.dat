60|$|Steam was up {{when the}} Enchantress rose with the tide, and shortly {{afterward}} the engines began to throb. Muddy foam leaped about the whirling screw, flame mingled with the smoke that poured from her funnel, and steam roared from the <b>blow-off</b> <b>pipe.</b> Then the clatter of winch and windlass joined in, and Grahame stood, tense and anxious, holding a rope that slipped round the spinning drum. The winch could not shorten it, though the vessel was shaking and working in her muddy bed. It was high-water, the tide would soon begin to fall, and the sweat of suspense and strain dripped from the man as, {{at the risk of}} breaking the warp, he tightened the turns on the drum. It gripped; to his surprise, a little slack came off, and he nodded to Walthew, who was watching him eagerly from the windlass.|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{permitted}} {{pressure in}} chemical reactors can be exceeded {{in the event}} of missoperations. In order to avoid the destruction of the reactor and pollution of the environment by toxic or explosive compounds, a controllable depressurization through safety devices is required. Therefore the cross-sectional area of the safety devices {{and the size of the}} facilities to contain and separate the discharged mass flow must be properly dimensioned. Since the discharging mass flow rate is coupled to the fluiddynamic processes in the vessel. The foaming up during depressurization is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The experimental investigations are carried out using hydrous solutions of different viscosity saturated with carbon dioxide at the beginning of the depressurization. The volume of the vessels, the position of the <b>blow-off</b> <b>pipes,</b> the cross-sectional areas of the safety devices as well as the initial liquid filling levels are variied in the investigations. During the blow-down, the axial void fraction profils in the vessel, the void fraction in the <b>blow-off</b> <b>pipes</b> and the discharging mass flow rates are measured. For pure liquids with low viscosity the void fraction increases strongly in the upper part of the vessel due to the formation of an extended liquid circulation flow. In these vortices bubbles are accumulated. For hydrous solutions with higher viscosity, smaller bubbles are formed due to the desorption of the gas from the liquid. These small bubbles rise upward with a low velocity. In this case the void fraction in the whole two-phase mixture is independent of the axial position in the vessel. On the basis of the experimental investigations a calculation method for the time dependent fluiddynamic processes inside the vessel is developed employing the two-bubble-class approach. The present measurements are well represented by the calculations. (orig.)
