40|$|Circulating {{prostate}} {{cells can}} be detected in cancer patients by using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM) mRNA. A quality-control study involving a conventional RT-PCR assay was performed and, surprisingly, detected both transcripts in many negative control cell lines and in normal blood samples. The existence of an illegitimate transcription of the PSA and PSM genes was evidenced by sequence analysis of several PSM and PSA-PCR products. Sequencing indeed demonstrated {{the presence of a}} PSA or PSM polymorphism in some but not all the cell lines and patient samples, as well as a heterozygous mutation (G to A; Asp to Asn) in the Jurkat cell line. Moreover, the amount of PSA transcript in MCF- 7, a PSA-negative <b>breast</b> <b>line,</b> increased after incubation with cycloheximide. Interestingly, the frequency of positivity was as high as 12 % in male samples if only tested once, but dropped to 3 % upon multiple testing of the same cDNA. This highlights the stochastic effects in RT-PCR results at high sensitivity, hence the importance of repetitive testing in clinical samples. Decreasing the number of cycles avoided the amplification of illegitimate transcripts but also affected the limit of detection, as evidenced with PSA and PSM cDNA containing plasmids, mixing of LNCap with normal blood samples, and the PSA-PSM-negative K 562 cell line. The current data raise the need for a multicentric standardization of the RT-PCR methodology used to amplify PSA and PSM transcripts...|$|E

A small lesion relative {{to the size of}} breast in this location may be resolved by performing a level I oncoplastic technique. However, a wide excision may significantly reduce the overall quality of the breast shape by distorting the visible <b>breast</b> <b>line.</b> From June 2012 to April 2015, 36 patients with breast cancer {{located in the}} upper/upper inner quadrant underwent breast-conservation surgery with matrix rotation mammoplasty. According to the size and location of the tumor relative to the nipple-areola complex, 11 patients underwent matrix rotation with periareolar de-epithelialization (donut group) and the other 25 underwent matrix rotation only (non-donut group). The cosmetic results were self-assessed by questionnaires. The average weights of the excised breast lumps in the donut and non-donut groups were 104. 1 and 84. 5 g, respectively. During the 3 -year follow-up period, local recurrence was observed in one case and was managed with nipple-sparing mastectomy followed by breast reconstruction with prosthetic implants. In total, 31 patients (88. 6 %) ranked their postoperative result as either acceptable or satisfactory. The treated breasts were also self-evaluated by 27 patients (77. 1 %) to be nearly identical to or just slightly different from the untreated side. Matrix rotation is an easy breast-preserving technique for treating breast cancer located in the upper/upper inner quadrant of the breast that requires a relatively wide excision.

40|$|We {{introduce}} an agent-based {{model of}} epithelial cell morphogenesis {{to explore the}} complex interplay between apoptosis, proliferation, and polarization. By varying the activity levels of these mechanisms we derived phenotypic transition maps of normal and aberrant morphogenesis. These maps identify homeostatic ranges and morphologic stability conditions. The agent-based model was parameterized and validated using novel high-content image analysis of mammary acini morphogenesis in vitro with focus on time-dependent cell densities, proliferation and death rates, as well as acini morphologies. Model simulations reveal apoptosis being necessary and sufficient for initiating lumen formation, but cell polarization being the pivotal mechanism for maintaining physiological epithelium morphology and acini sphericity. Furthermore, simulations highlight that acinus growth arrest in normal acini {{can be achieved by}} controlling the fraction of proliferating cells. Interestingly, our simulations reveal a synergism between polarization and apoptosis in enhancing growth arrest. After validating the model with experimental data from a normal human <b>breast</b> <b>line</b> (MCF 10 A), the system was challenged to predict the growth of MCF 10 A where AKT- 1 was overexpressed, leading to reduced apoptosis. As previously reported, this led to non growth-arrested acini, with very large sizes and partially filled lumen. However, surprisingly, image analysis revealed a much lower nuclear density than observed for normal acini. The growth kinetics indicates that these acini grew faster than the cells comprising it. The in silico model could not replicate this behavior, contradicting the classic paradigm that ductal carcinoma in situ is only the result of high proliferation and low apoptosis. Our simulations suggest that overexpression of AKT- 1 must also perturb cell-cell and cell-ECM communication, reminding us that extracellular context can dictate cellular behavior...|$|E
40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are known {{to play an important}} role in human health due to the range of phytochemicals they contain. Twenty-one peach genotypes and 45 plum genotypes with different flesh and skin color were analyzed for their antioxidant content and antioxidant activity. Anthocyanin content, phenolic content and antioxidant activity were higher in red-flesh than in light-colored flesh peaches. Carotenoid content was higher in yellow-flesh peaches. Among the peaches, the antioxidant activity was well correlated with phenolic content. The anthocyanin content among the plums increased with the red color intensity. Red-flesh plums generally had higher phenolic content than the other plums. Antioxidant activity was higher in red-flesh genotypes; however, it was strongly correlated only with the phenolic content in light-colored flesh plums. Extracts from selected genotypes of peaches and plums and their fractions were evaluated against two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB- 435 and MCF- 7) and one non-cancerous <b>breast</b> <b>line</b> (MCF- 10 A). The cells were cultured in the presence of peach and plum extracts and their fractions at various concentrations (0 - 500 ??g/ml) and the cell viability and antiproliferation activity was evaluated by MTT assay and Coulter Counter. There was a dose-dependent reduction on cell viability of estrogen-negative MDA-MB- 435 breast cancer cells. Only weak activity against MCF- 7 was observed at high extract concentrations. There was no activity against MCF- 10 A after 24 h treatment. Fraction I, which consists of mainly phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid and a caffeic acid derivative, reduces MDA-MB- 435 breast cancer cell viability with the lowest IC 50. The second most effective fraction was Fraction II which contained anthocyanins. Fraction III (flavonols) and Fraction IV (polymerized compounds) had no effect on the cell lines. Phenolic acids present in fraction I induced apoptosis in MDA-MB- 435 estrogen receptor-negative cell line.

40|$|Natural gas is {{a highly}} {{desirable}} energy source because of its high calorific value and clean-burning characteristics compared to other fuels. Natural gas, which is composed primarily of methane (CH 4), occurs as associated and non-associated form in reservoirs. The largest gas reserves are located in remote and thinly populated areas, viz. in Eastern Europe & Former USSR and the Middle East. Natural gas is transported either by pipeline {{in the form of}} compressed gas or after liquefaction by LNG carrier in the liquid state as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). LNG is inherent to transport by LNG carrier. It can also be transformed by chemical conversion and transported by a chemicals tanker. While the market for chemicals remains small, the LNG trade is expanding considerably. The expanding LNG trade is caused by the growing gas demand combined with the fact that where {{there is little or no}} gas supplies available or where long distance pipeline gas transport is economically or technically unfeasible, LNG transport generally appears to be the only feasible solution. BNE Ballast Nedam Engineering (BNE) is the in-house design company of the international contractor Ballast Nedam. BNE has the intention to extend her field of action from the final design phase to the earliest stages of LNG projects. In these earliest stages of LNG projects it has to be evaluated whether or not an acceptable rate of return is possible. Within this report it has been determined whether it is possible to develop a financial evaluation model for a quick reliable estimate of the LNG jetty investment and an accurate evaluation of the project's feasibility. The product 'standard LNG jetty' In order to enable quick estimating of the jetty investment, the LNG jetties are considered as a standard product. The product 'standard LNG jetty' consists of (1) a loading platform which supports loading-, fire-fighting- and miscellaneous equipment and provides vehicular and pedestrian access; (2) breasting and mooring dolphins which absorb berthing energy and transmit breasting forces to the subsoil respectively keep the ship close to the berth by transmitting <b>breast</b> <b>line</b> forces to the subsoil and (3) a trestle which connects the loading platform to the shore in order to provide vehicular and pedestrian access and support to the LNG (un) loading lines, vapor return line and cable trays. Opportunities and threats The market for LNG and the market for the product 'standard LNG jetty' look strong for the period through 2015. LNG trade is expected to expand by over 90 % between 19992010 under a scenario most likely, reaching 241. 3 billion m 3 of gas. An important factor in this growth is the governmental agreement relating to caps on carbon emissions according to the Kyoto protocol through which the need for natural gas increases. Moreover, modern natural gas fired combined cycle power plants have very high efficiencies, which can exceed 55 % and their capital costs are about 60 % lower than that of a similar sized coal- or nuclear plants. Opposed to this, the close location of natural gas hydrates to some of the major markets for LNG or the technical and economic improvements of deepwater gas pipelines could dampen growth in the LNG market.
