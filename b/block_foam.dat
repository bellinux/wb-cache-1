40|$|Forced {{convection}} heat transfer in a channel with different configurations of graphite foams is experimentally and numerically studied in this paper. The physical properties of graphite foams {{such as the}} porosity, pore diameter, density, permeability and Forchheimer coefficient are determined experimentally. The local temperatures at {{the surface of the}} heat source and the pressure drops across different configurations of graphite foams are measured. In the numerical simulations, the Navier–Stokes and Brinkman–Forchheimer equations are used to model the fluid flow in the open and porous regions, respectively. The local thermal non-equilibrium model is adopted in the energy equations to evaluate the solid and fluid temperatures. Comparisons are made between the experimental and simulation results. The results showed that the solid <b>block</b> <b>foam</b> has the best heat transfer performance at the expense of high pressure drop. However, the proposed configurations can achieve relatively good enhancement of heat transfer at moderate pressure drop...|$|E

The potential for aspiration of aqueous foam during its use and the resulting adverse effects associated with complete immersion in aqueous foam is of major concern to the NIJ when examining the effectiveness and safety of using this technology as a Less-Than-Lethal weapon. This preliminary study was designed to evaluate the maximum quantity of foam that might be aspirated by an individual following total immersion in an SNL-developed aqueous foam. A. T. W. Reed Breathing simulator equipped with a 622 Silverman cam was used to simulate the aspiration of an ammonium laureth sulfate aqueous foam developed by SNL and generated at expansion ratios in the range of 500 : 1 to 1000 : 1. Although the natural instinct of an individual immersed in foam is to cover their nose and mouth with a hand or cloth, thus breaking the bubbles and decreasing the potential for aspiration, this study was performed to examine a worst case scenario where mouth breathing only was examined, and no attempt was made to <b>block</b> <b>foam</b> entry into the breathing port. Two breathing rates were examined: one that simulated a sedentary individual with a mean breathing rate of 6. 27 breaths/minute, and one that simulated an agitated or heavily breathing individual with a mean breathing rate of 23. 7 breaths/minute.

A novel concept of Regular Packing and Stacking (RPS) was developed for production of macro-composites <b>block</b> <b>foams</b> that combines extrusion foaming of starch foams with selfadhesion aided by application of water to produce <b>block</b> <b>foams</b> with a network of reinforcing interfaces. The structure and material properties of the foams can be manipulated through control of foam cell structure and the interface network. Parameters controlling the evolution of cell structures including processing conditions and additives were systematically studied using a twin-screw extruder. Under constant screw speed and controlled feed rate, high barrel temperature profiles with appropriate water contents were found to result in finer cell structure foams. Short length reverse screw with tight pitch was found more effective to produce fine cell foams. Addition of 22 micron talc powder at 1 wt% was found effective as a nucleating agent. Addition of flax fibre resulted in fine cell and high strength foams. The key variables in design and operation of a RPS machine were investigated. A pultrusion technique has been employed to reform the extruded foam strands to modify their shape and density and facilitate self-adhesion. Uniform wetting was achieved by using water absorbent fabrics to apply water in a controlled manner. Foam strands were then bonded to form macro-composite <b>block</b> <b>foams.</b> A RPS demonstration machine was successfully developed. The key factors affecting the macro structure and performances of the RPS <b>block</b> <b>foams</b> were investigated in great detail. Extruded foam strands were anisotropic and this feature was utilised in the design of RPS <b>block</b> <b>foams</b> to manipulate their properties in different strands' orientations. Thicker interfaces formed a network within the RPS <b>block</b> <b>foams,</b> which was found to make a significant contribution to the strengthening of the RPS foams (by a factor of 3). High humidity conditioning of the RPS foams was found an efficient way to control density and refine cell structure of the foams which could increase foam density by a factor of 3. 5 and compressive strength by a factor of 10. This work has made significant contributions {{to the development of a}} novel technology for processing of <b>block</b> <b>foams</b> based on starch foam and understanding of extrusion foaming process, structure and properties of the starch materials. The research results paved the way for the industrial development of biodegradable <b>block</b> <b>foams</b> for cushion packaging application, which are based on renewable resources and are bio-compostable and thus facilitate reduction of landfill at the end of their intended service life.

40|$|Abstract—Oxysterols are key {{regulators}} of {{lipid metabolism}} and regulate gene expression by activating the liver X receptor (LXR). LXR plays {{a vital role}} in macrophage foam cell formation, a central event in atherosclerosis. It is known that addition of exogenous oxysterols to cultured macrophages activates LXR, leading to increased expression of ABCA 1 and cholesterol efflux. In this study, we tested the novel hypothesis that stimulation of endogenous oxysterol synthesis would <b>block</b> <b>foam</b> cell formation induced by atherogenic lipoproteins. Macrophage synthesis of 24 (S), 25 -epoxycho-lesterol, a potent LXR ligand, increased 60 -fold by partial inhibition of 2, 3 -oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSC), a microsomal enzyme in both the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the alternative oxysterol synthetic pathway. When macrophages were challenged with human hypertriglyceridemic VLDL (HTG-VLDL), cellular cholesteryl ester accumulation increased 12 -fold. This was reduced dramatically, by 65 %, after preincubation with an OSC inhibitor (OSCi). The HTG-VLDL–induced accumulation of macrophage TG (70 -fold) was unaffected by the OSCi or exogenous 24 (S), 25 -epoxycholesterol, an effect associated with suppression of SREBP- 1 processing. By contrast, TO 901317, a synthetic LXR agonist, increased cellular TG significantly and markedly increased SREBP- 1 processing. OSC inhibition decreased HTG-VLDL uptake through downregulation of LDL-receptor expression, despite substantial inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, OSC inhibition significantly upregulated ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 expression, which led to enhanced macrophage cholesterol efflux, an effect mediated through LXR activation. Therefore, increased macrophage synthesis of endogenous oxysterols represents a new mechanism for the dual regulation of LXR- and SREBP-responsive genes, an approach that inhibits foam cell formation without detrimental effect on TG synthesis...|$|E

40|$|The liquid–solid mass {{transfer}} rate in a rotating foam stirrer reactor {{and in a}} slurry reactor is studied using the hydrogenation of styrene as a model reaction. The rotating foam stirrer reactor is a novel type of multi-phase reactor where highly open-celled materials, solid foams, are used as a catalyst support and as a stirrer. The design of the foam stirrer has a strong influence on the liquid–solid {{mass transfer}} rate. Using a donut-shaped <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> configuration, the liquid solid mass transfer coefficient, kLS, is five times lower than in a blade configuration. The reduced liquid circulation through the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> structure is explained by a higher frictional pressure drop. The pore Reynolds number indicates that the flow is in the laminar regime for the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> stirrer while it is turbulent for the blade stirrer. Local measurements of kLS indicate a mass transfer profile along {{the height of the}} <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> structure, allowing a pertinent choice of the catalyst location within the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> and/or suggesting changes of the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> design to avoid the bottom effects, for instance, using a conical <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> shape. However, the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> stirrer offers higher liquid–solid interfacial area than a blade stirrer, resulting in higher kLSaLS. At a power input above and using a 20 ppi <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> with the top part catalytically active, the reaction rate is not liquid–solid mass transfer limited. Compared to a Rushton stirrer, the liquid–solid mass transfer rate is enhanced because of a high liquid–solid interfacial area and a fast refreshment of the catalyst surface. kLSaLS values of 0. 5 s- 1 are obtained compared to 0. 04 s- 1 for the slurry system. The same production rate as in the slurry reactor is achieved using 62 % less catalyst. As the catalyst is immobilized on the stirrer, an additional advantage of the rotating foam stirrer reactor is the absence of a catalyst separation step. Attrition and agglomeration of the catalyst do not occur and the foam catalyst can be reused...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the plastic}} {{crushing}} response is studied for an aluminum <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> of varying cross-section under impact. The {{influence of the}} gradient on the cross-section is investigated. Based on the one-dimensional shock theory, an analytical model is proposed to investigate an impact scenario, in which a <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> with a gradient in its cross-section together with a rigid mass impinges onto a rigid target. Because {{of the change in}} the cross-sectional area along the length, two possible deformation modes may appear, namely the double shock mode and the single shock mode. When the largest cross-section is impinged, two compaction zones in the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> are found, while only one compaction zone appears from the impinged end when the smallest cross-section is impinged. Of particular interests are the absorbed energy and the force transmitted to the target.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two years, serious {{concerns}} have been expressed in the press about human exposures to trace amounts of alkyl tin moieties such as tributyltin (TBT). Organostannic compounds are commonly used as catalysts in polyurethane chemistry. Whereas stannous octoate (SNOCT) exhibits a TBT content below the detection limit of most analysis equipment (< 0. 01 %, TBT levels as high as 0. 6 % have been measured in dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL). Although DBTDL manufacturers are currently optimising their process to lower the TBT content in DBTDL, the (chemo) pressure exerted on polyurethane foamers is such that DBTDL-free formulations are being actively looked for. High resilience (HR) foams based on various polymer polyols - particularly polyols made with pure polystyrene (POSTech*) or poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) have been developed using DBTDL as the gel catalyst. The direct replacement of DBTDL is not straightforward, as <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> dimensional stability issues (often referred to as "cold flow") are encountered when other catalyst (i. e., SNOCT) are used. This "cold flow" phenomenon is very much dependent on the size {{and the weight of}} the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> produced, making all small scale laboratory experiments unsuitable for developing novel stable HR foam formulations. The present research has shown that properties derived from small scale experiments can nevertheless be related to the "cold flowability" of HR formulations.

40|$|The liquid-solid mass {{transfer}} rate is studied for two three-phase reactor configurations, a stirred reactor and a rotating solid foam reactor, using {{the dissolution of}} copper by potassium dichromate as a model reaction. For the stirred reactor consisting of a Rushton stirrer and a slurry with small particles, the particle density has a large influence on the liquid-solid {{mass transfer}} rate. Heavy particles show high slip velocities, as their path is less influenced by the liquid turbulence. Furthermore, the mass transfer is enhanced by neighboring particles passing each other. In the case of solid copper particles, a kLS value of 3 × 10 - 3 ms- 1 was observed. For particles having a density comparable to industrial catalyst supports, the kLS value is 1 order of magnitude lower. For the rotating <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> stirrer also, high kLS values of 2. 5 × 10 - 3 ms- 1 could be achieved due to the high liquid velocity along the foam struts. The influence of several parameters on the hydrodynamics and the liquid-solid mass transfer was studied. Among these, the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> height, the <b>foam</b> pore size, and the space above the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> stirrer have a large effect on the liquid circulation, the bubble formation, and therefore on the liquid-solid mass transfer. The reduction of the foam pore size has two counterbalancing effects, resulting only in a slight increase of the rate of mass transfer: (i) the liquid-solid interfacial area is increased; (ii) the liquid circulation is, however, reduced due to the higher frictional pressure drop. Gas bubbles passing the foam struts affect the liquid-solid mass transfer by inducing liquid velocity fluctuations. For the <b>foam</b> <b>block</b> stirrer, a maximum kLSaLS value of 0. 6 s- 1 was obtained. This shows great potential for further optimization of the liquid flow and therefore the mass transfer.
