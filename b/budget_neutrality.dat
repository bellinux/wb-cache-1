40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Medicare program's prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provides incentives for hospitals to operate efficiently by paying them a predetermined, fixed amount for each inpatient hospital stay regardless of the actual costs incurred in providing the care. Although the fixed amount is based on national average costs, actual per stay payments vary widely across hospitals, primarily because of two payment adjustments in the PPS. One adjustment accounts for cost differences across patients due to their care needs and the other accounts for the substantial variation in labor costs across the country. The Medicare program's labor cost adjustment may not adequately account for geographic differences in hospital wages because of problems with the definition of labor markets. The geographic areas used by Medicare to approximate hospital labor markets often encompass large areas in which hospitals {{in different parts of}} an area or different types of communities pay widely varying wages. Geographic reclassification does not systematically address inadequacies in the way the Medicare program defines geographic areas, although it allows some, but not all, hospitals that may be in distinct labor market and pay wages above the average in their area to receive a higher labor cost adjustment. Geographic reclassification reduces payments to hospitals that do not reclassify because of the <b>budget</b> <b>neutrality</b> requirement, and the amount of this reduction would vary across hospitals under a state-specific <b>budget</b> <b>neutrality</b> approach depending on their location. In 2002, payments to metropolitan hospitals that were not reclassified were 1 percent lower and payments to nonmetropolitan hospitals that were not reclassified were 0. 6 percent lower because of geographic reclassification. If the <b>budget</b> <b>neutrality</b> provision were calculated and applied within individual states instead of nationally, the adjustment would be smaller in those states in which hospitals did not benefit much from reclassification and higher in states where a higher proportion of hospitals reclassified. ...|$|E

Monthly proton budgets were estimated for the root zone (0 - 90 cm layer) and for the 0 - 25 and 25 - 90 cm layers. After an annual cycle, the root zone was alkalinized by 0. 5 to 3. 1 kmol OH- ha-'. The alkalinity originated from the mineralization of the organic anions contained in the organic matter. The <b>budget</b> was near <b>neutrality</b> in the 0 - 25 cm layer (range:- 1. 0 to 1. 4 kmol H+ ha-'), whereas there was net alkalinization in the 25 - 90 cm layer (1. 7 to 2. 3 h o l OH- ha-'). In the 0 - 25 cm layer, the acidity produced in autumn by mineralization of organic nitrogen was counterbalanced by the alkalinity released from crop residues.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of the Indonesian government’s 2008 income tax policy reform on its economy, using the computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. In 2008, the Indonesian parliament approved the government’s proposal to amend the income tax laws. Essential amendments included adjusting the personal income marginal tax rates and adopting a single corporate income tax rate. These amendments {{are part of the}} tax reform and fiscal adjustment program that the government has implemented gradually since the early 2000 s, with a value added tax and luxury sales tax reform on the agenda. These policies were initiated to achieve two objectives: to increase tax revenue and to promote sustainable economic growth. Along with economic growth, income equality is an important tax policy objective. Taxes are instruments for the redistribution of income and welfare between different household groups. Normally, a tax system is considered to have a positive effect upon income distribution and welfare if lower-income groups pay less than higher ones, as exemplified in many countries’ progressive income tax policies. A good tax system should be used as a policy instrument not only to protect the low-income households from paying an undue amount of tax but also {{to reduce the number of}} households below the poverty line. The relationship between tax policy reforms and the economy is complex; in some cases, large-scale tax reform can impact through inter-industry linkages simultaneously, making it difficult to explain, in theoretical terms, the impacts on the economy. However, identifying the important relationships among these inter-industry relationships may help to measure and evaluate the impacts on the economy. For this study, three policy scenarios were simulated. The first was an adjustment in the personal income tax rate structure; the second was an application of a single rate to the corporate income tax; and the third was a combination of these policies. The simulations were conducted under two different assumptions: with and without a balanced-budget condition. The balanced budget (or <b>budget</b> <b>neutrality)</b> condition is defined as the situation where government spending and revenue move in such a way to maintain a constant budget balance. The non-balanced budget condition is when revenue and spending do not necessarily move in line. The simulations were run under short- and long-run scenarios. The simulation results suggest that under the balanced budget-neutrality condition the income tax policy reform, which comprises the adjustment of the PIT rate structure and the application of a single CIT rate, benefits the overall economy with positive impacts arising. In the long-run, the policies increase aggregate welfare in the economy, indicated by the increase in real GDP and consumption expenditure. The results also show that income taxes tend to have a distortionary effect on the economy. As a result, the tax cut policy brings about increased economic welfare. The policies also cause a production factors to be reorganised. Excess labour, particularly in the government sector, is reallocated to other industries; this reallocation of labour is not only between sectors but also between labour categories-from skilled labour categories (e. g. management/professional and clerical labour) to the more unskilled labour categories (e. g. production and agricultural labour). While the policy simulations only have a small effect on reducing the incidence of poverty, they do increase the level of income inequality. A closer look at the policies’ impacts indicates that the adjustment of the PIT rate structure and the application of a single CIT rate provides more benefits to those in higher income groups, when compared to those with the lowest income. Rather, the impact on the lower income groups arise more from the indirect effects of economic growth. It is noteworthy that the CIT policy is more advantageous compared to the PIT policy in terms of promoting exports, inflation control, and attracting investment. This study improves our understanding of how the Indonesian government’s tax policies affect the country’s economy. Importantly, the study analyses the country’s economic development by examining the taxation policy’s impact not only at a macro-level, such as the impact on economic growth and employment, but also at a micro-level, such as the impacts on poverty and income distribution. The findings of this study provide important lessons to similar developing countries that are reforming their tax systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} that puts emphasis on increased contestability and student choice can maximise the public {{value for the}} government’s investment in VET, according to this report. Executive Summary Background The NSW Government recognises {{the need for an}} educated, skilled workforce to drive a productive economy, support workforce participation and grow industry and business. Its goal is to increase the proportion of working-aged people with post school qualifications at Certificate III level and above, from 55. 8 per cent in 2010 to 83. 7 per cent in 2020, an increase of 50 per cent. Over the last decade, the Commonwealth has contributed to Vocational Education and Training (VET) reform through a series of National Partnership Agreements. The most recent of these, the 2012 National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform (NPASR), required an entitlement for subsidised training. Governments will pay the subsidy to Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) that attract and train students. Governments agreed to provide greater competition in an accessible, transparent, efficient and quality training sector that is responsive to the needs of students, employers and industry. Under NPASR, the Commonwealth will pay New South Wales $ 561. 6 million over five years from 2012 – 13 for delivering the reform, including the goal of increasing the number of people completing post-school qualifications by an average of around 16, 000 (14 per cent) each year. Governments used the flexibility provided under NPASR to implement the reforms in different ways. Victoria began before NPASR commenced, setting up a demand-driven system in 2008 with low barriers to RTO entry. Five years later 100 per cent of the VET market was contestable, training 207, 000 (72 per cent) more students at a cost of an extra $ 764 million (65 per cent). Since 2013, Victoria has sought to reduce VET expenditure, improve quality and value for money and fund the rationalisation of the public provider TAFE. Other States have also sought to cap expenditure and ensure quality and a reduced but ongoing role for TAFE. Governments subsidise different qualifications for different student groups for different amounts. New South Wales is the latest State to implement the reform. The Minister for Education announced the Smart and Skilled reform in 2012, which introduced a VET entitlement from 1 January 2015. The VET reform aims to get more people trained while maximising public value for the government’s investment. Unlike Victoria, New South Wales intends the reform to be budget neutral. In 2013 – 14, the NSW Government spent $ 2, 185. 5 million subsiding VET for around 500, 000 student enrolments. TAFE accounted for over 85 per cent of the VET spending and 77 per cent of the student enrolments. The Government expects the VET reform to gradually reduce that proportion but for TAFE to continue to be the major provider. Apart from meeting its commitment to introduce an entitlement without spending more, the government’s other major policy objectives under NPASR are to: 	sustain TAFE in a competitive market 	introduce consumer driven contestability 	ensure VET is available across the State and to disadvantaged groups 	provide high quality training. This audit assessed the effectiveness of the Department of Education and Communities’ (the Department) framework for VET reform and whether {{it has the potential to}} achieve these objectives. More details on the audit objective, scope and focus are outlined in Appendix 1. We undertook the audit before the new VET Smart and Skilled reform commenced on 1 January 2015. Conclusion The Department’s framework for VET reform has the potential to effectively achieve the government’s immediate objectives for the reform, which are associated with meeting its commitments under the National Partnership Agreement for Skills Reform without spending more. We found that the government is addressing VET reform objectives in the following order of priority: 	no extra cost (<b>budget</b> <b>neutrality)</b> 	TAFE viability 	quality VET 	access to VET for regions and equity groups 	more contestability 	student choice. Overall, we conclude that a more balanced approach, by putting more emphasis on increased contestability and student choice, is more likely to maximise the public value for the government’s investment in VET. In addition, the VET reform framework does not address the government’s longer-term goal to increase the proportion of working-aged people with post-school qualifications at Certificate level III and above by 50 per cent by 2020. New South Wales is most unlikely to reach this State Plan goal on current trends. The VET reform’s budget neutral objective, its pricing structure and the incentives for efficiency mean that it is unlikely to generate the funds needed to meet this State Plan goal. It is appropriate that the framework separates responsibility for purchasing and providing training. However, this separation is incomplete. The government continues to provide TAFE with direct non-contestable funding. The budget for this direct funding is not subject to clear purchaser oversight, nor is it clear how long it will continue or what TAFE will deliver for it. In addition, the benefits of the VET reforms depend on achieving the efficiency outcomes of the TAFE reforms. While the Department has addressed benefits management principles in its documentation, it does not have a benefits realisation plan and register to ensure that it can demonstrate which VET reform benefits have been achieved in four years’ time. The Smart and Skilled reform is a complex initiative. The Department is developing the key systems, tools and processes necessary to purchase and manage training in 2015 and to inform students’ choice of provider. The implementation of the Smart and Skilled reform and its enabling systems has been delayed and remains on a tight timetable. The Department has used suitable project management controls to ensure that the Smart and Skilled reform commenced on its revised 1 January 2015 launch date...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a stylised {{simulation}} model to consider potential behavioural {{responses to the}} reduction in pension taper rates associated with replacing the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) with the Pension Credit (PC). A range of long-run responses to the policy change are identified, summarised by four behavioural "types": 1. Households on very low incomes, who do not save any wealth under the MIG — comprising 17 {{percent of the population}} in 2004. The behaviour of these households is affected only slightly by replacing the MIG with the PC. These households do not save for retirement and choose to exit the labour market before state pensionable age because of their low labour incomes (relative to welfare benefits), rather than in response to the effects of means tested pensions. 2. Households (other than those described under 1) for which a marginal increase in savings would be subject to a 100 % taper under the MIG — comprising 12 percent of the population in 2004. Substitution effects dominate with the introduction of the PC, and these households choose to increase their savings for retirement (by £ 11, 000 on average between ages 60 and 64), and to choose a later retirement age (an additional 18 % to 20 % choose to be employed between ages 60 and 64). Interestingly, the increase in government expenditure implied by the reduced taper rates on private income for this population subgroup under the PC is more than off-set by the increase in revenues associated with the subgroup’s increase in savings. The responses of this population group consequently appear to most accurately reflect the suppositions of those who argued for a move away from the MIG. 3. Households (other than those described under either 1 or 2) with sufficient savings under the MIG to generate incomes close to the upper threshold for which benefits can be received under the PC — approximately corresponding to the third population quintile (31 % of the population 1). These households are unambiguously better off under the PC. In the absence of behavioural responses, some of these households would receive a state retirement benefit under the PC where they would not under the MIG, and the PC implies a smaller cost of consumption during the working lifetime than the MIG. Hence, both substitution and income effects motivate these households to reduce their retirement savings (by £ 6, 500 -£ 7, 300 on average between ages 60 and 64), and to take earlier retirement (between 4 % and 7 % fewer choose to be employed between ages 60 and 64) under the PC relative to the MIG. The behavioural responses of these households draw a clear contrast with those described under 2. 4. Households that earn sufficiently high incomes, so that they lie beyond the thresholds of means tested pension benefits under either the MIG or the PC — comprising the fourth, and in particular, highest population quintile (approximately 40 % of the population). As could be expected, these households {{do not appear to be}} much affected by the policy counterfactual considered here. Aggregating the behavioural effects over a population cohort suggests that substitution effects on poorer households will dominate the long-run impact on retirement of the shift from the MIG to the PC, so that an additional 0. 5 - 1. 4 % of the population will choose to supply labour between ages 60 and 64. In contrast, the offsetting savings responses of alternative households produce an insubstantial fall in aggregate population savings. In terms of the long-run budgetary impact of the change from the MIG to the PC, the study supports the view that the reduction in pensions means testing will reduce the reliance on the welfare state. The effect of the policy change on the aggregate Government budget, however, suggests overall <b>budget</b> <b>neutrality.</b> Under the PC, the effects of reduced government expenditure on means-tested benefits, reduced tax receipts from savings and increased tax receipts from working longer all offset one another. This last observation is a key result of the current study, and arises due to an interesting relation between the behavioural responses of lower and middle income households. In the absence of behavioural responses, it is clear that many households in receipt of the MIG would receive a larger state benefit under the PC. Our analysis, however, implies that lower income households will actually impose a smaller burden on the public purse under the PC than they would have under the MIG, because of their responses to the improved incentives to save. This net benefit to the government budget is almost exactly offset in our analysis by the responses of middle income households, who save less and retire earlier under the PC. The finding of budgetary neutrality is important as it suggests that the policy reform is welfare improving, since all households are at least as well off under the PC as they would have been under the MIG, and some are made strictly better off. Sensitivity of the above results to aspects of the policy environment are also reported here, and are summarised in Table 1. This table indicates that reducing means testing beyond the PC by providing a Citizen’s Pension equal to the MIG, exaggerates the behavioural responses of households in the first and second quintiles, increases the consumption (both pre and post retirement) of households above the second quintile, and imposes a higher cost on the public purse. Furthermore, we consider the effects of allowing the PC to extend up the income distribution, as is implied by the differential indexing that is currently applied to the Savings Credit. This analysis suggests that extending the PC up the income distribution will not have a substantial effect on the behaviour of the lowest quintile (as these households are indifferent to policy changes that affect incomes beyond a lower threshold), will reduce the behavioural responses observed for the second quintile (as the range of means tested incomes in retirement is extended), will motivate the third quintile to save and work less (as a larger proportion are subject to means testing), and motivate households in the fourth and fifth quintiles to save more (due to the income effects of a relative fall in the value of the basic state pension). ...|$|E
