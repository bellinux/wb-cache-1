40|$|With chronic post {{surgical}} pain affecting up to {{one third}} of patients undergoing surgeries {{and the price of}} treatment being astoundingly high there has been a transition in research to investigate and identify risk factors. Through identification of risk factors new preventative measures can be taken to ensure better surgical outcomes. The role that psychosocial factors can play in the development of chronic post surgical pain has long been recognized yet its mechanisms are still unknown. We aim to investigate how environment can play a direct role in pain perception and sensitivity. We used a Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) paradigm to induce depression in 10 adult male mice, we used 10 control mice who were left in standard opti cages, and 10 enriched mice who were placed in large enrichment cages. CMS mice were exposed to a series of stressors and all mice underwent spared nerve injury surgery. During spared nerve injury the common peroneal and tibial branches of the sciatic nerve were severed while the sural branch was left intact. Overall well-being and pain threshold of mice were tested via Von Frey, Hot Plate, Heat Place Preference, Dynamic Weight <b>Bearing,</b> <b>Hole</b> Board, and Social Interaction. It was found that CMS mice experienced thermal hyperalgesia yet normal thermal threshold sensation. CMS mice also spent less time interacting with novel mice in social interaction, and less amount of time exploring the center of the hole board arena than control or enriched mice. While Von Frey results did not change {{over the course of the}} experiment, dynamic weight bearing results indicated spared nerve injury surgery was successful and produced chronic pain. Results indicate that environment plays a role in thermal pain perception and CMS affected overall well being of mice as CMS mice exhibited more timid and anxious behavior...|$|E

50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{brinelling}} {{is the use of}} improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when pressing <b>bearings</b> into <b>holes</b> or onto shafts.

If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. Flat pressing plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|R

Surprisingly, the behaviour of the specimens having cold expanded holes was worse than that of specimens with untreated holes.

Several hypotheses were formulated and experimentally verified to overcome this problem, such as deeper hole deburring, rivet diameter, joint design and grip material, steel instead of aluminium alloy. Additional tests demonstrated that the problem was not present in sealed joint as the surface upset was hidden in the sealant thickness. Sealants have detrimental effects in the fatigue resistance of riveted joints, as they increase the load transferred by rivet <b>bearing.</b> The <b>hole</b> expansion is beneficial in this condition, while in un-sealed joints its effect must be accurately evaluated.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} thermodynamic and fluid mechanic analysis of an engine lubrication system. A comprehensive thermofluid computer model {{was developed to}} provide a flexible design analysis tool for the accurate prediction of oil pressures, flow rates and temperatures at any point within any lubrication system. Technical and financial support for the study was provided by Jaguar Cars. A comprehensive literature review revealed that the past {{research in this field}} had concentrated on either the thermofluid analysis of the lubrication system by engine testing, or the detailed analysis of individual components. A small number of computer models were developed for the flow analysis of the whole lubrication system. However, these models had limited heat transfer prediction capabilities, some requiring measured engine temperature data, and were not flexible enough to be employed as design tools. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a flexible steady-state thermofluid design analysis tool, by integrating a flow analysis approach with a detailed analysis of the heat transfer within the engine block. Mathematical models of the thermofluid behaviour of the lubrication system components were developed and were implemented in a suite of FORTRAN computer programs which formed the design analysis package. A simple, linear flow model was initially developed to represent the system with a combination of laminar pipes, pumps, filters, journal <b>bearings,</b> crank-shaft transfer <b>holes</b> and cam <b>bearing</b> transfer <b>holes.</b> The linear program provided a rapid analysis tool, but the accuracy of the results were limited by the simplified flow characteristics of the system components. A more comprehensive and flexible non-linear flow model was developed, which solved for the unknowns with an iterative technique. Additional component models with non-linear flow characteristics, such as turbulent pipes, annular pipes, strainers, and oil coolers, were developed. The non-linear solution technique was proven to be robust and flexible and was subsequently used in all the analysis programs. The heat transfer to the oil within the pressurised part of the lubrication system is modelled by the heat transfer program. The engine block temperatures are calculated by the engine block program. This program accounts for the heat transfer to the oil splashed on to the internal surfaces of the engine. The engine geometry is represented by a series of block elements and modelled as a nodal resistance network. This capability has particular importance during the design stage, rapidly providing an estimate of the temperature profile through the engine block, results which were previously only available from expensive and slow FEA models. It was shown that both the Jaguar AJ 6 and V 8 engine lubrication systems could be analyzed in great detail. Engine tests showed that the predicted flow rates, pressures and temperatures were in excellent agreement with measured values. The overall accuracy of the results induced a high degree of confidence in the thermofluid model. The final analysis package was proven to be easy to use, robust, rapid, flexible and accurate. The design analysis package, developed during the course of this study, represents a unique stand-alone simulation tool which can rapidly analyze any engine lubrication system configuration. This package provides a valuable analysis tool which can be used to optimise system designs at the initial design stage and the diagnosis of performance problems during the development phase. Parametric studies can be easily carried out on the lubrication system and engine block configuration to identify areas which can enhance heat transfer to the oil. The steady-state analysis package forms an excellent platform for the development of a full transient model. This would allow a detailed analysis of the lubrication system during engine warm-up, with the aim of reducing engine emissions and determining minimum oil requirements...|$|R

The investigation included finite element analysis and a program of experimental testing for quasi-isotropic laminates, uni-directional laminates and laminates with fibres steered along predefined trajectories. The investigation formed part of a research program in the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures Ltd (CRC-ACS) support by the Office of Naval Research from the United States. Work in progress in the CRC includes research defined in this thesis including the addition of nano-particles to the resin to improve the bearing strength. The literature survey undertaken in this thesis identified that the micro-buckling theory proposed by Professor C. T. Sun from Purdue University, Indiana USA, is the best analysis procedure for initial bearing failure in pin-loaded laminates. This failure theory has therefore been implemented in a Fortran program using the results from a finite element analysis for the nonlinear contact problem of a pin <b>bearing</b> on a <b>hole</b> in a composite laminate. The finite element analysis is executed using the commercial finite element system MSC. MARC. The numerical predictions have been validated by a test of progressive failure with the aid of an acoustic emission monitoring system. The acoustic emission parametric and frequency analysis is performed using the acoustic emission software Vallen Systeme. Fast fourier transformation of the waveform have been achieved to distinguish and identify microfailure mode. Failure mechanisms have been verified by post-mortem microstructural examination. There are 3 failure mechanisms associated with bearing failure in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite, the first is fibre matrix interfacial failure, followed by fibre fracture, and subsequently matrix splitting. The application of AE technique has been applied successfully to characterise the development of failure...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveMarrow-stimulation {{techniques}} {{are used by}} surgeons to repair cartilage lesions although consistent regeneration of hyaline cartilage is rare. We have shown previously that autologous blood can be mixed with a polymer solution containing chitosan in a glycerol phosphate (GP) buffer (chitosan–GP), and that implantation of this polymer/blood composite onto marrow-stimulated chondral defects in rabbit and sheep leads to the synthesis of more chondral repair tissue with greater hyaline character compared to marrow-stimulation alone. In the current study, we examined the modulation of cell recruitment and repair tissue characteristics at early post-surgical time points (from day 1 to 56) in a rabbit model to elucidate potential mechanisms behind this improved repair outcome. DesignThirty-three skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits underwent bilateral arthrotomies, with each trochlea receiving a cartilage defect (3. 5 mm× 4. 5 mm) <b>bearing</b> four microdrill <b>holes</b> (0. 9 mm diameter, ∼ 4 mm deep) into the subchondral bone. One defect per rabbit was treated with a chitosan–GP/blood implant, while the other defect was left as a microdrilled control. Repair tissues were stained by histochemistry, for collagen types I, II, and X by immunohistochemistry and analyzed using quantitative stereological tools. ResultsHistological analyses demonstrated that control defects followed a typical healing sequence observed previously in marrow-stimulation animal models while chitosan–GP/blood implants led to three significant modifications in the healing sequence at early stages: (1) increased inflammatory and marrow-derived stromal cell recruitment to the microdrill holes, (2) increased vascularization of the provisional repair tissue in the microdrill holes, and (3) increased intramembranous bone formation and subchondral bone remodeling (BR). ConclusionsThese {{results suggest that the}} greater levels of provisional tissue vascularization and BR activity are main factors supporting improved cartilage repair when chitosan–GP/blood implants are applied to marrow-stimulated cartilage lesions...|$|R
40|$|Polyfluorenes are {{polymers}} with outstanding properties: They are semi-conducting, relatively rigid, quite stable chemically and thermally, easily substituted {{and therefore}} potentially soluble in numerous solvents and more importantly, they exhibit blue electro- and photoluminescence. For all these reasons, these polymers are {{the subjects of}} numerous academic and industrial researches. The first subject of this work deal with the design, the synthesis and the characterisation of polyfluorenes end-capped with perylene dicarboximide derivatives. These perylene moieties are able to interact by energy transfer under specific conditions of illumination, proximity and orientation. Their observation by single molecule spectroscopy permitted therefore to gain valuable information concerning the three-dimensional folding of single polyfluorene chains. To complete this study, the synthesis and characterisation of a perylene end-capped trimer of fluorene was performed. This structure being monodisperse, a finer analysis of the energy-transfer occurring between both perylene dyes could be accomplished, which confirmed the structural hypothesis made for the polymer. During these studies, {{it has been observed}} that, in addition to the energy transfer occurring between both perylene derivatives, another energy transfer occurs between the polyfluorene backbone and the perylene derivatives upon excitation of the first. This led to the idea of the synthesis of a polyfluorene bearing perylenes dicarboximide as side chains. This perylene-rich polyfluorene has been used to build a photovoltaic cell efficient in the wavelengths of both polyfluorene absorption and perylene carboximide absorption. Another subject of this work was the design, synthesis and characterisation of polyfluorenes bearing bulky phenoxy groups as side-chains. These polymers, due to their lower tendency toward aggregation, exhibited a better stability of their emission colour upon annealing. Similarly, a series of homo- and copolymers of fluorene <b>bearing</b> bulky and <b>hole</b> accepting triphenylamine substituants was synthesised and characterised. In addition to their improved colour stability in comparison with dialkylpolyfluorenes, the LEDs build with these materials exhibited a very low turn on voltage.
