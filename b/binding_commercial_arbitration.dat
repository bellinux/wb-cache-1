40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. <b>Commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> {{is growing}} in {{importance}} in the modern world. People often use arbitration to ensure adjudication by {{an expert in the}} field and although arbitration may not always be quicker, its importance continues to grow especially in international commercial disputes. 1 Effective arbitration procedures will have positive consequences for the economical and political relationships between countries. 2 The Arbitration Act 42 of 1965 might have sufficed in the past, but as international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> is ever increasing and changing, this act has become out–dated. It does not effectively facilitate international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The Act was primarily designed with domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> in mind and therefore it is of limited assistance in the international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> sphere. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 3 has developed the Model Law on International <b>Commercial</b> <b>Arbitration.</b> 4 This Model Law or variations thereof can be adopted by a country to regulate international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration.</b> 5 Many countries choose to adopt the Model Law. The reasons vary but some are that the country’s own arbitration laws were out–dated and needed replacement. The Model Law has proved to be effective and it has become a benchmark for good arbitration legislation. 6 Some countries have even adopted the Model Law for use in domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> disputes. The South African Law Commission 7 published a report in 1998 dealing with the possible application of the Model Law on international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> in South Africa. It drafted a Draft Bill on International Arbitration (not as of yet promulgated) based on the Model Law. 9 One of the points of discussion in the report of the Commission was whether the Model Law should also be made applicable to domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> in South Africa. The conclusion was that domestic and international arbitration should be dealt with separately and that the present Act regulating domestic arbitration should be amended but not replaced by the Model Law. This implies two arbitration regimes: the International Arbitration Act (dealing only with international commercial arbitration); and the Arbitration Act (dealing only with domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration)</b> After the Commission’s report had been studied and South Africa’s legal position had been compared with Australia’s legal position, it is conlcuded that Australia is a good example to follow in regard to arbitration practices. It is, however, important to keep South Africa’s own background in mind. A good point made by Australia, is the fact that international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> legislation and domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> legislation, should be kept separate. This will bring about effectiveness and clarity for the users of the said legislation. Furthermore, as end conclusion, the Commission’s view is not favoured in regard to the fact that South Africa’s domestic arbitration legislation should not be based on the UNCITRAL Model Law. It {{would be a good idea}} to follow suit with Australia and base both South Africa’s international and domestic <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> legislation on the UNCITRAL Model Law.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{increasingly}} argued that international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> is stripping off its intrinsic features {{of an alternative}} dispute resolution method and turning into a mechanism that is almost indistinguishable from litigation. The development describing the metamorphosis of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> into a method that is very similar in process and substance to national litigation {{is referred to as}} the judicialisation of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The focus of this research is the process of judicialisation. The thesis questions whether it exists at all and, if yes, to what extent it has permeated both international arbitration proceedings and arbitral decision-making. While attempting to answer those questions other salient considerations are raised, such as: • Which characteristics of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> are fundamental for this method of dispute resolution and should remain intact; • What are the driving forces of the process of judicialisation; • Is the judicialised approach entirely consistent with the benefits of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> and to what extent? The ultimate objective of this thesis is to answer the question whether the judicialisation of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> is a positive development and thus be encouraged. Where negative implications are recognised, an attempt is made to identify the causes of the judicialisation process and offer solutions, if attainable...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} {{contribute to the development of}} the comparative study of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> by focusing on the Middle Eastern experience in commercial dispute resolution. Theoretical and practical criticism is offered and suggestions for an improved regional legislative framework are made. With the ever-increasing importance of international trade to Middle Eastern countries, research upon the effective dispute resolution mechanisms of <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> has become imperative. The process of harmonisation of <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> has become the subject of wider international and regional research studies, and the aim of this work is {{to contribute to the}} field in the context of the Middle Eastern region. This thesis examines "regionalism" and the process of harmonisation in international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration.</b> Within the philosophical framework of international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration,</b> international contract principles and dispute resolution mechanisms, the objective is to analyse existing cultural deviations and boundaries, and ascertain how these have prevented effective law reform within the region itself, obstructing the harmonisation process. Despite regional variations, in practice the process, of harmonisation is essential if the Middle East is to benefit from and participate in the phenomenon of globalisation. Whilst regional culture has become increasingly significant, harmonisation of <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> has become more urgent. The thesis argues that harmonisation with the international <b>commercial</b> <b>arbitration</b> Model Law can be achieved when the concept of regionalism is taken into consideration. Different aspects manifested within regionalism regarded as legal cultural deviation can be accommodated, making for an efficient arbitration law reform in accordance with the international accepted substantive and procedural principles of the UNCITRAL Model Law.
