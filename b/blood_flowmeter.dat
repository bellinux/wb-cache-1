40|$|Wearable {{wireless}} physiological sensors {{are helpful}} for monitoring and maintaining human health. Blood flow contains abundant physiological information {{but it is}} hard to measure blood flow during exercise using conventional blood flowmeters because of their size, weight, and use of optic fibers. To resolve these disadvantages, we previously developed a micro integrated laser Doppler <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter</b> using microelectromechanical systems technology. This micro <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter</b> is wearable and capable of stable measurement signals even during movement. Therefore, we attempted to measure skin blood flow at the forehead, fingertip, and earlobe of seven young men while running as a pilot experiment to extend the utility of the micro <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> We measured blood flow in each subject at velocities of 6, 8, and 10 km/h. We succeeded in obtaining stable measurements of blood flow, with few motion artifacts, using the micro <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter,</b> and the pulse wave signal and motion artifacts were clearly separated by conducting frequency analysis. Furthermore, the results showed that the extent of the changes in blood flow depended on the intensity of exercise as well as previous work with an ergometer.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} is {{an early}} event and a critical step in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. Accurate and sensitive tests are needed to correctly assess the degree of microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Spectral analysis of skin blood flow contains a characteristic low frequency reported {{to be associated with}} endothelial function in healthy subjects. We hypothesized that the relative amplitude of the oscillation recorded for this low frequency spectrum (0. 008 to 0. 021 Hz) would be less pronounced in patients with systemic sclerosis than in healthy subjects and in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Twenty-one patients with systemic sclerosis, twenty patients with primary Raynaud phenomenon and eleven healthy subjects were enrolled. Skin perfusion was recorded at rest for 30 minutes using laser Doppler flowmetry on the pad of the left third left. Fourier transform spectral analysis was applied to obtain the mean amplitude of the cutaneous blood perfusion signal of the total spectrum from 0. 008 to 1. 6 Hz and the mean amplitude of each characteristic frequency in the laser Doppler <b>flowmeter</b> <b>blood</b> flow oscillations.

40|$|Inhibition of {{the release}} of renin by vagal afferents from the heart and lungs was studied in 14 dogs with their aortic nerves cut and their carotid sinuses vascularly isolated. The release of renin from one kidney was {{calculated}} from the venous-arterial difference in plasma renin activity (radioimmunoassay) and the renal <b>blood</b> flow (electromagnetic <b>flowmeter).</b> Renin release was determined before and during temporary interruption of afferent vagal nerve traffic (bilateral cooling of the cervical vagi). With carotid sinus pressure maintained at 40 mm Hg, vagal cooling increased mean aortic blood pressure (24 %), decreased renal blood flow (19 °?), and increased renin release (241 %). With sinus pressure maintained at the mean aortic blood pressure existing during the control period, vagal cooling caused a lesser increase in mean aortic blood pressure (12 %), little decrease in renal blood flow (7 %), and a marked increase in renin release (522 %). The changes in renal blood flow and renin release with vagal cooling were prevented by renal denervation.

40|$|Contrasting {{hypotheses}} of mammalian thermoregulation {{were tested}} in unanesthetized rabbits {{in relation to the}} role of the central nervous (CNS) monoamines 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and noradrenaline (NA) in regulating lung function and ear skin <b>blood</b> flow (Doppler <b>flowmeter).</b> Normal rabbits and rabbits with CNS depletion of 5 -HT and NA (caused by the neurotoxins 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine and 6 -hydroxydopamine) were studied in an airconditioned chamber at ambient temperatures of 12 °, 22 ° and 35 °C. The results suggest that CNS 5 -HT plays an excitatory role in the heat conservation mechanism of cold-induced ear skin vasoconstriction, and that this effect is inhibited by CNS NA to cause heat dissipation during heat stress. Both CNS 5 -HT and NA appear to exert a mild inhibitory restraint on ventilation even during heat stress. The data support the theory that CNS 5 -HT is concerned with heat conservation and CNS NA with heat loss mechanisms in the cutaneous circulation, and that both monoamines moderate heat loss through panting. CNS monoamine-dependent thermoregulation in the rabbit thus resembles the model postulated for the cat, dog and monkey rather than, as previously proposed, for the sheep and goat...|$|R

40|$|Phasic {{coronary}} and aortic {{blood flow}} and arterial pressure were measured as heart rates were increased by ventricular pacing from 120 to 270 beats/min in unanesthetized dogs {{before and after}} beta-receptor blockade with intravenous propranolol. Before beta-receptor blockade, coronary flow progressively increased and coronary vascular resistance decreased with increasing heart rates. Aortic blood flow and arterial pressure were not significantly altered at rates below 240 beats/min. After administration of propranolol, mean coronary blood flow was comparable to that before beta-receptor blockade at heart rates from 120 to 210 beats/min. However, aortic flow progressively decreased and peripheral resistance increased with increasing ventricular rates.

Methods: Anesthetized pigs were studied during fasting (n = 6), physiologic (n = 4), and supraphysiologic (n = 4) hyperinsulinemia. PET was performed with (CO) -O- 15 (blood pool) and [F- 18]FDG (glucose uptake). 6, 6 -Deuterated glucose ([H- 2]G) was coinjected with [F- 18]FDG and blood collected from the carotid artery and portal and hepatic veins to compute LC as ratio between tracers fractional extraction. HGU was estimated from PET images and ex vivo from high-performance liquid chromatography measurements of liver [F- 18]FDG versus [F- 18]FDG- 6 -phosphate and [F- 18]glycogen.

The sample comprised 20 non-diabetic controls (Group 1), 19 patients with no clinically visible DR (Group 2), 18 patients with mild-to-moderate non-proliferative DR (Group 3) and 18 patients with diabetic macular edema (Group 4). Retinal hemodynamic measurements using the Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter</b> (CLBF- 100) were acquired before and 1  h after drinking a standardized oral glucose load drink. The magnitude of the retinal vascular response, as well as max:min velocity ratio and wall shear rate (WSR), was calculated and compared across groups. A significant change in blood glucose level was observed for all groups (p < 0. 05). The change in blood glucose elevation was significantly less in Group 1 {{compared to the other}} groups. No significant change in arteriolar diameter, blood velocity, blood flow, max:min velocity ratio and WSR was found in patients with diabetes and in age-matched subjects without diabetes. The results {{of this study indicate that}} retinal arteriolar blood flow is unaffected by acute elevation of blood glucose using an oral glucose load drink in patients with diabetes and in age-matched controls. This lack of a blood flow response to acute hyperglycemia in patients with early sight-threatening DR may be explained by a loss of retinal vascular reactivity. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Introduction and Purpose: Vascular pathologies play an {{important}} role in the etiology and progression of number of ocular diseases. Many instruments are developed to monitor retinal hemodynamics, including the Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter</b> (CLBF), in an attempt to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease (Chapter 2). The purpose of this thesis is to determine the impact of light scatter on retinal arteriolar hemodynamic measurement assessed by the CLBF as intraocular light scatter is an inevitable consequence of ageing and particularly cataract. Methodology: Chapter 4 – Artificial light scatter model: One eye from each of 10 healthy young subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 (23. 6 ± 3. 4) was randomly selected. To simulate light scatter, cells comprising a plastic collar and two plano lenses were filled with solutions of differing concentrations of polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences Inc., USA). 0. 002 %, 0. 004 %, 0. 006 %, 0. 008 % were prepared, as well as distilled water only. After a preliminary screening to confirm subject eligibility, seven arteriolar hemodynamic measurements were taken by randomly placing the cells between the CLBF objective lens and the subjects’ cornea. Chapter 5 – Ten patients scheduled for extracapsular cataract extraction using phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation between the ages of 61 and 84 (mean age 73 years, SD ± 8) were prospectively recruited. Two visits were required to complete the study; One prior to the surgery and one at least six weeks after the surgery to allow for full post-operative recovery. The severity of cataract was documented using the Lens Opacity Classification System (LOCS, III) at the first visit. Each subject underwent visual function assessment at both visits using logMAR Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity charts and the Brightness Acuity Tester (BAT). Retinal arteriolar hemodynamics were measured at both visits using the high intensity setting of the Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter.</b> Results: Chapter 4 : Our light scatter model resulted in an artifactual increase of retinal arteriolar diameter (p< 0. 0001) and thereby increased retinal blood flow (p< 0. 0001). The 0. 006 % and 0. 008 % microsphere concentrations produced significantly higher diameter and flow values than baseline. Centerline blood velocity, however, was not affected by light scatter. Retinal arteriolar diameter values were significantly less with the high intensity laser than with the low intensity laser (p= 0. 0007). Chapter 5 : Group mean retinal arteriolar diameter and blood flow were reduced following extracapsular cataract extraction (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p= 0. 022 and p= 0. 028 respectively); however, centerline blood velocity was unchanged (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p= 0. 074). Conclusions: Using an artificial light scatter model (Chapter 3), we demonstrated that the densitometry assessment of vessel diameter is increasingly impacted as the magnitude of artificial light scatter increases; this effect can be partially negated by increasing laser intensity. We showed similar results in the presence of cataract (Chapter 4) by measuring the retinal arteriolar hemodynamics before and after removal of cataract. Care needs to be exercised in the interpretation of studies of retinal vessel diameter that use similar densitometry techniques as cataract is an inevitable consequence of aging...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is a {{major health}} problem especially when associated to concomitant diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Hyperglycemia with an overwhelming generation of oxygen radicals and formation of glycation end-products exacerbates oxidation-sensitive mechanisms activated by tissue ischemia. Administration of autologous bone marrow cells (BMC) is an increasing notable intervention to induce therapeutic angiogenesis, ameliorated by metabolic intervention (MT). Recently, hemangioblasts (HS) with functional properties were isolated. Methods: The effects of integrate regimen with intravenous BMC, HS, and MT (1. 0 % vitamin E, 0. 05 % vitamin C, and 6 % L-arginine) were examined in the ischemic hindlimb of ApoE(-/-) diabetic and nondiabetic. Blood flow ratio was monitored by use of a laser Doppler <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> Capillary density was determined in sections of the adductor and semimembranous muscles with antibody against CD 31. Results: BMC or HS alone, and BMC plus HS increased blood flow and capillary densities and decreased interstitial fibrosis. These effects were amplified by additional MT, at least in part, through the nitric oxide pathway, reduction of systemic oxidative stress and macrophage infiltration. Investigation of molecular mechanisms in bone marrow (BM) -derived progenitor cells from mice revealed that BMC therapy and, more consistently, in combination with MT ameliorated functional activity via decreased cellular senescence and increased telomerase and chemokine CXCR 4 activities. Telomerase activity was also increased by HS alone or HS + MT and, more consistently, by BMC + HS alone or in combination with MT.

Methods: Fifteen NV-AMD patients were prospectively recruited and grouped according to the dosage of ranibizumab previously received. Group 1 NV-AMD patients (n = 7) had previously received 1. 50 mg or less, and group 2 patients (n = 8) had received more than 1. 50 mg in the study eye. A group of 12 non-NV AMD patients were also recruited for control comparison. Vessel diameter, centreline blood velocity and blood flow were assessed with the Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter</b> immediately prior to an injection and at a mean follow-up of 37. 7 and 36. 7 days for group 1 and group 2 patients, respectively. Results: The NV-AMD patients as a whole and the group 1 cohort had a significantly greater arteriolar diameter at baseline than the non-NV AMD patients. There was a significant reduction in arteriolar diameter, velocity and blood flow in group 1 but not in group 2 NV-AMD patients at follow-up. There was only an insignificant decrease in measured parameters of the retinal venules. At follow-up, {{there was no difference in}} the diameter, velocity or flow between AMD patients.

In addition, we assessed whether these compounds are capable of affecting the gastric mucosal lesions induced by absolute ethanol applied intragastrically (i. g.). The following plant-originated flavonoid substances were considered; Solon (Sophoradin extract), Amaranth seed extract, grapefruit-seed extract (GSE) and capsaicin (extract of chilly pepper). The area of gastric mucosa lesions and gastric blood flow were measured in rats with ethanol-induced lesions without (control) and with one of the tested substances without and with capsaicin denervation of afferent nerves or administration of L-nitro-arginine (L-NNA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Male Wistar rats, weighing 180 - 220 g fasted for 24 h before the study where used 100 % ethanol was applied i. g. to induce gastric lesions, whose area was determined by planimetry. Gastric blood flow was assessed using electrolytic regional <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> All tested plant-originated substances afforded gastroprotection against ethanol-induced damage and this was accompanied by increase in gastric microcirculation, both changes being reversed by pretreatment with neurotoxic dose of capsaicin or by pretreatment with L-NNA.

40|$|PURPOSE: We seek to {{identify}} pathogenic mechanisms for diabetic retinopathy that can become therapeutic targets beyond hyperglycemia and hypertension. We investigated if a defective myogenic response of retinal arteries to increased perfusion pressure, which exposes capillaries to increased pressure and flow, {{is associated with}} the onset of clinical retinopathy. METHODS: We examined prospectively the incidence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetic individuals tested 4 years earlier for the retinal arterial myogenic response, and in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of defective myogenic response in type 1 patients who had diabetic retinopathy. Among these, we contrasted early-onset (after 15 ± 2 years of diabetes, E-DR; n = 5) to late-onset (after 26 ± 3 years of diabetes, L-DR; n = 7) retinopathy. We measured the myogenic response using a laser Doppler <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter</b> after a change in posture from sitting to reclining, which increases retinal perfusion pressure. RESULTS: Five of seven participants who 4 years prior had a defective myogenic response had now developed clinical retinopathy; as compared with only one of six participants who 4 years prior had a normal response (P = 0. 10). In the cross-sectional study, all participants had normal retinal hemodynamics at steady state. In response to the postural change, only the E-DR group showed defective myogenic response (P = 0. 005 versus controls, P = 0. 02 versus L-DR) and abnormally high retinal blood flow (P = 0. 016 versus controls). CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 diabetic patients, a defective myogenic response of retinal arteries to pressure is not required for the development of clinical retinopathy, but is prominently associated with an accelerated onset of retinopathy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Obstructive sleep apnoea is {{a common}} condition. Treatment with nasal {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (CPAP), while effective and safe, causes nasal congestion and stuffiness in some patients. The hypothesis that this study aimed to test was that nasal CPAP with a mouth leak and subsequent unidirectional airflow across the nasal mucosa causes an increase in nasal mucosal blood flux and a fall in both nasal volume and minimal cross sectional area. A secondary aim was to study if this could be prevented by humidifying the air inspired with nasal CPAP. METHODS [...] Nasal CPAP was applied to eight normal subjects who kept their mouths open until they had expired 500 litres. The effect of this on nasal mucosal blood flux and nasal geometry was studied with and without humidification using a laser Doppler <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter</b> and acoustic rhinometer. In addition, nasal mucosal blood flux was measured {{in four of the}} eight subjects before and after nasal CPAP with the mouth closed. RESULTS [...] Nasal CPAP using room air with the mouth closed did not result in any change in nasal mucosal blood flux; with a mouth leak nasal CPAP using room air was associated with a 65 % increase in nasal mucosal blood flux. There was no change in nasal geometry. Nasal CPAP using humidified air with a mouth leak did not cause any change in nasal mucosal blood flux or nasal geometry. CONCLUSION [...] Nasal CPAP used with an open mouth leads to an increase in nasal mucosal blood flux. This can be prevented by humidifying the air inspired with nasal CPAP...|$|E
40|$|The {{impairment}} of ocular haemodynamics {{has been reported}} in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients using various blood flow measurement techniques. Studies have shown hypotension may accelerate progression in POAG and a marked nocturnal blood pressure reduction (NBPR) was reported to further expedite the neuro-degenerative disease. It has been suggested that extreme NBPR may be a form of systemic vascular dysregulation that is manifested as an ocular dysregulation, but this hypothesis has never been tested. In addition, the relationship, if any, of retinal haemodyanamics to magnitude of the NBPR is also unknown. A prototype Doppler spectral domain optical coherence tomographer (SD-OCT) together with the more established bi-directional Laser Doppler velocimetry with simultaneous vessel densitometry (BLDV-SVD) methodology (Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter,</b> CLBF) were utilized to see if the NBPR is associated to impaired retinal haemodynamics in glaucoma patients. The specific aims of this thesis were: (1) To evaluate the association between retinal hemodynamics of healthy eyes with age, as derived by Doppler SD-OCT, (2) To evaluate retinal blood flow (RBF) in patients with early POAG and differing NBPR profiles, (3) To investigate the relationship between Doppler SD-OCT derived retinal haemodynamics and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with early POAG and healthy age-matched controls, (4) To evaluate the vascular reactivity in patients with early POAG with different NBPR profiles using a normoxic hypercapnia provocation stimulus. Perfusion to the retina was not altered with increasing age among healthy people in the range of 20 to 70 years. Patients with early POAG who exhibited an exaggerated nocturnal reduction in mean arterial pressure also demonstrated lower RBF values as shown by the measurement of Doppler SD-OCT. The change in retinal circulation in early POAG was related to reduced RNFL thickness and a larger venous area may be associated with thicker RNFL among controls. Patients with early POAG who exhibited an exaggerated NBPR also demonstrated disturbance of retinal vascular reactivity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} cigarrete smoking {{in a group of}} otherwise healthy young individuals on: 1) Retinal blood flow using Doppler based SD-OCT, 2) Retinal vascular reactivity using a gas sequencer to provoke hypercapnia via constant changes in PETCO 2 (end-tidal partial pressure of CO 2) and in PETO 2 (end-tidal partial pressure of O 2). Methods An automated gas flow controller was used to achieve normoxic hypercapnia in ten non-smokers (mean age 28. 9 yrs, SD 4. 58) and nine smokers (mean age 27. 55 yrs, SD 4. 77). Retinal blood flow measurements were obtained using Doppler OCT and cannon laser <b>blood</b> <b>flowmeter</b> (CLBF) during baseline, normoxic hypercapnia (15 % increase in PETCO 2 relative to homeostatic baseline) and post-hypercapnia in both the groups. Exhaled carbon monoxide level was measured in all subjects. Results In non-smokers, retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and flow increased by + 4. 1 % (SD 2. 8, p< 0. 0001), + 16. 7 % (SD 14. 6, p= 0. 0004) and + 29. 6 % (SD 12. 5, p< 0. 0001) respectively, during normoxic hypercapnia; Similarly, the venous area, venous velocity and total retinal blood flow increased by 7 % (SD 8. 6, p= 0. 0418), 18. 1 % (SD 20. 8, p= 0. 0068) and 26 % (SD 22. 9, p< 0. 0001) respectively. In smokers, normoxic hypercapnia resulted in a significant increase in velocity by 12. 0 % (SD 6. 2, p= 0. 0019) and flow by 14. 6 % (SD 9. 5, p= 0. 0029); though arteriolar diameter increased by 1. 7 % (SD 1. 7, p= 0. 2616), the result was not statistically significant. Total retinal blood flow increased significantly by 19. 3 % (SD 18. 4, p= 0. 002) in response to normoxic hypercapnia. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in venous area (p= 0. 3322) and venous velocity measurements (p= 0. 1185) during hypercapnia compared to baseline and recovery. Comparing smokers and non-smokers, only the percentage change in arteriolar diameter (p= 0. 0379) and flow (p= 0. 0101) was significantly different among the groups. Group mean PETCO 2 was increased by 15. 9 % in the non-smoking group and by 15. 7 % in the smoking group, with a concomitant increase in PETO 2 by approximately 1. 5 to 2 % in both groups. There was no significant difference in baseline PETCO 2 level between smokers and non-smokers. Conclusions Retinal vascular reactivity in response to normoxic hypercapnia is significantly reduced in young healthy individuals who smoke compared to non-smokers. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact reason behind the impaired retinal autoregulation to provocative stimuli in smokers...|$|E
40|$|Abnormal {{leukocyte}} adhesion (i. e. leukostasis) to retinal vascular endothelial cells {{occurs in}} early diabetes. The processes of leukostasis have been clearly {{demonstrated in the}} vascular endothelium of patients with diabetes. In non-proliferative DR, clinical outcomes are manifested by excessive permeability from inflammatory progression leading to inner blood retinal barrier disruption, endothelial cell damage and widespread capillary nonperfusion. Diabetes promotes vascular leakage in DR by upregulation of adhesion molecules. Moreover, many of the pathological changes in NPDR are related to abnormalities in retinal blood flow. Studies have shown that specific circulating markers of inflammatory activity and endothelial dysfunction are associated with clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy. However, few have found an association between circulating levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunctional markers and abnormal retinal hemodynamics in patients with non-proliferative DR. The specific aims of this thesis are as follows: (Chapter 3) To correlate baseline levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers and 1) baseline retinal arteriolar hemodynamics and 2) any disturbance in retinal hemodynamics over 6 -month time in terms of vessel diameter, blood velocity, maximum-to-minimum velocity ratio and volumetric flow. In Chapter 4 : To correlate circulating levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers and 1) baseline vascular reactivity and 2) any disturbance in vascular reactivity after 6 -month time in terms of vessel diameter, blood velocity, maximum-to-minimum velocity ratio and volumetric flow in patients with increasing non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) severity. Methods for Chapter 3 : Diabetes subjects were stratified into either mild-to-moderate (Group 2) or moderate-to-severe (Group 3) NPDR based on their retinopathy status. Age-matched non-diabetics were recruited as controls (Group 1). Forearm blood sample was collected to determine baseline levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunctional markers. At visit 1, baseline retinal hemodynamics was acquired using Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter.</b> Patients returned for a visit 2 (6 month follow-up visit) and retinal hemodynamics was reassessed. Baseline levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunctional markers compared between groups and correlated with both baseline and change in retinal hemodynamic parameters over 6 -month time. For Chapter 4 : Diabetes subjects were stratified into either mild-to-moderate NPDR or moderate-to-severe NPDR based on their retinopathy status. Age-matched non-diabetics were recruited as controls. At visit 1, forearm blood sample was collected to determine levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunctional markers and baseline vascular reactivity response was acquired. Retinal blood flow data was acquired while subjects breathed air. Retinal blood flow measurements were then acquired after exposure to isocapnic hyperoxic stimuli. At visit 2 (6 month follow-up), retinal vascular reactivity was reassessed. Baseline levels of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunctional markers compared between groups and correlated with both magnitude of baseline and change in vascular reactivity in terms of retinal hemodynamics. Results of Chapter 3 : Maximum-to-minimum velocity ratio (max: min) {{was found to be}} significantly elevated in the group 3 compared to group 1 at baseline (0. 72 vs. 0. 49, after Bonferroni correction P< 0. 01). Both sICAM- 1 and sE-selectin were significantly elevated as a function of group (ANOVA p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 04). A post hoc Bonferroni test showed that Group 3 had significantly higher in both sICAM- 1 and sE-selectin levels compared to Group 1 (234. 0 vs. 151. 5 ng/ml, P= 0. 02 and 53. 4 vs. 27. 6 ng/ml, P< 0. 01, respectively). Hemoglobin A 1 c was significantly elevated across the groups (ANOVA p< 0. 01). A post hoc Bonferroni test showed that Group 3 had significantly higher hemoglobin A 1 c level compared to Group 1 (7. 9 vs. 5. 6 %, P< 0. 01). There were no significant associations found between baseline markers of inflammation and baseline retinal hemodynamics across all groups. The Δ velocity was correlated with the baseline sICAM- 1 (r= 0. 42, p= 0. 02) and A 1 c levels (r= 0. 37, p= 0. 04) in patients with NPDR. After adjustment for all other variables (A 1 c, hsCRP and vWF), Δ velocity, sICAM- 1 and A 1 c were found not to be reliable predictors of baseline retinal hemodynamics. For Chapter 4 : There {{were no significant differences in}} magnitude of retinal vascular reactivity in hemodynamic parameters between groups at visit 1 or visit 2. Over 6 months time, compliance was found to be significantly reduced in patients of Group 3 compared to Group 2 (- 0. 4 vs. 0. 1, t-test p< 0. 01). Both sICAM- 1 and sE-selectin were significantly elevated as a function of group (ANOVA p= 0. 02 and p< 0. 01). A post hoc Bonferroni test showed that Group 3 had significantly higher in both sICAM- 1 and sE-selectin levels compared to Group 1 (243. 4 vs. 157. 3 ngml, P< 0. 01 and 57. 0 vs. 29. 3 ng/ml, P< 0. 01, respectively). Hemoglobin A 1 c was significantly elevated across the groups (ANOVA p< 0. 01). A post hoc Bonferroni test showed that Group 3 had significantly higher hemoglobin A 1 c level compared to Group 1 (8. 8 vs. 5. 6 %, P< 0. 01). Baseline VR in blood velocity weakly correlates with sE-selectin (r= 0. 31, p= 0. 04) across all groups while sVCAM- 1 was associated with VR in terms of blood flow (r=- 0. 62, p< 0. 01) in patients with mild-to-moderate NPDR. The ∆ blood flow after 6 months was found to be weakly associated with sE-selectin (r= 0. 46, p= 0. 03) across all groups. Finally, the ∆ blood velocity after 6 month time was found to be moderately correlated with baseline vWF Ag level (r=- 0. 78, p= 0. 02). Multiple regression analysis found that vascular inflammatory and endothelial function markers had weak predictive power for Δ hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions Chapter 3 : We found weak associations between circulating markers and baseline or the disturbance in retinal hemodynamics after 6 months time. Overall, we found both an increase in rigidity of the arteriolar circulation and elevated inflammatory adhesion markers (sICAM- 1 and sE-selectin) within the same population sample. Change in velocity over the follow-up period was correlated with sICAM- 1 and A 1 c levels in patients with NPDR but the level of association was such that neither sICAM- 1 nor A 1 c proved to reliably predict retinal hemodynamics. Finally, in Chapter 4 we demonstrated two important characteristics in early NPDR; 1) a disturbance in vascular reactivity in terms of compliance and 2) an increase in systemic markers of inflammation were found in patients with NPDR. Although systemic markers of vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are not predictive of hemodynamic parameters, our study found moderate associations between baseline and disturbances in VR after 6 months time. Therefore, there is evidence that inflammation and vascular function may be related with respect to their development in NPDR...|$|E
40|$|The global aim of {{this thesis}} was to assess retinal {{vascular}} reactivity in glaucoma patients using a standardised hypercapnic stimulus. There is a suggestion of disturbance in the regulation of retinal and optic nerve head (ONH) hemodynamics in patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), {{although much of the}} work to-date has either been equivocal or speculative. Previous studies have used non-standardised hypercapnic stimuli to assess vascular reactivity. To explain, hypercapnia induces hyperventilation which disturbs arterial oxygen concentration, an effect that varies between individuals resulting in the non-standardised provocation of vascular reactivity. Therefore, a normoxic hypercapnic provocation was developed to avoid additional and potentially uncontrolled vasoconstriction in what is thought to be a vasospastic disease. The development of a safe, sustained and stable normoxic hypercapnic stimulus was essential for the assessment of retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity so that repeated hemodynamic measurements could be obtained. Furthermore, most techniques used to measure vascular reactivity do not comprehensively assess retinal hemodynamics, in terms of the simultaneous measurement of vessel diameter and blood velocity in order to calculate flow. In this respect, this study utilized a technique that quantitatively assesses retinal blood flow and vascular reactivity of the major arterioles in close proximity to the ONH. The stimulus and vascular reactivity quantification technique was validated in healthy controls and then was clinically applied in patients with POAG. Newly diagnosed patients with untreated POAG (uPOAG) were recruited in order to avoid any confounding pharmacological effects and patients with progressive POAG (pPOAG) were also selected since they are thought to likely manifest vascular dysregulation. Finally, the results of the functional vascular reactivity assessment were compared to those of systemic biochemical markers of endothelial function in patients with untreated and progressive POAG and in healthy controls. Overall summary A safe, sustained, stable and repeatable normoxic hypercapnic stimulus was developed, evaluated and validated. In terms of the physiology of retinal vascular regulation, the percent magnitude of vascular reactivity of the arterioles and capillaries was found to be comparable in terms of flow. The new stimulus was successfully applied in POAG and in healthy controls to assess vascular reactivity and was also compared to plasma levels of ET- 1 and cGMP. In terms of the patho-physiology of POAG, the study revealed a clear impairment of vascular reactivity in the uPOAG and pPOAG groups. There were reduced levels of plasma ET- 1 in the uPOAG and ntPOAG groups. In addition, treatment with Dorzolamide improved vascular reactivity in the ntPOAG group {{in the absence of any}} change in the expression of plasma ET- 1 or cGMP. Future work will address this apparent contradiction between the outcome of the functional vascular reactivity assessment and the biochemical markers of endothelial function in newly diagnosed POAG patients treated with Dorzolamide. Aims of chapters 	Chapter 3 : To determine the effect of hypercapnia on retinal capillary blood flow in the macula and ONH using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) in young healthy subjects. 	Chapter 4 : To describe a new manual methodology that permits the comprehensive assessment of retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity in response to a sustained and stable hypercapnic stimulus. The secondary aim was to determine the magnitude of the vascular reactivity response of the retinal arterioles to hypercapnic provocation in young healthy subjects. 	Chapter 5 : To compare the magnitude of vascular reactivity of the retinal arterioles in terms of percentage change of flow to that of the retinal capillaries using a novel automated standardized methodology to provoke normoxic, or isoxic, hypercapnia. 	Chapter 6 : To determine the magnitude of retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity to normoxic hypercapnia in patients with untreated POAG (uPOAG), progressive POAG (pPOAG) and controls. The secondary aim was to determine retinal vascular reactivity in newly treated POAG (ntPOAG, i. e. after treatment with 2 % Dorzolamide, twice daily for 2 weeks). 	Chapter 7 : To compare plasma endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) between groups of patients with untreated primary open angle glaucoma (uPOAG), progressive POAG (pPOAG), newly treated POAG (ntPOAG) and controls. The effect of normoxic hypercapnia on plasma ET- 1 and cGMP was also assessed. The functional measures of retinal blood flow and vascular reactivity were correlated with systemic biochemical markers of endothelial function. Methods Chapters 3, 4 and 5 were conducted on young healthy control subjects, where as Chapters 6 and 7 were conducted on patients with glaucoma and healthy controls. 	Chapter 3 : Subjects breathed unrestricted air for 15 minutes (baseline) via a sequential gas delivery circuit and then the fractional (percent) end-tidal concentration of CO 2 (FETCO 2) was manually raised for 15 minutes by adding a low flow of CO 2 to the inspired air. For the last 15 minutes, FETCO 2 was returned to baseline values to establish a recovery period. Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (HRF) images centered on both the ONH and the macula were acquired during each phase. 	Chapter 4 : Subjects breathed air via a sequential gas delivery circuit for 15 minutes and the air flow was then manually decreased so that subjects inspired gases from the rebreathing reservoir until a stable 10 - 15 % increase in FETCO 2 concentration was achieved for 20 minutes. Air flow rate was then manually elevated so that subjects breathed primarily from the fresh gas reservoir to return FETCO 2 back to baseline for the last 15 minutes. Retinal arteriolar hemodynamics was assessed using the Canon Laser <b>Blood</b> <b>Flowmeter</b> (CLBF) during all three breathing phases. 	Chapter 5 : Normoxic, or isoxic, hypercapnia was induced using an automated gas flow controller (RespirActTM, Thornhill Research Inc. Toronto, Canada). Subjects breathed air with PETCO 2 normalized at 38 mmHg. An increase in PETCO 2 of 15 % above baseline, whilst maintaining normoxia, was then implemented for 20 minutes and then PETCO 2 was returned to baseline conditions for 10 minutes. Retinal and ONH hemodynamic measurements were performed using the CLBF and HRF in random order across sessions. 	Chapter 6 : Retinal arteriolar vascular reactivity was assessed in patients with uPOAG, pPOAG (defined by the occurrence of optic disc hemorrhage within the past 24 months) and controls during normoxic hypercapnia. Using the automated gas flow controller, patients breathed air for 10 mins and PETCO 2 was maintained at 38 mmHg. Following this normoxic hypercapnia (a 15 % increase in PETCO 2 while PETO 2 was maintained at resting levels) was induced for 15 mins and then for the last 10 mins PETCO 2 was returned to baseline (post-hypercapnia) to establish recovery blood flow values. Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and blood flow was assessed using the CLBF in both patient groups and controls. A similar paradigm was repeated in the newly treated POAG group (ntPOAG, i. e. after treatment with 2 % Dorzolamide, twice daily for 2 weeks). 	Chapter 7 : Blood samples were collected from the cubital vein of all participants (uPOAG, pPOAG, ntPOAG and controls) during baseline conditions (PETCO 2 = 38 mmHg) and then during normoxic hypercapnia (i. e. a 15 % increase in PETCO 2 relative to the baseline) using the paradigm described for Chapter 6. ET- 1 and cGMP was assessed using immunoassay. Results 	Chapter 3 : The group mean nasal macula capillary blood flow increased from 127. 17 a. u. (SD 32. 59) at baseline to 151. 22 a. u. (SD 36. 67) during hypercapnia (p= 0. 028), while foveal blood flow increased from 92. 71 a. u. (SD 28. 07) to 107. 39 a. u. (SD 34. 43) (p= 0. 042). There was a concomitant and uncontrolled + 13 % increase in the group mean PETO 2 during the hypercapnic provocation of + 14 % increase in PETCO 2. 	Chapter 4 : Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and blood flow increased by 3. 2 % (p= 0. 0045), 26. 4 % (p< 0. 0001) and 34. 9 % (p< 0. 0001), respectively during hypercapnia. There was a stable ¬+ 12 % increase in PETCO 2 during hypercapnia and a concomitant - 6 % decrease in PETO 2. 	Chapter 5 : Using an automated gas flow controller the co-efficient of repeatability (COR) was 5 % of the average PETCO 2 at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia. The COR for PETO 2 was 10 % and 7 % of the average PETO 2 at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia, respectively. Group mean PETCO 2 increased by approximately + 14. 4 % and there was only a + 4. 3 % increase in PETO 2 during hypercapnia across both study sessions. Retinal arteriolar hemodynamics increased during hypercapnia (p< 0. 001). Similarly, there was an increase in the capillary blood flow of the temporal rim of the ONH (p< 0. 001), nasal macula (p< 0. 001) and foveal areas (p< 0. 006) during hypercapnia. A non-significant trend for capillary blood flow to increase in the macula temporal area (+ 8. 2 %) was noted. In terms of percentage change of blood flow, retinal capillary vascular reactivity (i. e. all 4 analyzed areas = 22. 4 %) was similar to the magnitude of arteriolar (= 24. 9 %) vascular reactivity. 	Chapter 6 : Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and flow did not increase during normoxic hypercapnia in uPOAG compared to controls. Diameter and blood velocity did not change in pPOAG during normoxic hypercapnia but there was a significant increase in blood flow (+ 9. 1 %, p= 0. 030). After treatment with 2 % Dorzolamide for 2 weeks there was a 3 % (p= 0. 040), 19 % (p< 0. 001) and 26 % (p< 0. 001) increase in diameter, velocity and flow, respectively, in the ntPOAG group. Group mean PETCO 2 increased by approximately + 15 % in all the groups and there was only a + 3 % increase in PETO 2 during hypercapnia. 	Chapter 7 : Plasma ET- 1 levels were significantly different across groups at baseline (one way ANOVA; p= 0. 0012) and this was repeated during normoxic hypercapnia (one way ANOVA; p= 0. 0014). ET- 1 levels were lower in uPOAG compared to pPOAG and controls at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia (Tukey’s honestly significant difference test). Similarly, ntPOAG group also showed lower ET- 1 levels compared to the pPOAG and controls at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia (Tukey’s honestly significant difference test). The cGMP at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia across all groups was not different. In the control group, the change in ET- 1 during normoxic hypercapnia was negatively correlated with change in retinal arteriolar blood flow (r = - 0. 52, p= 0. 04), that is, as the change in ET- 1 reduced, the change in blood flow increased. A weak correlation was noted between change in cGMP during normoxic hypercapnia and the change in arteriolar blood flow (r = + 0. 45, p= 0. 08). Conclusions 	Chapter 3 : Hypercapnia resulted in a quantifiable capillary vascular reactivity response in 2 of the 3 assessed retinal locations (i. e., nasal macula and fovea). There was no vascular reactivity response of the ONH. It is critical to minimise the concomitant change in PETO 2 during hypercapnia in order to obtain robust vascular reactivity responses. 	Chapter 4 : A technique to comprehensively assess vascular reactivity during stable and sustained hypercapnia was described. Retinal arteriolar diameter, blood velocity and blood flow increased in response to hypercapnia. The vascular reactivity results of this study served as a reference for future studies using the hypercapnic provocation and CLBF. Also, the concomitant change in PETO 2 using the partial rebreathing technique was reduced compared to the manual addition of CO 2 technique described in Chapter 3 but was still greater than optimal. 	Chapter 5 : A new automated gas flow controller was used to induce standardised normoxic, or isoxic, hypercapnia. The magnitude of vascular reactivity in both retinal arterioles and capillaries in response to the new hypercapnic stimulus was robust compared to the previous stimuli. There was a clear ONH vascular reactivity response in this study, unlike the result attained in Chapter 3. Although theoretically it is predictable that the percent magnitude of vascular reactivity of the arterioles and capillaries should be similar, this is the first study to show that they are indeed comparable. The magnitude of hypercapnia was repeatable and the concomitant change in PETO 2 was minimal and physiologically insignificant. 	Chapter 6 : The normal response of the retinal arterioles and capillaries to normoxic hypercapnia is impaired in both uPOAG and pPOAG compared to controls. Short term treatment with 2 % topical Dorzolamide for two weeks improved retinal vascular reactivity in ntPOAG. However, it is still unclear whether this improvement is a direct effect of Dorzolamide or as a secondary effect of the decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP). 	Chapter 7 : We found a reduction in the plasma ET- 1 at baseline and during normoxic hypercapnia in the uPOAG and in the ntPOAG groups. This is the first study to show a lower plasma ET- 1 level in uPOAG. The fact that this finding was repeated after 2 weeks treatment with Dorzolamide in the ntPOAG group further validates these results. It also suggests that Dorzolamide treatment does not impact ET- 1 and cGMP measures, although it clearly results in an improvement of vascular reactivity. Correlation results suggest that as the change in ET- 1 reduced during normoxic hypercapnia, the change in blood flow increased in the controls...|$|E
