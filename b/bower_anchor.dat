5|$|Searches were resumed for {{the lost}} Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful. They were finally {{recovered}} in 1969 by a research team from the American Academy of Natural Sciences, using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate the cannons, a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned <b>bower</b> <b>anchor.</b> Conservation work on the cannons was undertaken by the Australian National Maritime Museum, after which two of the cannons were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney's Darling Harbour, and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the National Museum of Australia in Canberra (with a replica remaining at the museum). A third cannon and the <b>bower</b> <b>anchor</b> were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown, with the remaining three at the National Maritime Museum in London, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.|$|E

25|$|Dover was at Madras Roads on 1 May 1811 {{undergoing}} a refit when a major gale struck. She was at anchor, with topmasts struck and foreyard lowered. Tucker had gone ashore {{and so she}} was {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Charles Jeffries. Although Jeffries dropped a second anchor and later a <b>bower</b> <b>anchor</b> after her anchor cable parted, a sudden squall drove her into the northeast corner of Fort Saint George during the night of 2 May. Despite attempts to save her, the storm battered her against the fort's walls until she foundered. Two men drowned.|$|E
50|$|In 1913 the two <b>bower</b> <b>anchors,</b> carried at the ship's bow, each {{weighing}} 3900 kg {{were recovered}} {{and put on}} display in Amsterdam. Consideration was given by Lloyd's to setting the anchors up as a monument behind the Royal Exchange {{in place of a}} statue to Sir Robert Peel, but this was not carried out and only the wooden stocks, marked Lutine were forwarded to Lloyd's.|$|R
50|$|She was {{destroyed}} at a deep water anchorage outside Balaklava by a hurricane-force storm which tore {{her from her}} anchorage and dashed her onto rocks: she broke up completely within ten minutes and only six of her 150 crew were saved. Correspondent William Howard Russell considered her officers to have been negligent in losing her <b>bower</b> <b>anchors.</b> Commander Bayntoun, her commanding officer, perished in the wreck.|$|R
50|$|Two 150 {{kilowatt}} General Electric turbo-generator sets provided {{lighting and}} power for auxiliary machinery {{with a half}} kilowatt Holtzer-Cabot Electric Company generator providing power for wireless communication with an emergency lighting generator set driven by a gasoline engine on the upper deck. Capstans and winches were all electric including the windlass for the two <b>bower</b> <b>anchors</b> of 5,110 lb each. Steering gear, not electric, was steam driven as were various engineering pumps; main boiler feed pump, auxiliary feed, circulating and air pumps. Two eight ton refrigeration plants were installed forward.|$|R
25|$|In March 1801, Arab, {{in company}} with the 18-gun British {{privateer}} Experiment, caught and challenged two Danish vessels, the brig , {{under the command of}} Captain Carl Wilhelm Jessen, and the schooner Den Aarvaagne. Arab approached the two Danish vessels and, according to Danish accounts, without warning, fired several broadsides at Lougen before the Danish ship was able to return fire. Lougen, which had escaped serious damage, began to return fire steadily. Experiment initially attempted to capture Aarvaagne, but Aarvaagne obeyed orders {{to stay out of the}} fight and instead escaped south to Christiansted on St Croix with its intelligence on British actions. Experiment then joined Arab in the attack on Lougen, with the two British ships sandwiching the Danish ship. During the engagement, which lasted for over an hour, one of Lougens shots struck the Arabs cathead and loosed the <b>bower</b> <b>anchor.</b> (Perkin's reported that it was the first shot from Lougen that loosed the <b>bower</b> <b>anchor.)</b> Arabs crew was unable to cut the anchor free, leaving Arab unable to manoeuvre effectively. This allowed Jessen to steer a course that brought him under the protection of the shore batteries and then into St Thomas. Captain Jessen of the Lougen was awarded a presentation sword made of gold, a medal and 400 rixdollars (the equivalent of a whole year's salary for a Captain in the Danish Navy) by the Danish government for his actions.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 1811 Amethyst was {{anchored}} in Plymouth Sound, intending to sail {{the next day}} join the fleet off Brest with provisions, including live bullocks. To facilitate her departure Walton decided to use only her <b>bower</b> <b>anchor.</b> A heavy storm caught her and blew her on shore near Cony Cliff Rocks, Mount Batten, before her crew could lower a second anchor. Lines were passed to the shore that enabled most of the crew to reach safety, though eight men did die. Most of the ship's stores were salvaged {{over the next few}} days. Still, the ship was too badly damaged to salvage and by 10 March wave action had broken up the hull.|$|E
2500|$|In 1804 Tartar {{was on the}} Jamaica Station under Captain Keith Maxwell, who had {{received}} promotion to post-captain on 1 May. Around this time Tartar grounded in Murray's Roads, Bermuda.

Capt. William L. Hudson, the commandant of the yard, ordered Beaumont to proceed in Aroostook to the vicinity where the disabled ship of the line had last been seen and, upon finding Vermont, to stand by her until other aid arrived.|$|R
50|$|Ankers Bower (also Anker's Bower, Ankers' <b>Bower,</b> Ankersbower, or <b>Anchor's</b> <b>Bower)</b> is a townland and hill in St. Mary's {{civil parish}} in the barony of Brawny, County Westmeath, Ireland. It is partly within the former urban {{district}} of Athlone. The name may derive from John Ankers, who was vicar of St. Mary's in 1608.|$|R
5000|$|Vessels {{may carry}} {{a number of}} anchors: <b>bower</b> <b>anchors</b> (formerly known as sheet anchors) are the main anchors used by a vessel and {{normally}} carried at {{the bow of the}} vessel. A kedge anchor is a light anchor used for warping an anchor, also known as kedging, or more commonly on yachts for mooring quickly or in benign conditions. A stream anchor, which is usually heavier than a kedge anchor, can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted, such as rivers and channels. [...] A Killick anchor is a small, possibly improvised, anchor.|$|R
2500|$|At eleven in {{the evening}} St Alban's Head was sighted about [...] to the leeward. [...] The crew took all the sails in and {{released}} the small <b>bower</b> <b>anchor.</b> [...] After an hour the ship began to drive towards the shore. [...] They released a sheet anchor, which held for two hours, when the ship again began to drive towards shore. The captain and the chief officer agreed among themselves that the ship was lost, and decided the officers should be asked to reserve the longboat for the ladies and themselves if possible.|$|E

However, he ordered them that if it should blow hard they should carry out the small <b>bower</b> <b>anchor,</b> and so to moor the ship by two anchors, and then giving what other orders he thought to be needful, he went ashore, as above.|$|E
500|$|When, by Cook's reckoning, about [...] of {{equipment}} {{had been thrown}} overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} pull the ship free. In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large <b>bower</b> <b>anchors,</b> and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off. The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.|$|R
5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two <b>bower</b> <b>anchors,</b> which were {{threatening}} to capsize the ship, were hauled in. During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too far away in the prevailing weather conditions to be accessible, so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that gathered around the ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration of rum to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|R

60|$|The huge loom of the Frenchman {{was seen}} {{bursting}} through the smoke. Thick clusters of boarders hung upon her sides and shrouds. A final broad-side leapt from her ports, and the main-mast of the Leda, snapping short {{off a few}} feet above the deck, spun {{into the air and}} crashed down upon the port guns, killing ten men and putting the whole battery out of action. An instant later the two ships scraped together, and the starboard <b>bower</b> <b>anchor</b> of the Gloire caught the mizzen-chains of the Leda upon the port side. With a yell the black swarm of boarders steadied themselves for a spring.|$|E
60|$|About twelve noon, {{however, the}} vessel's motion was {{observed}} to be considerably less, and the sailors were enabled to walk upon deck {{with some degree}} of freedom. But, to the astonishment of every one, it was soon discovered that the floating light was adrift! The windlass was instantly manned, and the men soon gave out that there was no strain upon the cable. The mizzen sail, which was bent for the occasional purpose of making the vessel ride more easily to the tide, was immediately set, and the other sails were also hoisted in a short time, when, in no small consternation, we bore away about one mile to the south-westward of the former station, and there let go the best <b>bower</b> <b>anchor</b> and cable in twenty fathoms water, to ride until the swell of the sea should fall, when it might be practicable to grapple for the moorings, and find a better anchorage for the ship.|$|E

500|$|Stenhouse first {{attempted}} to anchor the ship {{on the north}} side of Glacier Tongue itself. Disaster was only narrowly avoided when a change in the wind direction threatened to imprison Aurora between the Tongue and the advancing pack ice. With other options considered and rejected, Stenhouse finally decided to anchor at Cape Evans, site of Captain Scott's 1911 Terra Nova headquarters, some six nautical miles (11km) north of Glacier Tongue. On 14 March, after numerous failed attempts, Stenhouse manoeuvred Aurora into position, stern-first towards the shore at Cape Evans, where two large anchors had been sunk and cemented into the ground. Cables and hawsers, together with a heavy chain, attached these to the ship's stern. Two <b>bower</b> <b>anchors</b> were also dropped.

50|$|The ship's stockless <b>bower</b> <b>anchors</b> weighed 10 tons, {{attached}} to 125 ton, 330 fathom chains all manufactured by N. Hingley & Sons Ltd. The steam capstans {{to raise them}} were constructed by Napier Brothers Ltd, of Glasgow. The turbines were 25 ft long with 12 ft diameter rotors, the large diameter necessary because of the relatively low speeds at which they operated. The rotors were constructed on site, while the casings and shafting was constructed in John Brown's Atlas works in Sheffield. The machinery to drive the 56 ton rudder was constructed by Brown Brothers of Edinburgh. A main steering engine drove the rudder through worm gear and clutch operating on a toothed quadrant rack, with a reserve engine operating separately on the rack via a chain drive for emergency use. The 17 ft three bladed propellers were fitted and then cased in wood to protect them during the launch.|$|R

60|$|The {{next summer}} I saw a sloop from Chatham {{dragging}} for anchors and chains just oft' this shore. She had her boats {{out at the}} work while she shuffled about on various tacks, and, when anything was found, drew up to hoist it on board. It is a singular employment, at which men are regularly hired and paid for their industry, to hunt to-day in pleasant weather for anchors which have been lost,--the sunken faith and hope of mariners, to which they trusted in vain; now, perchance, it is the rusty one of some old pirate's ship or Norman fisherman, whose cable parted here two hundred years ago; and now the best <b>bower</b> <b>anchor</b> of a Canton or a California ship, which has gone about her business. If the roadsteads of the spiritual ocean could be thus dragged, what rusty flukes of hope deceived and parted chain-cables of faith might again be windlassed aboard! enough to sink the finder's craft, or stock new navies {{to the end of}} time. The bottom of the sea is strewn with anchors, some deeper and some shallower, and alternately covered and uncovered by the sand, perchance with a small length of iron cable still attached,--to which where is the other end? So many unconcluded tales to be continued another time. So, if we had diving-bells adapted to the spiritual deeps, we should see anchors with their cables attached, as thick as eels in vinegar, all wriggling vainly toward their holding-ground. But that is not treasure for us which another man has lost; rather it is for us to seek what no other man has found or can find,--not be Chatham men, dragging for anchors.|$|E

50|$|The {{expedition}} resumed {{and arrived}} at Middle Island on 4 January 1973. After a week of rough weather, the search commenced on 11 January using a manta board constructed from driftwood and other materials. The best <b>bower</b> <b>anchor</b> was discovered by Peter Koch in 15m deep water on 14 January. After reviewing his desktop research, Seton re-organised the search and found the stream anchor about 9 metres away from the best <b>bower</b> <b>anchor,</b> several hours later. The news of the discovery was announced on 15 January.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, as {{recommended}} in the Expedition's report, {{the opportunity to}} conserve one of the <b>bower</b> <b>anchors</b> was realised when grant funding became available. The SUHR collaborated with the SA Government and the Kangaroo Island Scuba Club {{to carry out the}} recovery. Assistance to the project was also provided by another 23 government agencies, private organisations and individuals. On 31 March 1980, an anchor shank was recovered from the wreck site followed by its stock on 1 April. Both parts were temporarily stored in the waters of West Bay for eventual collection and transfer by the fishing vessel, Lady Buick, to Kingscote respectively during April and May 1980. The shank and the stock were then respectively conveyed to Port Adelaide on MV Troubridge and on HMAS Banks. Conservation was carried out by Amdel in Adelaide. The conserved anchor was returned to Kangaroo Island where it was placed on display at the Flinders Chase Homestead in the Flinders Chase National Park, following a formal ceremony on 26 March 1982 attended by David Wotton, the SA Minister of Environment and Planning.|$|R
60|$|The intense {{darkness}} of the night added to the horrors of that awful moment. Nevertheless, the effect was to arouse all that there was of manliness and seamanship in Captain Crutchely, who from that instant appeared to be himself again. His orders were issued coolly, clearly and promptly, and they were obeyed as experienced mariners will work at an instant like that. The sails were all clewed up, and the heaviest of them were furled. Hillson was ordered to clear away an anchor, while Mark was attending to the canvas. In the mean time, the captain watched {{the movements of the}} ship. He had dropped a lead alongside, and by that he ascertained that they were still beating ahead. The thumps were not very hard, and the white water was soon left astern, none having washed on deck. All this was so much proof that the place on which they had struck must have had nearly water enough to float the vessel, a fact that the lead itself corroborated. Fifteen feet aft was all the Rancocus wanted, in her actual trim, and the lead showed a good three fathoms, at times. It was when the ship settled in the troughs of the sea that she felt the bottom. Satisfied that his vessel was likely to beat over the present difficulty, Captain Crutchely now gave all his attention to getting her anchored as near the reef and to leeward of it, as possible. The instant she went clear, a result he now expected every moment, he was determined to drop one of his <b>bower</b> <b>anchors,</b> and wait for daylight, before he took any further steps to extricate himself from the danger by which he was surrounded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] Cyril said, {{opening the}} ledger again, [...] "in the first place, I {{would point out}} that in all the heavy articles, such as could not {{conveniently}} be carried away, the tally of the stock-takers corresponds closely with the figures in this book. In best <b>bower</b> <b>anchors</b> the figures are absolutely the same and, as you have seen, in heavy cables they closely correspond. In the large ship's compasses, the ship's boilers, and ship's galleys, the numbers tally exactly. So it is with all the heavy articles; the main blocks are correct, and all other heavy gear. This shows that John Wilkes's book is carefully kept, {{and it would be}} strange indeed if heavy goods had all been properly entered, and light ones omitted; but yet when we turn to small articles, we find that there is a great discrepancy between the figures. Here is the account, for instance, of the half-inch rope. According to my ledger, there should be eighteen hundred fathoms in stock, whereas the stock-takers found but three hundred and eighty. In two-inch rope there is a deficiency of two hundred and thirty fathoms, in one-inch rope of six hundred and twenty. These sizes, as you know, are always in requisition, and a thief would find ready purchasers for a coil of any of them. But, as might be expected, it is in copper that the deficiency is most serious. Of fourteen-inch bolts, eighty-two are short, of twelve-inch bolts a hundred and thirty, of eight-inch three hundred and nine; and so on throughout almost all the copper stores. According to your expenditure and receipt-book, Captain Dave, you have made, in the last fifteen months, twelve hundred and thirty pounds; but according to this book your stock is less in value, by two thousand and thirty-four pounds, than it should have been. You are, therefore, a poorer man than you were {{at the beginning of this}} fifteen months' trading, by eight hundred and four pounds." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{remainder}} of the time I spent in making feverish preparations for arriving and seeing my dear comrades. I remembered {{that they were not}} in the habit of rising before six, and as it was now only three, I hoped to arrive before they were awake. Moreover, I set about making ready to let go the anchor, resolving in my own mind that as I knew the depth of water in the passage of the reef and within the lagoon, I would run the schooner in and bring up opposite the <b>bower.</b> Fortunately the <b>anchor</b> was hanging at the cat-head, otherwise I should never have been able to use it. Now I had only to cut the tackling, and it would drop of its own weight. After searching among the flags, I found the terrible black one, which I ran up to the peak. While I was doing this a thought struck me. I went to the powder-magazine, brought up a blank cartridge, and loaded the big brass gun, which, it will be remembered, was unhoused when we set sail; and as I had no means of housing it, there it had stood, bristling alike at fair weather and foul all the voyage. I took care to grease its mouth well, and before leaving the fore part of the ship, thrust the poker into the fire.|$|R
