5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with <b>beta</b> <b>blockers,</b> lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many of these drugs have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and <b>beta</b> <b>blockers.</b> Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy {{may induce}} {{depressive}} symptoms, although current evidence is conflicting. We examined {{the association between}} <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy and depressive symptoms in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients {{and the extent to}} which there is a dose–response relationship between <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> dose and depressive symptoms. Methods Patients treated with PCI (N = 685) completed the depression scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 1 and 12 months post PCI. Information about type and dose of <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use was extracted from medical records. Results Of all patients, 68 % (466 / 685) were on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy at baseline. In adjusted analysis, <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use at 1 month post PCI (OR: 0. 82; 95 % CI: 0. 53 – 1. 26) was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms. At 12 months post PCI, there was a significant relationship between <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use and depressive symptoms (OR: 0. 51; 95 % CI: 0. 31 – 0. 84), with <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy associated with a 49 % risk reduction in depressive symptoms. There was a dose–response relationship between <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> dose and depressive symptoms 12 months post PCI, with the risk reduction in depressive symptoms in relation to a low dose being 36 % (OR: 0. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 37 – 1. 10) and 58 % (OR: 0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 24 – 0. 76) in relation to a high dose. Conclusions Patients treated with <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy were less likely to experience depressive symptoms 12 months post PCI, with there being a dose–response relationship with a higher dose providing a more pronounced protective effect.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy in the {{settings}} {{of heart failure}} and coronary artery disease have been well described, although little data exist in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The current study will attempt to evaluate the efficacy of <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy in this setting. Pooled data from five randomized, controlled trials of abciximab during coronary intervention were {{used to analyze the}} clinical efficacy of <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy. The pooled analysis evaluated the end points of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and the combined endpoint of death and myocardial infarction in 2, 894 patients. At 30 days, death occurred in 12 of 1, 939 (0. 6 %) patients receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy and in 19 of 955 (2. 0 %) patients not receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy, (P < 0. 001). At 6 months, death occurred in 33 of 1, 939 (1. 7 %) patients receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy and 35 of 955 (3. 7 %) not receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy, (P < 0. 001). After creating a propensity model and adjusting for variables predictive of mortality in the multivariable analysis, <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy continued to be associated with a significant reduction in mortality. The findings were similar to those shown for the effects of <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy in separate subgroups of patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. This analysis demonstrates a lower short-term mortality in patients receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention for unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction.

5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), <b>beta</b> <b>blockers,</b> ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{effect of}} preinjury beta {{blockade}} on heart rate during initial trauma resuscitation is unclear. We hypothesized that preinjury beta blockade {{does not affect}} the heart rate response to initial trauma resuscitation. MethodsA case-control study of patients admitted to a level I trauma center was conducted. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, medications, injury information, and hemodynamic profiles. Logistic regression identified correlations between preinjury beta blockade and hemodynamics during initial trauma resuscitation and in-hospital mortality. ResultsThere were 76 deaths (cases) and 304 survivors (controls). Mean pre-resuscitation heart rate was 83 in patients on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> and 89 in patients not on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> (p =  0. 007). Mean post-resuscitation heart rate was 80 in patients on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> and 85 in patients not on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> (p =  0. 02). Tachycardia was present in 14. 3 % with preinjury <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> and 29. 7 % without (p =  0. 009). Bradycardia was present in 7. 1 % with preinjury <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> and 2. 3 % without (p =  0. 035). Of all patients who presented with an abnormal heart rate, 46 % of patients on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> attained a normal heart rate after resuscitation vs. 53 % of patients not on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> (p = not significant). ConclusionPreinjury beta blockade is associated with a slower presenting heart rate, more bradycardia, less tachycardia, but no difference in mortality or ability to achieve a normal heart rate with resuscitation...|$|R

5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as <b>beta</b> <b>blockers.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (<b>beta</b> <b>blockers),</b> or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{penetration}} across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> such as propranolol and metoprolol {{are more likely than}} other less lipophilic <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia and vivid dreams, and nightmares. Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced and increased awakening.|$|E

25|$|Unlike <b>beta</b> <b>{{blockers}},</b> {{calcium channel}} blockers do not decrease the responsiveness {{of the heart}} to input from the sympathetic nervous system.
