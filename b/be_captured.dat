5|$|On 11 July, the Indian troops {{commenced}} their attack. These strikes {{continued for}} another four days. But reports regarding the situation {{suggested that the}} Pakistanis were still in command of a strategically important position and the Indian commanders decided that these had to <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> before the advance could continue. Apart from this position, another position was also to <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> by the Indians. The task of capturing these two positions {{was assigned to the}} 6th Rajputana Rifles. Two companies were assigned to the operation, with the battalion's 'C' Company securing the second position after the first was captured by 'D' Company.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1643, most of the {{south-west}} {{was under}} Royalist control; only Plymouth, Poole and Lyme Regis held out against them. The Parliamentarians controlled the navy, and Lyme Regis was strategically important, due to its location between Bristol and the English Channel. In early 1644, Charles I ordered Lyme Regis to <b>be</b> <b>captured,</b> and sent a large force {{under the command of}} his nephew, Prince Maurice.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> (see below).|$|E
5|$|For their part, the 1st Airborne Division was {{to conduct}} three brigade-size {{airborne}} operations; the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was to <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> by 1st Airlanding Brigade (Operation Ladbroke), {{the port of}} Augusta was to be seized by 2nd Parachute Brigade (Operation Glutton), and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken by 1st Parachute Brigade (Operation Fustian).|$|E
5|$|In 1919 the German {{physicist}} Albert Betz {{showed that}} for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to <b>be</b> <b>captured.</b> This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.|$|E
50|$|If {{more than}} one piece <b>is</b> <b>captured</b> in a turn, the player whose pieces <b>were</b> <b>captured</b> must move them one turn at a time. If one of the pieces <b>captured</b> <b>was</b> the queen, it must be moved first. If {{more than one}} guard <b>was</b> <b>captured,</b> they can <b>be</b> moved in any order.|$|R

5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for the wording of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which cast doubt on Garner's claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{large quantities of}} hydrogen and helium on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when gas could still <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Rookwood, Tresham and Digby {{coincided with a}} series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out. Fawkes would light the fuse, and escape by boat across the Thames. An uprising would start in the Midlands, during which Princess Elizabeth was to <b>be</b> <b>captured.</b> Fawkes would escape to the continent and explain to the Catholic powers what had happened in England.|$|E
5|$|During the World War II German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, all six ships <b>were</b> <b>captured</b> in port by the Italians. Kobac <b>was</b> <b>captured</b> on 10 April at Šibenik, {{and the remainder}} <b>were</b> <b>captured</b> on 17 April: Sokol <b>was</b> <b>captured</b> at Split, and the rest at the Bay of Kotor.

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E
5|$|After {{success with}} {{shooting}} down alien scout ships and securing the crash sites from surviving alien crews, {{as well as}} interdicting alien attempts to abduct human civilians for unknown purposes, XCOM manages to also obtain the corpses of various different alien troops. Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and/or cybernetically altered, which seems to indicate they are merely foot-soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live alien <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> for interrogation. This also involves developing a specialized weapon capable of capturing a live alien, and constructing a facility in XCOM's subterranean base capable of safely holding a live alien prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot <b>be</b> <b>captured),</b> the player may use a Poké Ball on the wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep,) of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
30|$|E′(s) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} {{fraction}} of interlinks between groups that get exposed when s number of supernodes <b>are</b> <b>captured</b> by the adversary.

Their orders are to cut out Snow's heart {{and bring it to}} the Queen. Charming attacks the henchmen with his sword, killing two. One henchman gets away with Snow, and Charming quickly dispatches him with an arrow. Now that he has saved Snow, she decides to trust him, and agrees to lead him to the place where she sold the items.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} {{in the history of}} the Isles, the realm endured periods of {{fragmentation}} between rival factions. Whether the references to Lǫgmaðr in the north are evidence of a similarly partitioned kingdom is unknown. The Norwegian subjugation of the Isles, and subsequent capture of Lǫgmaðr, are recounted by several sources. For instance, Orkneyinga saga states as much; whilst Morkinskinna further specifies that Lǫgmaðr fled southwards and out to sea, as Magnús' fleet advanced, only to <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> and kept in the Norwegian king's company for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, they are given access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle a Robot Master. When a Robot Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can be used against other Robot Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the Robot Master using his primary weapon, the Robot Master will <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E

5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon is {{the only}} nation with a {{national}} law protecting this species. This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can <b>be</b> <b>captured</b> with a proper permit. International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under CITES Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of this species is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances. In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.|$|E
