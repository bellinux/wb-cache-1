[...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> news is that this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event.

[...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

[...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups.

2500|$|The Attorney General {{tasked with}} {{drafting}} the legislation was Alfred Deakin.

In seeking to justify the policy, Deakin said {{he believed that the}} Japanese and Chinese might be a threat to the newly formed federation and it was this belief that led to legislation to ensure they would be kept out:It is not the bad qualities, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> qualities of these alien races that make them so dangerous to us. It is their inexhaustible energy, their power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard of living that make them such competitors.Early drafts of the Act explicitly banned non-Europeans from migrating to Australia but objections from the British government, which feared that such a measure would offend British subjects in India and Britain's allies in Japan, caused the Barton government to remove this wording. Instead, a [...] "dictation test" [...] was introduced as a device for excluding unwanted immigrants. Immigration officials were given the power to exclude any person who failed to pass a 50-word dictation test. At first this was to be in any European language, but was later changed to include any language. [...] The tests were written in such a way to make them nearly impossible to pass.
