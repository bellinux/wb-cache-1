30|$|In this paper, {{authors have}} tried to reduce {{quantity}} of the factors influencing asphaltene deposition to study effect of pressure upon this process in more detail. A major factor which causes asphaltene precipitation is pressure decrease lower onset pressure which is slightly higher <b>bubble-point</b> pressure. Gas begins to liberate from oil at a <b>bubble-point</b> pressure, so that thermodynamic equilibrium in oil is disturbed, it’s dissolving ability in relation to asphaltenes considerably decreases, the maximum asphaltene precipitation rate is observed at this pressure. Further migration of asphaltene particles in the porous medium is influenced by four major factors, such as diffusion, adsorption, sedimentation and fluid forces.|$|E
30|$|Some other {{correlations}} {{have included}} additional correlating {{variables such as}} average temperature, critical temperature, Watson characterisation factor (K w), <b>bubble-point</b> pressure (P b) and <b>bubble-point</b> gas/oil ratio (R sb).

Alternative methods that could possibly give improved accuracy are the use of EOS or correlations that use crude oil compositions, though these are not usually available.

30|$|Near the {{critical}} point, where the <b>bubble-point</b> curve and dew-point curve interconnect, the physical {{properties of the}} liquid and gas are indistinguishable.

Capillary pressure and IFT have the highest values at the initial contact between the two immiscible fluids in {{contact with each other}} through an interface.

In the practice of petroleum reservoir engineering we are often faced with the analysis of processes which require the physical properties of the reservoir fluids, but in many cases no laboratory measurements of properties are available. Our only recourse in such cases is the use of empirically derived correlations This study considers the correlation of black oil Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) properties for pressures at or below the <b>bubble-point</b> pressure. Specifically, we address the following correlations: <b>Bubble-point</b> pressure, Pb *Solution gas-oil-ratio at pressures below the <b>bubble-point,</b> Rs ?Oil formation volume factor at pressures below the <b>bubble-point,</b> B 0 In this work we provide a detailed analysis of the most popular correlations in the petroleum literature compared to our two databases (P<Pb, 2213 data points; P= Pb, 728 data points). Our analysis shows that all these correlations have limitations in predicting the behavior of Rs and Bo at pressures below the <b>bubble-point.</b> This is somewhat expected as these correlations were developed specifically to estimate fluid properties at the bubblepoint pressure. Our first effort was to correlate Pb- In this effort we tried several relations, but we ultimately used the "Standing-Petrosky" model. Regressing this equation onto our bubblepoint pressure database we obtained an absolute average error of 1 1. 7 %. Our approach in developing a new correlation for Rs at pressures below the <b>bubble-point</b> considered the use of the "reduced" variables p, and Rsr' This correlation for Rs (P< Pb) gave an absolute average error on the order of 4 %. Similarly, correlating these data using our p, correlation we obtained an absolute average error of 8. 4 %. A similar reduced variables approach was attempted and abandoned for the correlation of B, (P< Pb), primarily due to our inability to correlate low pressure behavior. We instead used Standing's model; this correlation for B,, (P< Pb) gave an absolute average error on the order of 2 %. We also developed a material balance procedure for the determination of Bo using R, from our new correlation and a pseudo-liquid density correlation published by McCain and Hill. This correlation also gave an absolute average error of approximately 2 %...|$|E

30|$|Nojabaei et al. (2013) {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} capillary pressure {{on the behavior of}} oil reservoirs in tight rocks utilizing the Macleod and Sugden equation. The author has concluded that for oil reservoirs, there is an inverse relationship between capillary pressure and <b>bubble-point</b> pressure. It was found that capillary pressure increases with smaller pore throat sizes and <b>bubble-point</b> pressure appeared to be decreasing with smaller pore throat sizes. These outcomes were implied in later research conducted by Nojabaei et al. (2014) to investigate the influence on the productivity of Bakken oil reservoir in an oil-wetting environment. Contrary to the common belief of oil-wet systems implying higher retention and intensive holding of oil-in-place, the results showed an increase in oil recovery by 7 – 9 and 10  % in the gas recovery.|$|E

40|$|The {{intrusion}} of gas into oils stored within the SPR has been examined. When oil {{is stored in}} domal salts, gases intrude into the stored oil from the surrounding salt. Aspects of the mechanism of gas intrusion have been examined. In all cases, this gas intrusion results in increases in the oil vapor pressure. Data that have been gathered from 1993 to August 2002 are presented to show the resultant increases in <b>bubble-point</b> pressure on a cavern-by-cavern {{as well as on}} a stream basis. The measurement techniques are presented with particular emphasis on the TVP 95. Data analysis methods are presented to show the methods required to obtain recombined cavern oil compositions. Gas-oil ratios are also computed from the data and are presented on a cavern-by-cavern and stream basis. The observed increases in <b>bubble-point</b> pressure and gas-oil ratio are further statistically analyzed to allow data interpretation. Emissions plume modeling is used to determine adherence to state air regulations. Gas intrusion is observed to be variable among the sites and within each dome. Gas intrusions at Bryan Mound and Big Hill have resulted in the largest increases in <b>bubble-point</b> pressure for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The streams at Bayou Choctaw and West Hackberry show minimal <b>bubble-point</b> pressure increases. Emissions plume modeling, using the state mandated ISCST code, of oil storage tanks showed that virtually no gas may be released when H 2 S standards are considered. DOE plans to scavenge H 2 S to comply with the very tight standards on this gas. With the assumption of scavenging, benzene releases become the next most controlling factor. Model results show that a GOR of 0. 6 SCF/BBL may be emissions that are within standards. Employing the benzene gas release standard will significantly improve oil deliverability. New plume modeling using the computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT, is addressing limitations of the state mandated ISCST model...|$|E

30|$|Presented paper, herein, is on phase {{equilibrium}} {{of light and}} heavy crudes known to be closely related to enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In miscible gas injection, the advancing gas (or injecting fluid) develops with petroleum fluids a miscibility front in the reservoir fluids that further reduces the viscous forces holding crudes stranded. The present work presents a {{phase equilibrium}} scheme upon which heavy oil swelling and light crude vaporization were found when carbon dioxide (or methane) was used as advancing gas. Heavy crude swelling was observed to be not only dependent on gas solubility {{but also on the}} chemical composition of the crude oil. Although a small fraction of injecting gas was distributed in the reservoir water, the initial water–oil ratio was seen to alter the <b>bubble-point</b> pressure from 10 to 30  % depending of the injected gas. In order to mimic miscible-like behavior during gas injection, a dynamic description of methane and carbon dioxide was proposed. Alteration of PVT parameters below and beyond the <b>bubble-point</b> pressure was highlighted therefrom.|$|E
40|$|The {{impetus for}} this work stems from the {{difficulties}} in obtaining reliable viscosity measurements for live oils from viscous oil reservoirs. The use of correlations to estimate fluid viscosity can provide a useful method to provide the reservoir engineer with preliminary values for reservoir calculations. Many different correlations based on measured fluid properties have been presented in the literature to estimate fluid viscosity. Using measured data supplied through {{the offices of the}} DTI, these correlations have been assessed for their ability to predict measured viscosity data for several North Sea heavy oil reservoirs. Arising from this assessment, prediction of dead oil viscosity, on which most of the correlations for <b>bubble-point</b> and thereby undersaturated oil viscosity are based, was found to be poor. Work to identify an alternative correlation was undertaken and a new correlation developed. Particular correlations for <b>bubble-point</b> and undersaturated oil viscosity have been recommended as providing the best match with measured data. An engineer’s flow chart has been created to summarise the findings...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{the present}} study {{presents}} the pseudo-equilibrium of actual dead crude oils modeled from their chemical composition. A computational scheme, modified from established algorithms, is further proposed. Moreover, this work attempts to highlight in simple manner how does the phase composition of petroleum fluids could be correlated with basic PVT parameters including <b>bubble-point</b> pressure, solution gas–oil ratio (GOR) and oil formation volume factor (Bo).|$|E

40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of the binary system consisting of the supercritical fluid carbon dioxide (CO 2) and the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim][BF 4]) was studied experimentally. A synthetic method {{was used to measure}} its phase behavior. <b>Bubble-point</b> pressures of the system CO 2 + [bmim][BF 4] are reported for carbon dioxide concentrations ranging from (10. 22 to 60. 17) mole % and within a temperature range of (278. 47 to 368. 22) K. The CO 2 + [bmim][BF 4] binary system has a two-phase liquid-vapor region extending up to very high pressures. Most likely, the type of fluid-phase behavior is type III according to the classification of Scott and Van Konynenburg. The experimental results obtained were compared with the available phase behavior data of the binary system CO 2 + 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([hmim][BF 4]) to investigate the effect of the length of the alkyl group on the phase {{behavior of}} this type of system.

30|$|Knowledge of oil pressure–volume–temperature (PVT) {{properties}} is {{of great}} interest to petroleum engineers as they are critical in performing most reservoir engineering studies. Viscosity is one of these PVT properties and it controls the fluid flow through the porous media. It is therefore important to be able to estimate crude oil viscosity at different stages of oil exploration. Empirical correlations, based on easily acquired field data, are usually employed to estimate dead oil, <b>bubble-point</b> and undersaturated viscosities. However, performance of these empirical correlations is not usually satisfactory and improved predictions are always sought.|$|E
30|$|Gas {{solubility}} {{along with}} heavy oil solubilization increases {{with the pressure}} across these zones. Given the same conditions, methane will dissolve less in heavy crude {{not only because of}} its poor reactivity but also due to its high minimum miscibility pressure (Kulkarni and Rao 2005). One way to increase methane solubility would be to get it enriched with a fraction of C 2 –C 4 (Teletzke et al. 2005). In addition, oil swelling, whose significance has been discussed in earlier sections, would be higher for carbon dioxide than methane. Although the effect of reservoir water in the phase behavior could be neglected, primarily because of low distribution of gas, it is, however, believed to alter the <b>bubble-point</b> pressure.|$|E

Within this temperature range, <b>bubble-point</b> pressures up to 5 bar were observed.

Equally good results are obtained for the binaries of N 2 with naphthenes, iso-alkanes and aromatics.

30|$|A novel {{approach}} {{was introduced in}} (Khoukhi et al. 2011) to predict the entire viscosity by training {{the parameters of the}} curve and <b>bubble-point</b> viscosity. However, the caveat to this method is its dependent on oil compositions which cannot be determined easily on the field, limiting the potential adoption of such methods for industrial application. Also, other works on viscosity prediction a stand-alone ML technique or hybrid systems have mainly adopted a single functional form (Elsharkwy and Gharbi 2001; Ghorbani et al. 2016; Hemmati-Sarapardeh et al. 2016). This paper aims {{to solve the problem of}} local minima by using ensemble model rather than a stand-alone SVM and the problem of preferential adoption of a single functional form by using different functional forms found in the literature for the prediction of oil viscosity.|$|E
