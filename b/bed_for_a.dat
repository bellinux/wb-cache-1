25|$|The 500 {{shares of}} the Shropshire Canal were {{initially}} valued at £150 each, making it worth £75,000. It was making around £4,000 per year, and rather than buying it, the Shropshire Union decided to lease it instead, for an annual sum of £3,125. The agreement began on 1 November 1849. There were serious problems with subsidence, and the manager recommended that the canal should be converted into a railway in January 1855, but although the Shropshire Union board agreed, their recommendation to the LNWR was ignored. In July 1855, a breach of the canal occurred, when it broke through into the Oakengates railway tunnel. The summit level emptied, causing floods in the town. A second breach occurred in September, on a section which had been re-routed over a mine shaft {{to make way for}} the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway, and seven more occurred the following year. The LNWR then obtained an Act of Parliament in 1857, which allowed them to buy the canal for £62,500, and to close it from the Wrockwardine Wood inclined plane to the Windmill inclined plane, and use the <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> railway. Closure took place on 1 June 1858. Parts of the bed were used for a railway to Coalport, which opened in 1861. The Stirchley tunnel was converted into a cutting as part of this project.|$|E

In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week.

Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them {{went out of}} business—Kneale commented in a 2003 interview that [...] "I reckon I closed down at least two film companies." [...] Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of teenage suicides called The Big Giggle, or The Big, Big Giggle. Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay in <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long period, the concept started life as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation had second thoughts {{about the nature of}} the storyline and the possibility of copycat suicides; Kneale later agreed that they were probably right not to make it for television.

500|$|Although he gave-up day-to-day {{running of}} the party's organization, he stayed on the {{national}} executive as the English-speaking vice-president from 1950 to 1954. After four years of comparatively limited involvement with CCF internal politics, Lewis became the party's national chairman, by winning the election to replace Percy Wright. He, along with Lorne Ingle, the person that replaced him as national secretary in 1950, became the main drafters of the 1956 Winnipeg Declaration, which replaced the Regina Manifesto. [...] The lead-up to the August 1956 CCF convention had Lewis working full-time in his labour practice, including work on the merger of the Canadian Congress of Labour and the Trades and Labour Congress to form the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), and putting in long hours organizing the committee that wrote the Declaration. He collapsed {{in his office in}} May 1956; after administering several tests for a possible cardiac condition, the doctors concluded that Lewis collapsed of exhaustion. [...] He stayed in <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week and recovered enough to help the Declaration pass ten weeks later. [...] The Winnipeg convention was the CCF's swan song. [...] Even with the Declarations modified tone, which removed state planning and nationalization of industry as central tenets of the party's platform, the CCF suffered a crippling defeat in the 1958 federal election, which became known as the [...] "Diefenbaker sweep". It was obvious to Lewis, Coldwell {{and the rest of the}} CCF executive that the CCF could not continue as it was, and, with the co-operation of the CLC, they started exploring how to broaden its appeal.|$|E

The Manchester Guardian reported on 16 January 1899 that [...] "there were many shakings of the head, not only in Liverpool, at the audacity of the attempt" [...] and that [...] "the canal pilots, on reaching Irlam, looked as if they had not been in <b>bed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week, as their eyes were bleared with exhaustion".

The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port. On her first voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1899, the City took nine days and sixteen hours; and arrived before the mail boat, which had left the Mersey twelve hours ahead of her.|$|E
