This isotope {{does not cause}} aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years.

5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. <b>Beta</b> <b>radiation</b> can penetrate human skin, but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and <b>beta</b> <b>radiation</b> from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study has been}} made of the radiochemical decomposition of trypsin by the radiations from radium emanation. The following equation accounts quantitatively for the experimental results presented. See PDF for Equation It follows from this that the amount of trypsin decomposed by the radiations from radium emanation depends on the concentration of trypsin present and is proportional to the quantity of emanation expressed in millicuries and to the time of irradiation expressed in hours. It would seem that it is the active or undissociated trypsin that is affected. Evidence has been found which suggests that the <b>beta</b> <b>radiations</b> produce the decomposition observed for which the above statement holds.

50|$|Radon {{has been}} {{produced}} commercially {{for use in}} radiation therapy, {{but for the most}} part has been replaced by radionuclides made in accelerators and nuclear reactors. Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers.The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>radiations,</b> while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200 MBq).

25|$|Alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>radiation</b> {{have low}} {{penetrating}} power and {{are unlikely to}} affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>radiation</b> {{can only do so}} if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of erythema.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s {{the use of}} radium {{paint was}} discontinued. In many cases {{luminous}} dials were implemented with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades. Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive promethium-147 (half-life 2.6 years) or tritium (half-life 12 years) paint was used; both continue to be used today. These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium. Tritium emits very low-energy <b>beta</b> <b>radiation</b> (even lower-energy than the <b>beta</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted by promethium) which cannot penetrate the skin, rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer.|$|E

The collected evidence supported the hypothesis that increased time spent in formal science education correlates with a better understanding and more positive and rational attitudes.

The longer half-lived iodine-125 is also occasionally used when a longer half-life radioiodine is needed for diagnosis, and in brachytherapy treatment (isotope confined in small seed-like metal capsules), where the low-energy gamma radiation without a beta component makes iodine-125 useful.

The theory preserved the principle of conservation of energy, which had been thrown into question by the continuous energy distribution of beta particles.
