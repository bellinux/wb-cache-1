The first and fore-most is that ASPB, in more ways than I had previously fully appreciated, is tru-ly a terrific organization that does much to serve our plant biology community and enrich our professional lives. This is accomplished in multiple ways. Of course, there is the publication of our two premier scientific journals, Plant Physiology and The Plant Cell. There is the annual ASPB Plant Biology meeting that, through plenary and concurrent ses-sions, <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed on the latest developments in a variety of areas basic to plant biology and provides a forum for young scientists to present their findings on an international stage. There are also the new, smaller, specialty meetings on specific hot topics and the efforts of the Society to identify and honor with a variety of awards those individuals who have made outstanding contributions that have furthered our scientific under-standing of plant biology or who have provided lead-ership in agriculture or education in the plant sciences. Another very important way in which the Society serves the membership and plant biology community is through the work of the numerous ASPB committees. I don’t have space here to write about each of these committees. However, as examples, there is the Public Affairs Committee, which provides a voice on behalf of the entire plant biology community to Congress, fund-ing agencies, and elsewhere where our interests as plant biologists are concerned.

40|$|The Bungku-Tolaki {{group of}} {{languages}} (Austronesian, Western Malayo-Polynesian) comprises fifteen languages spoken {{in and around}} the southeastern peninsula of Sulawesi Island in present-day Indonesia. Although there exist no written records for these languages prior to 1900, I apply the traditional methods of historical and comparative linguistics, as well as bring to bear more recent understandings regarding the nature of grammatical and semantic change, in order to develop a picture of their common ancestor language, Proto-Bungku-Tolaki. The dissertation has two parts. In part one, I reconstruct the sound system of Proto-Bungku-Tolaki, detailing both the innovations which distinguish it from its nearest identified ancestor, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, along with the phonological changes which occurred in the various daughter languages, <b>bringing</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the present day. In the second part I focus on issues of transitivity including the grammaticalization of the preposition taken as a valence-changing applicative suffix, clause structure including relative clauses, and verbal inflection. Herein, Proto-Bungku-Tolaki is reconstructed as having three construction types which allowed the expression of both an agent and a patent, namely the active, the passive, and the antipassive. Nominative and absolutive pronoun sets served as agreement markers, though the genitive subject marking original to subordinate temporal adverbial clauses has in some languages also made its way into main clauses. Because there is not as yet a significant body of published material on the Bungku-Tolaki languages, I have made a conscious effort to amply supply this dissertation with the primary data upon which my analyses have been based. Therefore although the present work is of particular relevance to Austronesianists working in the field of historical reconstruction, the data and descriptions alone should make this an invaluable reference for anyone interested in the languages of this small corner of the world. Appendices include five texts with interlinear glossing and free translation, and a compilation of Proto-Bungku-Tolaki lexical reconstructions with supporting evidence...|$|R
40|$|This {{small but}} {{competent}} book correctly {{concludes that the}} German experience in Oklahoma was extremely limited, primarily because the settlement of Germans there was sparse. In addition, the Germans, like most white settlers in the state, arrived only after periods {{of time spent in}} other states, notably in the Midwestern states of Nebraska, Wisconson, Iowa, and Illinois. In Oklahoma the Germans were concentrated {{near the center of the}} state in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and Blaine counties. One in a series of small books treating the newcomer ethnic groups to Oklahoma, this volume contains a bibliographical essay and footnotes for each of its six chapters. An index is sadly missed. The chapters offer a general introduction; the patterns of German immigration to the United States; the settlement of Germans generally in Oklahoma; the three genuinely German counties of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, and Blaine; Oklahoma 2 ̆ 7 s Germans and World War I; and the German experience since World War I. The author <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> date with information from the 1970 s. Chapter 2, which treats German immigration to the United States, relies almost entirely on two excellent publications: Walter F. Willcox, ed., International Migrations, 2 vols.

40|$|This article briefly {{describes}} the beneficial qualities, constructive uses, and profound cultural {{significance of the}} coca leaf for the indigenous Andean peoples highlighting examples from Bolivia – a country {{in the vanguard of}} the defense of the sacred leaf. More specifically I will describe the natural coca leaf’s renowned nutritional and therapeutic qualities, explain how coca has been used for millennia as a ritual tool for divination, social interaction, and as a link to deities and the mother earth that they worship. I will also explain how coca became institutionalized as a key cultural symbol of solidarity, identity, and resistance for the native Andean people in the face of colonial and neocolonial domination. I will then describe the implications of the recent boom in the economic value of coca caused by the increased demand from the cocaine industry, combined with pressures to completely outlaw and eradicate the coca leaf. These contradictory foreign demands for the drug cocaine and for the prohibition of the natural coca leaf threaten to deprive the traditional consumers of their coca, thus creating a powerful social force of rebellion arising in defense of the traditional meanings and uses of coca in the face of threats to this traditional way of life and the very identity of indigenous Andeans. I conclude this historical analysis by <b>bringing</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> date on constructive uses of the leaf in wider society and the current struggle to recognize the coca leaf as an intangible heritage of humanity and access to its many beneficial qualities a basic human right for everyone.

40|$|Chapter 10, by Byron Dueck, <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> date, {{but also}} shifts {{analytical}} focus from the performativity {{of individuals to}} the way a relatively large group of musicians reflect on the performance (or not) of black identity in British jazz. Using interview material from the "What is Black British Jazz?" research project, he examines "a tangle in British discourse about jazz", specifically {{the way in which}} contemporary players often refute the suggestion that there is any such an entity as "black British jazz". That is, they rebut the idea of a homogeneous identity performed by black musicians. And there is also a concern not to be labelled as different or apart from British jazz, or just jazz, more generally. Dueck then sets this starting position of scepticism about "black British jazz" against a couple of other factors. One is the recognition that there definitely was a black British jazz, in the moment of the Jazz Warriors in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Indeed, some musicians acknowledge that it still exists in the case of up-front, hybrid ensembles like Gary Crosby's Jazz Jamaica. But there is another dimension beyond the way in which musicians reflect on the performance (or not) of blackness, and that is advantage-disadvantage. In the terms we developed {{at the beginning of the}} section to attend to this topic represents a move from the perfomative considered as a field of creative agency to the notionally "lower" level of the social structural conditions under which musicians live and work. First, as Dueck shows, black people in Britiain are much less likely to receive higher education, especially in music, and this is considered by many of the interviewees to be a serious disadvantage. On the other hand, this could be advantageous in encouraging improvisation, experimentation and individualism, and perhaps perceived as being true to a certain idea of self-taught authenticity in jazz performance. Second, it seems likely that black musicians disproportionately attract a white audience, in a latter-day version of the exoticism which has dogged black musicians since the earliest days of jazz in Britain. This is acknowledged by both white and black musicians in the interviews which Dueck considers, and is often considered to be an unfair advantage, yet in this situation success may be most readily achieved by adhering to white expectations of black musicians (the long history of this in a British context is explored throughout this volume, beginning with Rye in Chapter 2) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the interaction of politics with Buddhism and the Sangha (the community of monks) in Thailand. Buddhism is seen as having long served as one of the main socializing, acculturating, and unifying forces in Thai society. It has profoundly influenced the cultural, economic, and political development of the nation, and also reputedly continues to mould the social and political values of the great majority of the Thai population. The Sangha has played a very important role in the social life of almost every Thai. I intend to show that though Buddhism and the Sangha have had complex interactions with politics over a long period of time, recent sociopolitical changes in Thailand have led to the formation and assumption of new roles and a quite unique redefinition of roles for the Sangha. The main force behind this change has been the political development of the Thai state. To acquire a full perspective of the, relation between Buddhism and kingship, Sangha and state, it is necessary to examine the nature of their interactions from early times, and in this I am fortunate in being able to draw on a number of previous works. These earlier studies have their limitations, as will become clear when I consider them in more detail below, for they only take up the topic as a subordinate part of their consideration of other problems, and the most recent of them only <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1972. The most original part of-this study is therefore the examination of the modern period dating from the late 1950 s, especially the period between 1973 and 1976 when I attempt to elucidate the critical political developments and their interrelationship with changes in the Sangha. In this connection, the study attempts to investigate the impact of government controls and directions on the Sangha. I intend to show why since the late 1950 s the government has encouraged the Sangha to participate in the execution of government policies and how the Sangha has responded to this political mobilization. I will attempt to establish the degree to which the Sanghah has co-operated with the government. Assuming part of the Sangha is willing to collaborate with the government, I will then attempt to answer the questions: how far can Buddhism and the Sangha provide a positive ideology and assistance for the goal realization of the government and by what methods? Assuming part of the Sangha is not willing to co-operate with the government, I will ask the question: what are the opportunities for the Sangha to retain its place and its traditional status? I will attempt to understand the Sangha's own perception of its roles in this light. Another important area of investigation in this study, is that if some members of the Sangha are not willing to co-operate with the government and react independently to socio-political changes, what are the stimuli for their actions, and what are the opportunities for these monks to retain their place and traditional status? In this, I intend to show how the abrupt socio-political changes during 1973 - 1976 have resulted in the-assumption and formulation of new and non-traditional roles, and activities by certain groups of monks. I will consider their ideological positions and their perceptions of their roles...|$|R
