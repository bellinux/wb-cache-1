5|$|Human {{beings are}} seen as a {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> oneself.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, {{the focus}} has been on {{creating}} an awareness of the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. <b>By</b> <b>understanding</b> the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell also {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. <b>By</b> <b>understanding</b> the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.|$|E

25|$|The text is {{attributed}} to a certain Sāramati (娑囉末底) in the earlier Chinese tradition, while the Tibetan tradition considers the verse portion to have been composed by Maitreya-nātha and the prose commentary by Asanga.

25|$|In {{the study}} of {{infectious}} diseases and host responses, the mathematical and computer models are a great help. These models were very useful in characterizing the behavior and spread of infectious disease, <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> {{the dynamics of the}} pathogen in the host and the mechanisms of host factors which aid pathogen persistence. Examples include Plasmodium falciparum and nematode infection in ruminants.|$|E

25|$|Communication is a {{key element}} of {{negotiation}}. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. <b>By</b> <b>understanding</b> how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|<b>By</b> <b>understanding</b> the {{specific}} temperamental traits {{that are common}} among individuals with specific disorders, clinicians can form a more targeted, informed approach to treatment and look to newer psychotherapies for guidance. The relationship between temperament and individual clusters of DSM personality disorders is often investigated. According to the DSM-IV, the tridimensional structure allows up to nine major personality disorders to be identified, the theory thereby making a great contribution {{to the understanding of}} psychiatric disorders.|$|E

25|$|Through {{observation}} and carefully reasoned geological arguments, Hutton {{came to believe}} that the Earth was perpetually being formed; he recognised that the history of the Earth could be determined <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> how processes such as erosion and sedimentation work in the present day. His theories of geology and geologic time, also called deep time, came to be included in theories which were called plutonism and uniformitarianism.

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} {{is based on}} the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, cognition has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.|$|E

25|$|Cell {{signaling}} (cell signalling in British English) {{is part of}} any {{communication process}} that governs basic activities of cells and coordinates all cell actions. The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment {{is the basis of}} development, tissue repair, and immunity, as well as normal tissue homeostasis. Errors in signaling interactions and cellular information processing are responsible for diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. <b>By</b> <b>understanding</b> cell signaling, diseases may be treated more effectively and, theoretically, artificial tissues may be created.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, an {{influential}} {{leader in the}} early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of common descent (that all life developed from one common organism), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not {{pose a threat to}} Orthodox Judaism's beliefs. He posited that belief in Evolution could instead cause one to be more reverent of God <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> His wonders (a master plan for the universe).|$|E
25|$|Emotion {{and social}} skills are {{important}} to an intelligent agent for two reasons. First, being able to predict the actions of others <b>by</b> <b>understanding</b> their motives and emotional states allow an agent to make better decisions. Concepts such as game theory, decision theory, necessitate that an agent {{be able to detect}} and model human emotions. Second, in an effort to facilitate human–computer interaction, an intelligent machine may want to display emotions (even if it does not experience those emotions itself) to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.|$|E
