40|$|In this paper, the {{expressive}} power <b>of</b> disjunctive <b>rules</b> involving default negation is analyzed within a framework based on polynomial, faithful and modular (PFM) translations. The analysis {{is restricted to}} the stable semantics of disjunctive logic programs. A particular interest is understanding what is the effect if default negation is allowed in the heads <b>of</b> disjunctive <b>rules.</b> It is established {{in the paper that}} occurrences of default negation can be removed from the heads <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> using a PFM translation when default negation is allowed in the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> In this case, we may conclude that default negation appearing in the heads <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> does not affect expressive power <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> However, in the case that default negation may not be used in the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> such a PFM translation is no longer possible. Moreover, there is no PFM translation for removing default negation from the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> Consequently, disjunctive logic programs with default negation in the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> are strictly more expressive than those without...|$|R

Equity, as a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> varied from Chancellor to Chancellor, {{until the end}} of the 16th century.

25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E
2500|$|Equity is a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> that {{developed}} in England {{separately from the}} [...] "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so. This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to {{take good care of}} the entrusted property. In the early case of Keech v Sandford [...] a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford {{that he did not want}} the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote, ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the basic framework for indirect discrimination is found for the issue of equal pay between men and women. Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, {{and so did the}} TFEU article 157, {{there has always been a}} separate <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to [...] "pay", concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave. Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same employer, or an associated employer, and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply. It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant must be doing [...] "broadly similar" [...] work to the comparator, or work [...] "rated as equivalent", or work which is of [...] "equal value". These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the [...] "value" [...] of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court in a way that the open ended test for indirect discrimination does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court's discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an [...] "equality clause" [...] into the claimant's contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal. It is unclear what principle justifies the segregation of unequal pay claims based on sex, compared to all other protected characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, {{it had become}} an ever more widely held view that {{equitable}} rules and the law of trusts varied unpredictably, as the jurist John Selden remarked, according {{to the size of}} the [...] "Chancellor's foot". Over the 18th century English property law, and trusts with it, mostly came to a standstill in legislation, but the Court of Chancery continued to develop equitable principles notably under Lord Nottingham (from 1673–1682), Lord King (1725–1733), Lord Hardwicke (1737–1756), and Lord Henley (1757–1766). In 1765, the first Professor of English law, William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that equity should not be seen as a distinct <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> separate from the other laws of England. For example, although it was [...] "said that a court of equity determines according to the spirit of the rule and not according to the strictness of the letter," [...] wrote Blackstone, [...] "so also does a court of law" [...] and the result was that each system of courts was attempting to reach [...] "the same principles of justice and positive law". Blackstone's influence reached far. Chancellors became more concerned to standardise and harmonise equitable principles. At the start of the 19th century in Gee v Pritchard, referring to John Selden's quip, Lord Eldon (1801–1827) said 'Nothing would inflict upon me greater pain in quitting this place than the recollection that I had done anything to justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor's foot.' The Court of Chancery was meant to have mitigated the petty strictnesses of the common law of property. But instead, came to be seen as cumbersome and arcane. This was partly because until 1813, there was only the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls working as judges. Work was slow. In 1813, a Vice-Chancellor was appointed, in 1841 two more, and in 1851 two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (making seven). But this did not save it from ridicule. In particular, Charles Dickens (1812–1870), who himself worked as a clerk near Chancery Lane, wrote Bleak House in 1853, depicting a fictional case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, a Chancery matter about wills that nobody understood and dragged on for years and years. Within twenty years, separate courts of equity were abolished. Parliament merged the common law and equity courts into one system with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. Equitable principles would prevail over common law rules in case of conflict, but the separate identity of equity had ended. The separate identity of the trust, however, continued as strongly as before. In other parts of the Commonwealth (or the British Empire at the time) trust law principles, as then understood, were codified for the purpose of easy administration. The best example is the Indian Trusts Act 1882, which described a trust as meaning [...] "an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the bearer".|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{definition}} in question, if definition it can be called which is not found in any set form of words, but left to be arrived at by a process of abstraction from a hundred current modes of speaking on the subject; it seems liable to the conclusive objection, that it confounds the essentially distinct, though closely connected, ideas of science and art. These two ideas differ from one another as the understanding differs from the will, or as the indicative mood in grammar differs from the imperative. The one deals in facts, the other in precepts. Science {{is a collection of}} truths; art, a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> or directions for conduct. The language of science is, This is, or, This is not; This does, or does not, happen. The language of art is, Do this; Avoid that. Science takes cognizance of a phenomenon, and endeavours to discover its law; art proposes to itself an end, and looks out for means to effect it.|$|E

It must be pointed out that in effect, what is here forecast for questions of ménage and moral restraints has already happened to a very large extent in religious matters. There was {{a time when it was}} held--and I think rightly--that a man's religious beliefs, and particularly his method of expressing them, was a part not of his individual but of his social life. But the great upheavals of the Reformation resulted finally in a compromise, a sort of truce, that has put religious belief very largely out of intercourse and discussion. It is conceded that within the bounds of the general peace and security a man may believe and express his belief in matters of religion as he pleases, not because it is better so, but because for the present epoch there is no way nor hope of attaining unanimous truth. There is a decided tendency that will, I believe, prevail towards the same compromise in the question of private morals. There is a convention to avoid all discussion of creeds in general social intercourse; and a similar convention to avoid the point of status in relation to marriage, one may very reasonably anticipate, will be similarly recognized.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this report, {{we compare}} the {{expressive}} powers of classes of logic {{programs that are}} obtained by constraining the number n of atoms in the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> This {{gives rise to the}} classes of binary programs (n ≤ 2), unary programs (n ≤ 1) and atomic programs (n = 0). The comparison is based on the existence/nonexistence of polynomial, faithful, and modular (PFM) translation functions between the classes. As a result, we obtain a strict ordering on the classes of logic programs under consideration under the least model semantics. Binary programs are shown to be as expressive as unconstrained programs but strictly more expressive than unary programs. In addition, unary programs are strictly more expressive than atomic programs. This setting remains valid even if we consider normal logic programs, in which negative literals may appear in the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> under the stable model semantics. We also take propositional satisfiability into consideration and establish that atomic programs are strictly more expressive than sets of clauses under classical semantics.
