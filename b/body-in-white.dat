Then, two criteria for spot weld life prediction, based respectively on mechanical damage and fracture mechanics, are developed through a nonlinear multiple regression method of optimization. These criteria considerably improve the correlation between numerical and test results. Finally, an application of this study is led on a fatigue test of a full <b>body-in-white</b> with about 4000 spot welds. Secondly, {{this paper presents}} new fatigue data editing techniques. Existing fatigue data editing techniques are tested on a full <b>body-in-white</b> fatigue lifetime calculation. The load applied to the biw is complex, with several load application locations and directions. All the critical point have to be detected with the new strength signal. Existing fatigue data editing techniques are adapted and tested on a full <b>body-in-white</b> fatigue calculation. Since the time discretization point number of the new load signal obtained from the literature techniques is too high, two new fatigue data editing technique are developed and tested on a full <b>body-in-white</b> durability calculation. The damage values damages at both spot weld and sheet metal, predicted with these new simplified load signals, are close to the damages values calculated with the full load signal.

In field of dynamic analysis, experimental data is often viewed for having better accuracy giving the availability of reliable data acquisition and measuring equipment.

The {{automotive}} {{body system}} {{is not only a}} source for directly radiating noise into the vehicle interior space, but also a key component for transmitting various vibrations and noise. The optimization of the modes for <b>body-in-white</b> has significant meanings for improving the reliability and NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) performance of the whole vehicle. Based on the current situation that there is more severe interior vibration and noise problem occurring in driving for a light passenger vehicle, a hybrid modal analysis method combined with experiment and simulation methods is applied to investigate the vibration and noise characteristics of the whole vehicle body. By performing such modal analysis, the modal frequencies of the auto-body are improved effectively by strengthening the vibration sensitive regions in the body structure.

40|$|AbstractProcess {{planning}} of spot welding for <b>body-in-white</b> automobile structures involves several experimental (physical) welding trials {{to set the}} process parameters. These experimental trials are crucial in ensuring the quality and efficiency of the process. However, due to the iterative nature of the work, running several experiments is costly and time consuming prolonging the overall development cost and time significantly. To minimize the cost and time, replacing the physical tests by digital (virtual) tests is an established approach although not often applied for spot welding.

40|$|The use of {{advanced}} high strength steels (AHSS) in the automotive <b>body-in-white</b> is increasing. Those steels are predominantly joined by resistance spot welding. For {{the performance of}} the whole <b>body-in-white,</b> the fatigue behaviour is of high interest, especially as during production, weld imperfections such as cracks and manufacturing-related gaps cannot be avoided. In this study the TRIP steel HCT 690 was used as it is a typical advanced high strength steel in automotive production. The investigation into the influence of cracks was split depending on the crack location in the weld area. Surface cracks in the electrode indentation area {{as well as in the}} heat affected zone were produced during welding and analyzed. The results showed that surface cracks independent of their position have no effect on the fatigue life. The produced internal imperfections have shown only a marginal impact on the fatigue life. It was ascertained that gaps of 3 mm lead to a significant drop in fatigue life compared to gap free shear tension samples under a load ratio R of 0. 1. This fact was attributed to decreased stiffness, higher transverse vibration and higher rotation between the sheets.

Generation of <b>body-in-white</b> nite element models for full vehicle simulation of Linear Statics, Normal Modes, NVH, and Crash {{is one of the most}} critical items. This is due to the need to connect various <b>body-in-white</b> components which requires: a signi cant amount of manpower because of di cult automation possibilities a &quot;physically correct &quot; representation of part-connectors such as weld spots, screws, etc., which cannot be easily automated and requires more manpower resulting in delays and a potentially large source of error In the past, a number of methods were developed for joining these parts together, such as ho-mogenous models and various other weld spot approaches. In the generation of FE-models, each part depended on its connected parts, which made it di cult to shorten the modeling process. Bene ts of faster hardware, and some improvements in preprocessors, were diminished by the need for bigger models. Despite the above improvements, a signi cant amount of time was still required to generate FE models.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the finite element {{simulation}} of spot welded joint in crash analysis. Spot welding is a very common joining process in the automotive industry. It is cost effective and it provides a very fast production rate of automotive body components. Despite this advantage, spot welds are very susceptible to various types of loading conditions. Therefore they are prone to failure, if not designed properly, during their service life time. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the behaviour of spot welds and their failure characteristics. Generally, before the manufacturing stage, most of the automotive structural components are designed and tested in a virtual design environment. It is important to examine the crashworthiness of these <b>body-in-white</b> structures. To asses the crashworthiness of these structures they need to be represented correctly in virtual simulations, which necessitate the development of spot welded joint models to be included in crash analysis. Usually the models for the <b>body-in-white</b> structures are complicated and huge, which contains thousands of spot welded joints. Therefore a simple model for spot welded joints is desirable. Six different spot welded joint models were developed in this thesis to serve the above mentioned purpose. At the same time the simplicity issue of these developed spot weld models were also addressed, so that they can be integrated easily in a large assembly system, which consists of thousands of spot welded joints. Moreover for an effective modelling strategy, the computational costs incurred by the adopted spot weld models need also to be taken into consideration. Therefore the approach undertaken in this thesis was to study the characteristics of only one spot welded joint on a test coupon with the developed suitable spot weld nugget modelling configurations...|$|E
