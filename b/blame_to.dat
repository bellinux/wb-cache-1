5|$|Responsibility for the {{shooting}} in Maribor was never conclusively established. Austrian sources attributed <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> Rudolf Maister, and referenced {{him in some}} accounts as the Butcher of Maribor. In Slovenia, by contrast, Maister remains well-regarded; numerous societies institutions and streets are named in his honour and he is commemorated in several monuments.|$|E
5|$|When Jo {{comes to}} visit the branch, Dwight admits to the gun incident. He {{attempts}} to divert the <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> his employees, saying that blackmail is a bigger crime than firing a gun accidentally, but Jo takes the position away from him. Jo later puts Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), who has the most seniority in the office, in charge until a committee composed of Jim, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), and Gabe find a replacement. While Jim tells Dwight that Jo did the right thing, he also compliments Dwight, noting that the office got every single company order out on time.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat {{for the failure of}} Market Garden. Montgomery attached no <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E

Lionel has Lex committed to a mental institution, when his son discovers what Lionel did. When Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) discovers the truth, that evidence is used to assist Lex have Lionel arrested for his parents' murder. Season three also revealed why Lionel is angry with Lex; he blames his son {{for the death of}} his youngest son Julian Luthor, although Lex took the <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> protect the true killer, his mentally unwell mother Lillian (Alisen Down). Lionel also learns that he has a terminal liver disease, which he divulges to Lex while awaiting arraignment.|$|E
5|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the collision were sworn to secrecy due to national security concerns. The loss was not publicly reported until after the war ended, although the Admiralty filed a writ against Queen Marys owners, Cunard White Star Line, on 22 September 1943 in the Admiralty Court of the High Court of Justice. Little happened until 1945, when the case went to trial in June; it was adjourned to November and then to December 1946. Mr. Justice Pilcher exonerated the Queen Marys crew and her owners from blame on 21 January 1947 and laid all fault on Curacoas officers. The Admiralty appealed his ruling and the Court of Appeal modified the ruling, assigning two-thirds of the <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> the Admiralty and one third to Cunard White Star. The latter appealed to the House of Lords, but they upheld the decision.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> the Southern Railway for {{track maintenance}} or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although the entire class operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E

5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
