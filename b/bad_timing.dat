5|$|Wilco was touring {{to promote}} Mermaid Avenue Vol. II in May 2000 when Jeff Tweedy {{was invited to}} play at the Noise Pop festival in Chicago. The festival {{promoter}} offered to pair Tweedy with a collaborator of his choosing, and Tweedy decided to perform with Jim O'Rourke. Tweedy frequently played O'Rourke's album <b>Bad</b> <b>Timing</b> in his car while he traveled during the previous winter. O'Rourke was an accomplished producer as well as a musician, and had produced over 200 albums by the time that Tweedy requested the collaboration. O'Rourke offered the services of drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio performed at Double Door for the festival on May 14, 2000. Tweedy enjoyed the performance so much that he suggested that the trio record an album together. They chose the name Loose Fur, and recorded six songs during the following summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} to stage uprisings {{within a short time}} in {{southern}} and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. <b>Bad</b> <b>timing</b> and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in Kent started 10days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the River Severn. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to Wem, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either Plymouth or Poole) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.|$|E

Nevertheless, much of Slovakia was left devastated by the Uprising and the German counter-offensive and occupation.|$|E

25|$|Killer Love is {{the debut}} solo studio album by American singer Nicole Scherzinger, former {{lead singer of}} The Pussycat Dolls. It was {{released}} from March 18, 2011, by Interscope Records, in association with its affiliated record labels.

However, unsuccessful singles and poor timing led the project being pushed back numerous times into 2008 and 2009. After releasing The Pussycat Dolls' second album Doll Domination (2008), Scherzinger shelved the project entirely citing <b>bad</b> <b>timing</b> and creative issues as the reasons for its cancellation.

25|$|There {{has been}} three {{attempts}} of reformation since the band's breakup in 2004. In 2006 Norton and Dedman started demoing new tracks with Matt “Skitz” Sanders from Damaged on drums, Seanheist had injured {{his knee and}} ankle {{and was unable to}} commit to recording at this time. Three new songs were recorded but were never fully finished and were soon shelved. The second attempt at reformation was in 2008 with the lineup of Biro, Norton, Seanheist and Dedman rehearsing some old songs and jamming new material a handful of times. Personality clashes, old grievances and just <b>bad</b> <b>timing</b> just made the reformation impossible to go ahead. In 2012 All five members of the band from the IRCR line-up finally caught up and met at the album's 10 year Anniversary party at Norton’s bar (Whole Lotta Love) in Melbourne, talks of reforming were once again on the table, but nothing eventuated.|$|E

After the breakup of UK punk band, Generation X, Ellis took the lead singer to America and launched the career of Billy Idol. In each of these cases, and there are others, the common factor was Ellis’ personal devotion of time, effort and career planning that took the artists to international success. Yet it is ironic that the first band he ever signed to management, Clouds, had their career founder because of lack of management supervision. This was mainly <b>bad</b> luck and <b>timing,</b> for the Chrysalis empire began to rapidly expand at that very moment, and the success of Jethro Tull also meant that Ellis could not devote the time he typically wanted to spend on his artistes.|$|R
25|$|At {{this time}} there was a major change in Allied {{strategy}} which apparently originated with William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, the British foreign minister. According to the plan, Suvorov was to march north into Switzerland with 20,000 Russians to join 45,000 newly arrived Russians under Alexander Korsakov near Zürich. These soldiers would be assisted by 18,000 Austrians led by Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze. Meanwhile, the British agent William Wickham would raise an army of 20,000 Swiss. The mostly-Russian force was supposed to invade France across the Jura Mountains. As soon as Korsakov's army was situated, Charles was to move north into southern Germany with 60,000 Austrians and invade France across the upper Rhine. Tsar Paul I of Russia and Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor approved this plan and issued the necessary orders which arrived at Charles' headquarters on 7 August. In fact, the archduke was reluctant to carry out the plan, since he believed that splitting up the Coalition armies was a mistake. In the end, <b>bad</b> <b>timing</b> ruined the new scheme; Charles would leave Switzerland too early and Suvorov would arrive in Switzerland too late.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the 1957 stage musical West Side Story was {{instrumental}} in making Shakespeare a presence in modern popular and youth culture. The book was written by Arthur Laurents, with music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and choreography by Jerome Robbins. Widely admired, and the winner of ten Oscars, the 1961 film of the show – set among New York gangs – does not aim for a realistic portrayal of New York gang culture: in the opening sequence the Jets and the Sharks trade dance-steps instead of blows. The Jets are a gang of white youths, equivalent to Shakespeare's Montagues; the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. Unlike Shakespeare who included relationships between his young lovers and the older generation (the parents, and parent-substitutes such as the Nurse and Friar Laurence) West Side Story keeps its focus firmly on the youth, with only peripheral roles for Doc, the soda-shop owner, and police officers Schrank and Krupke. Tony (played by Richard Beymer, singing dubbed by Jimmy Bryant) is the play's Romeo and Maria (Natalie Wood, dubbed by Marni Nixon) is its Juliet. Maria's fiery brother Bernardo (George Chakiris) combines the Lord Capulet and Tybalt roles. The film's ending has been praised for achieving the tragedy of Shakespeare's play without recourse to magic potions or fateful <b>bad</b> <b>timing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jeff Tweedy {{was invited}} to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, {{and was told that}} he could {{collaborate}} with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's <b>Bad</b> <b>Timing</b> album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments about how the album should sound between songs. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Jay Bennett around this time, believing (according to Jay Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Jay Bennett was a collective decision.|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} investigates if graduating {{in a bad}} economy scars careers of youth cohorts in terms of {{increased}} future unemployment and overrepresentation in fixed-term and involuntary part-time work. These dynamics of scarring are explored from a cross-country comparative perspective, focusing on the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Finland. These countries make up for interesting cases as they differ remarkably on institutional and economic dimensions such as for example the vocational orientation of their education systems, the strictness of employment protection legislation, active labour market policies to support job-search success of jobless young people and the general level of prevalent youth unemployment, which {{are assumed to be}} related to cross-nationally distinct patterns in scarring effects. The focus of the empirical analysis is on long-term effects of the level of aggregate youth unemployment at graduation on career evolvement of school-leaver cohorts over 12 years since their graduation, distinguishing between educational groups while allowing for gender effects. All in all we find that <b>bad</b> luck in <b>timing</b> of labour market entry can scar future careers over the long-run. A bad economy at labour market entry may thus be seen as a major risk factor for the future integration of youth cohorts in very different institutional contexts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} and quantifies {{the impact}} of cognitive errors in certain aspects of investor decision-making. One error is that investors are unaware that the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a biased indicator of expected terminal wealth for any dynamic strategy where the amount invested is systematically related to the returns made to date. This error leads investors to use Value Averaging (VA). This thesis demonstrates {{that this is an}} inefficient strategy, since alternative strategies can generate identical outturns with lower initial capital. Investors also wrongly assume that the lower average purchase cost which is achieved by Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) results in higher expected returns. DCA is a similarly inefficient strategy. Investors also adopt strategies such as Volatility Pumping, which appears to benefit from high asset volatility and large rebalancing trades. This thesis demonstrates that any increase in the expected geometric mean associated with rebalancing is likely to be due to reduced volatility drag, and that simpler strategies involving lower transactions costs {{are likely to be more}} profitable. Academic papers in highly-ranked journals similarly misinterpret the reduction in volatility drag achieved by rebalanced portfolios, mistakenly claiming that it results from the rebalancing trades “buying low and selling high”. The previously unidentified bias in the IRR has also affected an increasing number of academic studies, leading to misleadingly low estimates of the equity risk premium and exaggerated estimates of the losses resulting from <b>bad</b> investment <b>timing.</b> This thesis also derives a method for decomposing the differential between the GM return and the IRR into (i) the effects of this retrospective bias, and (ii) genuine effects of investor timing. Using this method I find that the low IRR on US equities is almost entirely due to this bias, and so should not lead us to revise down our estimates of the equity risk premium. This method has wider applications in fields where IRRs are used (e. g. mutual fund performance and project evaluation). In identifying these errors this thesis makes a contribution: (i) to the academic literature by correcting previous misleading results and improving research methods; (ii) to investment practitioners by identifying avoidable errors in investor decision-making. It also makes a contribution to the field of behavioural finance by altering the range of investor behaviour which should be seen as resulting from cognitive error rather than the pursuit of different objectives...|$|R
25|$|In April 1916 about 1,250 armed Irish {{republicans}} under Padraig Pearse staged {{what became}} known as the Easter Rising in Dublin in pursuit not of Home Rule but of an Irish Republic. One of the rebels' first acts was to declare this Republic to be in existence. The rebels were composed of Irish Volunteers and the much smaller Irish Citizen Army under James Connolly. The rising saw rebel forces take over strongpoints in the city, including the Four Courts, Stephen's Green, Boland's mill, the South Dublin Union and Jacobs Biscuit Factory and establishing their headquarters at the General Post Office building in O'Connell street. They held for a week until they were forced to surrender to British troops. The British deployed artillery to bombard the rebels into submission, sailing a gunboat named the Helga up the Liffey and stationing field guns at Cabra, Phibsborough and Prussia street. Much of the city centre was destroyed by shell fire and around 450 people, about half of them civilians, were killed, with another 1,500 injured. Fierce combat took place along the grand canal at Mount street, where British troops were repeatedly ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the rebellion was marked by a wave of looting and lawlessness by Dublin's slum population and many of the city centre's shops were ransacked. The rebel commander, Patrick Pearse surrendered after a week, to avoid further civilian casualties. Initially, the rebellion was generally unpopular in Dublin, due to the amount of death and destruction it caused, the opinion by some that it was <b>bad</b> <b>timing</b> to irreverently hold it at Easter and also due to the fact that many Dubliners had relatives serving in the British Army.|$|E

Despite the presence of personalities such as Maria Shriver and Maury Povich (who anchored briefly in the early 1980s), Eyewitness News stayed in the ratings basement. At this point, the station also produced news updates for USA Network, titled USA Updates; but during the changes later in 1991, production was moved over to Hubbard Broadcasting's All News Channel, where they were produced until 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Tweedy's musical {{style has}} varied over his music career. Tweedy's vocal style is {{considered}} nasal, emotional, and scratchy, {{and has been}} compared to that of Neil Young. His first exposure to music was through gramophone records that his siblings left behind when they attended college, and he particularly liked The Beatles' White Album. Tweedy would frequently read issues of magazines such as Rolling Stone, and began to purchase punk rock albums such as The Clash's London Calling and X's Wild Gift. Belleville crowds did not respond well to punk music, so while Tweedy was a member of The Primitives they played covers of country songs at much faster tempos. [...] When Uncle Tupelo formed, the band began composing its own songs influenced by Jason & the Scorchers and The Minutemen. Wilco's first album shared many musical similarities with the four previous Uncle Tupelo albums, but on Being There, Tweedy began introducing more experimental themes into his music. He claims that he wanted to rebel against the belief spread by the No Depression magazine that Wilco was primarily a country band. One of the most influential albums for Tweedy was <b>Bad</b> <b>Timing</b> by Jim O'Rourke, which helped to inspire Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born. Tweedy uses a 1957 Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar, as well as a 1965 Fender Jazzmaster, at least three different Telecasters, an Epiphone Casino, a Rickenbacker 360, and a Gibson SG Standard. He has vintage SGs from '62 and '65 as well as a 2007 Custom Shop model and a 2008 Custom Shop Vintage Original Spec (V.O.S.) that are all rigged with Maestro tremolo bars. He also has been known to use a Breedlove 000 and even designed a limited edition 000 for Breedlove in 2007. His amplifier of choice is a Vox AC30.|$|E
2500|$|Aqua {{commenced}} {{the recording}} of Megalomania {{at the beginning of}} 2010, scheduled for a release in the spring of 2011. Aqua released the album's lead single, [...] "How R U Doin?" [...] on 14 March 2011, after a preview of the song was posted onto the band's official Facebook page on 10 March 2011. Co-written by Thomas Troelsen, the song peaked at number four in Denmark, becoming the band's tenth top-ten single. It has since been certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for sales of 15,000 copies in Denmark. Aqua were originally set to release their third studio album on 14 July 2011, however the release was pushed back to 5 September 2011 with the record label citing <b>bad</b> <b>timing.</b> The album, titled Megalomania, was then further rescheduled to be released on 3 October 2011. On 7 September 2011 Aqua released a preview of their new single, [...] "Playmate to Jesus", on their official Facebook page, which was released on 12 September 2011. On 8 September 2011 it was announced that [...] "Like a Robot" [...] would also be released as a single on 12 September, and would battle against [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] in the charts. After the moderate chart success of Megalomania in Denmark, an expanded version of the band featuring all four original members (Lene Nystrøm Rasted, René Dif, Søren Rasted, Claus Norreen), plus new additions Niels Lykke Munksgaard Rasmussen (guitar) Frederik Thaae (bass) and Morten Hellborn (drums), toured Australia in March 2012. They initially announced six concerts but quickly added three additional shows to Melbourne, Sydney and Perth (Fremantle) due to popular demand. Aqua appeared on Sunrise, an Australian morning TV show on the Seven Network. They performed a slower tempo acoustic version of [...] "Barbie Girl" [...] and it was revealed that Lene had pneumonia, but the concerts would proceed as the group pride themselves on never having cancelled a show. They then appeared on the Seven Network's The Morning Show, performing [...] "Doctor Jones". After the tour, the band split again.|$|E
2500|$|Max has {{a history}} of cheating, which Inside Soap said would make him the most obvious person, but as he has {{recently}} reunited with his former wife Tanya Jessop (Jo Joyner), it would be the worst thing he could do. However, the magazine said that [...] "Max thrives on passion and deceipt, so getting it on with Kat behind Tanya's back would be consistent." [...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier). They said Kat's fiery personality would appeal to Max and [...] "he loves illicit liaisons with unsuitable partners". They felt he was bound to mess up his relationship with Tanya, but thought it would more likely be something else that would do that. Soaplife said Max was [...] "least likely even though he has the track record and the matching morals of an alley cat." [...] Actor Wood had previously promised a big storyline for Max, but Soaplife did not think this would be it. Soaplife later ruled out Max, asking [...] "why would he go for hamburger (Kat) when he has steak (Tanya) at home?" [...] All About Soap called Max a [...] "love rat", but doubted that he would cheat on Tanya again, but as it's Max, [...] "all bets are off {{when it comes to the}} bedroom", and said he was the second most likely suspect. In September 2012, Richie said he thought that Max was the most likely suspect, saying [...] "I think it's Max. You can't trust him!" [...] Wood stated that [...] "It would definitely be in keeping with Max for him to be having an affair. He's got a chequered history and women are his Achilles heel. So it would make a lot of sense for it to be him. It would be <b>bad</b> <b>timing,</b> though, because he's planning to get remarried!" ...|$|E
