25|$|On 21 September 1965 the Pentagon {{authorized}} MACSOG {{to begin}} cross-border operations within Laos in areas contiguous to the South Vietnam's western border. MACV had sought {{authority for the}} launching of such missions (Operation Shining Brass) since 1964 {{in an attempt to}} put <b>boots</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in a reconnaissance role to observe, first hand, the enemy logistical system known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese). MACV, through the Seventh Air Force, had begun carrying out strategic bombardment of the logistical system in southern Laos in April (Operation Steel Tiger) and had received authorization to launch an all-Vietnamese recon effort (Operation Leaping Lena) that had proven to be a disaster. U.S. troops were necessary and SOG was given the green light.|$|E

60|$|They had {{scarcely}} {{begun to}} walk before Honora, {{with a sense}} of dismay of which she was ashamed, beheld {{some of the people who}} had occupied her thoughts come out of the door and form a laughing group at the end of the porch. She could not rid herself of the feeling that they were laughing at her. She tried in vain to drive them from her mind, to listen to Mrs. Tyler's account of how she, too, came as a bride to New York from some place with a classical name, and to the advice that accompanied the narration. The most conspicuous young woman in the group, in riding clothes, was seated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railing, with the toe of one <b>boot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Her profile was clear-cut and her chestnut hair tightly knotted behind under her hat. Every time they turned, this young woman stared at Honora amusedly.|$|R
500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a pair of <b>boots</b> for work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> pilots for <b>the</b> use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|R

[...] He confirmed that [...] "the Iraq stuff and the Vietnam stuff is there by design", adding that he did not think that the film was anti-military. [...] Critic Charles Marowitz in Swans magazine remarked, however, that the realism of the suggested parallel with wars in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan [...] "doesn't quite jell" [...] because the natives are [...] "peace-loving and empathetic".|$|E
