50|$|Jimmy {{remains and}} Poirot tells him {{the case is}} solved. There is no such person as John Fraser as the letter and {{handkerchief}} were put there to misdirect the police. The <b>bottle</b> in the <b>bin</b> was a ruse by Poirot; it contained ethyl chloride to knock Donovan briefly unconscious. While Jimmy was getting the drink for his friend, Poirot searched Donovan's pockets to find Pat's missing flat key which Donovan had abstracted {{earlier in the evening}} and a letter sent to Mrs Grant which arrived by the late evening post. Poirot thought it odd that the light switch in the kitchen did not work then did work minutes later. Donovan needed to get Jimmy out of the kitchen into the other room whilst he found the letter; the light not working was the ruse to gain him the few minutes he needed before the mistake of being in the wrong flat was obvious to Jimmy.|$|R
