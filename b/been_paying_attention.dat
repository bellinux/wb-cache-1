500|$|.....as I {{began to}} research, even I, {{as someone who}} had <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to {{alternative}} explanations, even I was fairly astonished when I put it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna first {{performed}} [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] on American Idol on April 7, 2010. She {{wore a black}} PVC catsuit and {{was accompanied}} on stage by guitarist Nuno Bettencourt; the set design included flame throwers and a video screen which showed guitars, lightning bolts and skulls. At one point, the singer picked and played up a black Gibson Flying V guitar. Larry Carroll for MTV wrote that the extent of Rihanna's ability to play the guitar was limited to playing it with one finger {{on one of the}} strings. However, he complimented Rihanna's overall performance, writing that her shoulder pads were [...] "nearly as huge as her presence". He went on to write that she [...] "half-sung, half-spoke" [...] the song. A reviewer for MTV UK agreed with Carroll, writing that [...] "halfway through the performance [...] donned a 'black flying v guitar' although we're not sure you could say she 'played' it!" [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone praised Rihanna's performance, writing [...] "if the introductory rules of rock stardom are 'teach thyself to pick slide,' 'tight clothes' and 'pyro!' then Rihanna has <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> in her 'Rockstar 101' classes after all".|$|E

500|$|Diefenbaker {{suggested}} {{to the jury}} that the silence on the line which had, he contended, swallowed the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] might {{have been caused by}} a fish dropped on a snow-covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence. He noted in his memoirs that the incident [...] "was not well documented, but it was all we had". He blamed the disaster on Tisdale, stating that lack of the word [...] "at" [...] before [...] "Gosnell" [...] in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention,</b> and that he should have noticed that, according to Diefenbaker, the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] were missing from Atherton's repeat of the order. The trial had taken four days; the lawyers argued for five hours; Diefenbaker's summation took three of them. Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury. McFarlane told the jurors that if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor Mainprize in the same form he had received it, they would be justified in acquitting him. The jury returned after 40minutes of deliberations. Jury foreman Fred Mounkley announced the acquittal of Atherton, as Atherton's mother wept.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Caryn Grant {{wrote that}} [...] "the album {{is at its}} strongest when Madonna shoves {{everyone}} {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight. So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> for years".|$|E
500|$|Upon her introduction, Chloe was {{received}} positively by audiences. Soap Opera Weekly praised the character, stating, [...] "What {{started as a}} 10-episode arc as a bitchy stylist transformed into a meaty contract character and an even meatier storyline for Elizabeth Hendrickson." [...] The magazine also considered Chloe the [...] "complex Genoa City bad girl", and observed that [...] "viewers aren't exactly loving Chloe" [...] for driving a wedge between the popular pairing of Cane and Lily. Speaking of the character's pregnancy, Allison Waldman of TV Squad was unconvinced of Chloe's schemes regarding the child's paternity, writing, [...] "I'm having doubts about Chloe's bun in the oven. She claims that Cane's the father, based on one drunken night in a car that he has blacked out of his memory. Chloe's hardly a reliable source, especially since it's just been revealed that she's Kate, Esther's daughter. Yes, Esther, Kay's maid for the last 20 years or so. Cane's had DNA tests done, but they only prove {{he could be the}} baby's father. Watch, this baby {{is going to have an}} interesting back story." [...] Carolyn Hinsey of the New York Daily News said Chloe's backstory reveal was a [...] "shock" [...] to fans and in light of her pregnancy wrote, [...] "Anyone who thinks Chloe's lies are over hasn't <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention.</b> Is the baby even Cane's?" [...] Jillian Bowe of Zap2it credited the character as a [...] "quirky fashion diva", and penned the reunion between Chloe and Esther [...] "long overdue".|$|E

500|$|In the Zone {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. It holds {{a score of}} sixty-six out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on thirteen critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Jason Shawhan of About.com gave a positive review, saying that while the album's vibe is sexy, {{the result is a}} personal statement from Spears. He also added, [...] "T's another thing about Spears' new record, as none of her previous albums ever managed to produce any kind of sustained emotional response than the pleasure that comes from a good pop record. I miss Max Martin, for sure, but it feels like Ms. S. has <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> to La Ciccone. To put it another way, this is Britney's True Blue." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album [...] " [...] all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern—it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums." [...] Ruth Mitchell of BBC Online called [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] the best track of the album, but added, [...] "Sadly, her attempts to prove her new-found maturity are what overwhelm and cloud all that is good about In The Zone." [...] Mim Udovitch of Blender commented, [...] "This I’m-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin [...] No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] the best and most straightforward moments of the album, but added that [...] "On a CD intended to celebrate her lurch into adulthood, Spears remains distant and submerged. For all her freedom, she's still finding her way." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Erotica" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic highlighted the song as an album standout, calling it [...] "some of Madonna's {{best and most}} accomplished music". Rolling Stones [...] Arion Berger wrote: [...] "'Erotica' [...] promise a smorgasbord of sexual experimentation, like the one portrayed in the video for 'Justify My Love'. But the sensibility of 'Erotica' is miles removed from the warm come-ons of 'Justify', which got its heat from privacy and romance [...] The Madonna of 'Erotica' {{is in no way}} interested in your dreams; she's after compliance"; he called the song [...] "'Vogue' with a dirty mouth, where all the real action's on the dance floor". [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times, commented that the [...] "foggy growl" [...] that Madonna uses in the spoken-word sections of the song [...] "contrast dramatically with the shrill little-kid voice from Madonna's earliest records that she still often uses to project a bratty teen-age exuberance". J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , wrote that [...] " [...] wasn't a surprise for anyone who had <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> to Madonna's recent music. She had shown her hand earlier with Breathless when she sang 'Hanky Panky', the song about spanking [...] then there was her single 'Justify My Love' [...] 'Erotica' though, was the full-blown music exploration, an exhibition, of what we were to believe was Madonna's sexual reality". Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson, called it [...] "a bondage update on 'Justify My Love'". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post, placed it at number 23 of his list [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles"; Jacobs wrote [...] "Released at the apex of Madonna's sex appeal, 'Erotica' and its accompanying title album are remarkable as a period of innovation for the singer".|$|E

2500|$|Outside of patch notes, Hello Games had {{effectively}} gone {{silent on}} social media right after the game's release up until {{the announcement of the}} Foundation update in late November 2016. Murray, who used the Hello Games' Twitter account with some frequency before release, had not been visible online for the first two months following the game's release. In the announcement of this update, Hello Games admitted to being [...] "quiet" [...] but have <b>been</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> to the various criticisms levelled at the game. [...] Schreier from Kotaku and Ben Kuchera of Polygon commented that some of the negative player reaction was {{due to a lack of}} clarification on these apparently missing features from either Hello Games or Sony in the weeks just after release, with Kuchera further stating that with the silence from either company, [...] "the loudest, most negative voices are shouting unopposed" [...] and leading to a strong negative perception of the game. Kuchera later wrote that many of the issues in the lead-up and follow-up to No Man's Skys release, whether by choice or happenstance, provide many lessons on the importance of proper public relations. Kuchera specifically pointed to the decision to withhold review copies and an apparent lack of public relations (PR) to manage statements relating to what features would be in the game. Kuchera also noted that many people had taken the hype generated by the press only to be disappointed by the final game, and that consumers did have ways to evaluate the game following its release before they purchased the title. Sony president Shuhei Yoshida admitted that Hello Games did not have [...] "a great PR strategy" [...] for No Man's Sky, in part for lacking a dedicated PR staff to manage expectations, but still support the developers as they continue to patch and update the game. Jesse Signal, writing for the Boston Globe noted that some of the hype for No Man's Sky may be attributed to game journalists themselves for getting too excited about the game, positing [...] "Had journalists asked certain questions at certain times, perhaps it would have been more difficult for Hello Games to make promises it couldn’t deliver on." ...|$|E
