40|$|The {{connection}} between column and deck-box on a semi-submersible platform is often subjected to high stress concentrations {{that can be}} governing for the structural strength. One common design used to withstand the high stresses is a cast integral in high tensile material, which is both heavy and expensive to manufacture, which is why an alternative cut-out design is investigated. This thesis aims at analysing the current node connection, with a finite element analysis (FEA), with regard to yield stresses, buckling, fatigue damage, weight and cost in order to propose an alternative cut-out design using the same criteria. The cast integral, which is analysed as a reference case and used for comparison of designs, is of a typical design used by GVA Consultants AB. The alternative cut-out design is first studied in a simplified two-dimensional (2 D) case, developed with applied loads and boundary conditions following recommendations from the classification society DNV-GL. Different geometrical cut-out shapes used in other applications are tested and evaluated. The cut-out design with the lowest yield stresses is implemented and further evaluated in {{a case study of}} a complete semisubmersible production platform. The cut-out design is investigated with a parametric study for the complete loading condition, which is defined from previous calculations performed by GVA. The cut-out is analysed with both the simplified fatigue assessment and with a stochastic approach, in order to investigate differences and inaccuracies in the methods. The parametric study shows that the use of a cut-out design may be advantageous in the centre <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connection</b> between the column and the deck-box. The adjacent geometry is of simple character and the cut-out does not affect the overall structural design. The cut-out is found to be a feasible alternative to the cast integral, with yield stresses and fatigue damage in the same range. Further refinements of the cut-out design could, however, decrease both yield stresses and fatigue damage, which is why the cutout is recommended in future work. The suggested cut-out solution leads to a decrease of 4. 5 % in weight for a reference structure. For the same reference structure the production cost is estimated to decrease by 9. 5 %, hence, the cut-out design is recommended for the centre <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connection.</b> However, it is concluded that the cut-out design is only developed for one specific semisubmersible platform in specific load conditions, for which reason further analysis and adjustments are needed for other applications and structures...|$|R

Due to this variety, many researchers have developed a model to predict {{the performance of the}} CLT panel (Okabe et al. [4], Oh et al. [5]). Also because there are very varied connections, several models to predict the shear performance of CLT shear wall connection have been developed. Filiatrault and Folz [6] applied a kinematic model for seismic design of wood frame building. FPInnovations and Binational Softwood Lumber Council [7] described a kinematic model, in which the performance of the CLT wall could be predicted by the properties of connection under the assumption that the CLT panel is a rigid body.

40|$|Many ageing road bridges, {{particularly}} timber bridges, require urgent improvement due to {{the demand}} imposed by the recent version of the Australian bridge loading code, AS 5100. As traffic volume {{plays a key role}} in the decision of budget allocations for bridge refurbishment/ replacement, many bridges in low volume traffic network remain in poor condition with axle load and/ or speed restrictions, thus disadvantaging many rural communities. This thesis examines an economical and environmentally sensible option of incorporating disused flat rail wagons (FRW) in the construction of bridges in low volume, high axle load road network. The constructability, economy and structural adequacy of the FRW road bridge is reported in the thesis with particular focus of a demonstration bridge commissioned in regional Queensland. The demonstration bridge comprises of a reinforced concrete slab (RCS) pavement resting on two FRWs with custom designed <b>connection</b> <b>brackets</b> at regular intervals along the span of the bridge. The FRW-RC bridge deck assembly is supported on elastomeric rubber pads resting on the abutment. As this type of bridge replacement technology is new and its structural design is not covered in the design standards, the in-service structural performance of the FRW bridge subjected to the high axle loadings prescribed in AS 5100 is examined through performance load testing. Both the static and the moving load tests are carried out using a fully laden commonly available three-axle tandem truck. The bridge deck is extensively strain gauged and displacement at several key locations is measured using linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs). A high speed camera is used in the performance test and the digital image data are analysed using proprietary software to capture the locations of the wheel positions on the bridge span accurately. The wheel location is thus synchronised with the displacement and strain time series to infer the structural response of the FRW bridge. Field test data are used to calibrate a grillage model, developed for further analysis of the FRW bridge to various sets of high axle loads stipulated in the bridge design standard. Bridge behaviour predicted by the grillage model has exemplified that the live load stresses of the FRW bridge is significantly lower than the yield strength of steel and the deflections are well below the serviceability limit state set out in AS 5100. Based on the results reported in this thesis, it is concluded that the disused FRWs are competent to resist high axle loading prescribed in AS 5100 and are a viable alternative structural solution of bridge deck in the context of the low volume road networks...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{connection}} are generally {{considered in the}} design of steel structures in practice. These are classified as completely rigid (fixed) and simple (pin) connections. In theory, completely rigid connections cannot undergo rotation and simple connections cannot transfer moment. Nevertheless, in reality, rigid connections have a relative flexibility which makes them to rotate and simple connections have some reserve capacity to transfer moments. However, in an effort {{to increase the amount of}} data on the rotational stiffness of top and seat angle available to researchers, this thesis presents the modeled and non linear analysis of different theoretical top and seat angle connections. The finite element modeling software, ABAQUS, is used to create moment-rotation curves for these theoretical connections such as top and seat angle <b>connection</b> with <b>bracket</b> and top and seat angle connection with gusset plate. To demonstrate finite element modeling’s ability to accurately predict the response of the theoretical connections, the results of several experiments performed on top and seat connections are reproduced in ABAQUS. The result of this study shows that initial stiffness of top and seat angle connection increased when attached bracket or gusset plate in connection zone. It is also found that this type of connection can be classified as rigid connection...|$|R

A simple beam idealisation that accounts for the semi-rigidity of the joints in a frame analysis is described and verified using a combination of finite element shell analysis and laboratory tests. The efficiency of the proposed frame is compared to that of an equivalent rigid-jointed frame, including consideration of serviceability requirements and practical site constraints {{on the size of the}} brackets and number of bolts used for the joints. For certain combinations of frame geometry and imposed loading such frames are shown to provide very competitive alternatives to conventional rigid jointed hot-rolled steel construction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 A {{standard}} tool {{in general}} relativity is the 3 + 1 or ADM point of view, namely slicing spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces of constant {{time and then}} describing physics in terms of time-dependent quantities on a typical such hypersurface. Much less well-known is the 1 + 3 point of view, in which one foliates spacetime with timelike curves, then describes physics {{in terms of the}} surfaces "locally orthogonal" to the given foliation. This is precisely the description of physics as seen by a single observer. However, in many instances there do not exist such orthogonal hypersurfaces. One may instead attempt to describe physics on the manifold of orbits defined by the timelike curves, but one must then develop a parametric theory to handle the time dependent objects defined on the manifold of orbits. I will present two equivalent descriptions of parametric manifolds. The first is based on a generalized Gauss-Codazzi formalism which involves projection to a lower-dimensional "surface". The second is an intrinsic description which involves redefining the action of vector fields on functions. In either description one is lead to generalized notions of <b>connections,</b> Lie <b>bracket,</b> and exterior differentiation. Unique to a parametric theory of geometry is the deficiency. Although independent of the torsion, the deficiency behaves like torsion in the parametric direction. We will show how the deficiency emerges {{as a result of the}} above generalizations. The 3 + 1 formalism arises naturally in considering initial-value formulations both for fields on a fixed background spacetime and for the spacetime itself. The applicability of parametric manifolds to such problems will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the descent}} {{equation}} in string theory, we give a new interpretation for {{the action of}} the symmetry charges on the BRST cohomology {{in terms of what we}} call the Gerstenhaber bracket. This bracket is compatible with the graded commutative product in cohomology, and hence gives rise to a new class of examples of what mathematicians call a Gerstenhaber algebra. The latter structure was first discussed in the context of Hochschild cohomology theory [11]. Off-shell in the (chiral) BRST complex, all the identities of a Gerstenhaber algebra hold up to homotopy. Applying our theory to the c= 1 model, we give a precise conceptual description of the BRST-Gerstenhaber algebra of this model. We are led to a direct <b>connection</b> between the <b>bracket</b> structure here and the anti-bracket formalism in BV theory [29]. We then discuss the bracket in string backgrounds with both the left and the right movers. We suggest that the homotopy Lie algebra arising from our Gerstenhaber bracket is closely related to the HLA recently constructed by Witten-Zwiebach. Finally, we show that our constructions generalize to any topological conformal field theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to reevaluate and improve the existing cable-to-post attachment hardware that is utilized in the non-proprietary cable barrier being developed at MwRSF. The study focused on redesigning the bolted, tabbed bracket (V 10) to eliminate the bolt, reduce the number of components per bracket, eliminate the need for tools during installation, and reduce the number of small parts. Three attachment concepts were selected for evaluation through dynamic testing: (1) the key plate attachment; (2) the wire lock pin attachment; and (3) the pinned back attachment. Each attachment prototype was subjected to two vertical and two lateral dynamic component tests to evaluate the release loads and fracture mechanisms of the brackets. Test results were compared to previous tests on the bolted tabbed bracket (V 10). None of the three bracket attachment designs were found to satisfy all of the design criteria for an alternative bracket. The lack of fixity in the <b>connection</b> between the <b>brackets</b> and the post led to a variable position of the tabs within the keyway which frequently caused unsatisfactory release loads.

40|$|Over {{the past}} six years, to {{increase}} the use of renewable materials in the construction industry, a novel steel-timber hybrid building system was developed and studied at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations. The hybrid structural system was a steel moment resisting frames (SMRFs) with Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) infill walls. These studies were mainly on developing: novel connection types, new constitutive laws for the CLT walls, and force-based and displacement-based design guidelines. The effect of CLT infills on the collapse risk of the SMRFs was not explicitly investigated, and is the topic of this paper. With consideration of seismicity of Vancouver (Canada) and using the 2010 National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) force based design guideline, 3 - and 6 -storey, 3 -bay, bare and middle bay CLT-infilled SMRFs, were designed. Nonlinear analytical building models that account for the frame-infill interactions, were developed in the OpenSees finite element tool. L-shaped steel <b>bracket</b> <b>connections</b> were modeled using experimentally calibrated nonlinear two-node-link elements. Moreover, to allow brackets deformation, a small gap was provided at the interface of the steel frame members and CLT infill panels.

Partial strength connection is a connection whereby the moment resistance of the connection is less than that of the moment capacity of the connected beam. In this paper, Numerical simulation is conducted by using ANSYS Workbench 14. 0 in order to predict the structural behaviors of cold formed steel partial strength connection. The objective of this study is to develop moment rotation curve for flange-web-cleat connection using double channel cold formed steel section under monotonic loading.

40|$|In {{terms of}} seismic performance, timber {{structures}} {{have been observed}} to perform well, in spite of timber being an inherently non-ductile material. This is due mainly to the ductility of the steel-to-timber connections, {{and the way in}} which they interact with the timber material. If these connections are detailed to deform plastically, while keeping the timber members elastic, the overall structure achieves ductility. For nailed sheathing-to-framing shear walls and floor diaphragms, the New Zealand structural timber code, NZS 3603 : 1993 [1] allows ductilities of up to four to be assumed. The issue with such an approach is that in a design level earthquake, the deformations required to achieve ductility often renders the structure irreparable, or at least requiring expensive repairs. Recent developments in engineered lumber products have seen the availability of mass timber panels of tremendous strength and stiffness. These include CLT (cross laminated timber) and LVL (laminated veneer lumber) panels. Under typical loading conditions these panels are essentially rigid, and the experiments of Popovski and Karacabeyli [2] demonstrate that the hysteretic behaviour is largely governed by the plastic deformations in the steel <b>bracket</b> <b>connections</b> attaching the walls to the floor. The hysteretic loops bear some resemblance to those of sheathing to framing shear walls, the main difference being they are more tightly pinched.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we have shown}} {{precisely}} that the curvature of a 2 -sphere introduces quantum features in the system through {{the introduction of the}} noncommutative (NC) parameter that appeared naturally via equations of motion. To obtain this result we used the fact that quantum mechanics can be understood as a NC symplectic geometry, which generalized the standard description of classical mechanics as a symplectic geometry. In this work, we have also analyzed the dynamics of the model of a free particle over a 2 -sphere in a NC phase-space. Besides, we have shown the solution of the equations of motion allows one to show the equivalence between the movement of the particle physical degrees of freedom upon a 2 -sphere and the one described by a central field. We have considered the effective force felt by the particle as being caused by the curvature of the space. We have analyzed the NC Poisson algebra of classical observables in order to obtain the NC corrections to Newton's second law. We have demonstrated precisely that the curvature of the space acted as an effective potential for a free particle in a flat phase-space. Besides, through NC coherent states quantization we have obtained the Green function of the theory. The result have confirmed that we have an UV cutoff for large momenta in the NC kernel. We have also discussed the relation between affine <b>connection</b> and Dirac <b>brackets,</b> as they describe the proper evolution of the model over the surface of constraints in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, respectively. As an application, we have treated the so-called Zitterbewegung of the Dirac electron.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the interim structural {{analysis of a}} redesigned Ice/Frost Ramp bracket for the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET). The proposed redesigned bracket consists of mounts for attachment to the ET wall, supports for the electronic/instrument cables and propellant repressurization lines that run along the ET, an upper plate, a lower plate, and complex bolted connections. The eight nominal bolted connections are considered critical in the summarized structural analysis. Each bolted connection contains a bolt, a nut, four washers, and a non-metallic spacer and block that are designed for thermal insulation. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model of the bracket is developed using solid 10 -node tetrahedral elements. The loading provided by the ET Project {{is used in the}} analysis. Because of the complexities associated with accurately modeling the bolted <b>connections</b> in the <b>bracket,</b> the analysis is performed using a global/local analysis procedure. The finite element analysis of the bracket identifies one of the eight bolted connections as having high stress concentrations. A local area of the bracket surrounding this bolted connection is extracted from the global model and used as a local model. Within the local model, the various components of the bolted connection are refined, and contact is introduced along the appropriate interfaces determined by the analysts. The deformations from the global model are applied as boundary conditions to the local model. The results from the global/local analysis show that while the stresses in the bolts are well within yield, the spacers fail due to compression. The primary objective of the interim structural analysis is to show concept viability for static thermal testing. The proposed design concept would undergo continued design optimization to address the identified analytical assumptions and concept shortcomings, assuming successful thermal testing...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the trends}} in ship {{building}} is {{the building of}} larger and faster ships. However, increasing demand for speed has forced the ship designers to search for alternative materials to reduce {{the weight of the}} ship without compromising strength. Aluminium alloys, once properly designed, can achieve this goal by reducing the weight of structural components by over 50 % compared to those made of normal carbon steel. Another advantage of aluminium alloys is that its corrosion resistance. In a sea environment, steel has been found to corrode about 100 times faster than aluminium alloys under the same corrosive environment. As the size of aluminium ship increases, fatigue {{has become one of the}} main design criteria. In order to effectively make use of the high strength/weight ratio of aluminium alloys, the cross section of the structural components as well as the joint design should be optimized to provide sufficient fatigue strength while still maintain acceptable fabrication cost. Extruded hollow stiffeners have been proven to be able to provide excellent light and stiff panels for aluminium ships. Box stiffener is such a cross section profile investigated in the present study. The box stiffener is usually oriented longitudinally by interacting with a large number of web frames by fillet welds. These welded joints may be exposed to larger fatigue damage due to its significant stress variations experienced during the service of the ships. In addition, welding of these joints is quite costly since there are a lage amount of them and it is difficult to apply automatic welding due to complex profile. Any simplification in the welding procedure would cause a significant benefit to the ship builders. Three similar web frame/box stiffener connections are considered in these studies, by varying the opening shape on the web fame and accordingly the welding procedure. The objective is to achieve sufficient fatigue strength while still maintaining an economically efficient joint. The first connection (denoted as Alt- 1) tries to make a relatively larger opening on the web frame for easy assembling and more space for welding. The second and third alternatives (denoted as Alt- 2 and Alt- 3) are identical in the opening on the web frame while differs on welding procedure only. Interrupted welding is performed for Alt- 2 to save both the human resource and weld material while continuous welding is required for Alt- 3 for a simple welding procedure. Alt- 3 also provides a water tight solution due to the continuous welding. It is found that the change of cutting shapes on the web frame as well as the corresponding weld procedure has great impact on both the static and fatigue properties of the joints. Extra welding around the web frame may cause a high stress concentration at the weld toe and therefore imply an unacceptable fatigue damage. However, a simple weld can be a good candidate to achieve sufficient fatigue strength. Butt weld is usually used to join two pre-fabricated units to obtain sufficient overall strength of the joined single piece structure. However, difficulty may arise for such units when the box stiffeners are presented as the longitudinal stiffeners due to relatively large shrinkage and distortion introduced in the fabrication process including welding in the adjacent area. A special type of lap joint, denoted as box stiffener lap joint is designed to provide a joining solution for the box stiffeners. By enabling the inside profile of the lapping plate to be identical to the outside profile of the box stiffener, the joining of two box stiffeners is just to weld the intersection lines between the lapping plate and box stiffener. Only the wide flanges of the box stiffener require a conventional weld. Cracking from the weld root should be avoided to ensure sufficient fatigue strength. Good fatigue performance is observed for the box stiffener lap joint. The weld leg length is found to be a determining factor that affects both the fatigue strength and fatigue crack initiation site. Weld leg length between 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm is suggested to avoid high stress concentration at the weld toe. Moreover, this design reduces the likelihood of fatigue cracks to initiate from the most complex manual welding area. Information about fatigue analysis of welded aluminium structures is quite limited in the open literature. This thesis deals with fatigue assessment methods of welded aluminium plate structures based on both numerical analysis and experimental tests. Various stress based fatigue assessment methods such as the nominal, structural and notch stress approaches have been applied to the investigated joints. The nominal stress range approach can not provide a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength of novel welded joints because the local geometrical details including structural geometry and weld geometry are implicitly embedded in the nominal design SN curves. Laboratory tests would hence be needed to establish nominal stress approaches. More refined local approaches including the structural stress range approach and the notch stress range approach have been developed for a more accurate assessment of the fatigue strength. The main challenge for these local approaches is to find suitable stress calculation methods in the vicinity of the weld and thereby the uncertainties that determine the fatigue strength of the joint can be quantitatively reflected in a local stress concentration factor. Several of these methods are applied in the study of novel types of welded aluminium joints in this thesis. The choice of design SN curves must be consistent with the way by which the design stress range is calculated. Fatigue test data support the use of a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 40 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium fillet welded in-plane <b>bracket</b> <b>connections</b> when the structural stress has been derived from the extrapolation methods. It has been shown that a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 44 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium lap joints can be used. Another important issue is to investigate the effect of the local weld geometry such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius, and weld leg length on the value of the structural/notch stress and accordingly on fatigue behaviour. The weld parameters of the joints have been measured in the laboratory and the statistical measured values are used in the numerical finite element models (FEM). Improving fatigue strength of critical joints is found to be necessary late in the design process or during the service time of a structure to extend the whole service life of the structure. The effect of weld toe grinding on the stress concentration at the weld toe is studied by finite element analysis (FEA). Fatigue tests show that the fatigue life in terms of number of cycles to failure is nearly doubled by simply grinding the weld toe of the joint. However, the standard deviations are not so much affected as the fatigue strength. The effect of weld parameters such as the grinding depth has been found to play a decisive role in fatigue life improvement. </p...|$|R
