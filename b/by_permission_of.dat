5|$|To aid in his {{ministry}} to the Jewish people, Jesus {{was given the}} ability to perform miracles, <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> God rather than by his own power. Through {{his ministry}}, Jesus {{is seen as a}} precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, owing to various causes {{such as the}} {{mitigation}} of the rule—either <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the pope, or through a lessening of fervour, but chiefly because of the Plague and the Great Western Schism—discipline became relaxed in the Augustinian monasteries; and so reformers emerged who were anxious to restore it. These reformers were themselves Augustinians and instituted several reformed congregations, each having its own vicar-general (vicarius-generalis), but all {{under the control of}} the general of the order.|$|E

500|$|One {{method of}} paying for the {{construction}} and maintenance of city walls was a tax called murage, usually levied <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the king on particular goods being imported into a city. In Worcester, murage was raised to support work on the walls during three main phases, [...] 1224 to 1239, 1252 to 1310 and 1364 to 1411. Worcester was attacked again during the Second Barons' War in the 1260s, and the records suggest {{that some of the}} murage payments were used to repair damage caused by that attack. In the late 14th century a watergate was built in the western walls of the city, close to a slipway for launching boats. Worcester's last murage grant occurred in 1439, although in 1459 Henry VI allowed the city to use stones from the castle to repair the walls to defend the city in anticipation of a Yorkist attack during the Wars of the Roses. As in many other English towns and cities, as the medieval period progressed, housing began to encroach on the city walls in Worcester.|$|E
