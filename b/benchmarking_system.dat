However, VWSA itself questions the reliability of these figures. In some cities, non-revenue water is as high as 75%.

In 1998 the Federal Ministry of Education and Research initiated a competition of ideas to reduce the costs of water supply together with the economic research institute RWI and 14 water utilities. It developed a set of criteria to assess strengths and weaknesses in the industry. Participating utilities say that they reduced their operating costs by about 5 percent after two to three years. The professional associations DVGW and DWA have jointly established a voluntary <b>benchmarking</b> <b>system,</b> which keeps individual company data confidential.

It {{is in charge of}} projects with private sector participation. It has also carried out major investment projects such as the water loss reduction program in Amman and has regulated the private operator in Amman from 1999 to 2006. The PMU was supposed to be an embryonic unit for a future semi-autonomous water regulatory agency for the entire country, to be established by law outside of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. As a step in that direction, a Water Sector Audit Unit (WSAU) was established in the PMU in May 2008. The unit has set up a <b>benchmarking</b> <b>system</b> using performance indicators that have initially been applied to the Aqaba Water Company and Miyahuna.

For each benchmark, the modelling guidelines are provided, along with eigenvalues and time-domain results produced {{with at least two}} simulation software, and one possible control approach is provided for each system as well.

3000|$|It {{is clear}} from Figure 6 that augmenting a {{cellular}} network with femto-cell deployment yields tremendous capacity gains over the <b>benchmark</b> <b>system.</b> These gains are attributed to two reasons. First, in the <b>benchmark</b> <b>system,</b> all former femto UEs are served by the outdoor eNB, where high wall penetration losses result in a highly attenuated signal. The second reason {{is that in the}} <b>benchmark</b> <b>system,</b> all UEs must share the macro resources, so that each UE is assigned fewer RBs compared to the case with femto-cell deployment. For four apartment blocks per sector (Figure 6 (a)), with each apartment having a 10 % probability of containing an active HeNB, each sector contains, on average, ten femto UEs in addition to the ten macro UEs. This means that in the <b>benchmark</b> <b>system,</b> each macro UE is allocated half the number of RBs in comparison to the system with femto-cell deployment. The situation is obviously worsened in the 14 grid per sector case, as shown in Figure 6 (b). This is also responsible for the <b>benchmark</b> <b>system</b> showing the highest outage. In this context, a UE goes into outage if the achieved SINR on all RBs is less than [...]...|$|R

A Membrex <b>Benchmark</b> <b>System</b> with either a 100 kD or a 0. 45 -mu-m filter and a large-scale Pacesetter System with a 100 kD filter were used. The <b>Benchmark</b> <b>System</b> is ideal for processing 100 ml to 50 l of water, while the Pacesetter is designed for working with volumes from 20 l up to hundreds of liters. The <b>Benchmark</b> <b>System</b> with a 100 kD filter yielded an average recovery of 81. 7, 83. 3 and 80. 5 % respectively for particulate DNA, chlorophyll a and bacteria. The efficiency of recovery with the Pacesetter System was 38. 0, 38. 1 and 43. 6 % respectively for particulate DNA, chlorophyll a, and bacteria.
