5000|$|In March 2005, Paterson and Mikes {{joined with}} bass guitarist Sean Jacobs and keyboardist Dave Rudin to form <b>Brownline</b> Fiasco. Prior to the {{formation}} of <b>Brownline</b> Fiasco, Jacobs and Rudin played together in a local cover-band. In preparation for their first album, lead guitarist Michael Danz was added in 2006. Guitarist Sean Fried replaced Danz in 2009 and played with the band until early 2011. [...] In late 2011, Jonny Untch joined the band as the new lead guitarist.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{formally}} {{changed its}} name from <b>Brownline</b> Fiasco to HiFi Superstar in May 2009. [...] Under the name HiFi Superstar, the band has played with such performers as Missing Persons, Tommy Tutone, Stryper, Cheap Trick, and American Idols' Bo Bice ...|$|E
40|$|Seven field {{populations of}} Xiphinema americanum sensu lato from California's major agronomic areas were tested {{for their ability}} to {{transmit}} two nepoviruses, including the prune <b>brownline,</b> peach yellow bud, and grapevine yellow vein strains of tomato ringspot virus and the bud blight strain of tobacco ringspot virus. Two field populations transmitted all isolates, one population transmitted all tomato ringspot virus isolates but failed to transmit bud blight strain of tobacco ringspot virus, and the remaining four populations failed to transmit any virus. Only one population, which transmitted all isolates, bad been associated with field spread of a nepovirus. As two California populations of Xiphinema americanum sensu lato were shown {{to have the ability to}} vector two different nepoviruses, a nematode taxonomy based on a parsimony of virus-vector relationship is not practical for these populations. Because two California populations of X. americanum were able to vector tobacco ringspot virus, commonly vectored by X. americanum in the eastern United States, these western populations cannot be differentiated from eastern populations by vector capability tests using tobacco ringspot virus...|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 21-35 mm. The forewings of the males are brown with scattered yellow scales and with a small black discal spot.Females have a yellow costal band on the forewings {{and there is no}} discal spot. The male hindwings are yellowish white with two longitudinal, <b>brownlines.</b> The female hindwings are yellowish white, with some veins tinged with light brown. Adults have been recorded on wing from April to September and in December.|$|R
