The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E

His systems management experience {{served him well}} in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|Peart's next book, Far and Away: A Prize Every Time, was {{published}} by ECW Press in May 2011. This book, which he worked on for two years, is based around his travelling in North and South America. It tells how he found in a Brazilian town a unique combination of West African and Brazilian music. In 2014, a follow-up book, Far and Near: On Days like These, {{was published}} by ECW. It covers travels in North America and Europe. Another book, Far and Wide: <b>Bring</b> <b>That</b> Horizon to Me!, was published in 2016 {{and is based on}} his travels between stops on the R40 Live Tour of 2015.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were {{replaced}} with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As {{part of the}} transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining aircrew were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No.1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement aircrew were posted from No.2 Squadron. The squadron suffered a number of accidents during the next two years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No.6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No.2 Squadron to <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> unit up to its full strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No.6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in South Vietnam.|$|E

He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into.
