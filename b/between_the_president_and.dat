5|$|On November 16, 1923, Edwards {{wrote to}} Bascom Slemp, {{secretary}} to President Calvin Coolidge (the previous president, Warren G. Harding, had recently died). Edwards arranged a meeting <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> himself, association president Hollins N. Randolph (an Atlanta lawyer and direct descendant of early president Thomas Jefferson), and Borglum. President Coolidge agreed to support authorizing legislation for a Stone Mountain coin.|$|E
5|$|In late September 2010, the Supreme Court {{considered}} removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry {{met with}} his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1969, Kouandété accused Alley of {{plotting}} to kidnap and murder him. Facing the death penalty, Alley {{was sentenced to}} ten years of hard labor at an open trial held on October 4. Zinsou had intervened for Alley, and it strained relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> Kouandété. The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10. In the aftermath, Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army. In July 1968, he was named Secretary General of National Defence. Kouandété ended up becoming Alley's adjutant.|$|E

5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia and the Government {{cooperate}} {{in the formulation}} and implementation of Croatia's foreign policy. This provision of the constitution is an occasional source of conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> the government. The president decides on the establishment of diplomatic missions and consular offices of the Republic of Croatia abroad, at the Government's proposal and with the countersignature of the prime minister. The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Croatia, at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives letters of credence and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.|$|E
5|$|The Presidency was {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. The Presidency was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Prime Minister. The Presidency was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E

He also worked with fellow Representative Alma Adams, a Democrat from North Carolina, to start an internship program for students from HBCUs. He is supportive of criminal justice reform initiatives, and has called for a shift in Republican approach to this issue.|$|R
5000|$|Patapievici {{has also}} {{occasionally}} come under criticism from political detractors and from opponents of President Băsescu, {{with whom he}} has long had a good relationship. An example of this was in 2007 when Patapievici defended Băsescu when the parliament had begun an impeachment procedure against <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> Patavievici blamed <b>the</b> disagreements <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> <b>and</b> prime-ministers on <b>the</b> Romanian Constitution. Critics of Băsescu labeled Patapievici and two other supporters at the time, Gabriel Liiceanu, and Vladimir Tismăneanu, as [...] "Băsescu's intellectuals", a label that the three dismissed.|$|R
5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
25|$|After Robert Kennedy's assassination, Johnson rallied {{the party}} bosses and unions to give Humphrey the {{nomination}} at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Personal correspondences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> {{some in the}} Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported Nelson Rockefeller's campaign. He reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee, he would not campaign against him (and would not campaign for Humphrey).|$|E
25|$|The final {{component}} of the WOSBs was interviews. The interview method was intended particularly to help the Board to make decisions on borderline candidates who had been highlighted by the preceding tests. There were also two interviews: the Board President and the Board Psychiatrist both interviewed candidates. At some boards, the two interviews led to conflict and jostling for power <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Psychiatrist (see Reception, below).|$|E

An alumnus of Seattle, Washington's The Bush School and Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, he founded <b>The</b> <b>Presidents</b> with fellow Bush School alumnus Chris Ballew.

25|$|At {{one time}} Pennsylvania Avenue {{provided}} an unobstructed view between the White House and the Capitol. The {{construction of an}} expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President Andrew Jackson did this on purpose. Relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> Congress were strained, and Jackson {{did not want to}} see the Capitol out his window, though in reality the Treasury Building was simply built on what was cheap government land.|$|E
25|$|In May 1945, {{after a year}} {{of growing}} hostility <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> the assembly, which was vainly {{awaiting}} deeds to substantiate Velasco's rhetorical advocacy of social justice, the mercurial chief executive condemned and then repudiated the newly completed constitution. After dismissing the assembly, Velasco held elections for a new assembly, which in 1946 drafted a far more conservative constitution that met with the president's approval. For this brief period, Conservatives replaced the left as Velasco's base of support.|$|E
25|$|A {{political}} fight {{which began}} as a conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Supreme Court turned into a battle between Roosevelt and the recalcitrant {{members of his own}} party in the Congress. The political consequences were wide-reaching, extending beyond the narrow question of judicial reform to implicate the political future of the New Deal itself. Not only was bipartisan support for Roosevelt's agenda largely dissipated by the struggle, the overall loss of political capital in the arena of public opinion was also significant.|$|E

25|$|The 1891 Chilean Civil War {{brought about}} a {{redistribution}} of power <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a vastly expensive naval arms race with Argentina that nearly led to a war.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tombalbaye in 1975 and the accord between President Félix Malloum and the insurgent leader Hissène Habré in 1978, a new {{constitution}} was created on August 29, 1978, to make space for a coalition government, with the executive power shared <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Prime Minister. As part of the coalition accord a National Council representative of all prefectures was set up, and also a Defence and Security Council in which Malloum and Habré partisans were given equal representation.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, Omonia {{was knocked}} out of the Europa League playoff stages by Dynamo Moscow. The club issued a {{complaint}} to UEFA regarding the refereeing of the match by Alexandru Tudor. In early September, the club stopped supplying the fans' group Gate-9 with tickets resulting in the group's abstention from matches. Two weeks later, after a meeting <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> the coach, {{it was decided that}} tickets were to be supplied again to Gate-9. Omonia managed to finish fourth in the league. The team was eliminated from the Cypriot Cup semi-finals by APOEL.|$|E
5000|$|The {{historic}} site {{is often used}} as a political metaphor in the United States. Political scientists and political commentators often use the mile-and-a-half (2.4 kilometres) length of Pennsylvania Avenue {{as a metaphor for}} the political gulf which sometimes exist <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> <b>and</b> Congress's policy priorities. It has also been used {{as a metaphor for the}} separation of powers under the United States Constitution. The area is also seen as a political synonym for the seat of government as well as <b>the</b> White House. <b>President</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, was often called [...] "the sphinx of Pennsylvania Avenue." ...|$|R

25|$|Immediately {{upon his}} {{assuming}} office {{he had to}} deal first with some incidents in Chillán, and then with an insurrection in the island of Chiloé that was trying {{to break away from}} the control of the central government and return to the protection of Spain. The rebellion was very brutally suppressed, and 20 people were executed. The problems <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> Congress that had marked the rule of his predecessor, continued. The federal laws started to cause friction between the new provinces, and the famous highwaymen the Pincheira family, started a new campaign.|$|E
25|$|Lozano Díaz {{began his}} period as {{president}} {{with a broad}} base of support that eroded rapidly. He unveiled an ambitious development plan to be financed by international loans and increased taxes and also introduced the nation's first labor code. This document guaranteed workers the right to organize and strike but gave employers the right of lockout and forbade strikes in public services. The code also embodied some social welfare and minimum-wage provisions and regulated hours and working conditions. All these provisions gained him some labor support, but in later months relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> labor began to sour.|$|E
25|$|Local {{self-government}} {{is officially}} guaranteed. Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations are {{appointed by the}} President {{in accordance with the}} proposals of the Prime Minister. This system virtually requires an agreement <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Prime Minister, and has in the past led to problems, such as when President Yushchenko exploited a perceived loophole by appointing so-called 'temporarily acting' officers, instead of actual governors or local leaders, thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime Minister. This practice was controversial and was subject to Constitutional Court review.|$|E
