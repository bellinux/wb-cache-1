5000|$|Seafaring is a {{tradition}} which encompasses a variety of professions and ranks. Each of these roles carries unique responsibilities which are integral to the successful operation of a seafaring vessel. A ship's crew can generally be divided into four main categories: the deck department, the engineering department, the steward's department, and other. The reasoning behind this is that a ship's bridge, filled with sophisticated navigational equipment, requires skills differing from those used on deck operations [...] - [...] which houses equipment such as <b>berthing,</b> <b>cargo</b> and/or military devices; which in turn requires skills different from those used in a ship's engine room and propulsion, and so on.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the evaluation method of berth capacity for general cargo in port. Specially, this study discussed the evaluation formula for general <b>cargo</b> <b>berth</b> capacity. It described the traditional evaluation method and new evaluation method with a sample case using real data of the general <b>cargo</b> <b>berth.</b> The results of the study revealed some problems for traditional evaluation method of general cargo handling capacity. Traditional calculation method does not reflect real situation for the general <b>cargo</b> <b>berth</b> capacity. Also, it does not reflect individual circumstances in terms of input parameter like berth occupancy rate, an annual working day and daily working hour. Finally, this study recommended the applicable and effective formula to reflect real situation on ports which can give direction for developing evaluation of formula for general cargo port capacity...|$|R

The objective of the development plan is then defined, i. e. to provide MPT the least-cost of port operation consisting of port investment, ship operational cost in port, and cargo handling cost. Thus the relevant criterion to be used is the optimization of berth length, storage facilities and other major fixed investment. In order to find the proper solution for the above problem, the strategy of the development plan is that the less-cost potential solution should be first investigated. Thus first investigation is concerning the operational improvement measures : the longer working time and the more effective cargo handling operation. These measures are covered in the Port Improvement Action Plan being implemented at present. Only if these measures cannot solve the above problem, the expansion of existing MPT or even the construction of new terminal will be considered.
