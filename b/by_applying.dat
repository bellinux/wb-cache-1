5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the riderâ€™s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E

The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E

5|$|Coal was {{the almost}} {{exclusive}} {{fuel for the}} pre-dreadnought period, though navies made the first experiments with oil propulsion in the late 1890s.

5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> a scaling factor to the components of the prototype.

5|$|For {{the past}} ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has been {{assisting}} Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. <b>By</b> <b>applying</b> the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping {{and the use of}} organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{can also}} be created from {{stochastic}} processes <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> some suitable transformations, which {{is the case for}} the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process.

5|$|The {{first use}} of SiC was as an abrasive. This was {{followed}} by electronic applications.
