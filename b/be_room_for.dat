25|$|The Church is unwavering in {{upholding}} its dogmatic teachings, {{but does}} not insist upon those matters of faith which have not been specifically defined. The Eastern Orthodox believe that there must always <b>be</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> mystery when speaking of God. Individuals are permitted to hold theologoumena (private theological opinions) {{so long as they}} do not contradict traditional Eastern Orthodox teaching. Sometimes, various Holy Fathers may have contradictory opinions about a certain question, and where no consensus exists, the individual is free to follow his or her conscience.|$|E
500|$|To avoid some of {{the design}} {{mistakes}} made in Baldur's Gate, guidelines were drawn up for each department; the level designers had the longest set of guidelines. These lists continually changed and evolved as the development progressed. The main design guidelines for the entire project were that the players should feel like their actions {{have an effect on}} the game world, and good versus evil options should be available depending on which path the player takes. Guidelines for the story were to keep the focus on the player's character, keep the player updated on the activities on the game's villain, add a significant plot twist, and make the ending of the game open enough so that there would <b>be</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> more sequels. Environment guidelines were to break the game into chapters, make some locations key to the central plot, keep areas interesting and easy to quickly navigate, and showcase areas before they were available to explore to capture player interest. For the game systems, guidelines focused on character customization and a well-crafted reward system. The writing guidelines were concerned mainly with dialogue: limiting the number of sentences NPCs spoke at a time, keeping the number of player response choices at three as often as possible, avoiding profanity and accents, and having a small set of random dialogue for unimportant NPCs. [...] Many early design decisions did not follow the guidelines, and programming constraints were not always followed by other departments, such as design and art, leading to slowdowns in some parts of the game that were difficult or impossible to fix.|$|E
2500|$|Most Overwatch {{pornography}} is only several seconds long and intended to loop indefinitely. Since the game's official release, various creators have experimented with {{longer and more}} elaborate story content. Though the characters each have a personal backstory, {{there is still a}} lot not known about them. According to Kotakus Grayson, [...] "by design, they can’t be fully fleshed out. There has to <b>be</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> player identity." [...] Most short character clips take known character traits to a sort of [...] "logical conclusion", such as showing former pro gamer D.Va masturbating while streaming. The superpowers and symbols of agency of the female characters are usually not integral to these fanworks, though Emily Gaudette of Inverse noted that Tracer is an exception to this rule, stating that this character [...] "has achieved something not many other female characters in porn have: a unique personality that only adds to her sex appeal." [...] Gaudette further stated that the majority of Overwatch {{pornography is}} [...] "vanilla", suggesting that it is intended for a straight male audience.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{historical}} examples of human civilization undergoing large-scale transitions, {{such as the}} Industrial Revolution. The transition between Kardashev scale levels could potentially represent similarly dramatic periods of social upheaval, since they entail surpassing the hard limits of the resources available in a civilization's existing territory. A common speculation suggests that the transition from Type0 to TypeI might carry a strong risk of self-destruction since, in some scenarios, there would no longer <b>be</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> further expansion on the civilization's home planet, as in a Malthusian catastrophe. Excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat, for example, could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching TypeI unsuitable to the biology of the dominant life-forms and their food sources. If Earth is an example, then sea temperatures in excess of [...] would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their metabolism difficult if not impossible. Of course, these theoretical speculations may not become problems in reality thanks to evolution or the application of future engineering and technology. Also, {{by the time a}} civilization reaches TypeI it may have colonized other planets or created O'Neill-type colonies, so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the planetary system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the run-up}} to the {{investiture}} of Willem-Alexander on 30 April 2013, Utrecht student Joanna suddenly made headlines when she protested with a cardboard sign reading 'Weg met de monarchie. Het is 2013' ("Down with the monarchy. It is 2013") in the presence of Queen Beatrix, after which she was removed by the police, violating her freedom of expression. The incident inspired the foundation of the antimonarchist [...] "It is 2013" [...] movement, that together with the NRG wanted hold playful activities to call for a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy on 30 April. The police later admitted their mistake, and the soon-to-be-king Willem-Alexander remarked that on the day of his investiture [...] "of course there will <b>be</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> dissent. There has to be. Nothing wrong with that." [...] He commented that the police officer who removed Joanna probably made a mistake, but everyone can make mistakes and learn from them. Of the six protest locations assigned by the government of Amsterdam, one was used by republicans: the Waterlooplein. Joanna and NRG chairman Hans Maessen, who demonstrated individually against the monarchy, were arrested on Dam Square. The police later admitted the arrests were a mistake. Joanna claimed she had been [...] "silenced". Since the investiture, Joanna and the [...] "It is 2013" [...] movement were rarely heard from again.|$|E
2500|$|Zajac {{began his}} junior ice hockey {{career with the}} Salmon Arm Silverbacks of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). One of his {{teammates}} was Brady Murray, who would briefly play in the NHL for the Los Angeles Kings, and his linemate was future Calgary Flames winger Kris Chucko. In his second season with Salmon Arm, Zajac led the team in goals, assists and points, and finished second overall in the League in the latter two statistics. At season's end, he was named the MVP of the BCHL's Interior Division, and {{he played in the}} BCHL All-Star Game. His play attracted attention, and he was projected to be a potential first-round draft pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. The projection proved accurate, as the New Jersey Devils would take him with the 20th overall pick. The Devils traded up to get Zajac, which [...] "mean a lot" [...] to him, but was not a surprise, as the Devils scouted him more than any other team. [...] Zajac opted to play college ice hockey for the University of North Dakota rather than major junior hockey in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL), as he wanted an education in addition to playing hockey. Then-Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello commented that there would <b>be</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> Zajac on the North Dakota roster because the Devils were recalling forward Zach Parise, drafted the year earlier, to play professional hockey.|$|E
