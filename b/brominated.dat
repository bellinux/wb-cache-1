5|$|<b>Brominated</b> {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the <b>brominated</b> material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|To make <b>brominated</b> {{polymers}} and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of <b>brominated</b> monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly <b>brominated</b> molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first <b>brominated</b> followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E

30|$|Polyethylene glycol-bound {{potassium}} tribromide [{K+PEG}·Br 3 −] {{was found}} to be an efficient <b>brominating</b> agent for the bromination of bisphenol A to tetrabromobisphenol A of a very high purity in excellent yield. The <b>brominating</b> agent was easily prepared by reacting the PEG 400 with KBr 3 using the host-guest chemistry concept. The effect of various reaction parameters such as solvent, temperature, and concentration of <b>brominating</b> agent on the yield and purity of tetrabromobisphenol A was studied. The key advantages of the developed method are the use of inexpensive, non-volatile poly(ethylene)glycols, facile regeneration, and inbuilt recycling of generated HBr waste.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} <b>brominated</b> halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and <b>brominated</b> flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E

40|$|Marine organisms {{mediate the}} {{formation}} of volatile inorganic (e. g. HOBr) and organic halogens (e. g. CHBr 3) {{and contribute to the}} sea-to-air emission of bromine and iodine. This air-sea halogen exchange has implications for atmospheric chemistry. It is important to establish the physiological function of halogen metabolism in key groups of marine organisms to permit predictive model development. In this study a series of laboratory experiments was performed to investigate the link between the availability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and <b>brominating</b> activity, as measured by the bromination of phenol red, in two cold-water marine diatoms (Thalassiosira antarctica, CCAP 1085 / 25; Porosira glacialis, CCMP 668). <b>Brominating</b> activity in T. antarctica was found to change in response to short term changes in photon flux density and to have a strong positive linear relationship with gross photosynthetic rate up to 260 µmol O 2 (mg chla) - 1 hr- 1. Experiments performed across multiple diel cycles showed that light-phase <b>brominating</b> activities in T. antarctica were a factor of 2. 8 (± 1. 0) higher than those measured in the dark. Whilst P. glacialis showed no response to short term changes in PFD, measurements across a number of diel cycles revealed that light-phase <b>brominating</b> activities in this diatom were significantly higher than those in the dark by a factor of 1. 3 (± 0. 3). The addition of 0. 1 µM H 2 O 2 to the medium of T. antarctica cultures led to a significant increase in <b>brominating</b> activity by a factor of 2. 4 (± 0. 3) relative to no-addition controls but no such response was seen in P. glacialis. These results suggest that there is a link between PAR light availability and <b>brominating</b> activity in marine diatoms but that the nature of this relationship differs between species. By establishing a potential link with common ecosystem model state variables (light and photosynthesis) this work provides the first step towards developing a predictive capability for <b>brominating</b> activity in the marine environment. More work is needed to assess the potential for developing generalised parameterisations between PAR light availability and <b>brominating</b> activity in diatom species representative of a wider range of ocean regions...|$|R

25|$|The {{chlorine}} atom, written {{often as}} Cl., behaves very {{differently from the}} chlorine molecule (Cl2). The radical Cl. is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O2. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Bromine atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence <b>brominated</b> CFCs are also regulated.|$|E
