5|$|In 1892, his {{grandmother}} Louisa Drew's business began to suffer, and she {{lost control of}} her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from tuberculosis; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> her, and he was mostly raised by {{his grandmother}}. The loss of their mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at The Lambs, a New York actors' club.|$|E

25|$|The Honourable George Harris {{was born}} in St Ann's, Trinidad on 3 February 1851 when his father, George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris, was serving as Governor of Trinidad (1846–1854). Harris <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> his mother who {{died when he was}} two years old. In 1854, the family moved to Madras when his father was posted to the {{governorship}} there. Harris senior retired in March 1859 and returned to England where he became involved with Kent County Cricket Club as a committee member and, in 1870, club president. He died in November 1872, whereupon Harris junior succeeded to the barony as 4th Baron Harris. He was already a first-class cricketer by then and was henceforward universally known in the sport as Lord Harris.|$|E

25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he <b>barely</b> <b>knew,</b> and therefore Riley {{would be less}} likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard she would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E
500|$|In 1516, Ferdinand died. [...] The {{remaining}} heir was Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson Charles, {{who became}} King Charles I of both Castile and Aragon in co-regency {{with his mother}} Joanna. [...] Charles {{was brought up in}} Flanders, the homeland of his father Philip, and <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> Castilian. [...] The people greeted him with skepticism, but also hoped he would restore stability. [...] With the arrival of the new king in late 1517, his Flemish court took positions of power in Castile; young Charles only trusted people he knew from the Netherlands. [...] Among the most scandalous of these was the appointment of the twenty-year-old William de Croÿ as Archbishop of Toledo. [...] The Archbishopric was an important position; it had been held by Archbishop Cisneros, the former regent of the country. [...] Six months into his rule, discontent openly simmered among rich and poor alike. [...] Even some monks began to agitate, denouncing the opulence of the royal court, the Flemish, and the nobility in their sermons. [...] One of the first public protests involved placards posted in churches, which read: ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1915, Howe {{traveled}} back to Massachusetts {{to court}} Alice Worcester, {{daughter of the}} head of the company he had worked for in the summer at MIT. After some surprise at the attention from a man she <b>barely</b> <b>knew,</b> Worcester eventually accepted him, and the two were married in mid-1916. The same year, he resigned from government service to go into business with partners as C. D. Howe and Company, whose major business was initially the construction of grain elevators. [...] Both the company headquarters and the marital home were in Port Arthur. Howe's first contract was to build a grain elevator in Port Arthur. In December 1916, a massive storm destroyed the half-built elevator, wiping out Howe's assets. Had his bank not come to his assistance with additional funds, he would have been ruined. When Howe turned over the completed elevator to the owner, the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, he was asked how badly he had done on the contract, and stated, [...] "I lost my shirt." [...] The Association voted him a bonus to make up his loss.|$|E

500|$|William Petersen {{worked with}} the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in {{preparation}} for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on them and how they learned to [...] "compartmentalize" [...] their working and personal lives. [...] "Of course you don’t really turn it off", he recalled. [...] "At the end of the day, even if you’re just a regular policeman, it takes a toll". [...] During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as [...] "one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and criminal profiling at the time". Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he <b>barely</b> <b>knew,</b> and believed that Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] was [...] "their song". This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.|$|E

But Wilkes says their relationship was closer than that. [...] Ever since they went on a scuba-diving trip together in 1993, he said, Lewis had referred to him as his [...] "diving buddy." [...] They occasionally dined together or met at political functions, Wilkes said. At a Las Vegas fund-raiser in April 2005, Wilkes said, Lewis greeted him as [...] "Brento" [...] and hugged him as Wilkes surprised Lewis with $25,000 in campaign contributions.|$|E

[...] "I know that [...] only because somebody has mentioned that, too, already," [...] he told reporters at the time. However, it was later revealed that Ryun and Foley had hosted a joint fundraiser on their street on May 18, 2006, called the [...] "D Street Block Party." [...] An invitation to the fundraiser included side-by-side pictures of Ryun and Foley. Ryun's campaign manager later said that Ryun had always known he was Foley's neighbor.|$|E

Of the two daughters, Lily, born into wealth, seemed more {{affected}} by the fall into poverty. When in 1902, Baby Doe traveled with her daughters to Oshkosh to visit her relatives, Lily decided then to prolong her visit, to stay and provide care for her elderly grandmother. Later, Lily moved to Chicago, where in 1908 she married her first cousin, and soon after gave birth to Baby Doe's grandchild. [...] In 1911, Baby Doe and Silver again visited relatives in Wisconsin, going on to visit Lily in Chicago. After such a prolonged absence, Lily claimed she <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> Silver Dollar.|$|E

After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University in suburban Evanston, where he graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in history. He earned his J.D. from the Pepperdine University School of Law in 1983. He later said of the experience: [...] "I went to law school at a place called Pepperdine in Malibu, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean — a lot of surfing and movie stars and all the rest. I <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> where that law library was." [...] Blagojevich is married to Patricia Mell, the daughter of former Chicago alderman Richard Mell.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{attempts}} to replicate Bailén proved particularly dangerous for Spanish units recruited and equipped {{in the chaos}} of French military occupation and counterinsurgency: [...] "The raw levies that formed {{the bulk of the}} Spanish forces proved incapable of manoeuvring {{in the face of the}} enemy, whilst many of them <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> how to use their weapons, having sometimes only been issued with muskets the day before they went into action." [...] These untrained recruits typically broke ranks when assaulted by the French regulars, [...] "accusing their commanders of treason and leaving the few [...] regulars involved to fend for themselves as best they could. Having run away, meanwhile, the levies invariably exposed themselves to the French cavalry, which were unleashed amongst them with terrible effect, sabring them unmercifully and taking hundreds of them prisoner." [...] Wellington, as allied commander, would inherit this [...] "Bailén syndrome" [...] and attempt to restrain the ardour of the Spanish under his command: ...|$|E

2500|$|John Florence Sullivan {{was born}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Irish Catholic parents.

His father, James Henry Sullivan, his infant brother, Robert, and he were taken in by one of his mother's sisters, [...] "my Aunt Lizzie", around whom he focused the first chapter of his second memoir, Much Ado About Me. His father was so shattered by his mother's death that, according to Allen, he drank more heavily. His aunt suffered as well: her husband Michael was partially paralyzed by lead poisoning shortly after they married, leaving him mostly unable to work, something Allen remembered as causing contention among Lizzie's sisters. Eventually, Allen's father remarried and offered his sons the choice between coming with him and his new wife or staying with Aunt Lizzie. Allen's younger brother chose to go with their father, but Allen decided to stay with his aunt. [...] "I never regretted it", he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|By 1951, the 64-year-old Frawley had {{appeared}} in over 100 movies, but was starting to find film role offers becoming fewer. When he heard that Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting a new television situation comedy, he applied eagerly {{to play the role}} of the cantankerous, miserly landlord Fred Mertz. [...] One evening he telephoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. Ball was surprised to hear from him — a man she <b>barely</b> <b>knew.</b> Both Ball and Arnaz agreed that it would be great to have Frawley, a motion picture veteran, appear as Fred Mertz. Less enthusiastic were CBS executives, who warned of Frawley's frequent drinking and instability. Arnaz immediately told Frawley about the network's concerns, telling him that if he was late to work, arrived drunk, or was unable to perform because of something other than legitimate illness more than once, he would be written out of the show. Contrary to the network's concerns, Frawley never arrived at work drunk, and in fact mastered his lines after only one reading. Arnaz eventually became one of the misanthropic Frawley's few close friends.|$|E
2500|$|Malin Matsdotter were {{questioned}} and cautioned {{to tell the}} truth. She was thoroughly questioned regarding her religious instruction. When asked to recite the Creed, she answered {{that she could not}} bother to read and <b>barely</b> <b>knew</b> the Lord's Prayer. [...] Her language difficulties attracted attention when she had difficulty reading the prayers the court instructed her to: she did not know them herself, and even had trouble repeating them when they were read to her. [...] The court noted that she hesitated in a suspicious way when she was to repeat the prayers word by word. [...] The fact that she had trouble reading was in fact uncommon in 17th-century Stockholm: since the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, every citizen regardless of class or sex was by law required to be able to read, so that {{they may be able to}} read the bible. The fact that she seems to have preferred Finnish considered strange by the court, as the capital had a great Finnish minority from the nearby province who even had their own congregation; what was regarded suspicious for a person accused of consorting with the Devil was, rather, the fact that she had difficulty to read and pronounce words from the holy scripture.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955 Surrey {{won their}} first 9 matches and Surridge's vice-captain Peter May succeeded Len Hutton as captain of England. Barrington made 135 not out against Lancashire and 126 against Nottinghamshire, which won him his county cap. Now {{established}} in the Surrey team he was called up for the First Test against South Africa at Trent Bridge, hearing the news when a crowd cheered him while batting in a charity match. He batted at number 4, replacing Colin Cowdrey who was unable to play. Barrington made a duck and though England won by an innings he felt isolated from the England regulars who he <b>barely</b> <b>knew.</b> He was kept in the side for the Second Test at Lord's, coming in at 30/3 in the first innings and making 34, top-scoring in England's 133, but looked uncomfortable on a green pitch against the fast bowling of Peter Heine. In the second innings Barrington and Denis Compton added 40 runs, but he was out for 18. Even though England won again Cowdrey was available and Barrington was dropped. Returning to Surrey he made 73 out of 171 against Middlesex after coming in at 6/4 and helped the County to their fourth successive Championship. He was voted [...] "Young Cricketer of the Year" [...] by the Cricket Writers Club and was chosen for the 1955–56 MCC tour of Pakistan.|$|E
