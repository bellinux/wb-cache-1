5|$|Within {{the section}} Mycena, M.multiplicata {{is similar to}} the Malaysian species M.obcalyx in having a grayish-white cap, lobed cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and a lignicolous habitat.

5|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> a knife.|$|E
5|$|Akira is an effeminate {{male with}} a crush Nanako Momoi. After exchanging <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> her, his {{personality}} and Nanako's feminine appearance causes his popularity to soar. His best friend, Shinnosuke Senbongi, learns his secret and becomes enamored {{with his new}} appearance. Initially, Akira was adamant on returning to his body and maintaining his masculinity. During the series, he reluctantly reconciles Shinnosuke's feelings and upon realizing everyone is happier with the new statusquo, resigns to live in Nanako's body. He is voiced by Kenji Nojima in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Shun Shioya in the live action film.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Bears are carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} Ursidae. They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting.

5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} <b>bodies,</b> <b>with</b> ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{the display}} was totally renovated. The {{destroyed}} limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of Derbyshire limestone, many weighing over , rebuilt {{according to a}} small model made from {{the same number of}} polystyrene blocks. Fibreglass replacements were created for the missing sculptures, and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans {{are dark}} <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> reddish, featureless spectra. No firm {{evidence}} {{of the presence of}} water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during {{the early stages of the}} Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.|$|E

5|$|Lionel is {{sentenced to}} prison for his parents' murder in season four. Lionel {{attempts}} to switch <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> Lex using a stone from Clark's homeworld of Krypton but Clark intervenes and Lionel switches <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> Clark instead. When he and Clark switch back, Lionel discovers his terminal liver disease is healed. Lionel is released from prison by Genevieve Teague (Jane Seymour), and begins searching for three stones of knowledge. During this quest, Lionel falls into a catatonic state after being uploaded with Kryptonian knowledge. Lionel recovers from his catatonic state in season five when the Kryptonian artificial intelligence Jor-El takes over his body to speak with Clark. With Jor-El guiding him, Lionel begins helping Clark by making excuses for Clark's behavior and unexplained disappearances throughout seasons five and six. Season seven revealed that Lionel and three other wealthy families formed the secret society called Veritas to protect an alien visitor known as the Traveler (Clark). When the secret is uncovered, Lex murders his father, realizing he has been covering up the Traveler's existence.|$|E

5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented <b>bodies</b> <b>with</b> jointed limbs, {{all covered}} in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of HIP 78530 b was reported on January 24, 2011. In imaging the ninety-one stars, HIP 78530 b and 1RXSJ1609-2105b were discovered.

However, this number is a lower limit, as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller, low-mass planets that fit this scenario.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has had to share its legislative powers.
