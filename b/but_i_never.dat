500|$|Seth {{was born}} in Uniontown in 1815. While in Pennsylvania, he learned to read and write, [...] "I could form good letters with a pen <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> learned to spell well." [...] In 1830 his father took the family and {{migrated}} to Tazewell County, Illinois.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{ability to}} connect with Americans earned him the laudatory moniker [...] "The Great Communicator." [...] Of it, Reagan said, [...] "I won the {{nickname}} the great communicator. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thought it was my style that made a difference—it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things." [...] His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, he rebutted two longstanding rumors: {{one that}} he {{appeared}} as a soldier on a train in Biloxi Blues (1988), saying, [...] "No. I don't know why that's on IMDb, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> was in that", and the other that he is related to dancer Lacey Schwimmer, saying, [...] "No, not at all. Please set the record straight. I guess it's a natural assumption {{because we have the}} same last name, but no. I've never even met her".|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, King {{says that}} in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic {{candidate}} John F. Kennedy: [...] "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> made one." [...] King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying [...] "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the season}} was much more violent than {{previous}} MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be [...] "too far", saying that [...] "Daredevil wasn’t asking {{for a lot of}} sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn’t fit the story for that season. I think that’ll change moving forward, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once Daredevil was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in Jessica Jones." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi: An old A-list horror film actor whom Ed {{brings back}} into the spotlight. Rick Baker created the {{prosthetic}} makeup designs. Baker did not use extensive make-up applications, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion. For research, Landau watched 25 of Lugosi's films and seven interviews between the years of 1931 and 1956. Landau {{did not want to}} deliver an over-the-top performance. [...] "Lugosi was theatrical, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery... I felt it had to be Lugosi's theatricality, not mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods {{was listed}} in 2012 credits as the film's inspiration, and Emmerich {{said in a}} Time Out interview: [...] "I {{always wanted to do}} a biblical flood movie, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt I had the hook. I first read about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods." [...] He and composer-producer Harald Kloser worked closely together, co-writing a spec script (also {{entitled}} 2012) which was marketed to studios in February2008. A number of studios heard a budget projection and story plans from Emmerich and his representatives, a process repeated by the director after Independence Day (1996) and The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
500|$|Turner {{stated that}} she was on a [...] "downhill slide" [...] for much of the 1970s, {{drinking}} heavily, not eating, missing performances, and weighing only 95 pounds. [...] "I was a sipper <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> got high or drunk," [...] Turner said in a 1982 interview. [...] "It was much more insidious. It was starting to affect my liver and my health... I was very sick." [...] She decided to stop drinking, and began eating all organic food; she would credit herbalism as helping her overcome her alcoholism. Turner claimed she was chaste for the remainder of her life, after her final divorce in 1969 and had no desire to marry again.|$|E

500|$|Tessa {{occasionally}} meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In [...] "", {{she immediately}} dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that [...] "...sparks fly {{between the two}} women". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thought I would meet one of them." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Sullivan {{loved to}} spend time in France (both in Paris and the south of France), where his acquaintances {{included}} European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling. He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors. In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley, and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis although, according to George Grossmith, [...] "I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players in my time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan".|$|E

500|$|Barbauld {{demanded that}} her father teach her the {{classics}} and after much pestering, he did. Thus she {{had the opportunity to}} learn Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unsuitable for women at the time. Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism; the two were never as close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter: [...] "I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> knew such another, and I believe never shall." ...|$|E
500|$|Relating to his {{responsibility}} as a celebrity, PewDiePie has stated [...] "many people {{see me as}} a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day", adding, [...] "The loneliness {{in front of the}} computer screens brings us together. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> set out to be a role model; I just want to invite them to come over to my place." [...] Correlating with this note, his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves. Conversely, during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one Kotaku reporter, respondents described him as [...] "annoying" [...] and an [...] "obnoxious waste of time." [...] Additionally, Rolling Stone has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of PewDiePie.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E

500|$|Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 {{as a full}} {{feature for}} Danny Trejo. [...] "I had cast him in Desperado and I {{remember}} thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> got around to making it." [...] The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills (2013), followed.|$|E
500|$|According to the drummer, Jackson, Redding wrote [...] "Respect", after a {{conversation}} they had {{during a break}} in the recording session, in which he told Redding: [...] "You're on the road all the time. All you can look for is a little respect when you come home." [...] An alternative story is told by Redding's friend and road manager, Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Sims, who states that the song [...] "came from a group I was singing with", and that even though Redding rewrote it, [...] "a lot of the lyric was still there"; Sims adds: [...] "He told me I would get a credit, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> did". [...] Sims also states that he sang the backing chorus of [...] "Hey hey hey". The song used for the fifth track, [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long", had been previously recorded in mono with Booker T. Jones on piano and released as a single in April 1965, becoming a number-two hit on Billboards R chart; it was rerecorded in stereo for the album.|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher". During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E
