Because of numerous advantages in comparison to a traditional air block brake, disc brakes, {{are more and more}} often utilized in passenger carriages and other railway vehicles. Stable and constant – in the whole speed range – coefficient of friction µ, with the value: µ = 0. 35 is a basic advantage of disc brake systems [7]. Attempt to increase train speed, triggers application of greater braking power i. e. braking systems rapidly absorbing and dispersing stored heat energy. For stimulation of cooling processes of <b>friction</b> set (<b>brake</b> disc and <b>friction</b> <b>pad),</b> discs with ventilation canals shaped by various vanes, are used. Thanks to such solution discs take off about 40 % [4] of heat generated during braking.

40|$|One of {{the main}} quality {{concerns}} of car manufacturers is brake squeal. There are two CAE (Complex Aided Engineering) method for prediction of brake squeal, CEA (Complex Eigenvalue Analysis) and TDA (Transient Dynamic Analysis). However, CEA method is a quite usual tool to evaluate brake squeal propensity despite its intrinsic overestimation of any system instabilities. In contrast, TDA provides a reduced number of predicted instabilities, {{but it is too}} time consuming for complete FE models. The purpose of this thesis is the comparison of TDA with CEA to identify brake squeal frequencies. The finite element model of studied brake system consists of a brake disc, and pair of <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> (<b>friction</b> material and backplate). Using the CEA method, brake squeal frequencies are identified by coalescence modes and calculation of Negative Damping Ratio (NDR) for various pressure and friction coefficient. As a comparison with CEA, TDA is performed by use of dynamic explicit solver to extract the variation of amplitude at a node on the <b>brake</b> disc <b>friction</b> surface over time. The frequency response function of a node on brake disc can be calculated by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the frequencies correspond to the peaks of frequency response function can be considered as a representative of brake squeal frequency. The comparison of TDA and CEA reveals that even though five modes are introduced by NDR criteria for brake squeal onset, merely two of them are detected by TDA. Taking account of CEA overestimation about unstable modes, it can be concluded that the frequency response derived from the transient response can be a reliable method to represent the system instability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge for formulating low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials without using and releasing hazardous materials that are listed on Washington State and California State Senate Bills. Model brake material samples were manufactured and tested in the Friction Assessment and Screening Test (FAST) and the full scale automotive brake dynamometer (Dyno) using a SAE J 2430 test procedure. The SAE recommended a J 2430 test procedure which provided the necessary data for the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP) by the Brake Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 Council. The newly developed low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials were formulated by modifying a typical Non Asbestos Organic (NAO) (T-Baseline) formulation and a typical Semi-Metallic (M-Baseline) formulation. The NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials contain geopolymer and natural hemp fibers as a partial replacement of phenolic resin and synthetic Kevlar fibers, respectively. Friction performance and wear data from a series of FAST tests were used to train an artificial neural network, which was used to optimize the NAO Cu-free formulations. Then, the optimized low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials were tested on the Dyno. Dyno test results showed that all NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials have passed the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP), did not exhibit thermal fade when temperature was increased and were slightly sensitive to speed. The NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials exhibits slightly lower average friction level when compared to the baseline materials (T-Baseline). The Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials, as well as the rotors, exhibit higher wear than the detected wear on the T-Baseline material. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials have also passed the BEEP. Dyno test results indicated that the semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free friction materials did not exhibit thermal fade and were slightly sensitive to speed. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free materials exhibited lower friction level and higher wear on the pads when compared to the M-Baseline material. The semi-metallic Cu-free material outperformed the M-Baseline material in term of rotor wear. Analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis on the tested materials show that the friction surface of the T-baseline material was covered with fully developed and stable friction layer (third body) consisting mostly of Fe-oxides, different forms of carbon and compounds of materials originally present in the bulk material. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) did not develop a sufficient friction layer. The friction layer seemed to be responsible for the detected lower wear in the T-Baseline compared to the NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16), and it acted as a solid lubricant on the interface between the rubbing pad and the cast iron rotor lowering the adhesive forces. The friction and wear of the T-Baseline material was controlled by adhesive mechanisms. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) with content of geopolymer replacing phenolic resin matrix exhibited extensive abrasive wear in addition to adhesive mechanisms. The capacity to form a friction layer on the surface plays a considerable role when lowering the wear of NAO <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials. The friction layer was formed by compaction and interaction of brake wear particles, and its stability and character depend on the chemistry of the bulk materials in contact as well as the temperature, pressure and sliding speed during a friction process. SEM and EDX analyses also showed that the semi-metallic <b>pads</b> have developed <b>friction</b> layer on the friction surfaces. The difference was that the M-Baseline material had well developed friction layer, but the Low-Cu (M 4) and Cu-free (M 5) materials, had many smaller patches of friction layer disturbed on the surfaces...|$|R
