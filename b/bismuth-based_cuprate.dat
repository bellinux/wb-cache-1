40|$|High-temperature superconductors {{belong to}} the group of {{strongly}} correlated materials. In these compounds, complex repulsive electron interactions and a large number of degrees of freedom lead to a rich variety of states of matter. Exotic phases like the pseudogap, charge-, spin- and pair-density waves, but also the remarkable phenomenon of superconductivity emerge, depending on doping level and temperature. However, up to now it is unclear what exactly causes these states, to what extent they are coexisting or competing, and where their borders in the phase diagram lie. A better understanding could help in finding the mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity, but would also provide a better insight into the puzzling behavior of strongly correlated materials. This thesis tries to resolve some of these questions with focus on the underdoped pseudogap regime. Mesa structures of <b>bismuth-based</b> <b>cuprate</b> superconductors were studied using intrinsic tunneling, which allows spectroscopic characterizations of electronic density of states inside the material. A micro/nano fabrication method was developed to further reduce mesa areas into the sub square-micrometer range, in order to minimize the effect of crystal defects and measurement artifacts caused by heating induced by the measurement current. The comparison of energy scales in Bi- 2201 and Bi- 2212 cuprates shows that the pseudogap phenomenon is not connected to superconductivity, but possibly represents a competing spin-singlet order that is universal to all cuprates. The analysis of the upper critical field in Bi- 2201 reveals a low anisotropy, which gives evidence of paramagnetically limited superconductivity. Furthermore, a new electrical doping method is demonstrated, which enables the reversible tuning the doping level of Bi- 2212 and study a broad doping range upon a single sample. Using this method, two distinct critical points were observed under the superconducting dome in the phase diagram: one at the overdoped side, associated with the onset of the pseudogap and a metal to insulator transition, and one at optimal doping, associated with an enhanced "dressed" electron energy. Finally, a novel angular-dependent magnetotunneling technique is introduced, which allows for the separation of the superconducting and non-superconducting contributions to the pseudogap phenomenon. The method reveals that after an abrupt decay of the energy gap for T→Tc, weak superconducting correlations persist up to several tens of degrees above Tc...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{normal state}} diamagnetism reported by Lu Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 81, 054510 (2010) ] {{is shown to}} be incompatible with an acclaimed Cooper pairing and vortex liquid above the resistive critical temperature. Instead it is perfectly compatible with the normal state Landau diamagnetism of real-space composed bosons, which describes the nonlinear magnetization curves in less anisotropic cuprates La-Sr-Cu-O (LSCO) and Y-Ba-Cu-O (YBCO) {{as well as in}} strongly anisotropic <b>bismuth-based</b> <b>cuprates</b> in the whole range of available magnetic fields.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of a bulk charge modulation in La_ 1. 88 Sr_ 0. 12 CuO_ 4 (LSCO) with a characteristic in-plane wave-vector of (0. 236, ±δ), with δ= 0. 011 r. l. u. The transverse shift of the ordering wave-vector indicates the presence of rotated charge-stripe ordering, demonstrating that the charge ordering is not pinned to the Cu-O bond direction. On cooling through the superconducting transition, we find an abrupt change {{in the growth of}} the charge correlations and a suppression of the charge order parameter indicating competition between the two orderings. Orthorhombic LSCO thus helps bridge the apparent disparities between the behavior previously observed in the tetragonal " 214 " cuprates and the orthorhombic yttrium and <b>bismuth-based</b> <b>cuprates</b> and thus lends strong support to {{the idea that there is}} a common motif to charge order in all cuprate families.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} anisotropies {{and easy}} axes of magnetization {{at room temperature}} were determined, {{and the effects of}} rare-earth (RE) ions were clarified for RE-based <b>cuprates,</b> RE-doped <b>bismuth-based</b> <b>cuprates</b> and RE-doped Bi-based cobaltite regarding the grain orientation by magnetic field. The easy axis, determined from the powder orientation in a static field of 10 T, depended qualitatively on the type of RE ion for all three systems. On the other hand, the magnetization measurement of the c-axis oriented powders, aligned in static or rotating fields, revealed that the type of RE ion strongly affected not only the directions of the easy axis but also the absolute value of magnetic anisotropy, and an appropriate choice of RE ion is required to minimize the magnetic field used for grain orientation. We also studied the possibility of triaxial grain orientation in high-critical-temperature superconductors by a modulated oval magnetic field. In particular, triaxial orientation was attempted in a high-oxygen-pressure phase of orthorhombic RE-based cuprates Y 2 Ba 4 Cu 7 Oy. Although the experiment was performed in epoxy resin, which is not practical, in-plane alignment within 3 ° was achieved...|$|R
