50|$|Accessories for bottles include {{cleaning}} <b>brushes</b> {{and drying}} <b>racks.</b> <b>Brushes</b> may be specially {{designed for a}} specific manufacturer's bottles and teats. Bottle warmers warm previously made and refrigerated formula. Coolers designed to fit a specific manufacturer's bottles are available to keep refrigerated formula cold. Special formula powder containers are available to store pre-measured amounts of formula so that caregivers can pre-fill bottles with sterile water and mix in the powder easily. The containers are typically designed to stack together so that multiple pre-measured amounts of formula powder may be transported as a unit.|$|R

Additionally, there were numerous Honda accessories that did not come on any trim level which could be purchased and installed at the dealership including <b>brush</b> guards, roof <b>racks</b> (with a variety of accessory mounts), storage organizers, bed extenders, and more.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers {{can also}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. {{the number of}} people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as roof <b>racks,</b> <b>brush</b> guards, wind deflectors (or [...] "spoilers", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, push bars, and narrow and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing both weight and aerodynamic drag. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. [...] Removing roof racks (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by 20%.|$|R
