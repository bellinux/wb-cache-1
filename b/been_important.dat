The local parish council state that 'Crook' comes from the Old English 'Cruc' meaning 'peak' or 'pointed hill'. 'Shute' is a contraction of schute which meant slope in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E

5|$|As {{a magnet}} school founded to promote school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity have <b>been</b> <b>important</b> factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to}} a US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions. School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E

5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not <b>been</b> <b>important</b> adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E

Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E
50|$|The former Brisbane Central Technical College, erected 1911-1915, <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for its {{association}} {{with the development of}} education in Queensland. As the centre of technical education in Queensland, the place <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in demonstrating the development of technical education in the State. The place <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for demonstrating on one site, major changes to technical education from 1900. In particular, the place <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for demonstrating the expansion of technical education in response to retraining requirements for returned soldiers from both World Wars and in response to increases in trade apprenticeships from the 1920s.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{founding}} of Albany in 1624 as a trading post, shipping has <b>been</b> <b>important</b> to its growth and prosperity. Furs (especially beaver), timber, and farm produce were important exports while European people and goods were shipped in. The Dongan Charter, which established Albany as a city, made Albany the exclusive market town in the upper Hudson River Valley. From its beginning, the port consisted of hastily built docks built every spring and destroyed every winter by erosion, flooding, ice, and tidal action. Three city-owned docks were established in 1766, {{the northern and southern}} ones later being expanded into wharves.|$|E
