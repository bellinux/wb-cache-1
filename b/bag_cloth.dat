Hermetic storage of pods offers a novel, sustainable and ecologically safe alternative over traditional methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of triple-layer “Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) ” bags, (that comprises of two inner high density polyethylene bags and one outer woven polypropylene bag), for protecting pods from quality deterioration, damage by bruchids (Caryedon serratus) and aflatoxin contamination (Aspergillus flavus). Custom made triple-layer bags were used and pods (of cv ICGV 91114) were placed @ 2 kg/bag. Over four months of storage under ambient conditions, triple-layer bags supported retention of seed weight, germinability and oil content significantly better than <b>cloth</b> <b>bags.</b> Further, under both natural and artificial infestations with A. flavus, seed aflatoxins levels were lower in PICS <b>bags</b> compared to <b>cloth</b> <b>bags.</b> Toxin accumulation in PICS bags deliberately infested with bruchids and A. flavus was less compared to <b>cloth</b> <b>bags</b> under similar conditions. Bruchid damage to pods was less in PICS <b>bags</b> versus <b>cloth</b> <b>bags</b> in all cases. Our results suggest the superiority of triple-layer PICS <b>bags</b> over <b>cloth</b> <b>bags</b> in protecting seed viability, seed weight and oil content while safeguarding the groundnuts from bruchids and retarding toxin accumulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the seed quality of Indian spinach for three months stored at different containers (Plastic pot, polythene <b>bag</b> and <b>cloth</b> <b>bag)</b> during 2013 - 2014 at Seed Technology Laboratory of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU), Gazipur. The initial moisture content of the seed was 9. 89 % with 75. 00 % germination. However, after two months, the seed had a different range of increased moisture content with reduced germination percentage depending upon the packing materials. Among the three containers, seeds stored at <b>cloth</b> <b>bag</b> absorbed more moisture (14. 36 %) from surrounding atmosphere followed by the moisture content, 12. 67 % and 11. 50 % of polythene bag and airtight plastic pot, respectively. Seeds stored at plastic pot, polythene <b>bag</b> and <b>cloth</b> <b>bag</b> exhibited 65. 00, 64. 00 and 50. 00 per cent germination, respectively. Similarly, the fresh weight and dry weight of seedling and seedling vigor were also decreased. The seeds of plastic pot were good in term of germination capacity, fresh and dry weight and vigor index in comparison to those stored at <b>cloth</b> <b>bag</b> and polythene bag...|$|R

And then when the women stop singing and separate out, he removes the eyeballs, puts them back in the <b>cloth</b> <b>bag</b> and takes them up to heaven.”So during the !kia state, this man says he can see, both figuratively and literally.|$|R
