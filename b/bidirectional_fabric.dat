40|$|ABSTRACT: This work reports hygroscopic, thermal, and {{mechanical}} properties of biomass composites comprising sisal fiber reinforcing castor oil PU resin. The effects of reinforcement geometry and alkaline treatment of fibers were evaluated. In general, alkaline treatment improved quasi-static tensile properties of composites with short randomly oriented and long aligned sisal fibers, respectively. On the other hand, an adverse effect of alkaline treatment {{was observed in}} the mechanical behavior of the composite with <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> architecture. The outstanding influence of moisture on thermo-mechanical properties of biomass composites was confirmed through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. Dynamical-mechanical thermal analysis showed increased storage modulus (i. e., stiffness) and decreased damping properties of biomass composites as compared to neat PUmatrix. Dynamical-mechanical testing also detected unexpected decrease on glass transition temperature of composites {{in regard to the}} neat polymer resin; resin plasticization due to moisturized fibers and/or alkaline treatment residues was identified as probably the culprit.

40|$|Abstract — The {{laminated}} composite beams {{are basic}} structural components {{used in a}} variety of engineering structures such as airplane wings, helicopter blades and turbine blades as well as many others in the aerospace, mechanical, and civil industries. An important element in the dynamic analysis of composite beams is the computation of their natural frequencies and mode shapes. This is important because composite beam structures often operate in complex environmental conditions and are frequently exposed to a variety of dynamic excitations. In this paper, a combined finite element and experimental approach is used to characterize the vibration behavior of composite beams. To this end, some beams are made using the hand-lay-up process. Glass fiber is used as reinforcement in the form of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> and general purpose polyester resin as matrix for the composite material of beams. Experimental dynamic tests are carried out using specimens with different fiber orientations. From the results, the influence of fiber orientations on the flexural natural frequencies is investigated. Also, these experiments are used to validate the results obtained from the finite element software ANSYS...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to investigate the}} stiffness and strength enhancement in a structural steel channel section strengthened by six different carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) wrapping configurations is described in this paper. An approach of transforming the singly symmetric open section such as a channel section to a closed section by CFRP wrapping {{as a means to}} increase the stiffness and strength is demonstrated. A total of 21 specimens, both CFRP reinforced and bare steel specimens, were tested in four-point bending. Two different CFRPs, unidirectional and <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabrics,</b> were used in wrapping the specimen. While the unidirectional layers contribute to the stiffness and strength, the bidirectional layer primarily contributes to confining the former in addition to increasing the resistance to lateral torsional buckling (LTB) of the specimens. The results indicate that the CFRP-strengthened closed sections confined by <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> are effective in enhancing the strength and stiffness compared to CFRP skin–strengthened sections (perimeter of bare steel channel sections overlayed with CFRP). The effectiveness of the closed section can be further improved by increasing the unidirectional CFRP layers prior to the final wrapping by bidirectional fibers. The variation in stiffness for all the CFRP configurations from the initial loading of specimens up to the ultimate is also investigated. This paper demonstrates that the strength and stiffness of steel channel sections can be significantly enhanced by means of appropriate CFRP wrapping configuration...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of an unidirectional carbon fabric layer on the mechanical performances of bidirectional flax fabric/epoxy composites used for structural applications was studied. Two different <b>bidirectional</b> flax <b>fabrics</b> were used to produce flax fabric reinforced plastic (FFRP) laminates by a vacuum bagging process: one is normally used to make curtains; the other, heavier and {{more expensive than the}} previous one, is usually used as reinforcement in composite structures. In order to realize hybrid structures starting from FFRP, an unidirectional UHM carbon fabric was used to replace a <b>bidirectional</b> flax <b>fabric.</b> Tensile and three-point bending tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the laminates investigated (both FFRP and hybrids). Furthermore, the mechanical behavior of the different <b>bidirectional</b> flax <b>fabrics</b> was analyzed by carrying out tensile tests. The experimental tests showed that the structures reinforced with flax fabrics, normally used to make curtains, present better flexural properties than that of others while, in tensile configuration, these last show higher modulus and strength. Moreover, both FFRP laminates show low mechanical properties, which do not allow their use in structural applications while the presence of one external layer of unidirectional carbon involves remarkable increase in their properties. According to this study, the hybrid composites realized could be used in several structural applications (i. e., nautical and automotive) ...|$|R

CFC laminates made from unidirectional prepreg tapes as well as <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabric</b> prepregs were tested in as-received condition at room temperature and under hot/wet environmental conditions after hygrothermal aging. The influence of geometric parameters like the specimen width-to-hole diameter ratio (w/d) and the specimen thickness-to-hole diameter ratio (t/d) on the {{bearing strength}} has been investigated. Bearing strength tests were performed with three different fastener bolt materials, and, in all, over 300 specimens were tested. Bearing stresses were evaluated at ultimate failure, at two-percent hole deformation, at onset of nonlinearity, and at first load drop; and two percent offset bearing strength has been selected {{for the purpose of}} comparison of data. The influence of lamina configuration, mode of loading, hole tolerance, and fastener bolt material on bearing strength has been investigated.

40|$|Shape memory polymer {{composites}} (SMPC) are a {{new kind}} of smart materials where many researches have been carried out. In SMPC, shape memory polymers serves as a matrix material and particles or fibers act as reinforcements. As structural applications demand structures to withstand load and stiffness, particles reinforced SMPC does not serve for it. Therefore fiber/fabric reinforced SMPC used widely for such applications. SMPC’S changes its shape during a typical thermo-mechanical cycle and retracts to its original shape upon external stimulus (temperature). Molecular mechanism is the driving force of these SMP’s. SMP consists of 1. molecular switches and 2. netpoints. This project deals with Epoxy shape memory resin (Matrix material) and fabrics such as Glass, Kevlar and Carbon (Reinforcements). A Comparative analysis was carried out to find which combination gives the best results by bend test. Different orientations were tried for <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabrics</b> such as (0 / 90) 3, (0 / 45) 3, ((0 / 90) /(± 45) /(0 / 90)) specimens.

40|$|The {{anchorage}} of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites {{when applied}} to reinforced concrete (RC) structures as externally bonded reinforcement is an effective means to achieve higher levels of fiber utilization prior to premature debonding failure. Commonly documented anchorage methods for FRP-to-concrete applications demonstrating encouraging results include FRP U-jackets, FRP anchors (also known as spike anchors, among other names), patch anchors (utilizing unidirectional and <b>bidirectional</b> <b>fabrics),</b> nailed metal plates (also known as hybrid bonding), near-surface mounted rods, mechanical fastening, concrete embedment, and mechanical substrate strengthening. Anchorages applied to FRP systems have been verified through experimental testing and numerical modeling to increase the ductility, deformability, and strength of the member and also prevent, delay, or shift the critical mode of FRP debonding failure. Although the benefits of anchorage solutions have now been widely acknowledged by researchers, further studies are {{required in order to}} establish reliable design formulations to negate the requirement for ongoing laboratory verification by industry. The present paper is a state-of-the-art review of experimental studies conducted in the area of FRP anchorage systems applied to FRP-strengthened RC flexural members. Available experimental data are compiled and catalogued and an anchorage efficiency factor for each anchorage type under investigation is assigned in order to quantify the anchor’s efficiency. Finally, current shortcomings in knowledge are identified, in addition to areas needing further investigation...|$|R

Laminates of epoxy resin reinforced by hemp fibres were manufactured by adopting low cost technology. In particular, different typologies of composite laminates, starting from unidirectional and <b>bidirectional</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> and loose hemp fibres, were impregnated by infusion process. Successively, the characterization of the laminates was carried out; in particular, permeability values, flexural characteristics, thicknesses and volumetric percentage of reinforcement were evaluated, in order to investigate impregnation, process quality and mechanical properties of the composite materials...|$|R

The study specimens simulated the flange restrained C-channel sections in lateral bracing of steel bridge superstructure and steel storage structures. A total of seven different strengthening configurations were made based on the two strengthening approaches. The results indicate that the flange strengthening approach is not an efficient method of retrofitting open cross section specimens with longer length compared to the modified cross section strengthening method with infilled core which significantly improved the flexural strength. In addition, the results indicate that with an increase in a number of confinement wrap using <b>bidirectional</b> CFRP <b>fabrics</b> the wrinkling can be prevented. The results also indicate that depending on the magnitude of camber imperfection (initial bent about major axis) different failure modes of CFRP can be observed...|$|R

To this scope, long-term ageing tests were performed on two different laminates in critical environmental conditions. The first laminate, named Flax, was constituted by stacking ten layers of <b>bidirectional</b> flax <b>fabrics.</b> The second one, named FlaxeBasalt, was produced by replacing two external flax layers with two layers of basalt mat for {{each side of the}} laminate.

Five samples per laminate were removed from salt-fog spray chamber and mechanically tested. In particular, quasi-static flexural tests and Charpy impact tests were performed according to ASTM D 790 and ISO 179 standards, respectively. The fracture surfaces of both laminates were evaluated by using an optical 3 D microscope. Moreover, five samples per laminate were removed periodically and weighed to evaluate the water absorption. The experimental results showed that the hybridization with basalt fibres can be considered as a practical approach for enhancing the durability of natural fibre composites under salt-fog environment conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand of}} flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites in various engineering applications calls for accurate predictions of their mechanical behaviors. In this study, numerical methods to generate and simulate mechanical properties of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre fabric-reinforced polymer composites are proposed. The microstructures of {{short flax fibres}} with different fibre length-to-diameter ratios are generated by algorithm taking fiber defects (e. g. kink band) and fiber bundles into account. <b>Bidirectional</b> flax <b>fabric</b> is generated and discretized by tetrahedron 4 -node finite elements. A brittle material law for fibre defects and interfacial zones of fibre bundles is proposed. Flax short fibre/polypropylene and flax fabric/epoxy composites are modeled by a non-linear plasticity model considering an isotropic hardening law and non-local continuum damage mechanics. The numerical modelling results are compared with the experimental results of these composites. This study shows that the simulation can capture the main damage mechanisms of the composites such as fibre breakage initiated at the fiber defects, damage of polymer matrix and the fibre debonding at fibre/matrix interface accurately.

40|$|Determination of shear {{strength}} of brick-mortar bed joint {{is critical to}} overcome the sliding-shear or joint-shear failure in masonry. In the recent past, researchers have attempted to enhance the {{shear strength}} and deformation capacity of brick-mortar bed joints by gluing fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite across the bed joint. FRP composites offer several advantages like high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of application in terms of labor, time, and reduced curing period. Furthermore, FRP composites are desirable for strengthening old masonry buildings having heritage value because of its minimal interference with the existing architecture. A majority of earlier studies on shear strengthening of masonry available in the literature adopted masonry having the ratio of modulus of elasticity of masonry unit (Emu) to modulus of elasticity of mortar (Em) greater than one. Information related to shear behavior of FRP glued masonry composed of masonry units having Young's modulus lower than mortar is limited. Hence {{the present study is}} focused on characterizing the interfacial behavior of brick-mortar bed joint of masonry assemblages composed of solid burnt clay bricks and cement-sand mortar (E-mu/E-m ratio less than one), strengthened with FRP composites. Masonry triplets and prisms with bed joint inclined to loading axis (0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees) are employed in this study. Glass and carbon FRP composites composed of <b>bidirectional</b> FRP <b>fabric</b> with equal density in both directions are used for strengthening masonry. Masonry triplets are glued with glass and carbon FRP composites in two configurations: (1) both faces of the triplet specimens are fully glued with GFRP composites; and (2) both faces of the triplet specimens are glued with GFRP and CFRP composites in strip form. The performance of masonry assemblages strengthened with FRP composites is assessed in terms of gain in shear strength, shear displacement, and postpeak behavior for various configurations and types of FRP composites considered. A semianalytical model is proposed for the prediction of shear strength of masonry bed joints glued with FRP composites. A composite failure envelope consisting of a Coulomb friction model and a compression cap is obtained for unreinforced masonry and GFRP-strengthened masonry based on the test results of masonry triplets and masonry prisms with bed joints having various inclinations to the loading (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R
40|$|Provision {{of utility}} and service ducts are {{important}} part of modern building construction. To facilitate fast and uninterrupted progress the layout of these ducts are planned in advance. Their positions are decided considering the head room provisions in buildings, aesthetic look etc. without jeopardizing the strength,stability and serviceability of the structures. To fulfil these aspects many times ducts have to pass through main load bearing elements like beams. Web openings in a beam adversely affect its strength and stiffness resulting in excessive deflections which may lead to unpleasant appearance {{and the collapse of}} the structure. Therefore, such beams are required to strengthen to restore their strength. The newly developed technique of jacketing the deficit beam with layers of Fiber Reinforced Polymer has proven to be very efficient in restoring and increasing the strength of the beams. Since 1980 extensive research has been carried out on beams with rectangular and circular openings under the most commonly encountered loading case of shear and flexure. The behavior of beams with openings under torsion and its combination with shear and flexure has not been explored much. Hence the aim of the present work is to explore the behavior of rectangular RCC beams with small circular and rectangular openings under torsion. The torsional capacity of beams with openings are extracted experimentally. The study is extended by retrofitting the beams with four layers of <b>bidirectional</b> woven GFRP <b>fabric</b> applied following three different orientations scheme 90 / 90 / 90 / 90, 45 / 45 / 45 / 45 and 90 / 45 / 90 / 45.

40|$|For {{thousands}} of years man kind puts up buildings to protect himself against exposition to nature. In this course {{the simplest way to}} construct has been developed very early: more or less shaped stones are layered on top of each other. Mortar, clay or other matrix materials are inserted between the stones to keep them in their position and assure the distribution of forces to the foundation. Worldwide almost all historical buildings have been constructed in this way. Doubtlessly masonry construction has developed over the millennia/ centuries so that nowadays high strengths can be reached by optimising form and type of the stones as well as the applied matrix and many other factors. As a result of high compression strength masonry is suitable for bearing vertical loads applied by dead and live load. Horizontal load transfer however is extremely limited due to the low tensile strength of the material. Earthquake loads are particularly problematical as masonry is a brittle material with only low ductility. In spite of these characteristics masonry was and still is the prevailing construction method in many seismic vulnerable countries because of local availability and excellent thermal insulation. One possibility to improve the seismic capacity of masonry is laminar textile strengthening, enlarging the masonry’s tensile strength and ductility without charging the masonry with additional weight. Another advantage is the flexible application on existing and designed masonry buildings. Although the effectiveness of textile strengthening is well known so far no suitable numerical models for calculating the capacity of textile strengthened masonry shear walls exist. In the present paper a smeared model is developed in order to simulate masonry strengthened with a <b>bidirectional</b> textile <b>fabric</b> with variable orientation in a matrix of cementitious mortar. The brittle, non-linear material behaviour is described by a cyclic two-dimensional non-linear macro model which is based on the principal of equivalent uniaxial strain according to DARWIN and PECKNOLD. The idea of this concept is the decoupled formulation of the biaxial stress-strain-relationship for each principle stress direction. Then the current stress state depends not only on the present strain state but also on the load history. The main advantage of this formulation is the applicability for cyclic loading as well as the application of uniaxial material parameters and stress-strain-relationships which can be determined by simple uniaxial tests. The failure criterion defines the biaxial tensile and compression strengths as functions of the principle stress ratio for different bed joint orientations. If the strengthened masonry fails in tension the tension stiffening effect due to participation of the masonry between the cracks is calculated using a modified textile characteristic. The non-linear characteristic is approximated as a polygon whose sampling points are defined by the average textile strain between the cracks and the corresponding textile stress within the crack for different degrees of crack initiation. The average crack distance is calculated depending on the transfer length regarding the distribution of the masonry’s tensile strength for a certain degree of crack initiation according to KRELLER. The resulting textile stress within the crack is determined by the equilibrium of forces of the crack element considering the angle between strengthening direction and crack orientation. The applicability of the model implemented into the FE software program ANSYS is shown by simulation of unreinforced and textile strengthened masonry shear walls. The calculations have been made for vertically and horizontally loaded walls with different geometries. The simulations show that the model is able to represent the characteristic failure modes of masonry shear walls. Also the dependency between failure mode and material ductility is demonstrated. All in all the validity of the model for different masonry types can be demonstrated...|$|R
