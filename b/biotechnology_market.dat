It {{is part of the}} trend in economic analysis favoring a dynamic approach to the market, while continuing to respect intellectual property rights.

40|$|Bio{{technology}} {{has become}} one of the primary technology development areas of the 21 century. For a medical device or pharmaceutical manufacturer to remain on the competitive edge, not only is it necessary to satisfy the stringent demands of the <b>biotechnology</b> <b>markets,</b> but those companies must also develop processes that can accelerate the time frame from research and development to manufacturing and actual marketing of the medical products. The allotted time for product development is extremely critical in the manufacture of high tech biomedical products such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and artificial tissues. Biomanufacturing, therefore, is defined as the design, development, implementation and management of systems for the production of products that are integrated into or interact with human systems. This relatively new manufacturing field is anticipated to be an important area for Industrial Engineering, as it involves products that are expensive, complex, contain rapidly changing technology and are relatively difficult to manufacture on a large-scale Keywords Biotechnology, Biomanufacturing, Bioengineering 1...|$|R
