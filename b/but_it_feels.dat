500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} of funny gags on this double-length short, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> padded. It's also heavy-handed. I do like that they have a message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst out laughing. Even I found myself laughing at times." ...|$|E
500|$|Anthony Lane, {{reviewing}} for The New Yorker, called The Fountain [...] "a gorgeous nimbus of confusion." [...] Lane {{complained about}} the film's up-close and far-away shots, [...] "What fails to concern or attract Aronofsky {{is the place where}} most of us hang out—the in-between, the midshot of everyday existence." [...] He summarized, [...] "The movie may have significant truths to impart, although I have my doubts, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> too inexperienced, too unworldly, to have earned the right to them." [...] Roger Ebert, who admired Aronofsky's previous films, conceded in the Chicago Sun-Times that The Fountain was [...] "not a great success." [...] He identified the film's issues: [...] "too many screens of blinding lights," [...] "too many transitions for their own sake," [...] and [...] "abrupt changes of tone." [...] He believed that the scaling down of the film from Aronofsky's original ambition lost some elements and anticipated a director's cut truer to Aronofsky's vision.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "Good" [...] rating of 7.8 out of 10 and {{summarized}} the episode as being [...] "a much more focused story than 'Because You Left' {{but in the}} shadow of the season premiere's revelations and grandeur it is ultimately the weaker of the two. The comedic moments that string together Hurley's journey only go so far and the rest feels a bit too much like filler... If the conclusion of 'The Lie' is any indication though, the outside world may prove to be just as strange as the island." [...] IGN later ranked [...] "The Lie" [...] 84th out of the 115 Lost episodes, writing [...] "this isn't a terrible episode, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like a bit of a stop-gap, in the midst of a very cool run of episodes. On the Island, we do get to see a pretty cool looking Flaming Arrow attack, that kills the uber-annoying Frogurt, but the encounter the group has at the end with some men dressed as soldiers is just set up for the awesome [...] "Jughead." ...|$|E

Giving the episode a positive review, Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "Fortunately, the episode is {{on par with}} this season's best, boasting a reasonably unscattered plotline and, where the main romantic storyline is concerned, {{a touch of the}} childlike sweetness Simpsons writers have brought to previous 'crush' episodes." [...] Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com gave a positive review as well, describing it as a [...] "strong character-centric episode." [...] Although he enjoyed most episodes of the thirteenth season, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that [...] "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] and [...] "The Bart Wants What It Wants" [...] "forces [...] to rethink that opinion." [...] He continued, [...] "Like 'Proposal', 'Wants' isn’t a bad program, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> stale and rehashed." [...] He particularly disliked a joke about poor mileage, which he stated was [...] "identical" [...] to a gag from an earlier episode.

500|$|... "I Miss You" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic complimented [...] "I Miss You", and categorized {{it as one}} of the tracks on Meet Miley Cyrus that bared much resemblance to Hannah Montana songs. Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that [...] "I Miss You" [...] is [...] "as doleful as it gets". Andy Spletzer of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed the track had a level a sincerity that was void from the remainder of Cyrus' repertoire at the time. He added, [...] "The songs are more guitar-driven, the outfits more adult, and the lyrics imply a string of bad boyfriends -- <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like imaginary drama taken from high school poetry, as if she's pretending to be older than she is." [...] In a similar note, Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated the song was the exception to the [...] "heavy on flash and fantasy" [...] that characterized Cyrus at the time. Joseph P. Kahn of the Boston Globe mentioned the song while remarking that Cyrus' songs surpass much of the music played on Radio Disney. Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide believed the track was a clear demonstration of how affectionate Cyrus was with her grandfather. Kelly Jane Torrance of The Washington Times said [...] "I Miss You" [...] was an unpredictable effort, which, according to her, was both empathetic and executed properly, from Cyrus.|$|E
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E

500|$|In the Zone {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. It holds {{a score of}} sixty-six out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on thirteen critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Jason Shawhan of About.com gave a positive review, saying that while the album's vibe is sexy, {{the result is a}} personal statement from Spears. He also added, [...] "T's another thing about Spears' new record, as none of her previous albums ever managed to produce any kind of sustained emotional response than the pleasure that comes from a good pop record. I miss Max Martin, for sure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> like Ms. S. has been paying attention to La Ciccone. To put it another way, this is Britney's True Blue." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that the album [...] " [...] all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern—it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums." [...] Ruth Mitchell of BBC Online called [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] the best track of the album, but added, [...] "Sadly, her attempts to prove her new-found maturity are what overwhelm and cloud all that is good about In The Zone." [...] Mim Udovitch of Blender commented, [...] "This I’m-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin [...] No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] the best and most straightforward moments of the album, but added that [...] "On a CD intended to celebrate her lurch into adulthood, Spears remains distant and submerged. For all her freedom, she's still finding her way." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Ansen of Newsweek {{said the}} film [...] "is lushly, impeccably mounted—perhaps too much so. Mendes, a superb stage director, has an {{innately}} theatrical style: everything pops {{off the screen}} a little bigger and bolder than life, but the effect, rather than intensifying the emotions, calls attention to itself. Instead of losing myself in the story, I often felt {{on the outside looking}} in, appreciating the craftsmanship, but one step removed from the agony on display.

That's true; it is a very useful trick. I've used that on Percy and I've used that to a degree on Tonks in this book, as a red herring. But having said that, I disagree inasmuch as mine are very character-driven books, and it's so important, therefore, that we see these characters fall in love, which is a necessary part of life." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Roger Ebert, on {{his review}} of Fat City, [...] "His fascination with underdogs and losers. The {{characters}} in Huston movies hardly ever set out to achieve what they're aiming for. Sam Spade, in The Maltese Falcon, Huston's first film, ends up minus one partner and one woman {{he thought he could}} trust. Everyone is a loser in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and the gold blows back into the dust and is lost in it. Ahab, in Moby Dick. Marlon Brando's career Army officer in Reflections in a Golden Eye, even Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen – they all fall short of their plans. The African Queen does have a happy ending, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> tacked-on and ridiculous, and the Queen destroys itself in destroying the German steamer. So this [...] is a theme we find in Huston's work, but rarely does he fit it to characters and a time and place so well as in Fat City. Maybe that's because Huston knows the territory: he was a professional boxer himself for a while, and not a very good one." ...|$|E

[...] Bill Lamb, writer of About.com, gave to the song 3 stars out of 5, praising the [...] "catchy hook" [...] and the [...] "upbeat, happy melody", but criticized the track, calling it a [...] "bland hit factory pop" [...] and [...] "faceless". He ended up the review, stating that [...] "it's certainly catchy, but it is all rather bland and empty as well." [...] The Idolator Staff agreed, writing that [...] "On the one hand, it’s a totally serviceable dance track, and Sabi’s vocals are much stronger here than in her weak, cringe-inducing rap on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", but on the other hand, we’ve heard this synth hook before from other artists and frankly, it sounds like Cobra Starship may be trying too hard {{to keep up with the}} Euro dance trend while totally abandoning their old sound."

2500|$|Rihanna began {{recording}} {{songs for}} the album in April 2009. The recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} Milk Studios in Manhattan, New York, Metropolis Studios in London, England, Studios Davout in Paris, France and at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Rihanna worked with several different songwriters and producers on the album, including Chuck Harmony, The-Dream, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart, Chase & Status, StarGate, Demo, and Justin Timberlake. Rihanna wanted the album to be less influenced by synthpop, attempting to avoid the lighthearted commercial pop of her previous albums. By doing so, she incorporated a production style with more bass, and utilized Gothic imagery. In {{the early stages of}} the production, she worked with Adonis Shropshire, who stated that Rihanna had brainstormed a large number of ideas over the course of a few weeks. Rihanna also worked with Norwegian producer duo StarGate, who mused that the collaboration was [...] "very rewarding" [...] and [...] "inspiring for us", commenting: [...] "I don't think we should talk about titles just yet. We don't really know which songs are gonna make it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> exciting."

2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E
