40|$|Composers {{of popular}} music weave lyrics, melody, and {{instrumentation}} {{together to create a}} consistent and compelling emotional scene. The relationships among these elements are critical to musical communication, and understanding the statistics behind these relationships can contribute to numerous problems in music information retrieval and creativity support. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study on a large symbolic database {{of popular music}}; our results identify several patterns in the relationship <b>between</b> <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melody.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{revealed}} how Japanese speakers pronounce English words differently. However, not much research has explained {{the causes of}} the difference, let alone relating such difference with native language interference. By drawing a comparison between the sound structures of the English and Japanese languages using Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH), we will see how native language may influence foreign language USAge and cause pronunciation differences in popular songs. Transcriptions of three AKB 482 ̆ 7 s songs – Heavy Rotation, Sugar Rush, and Namida Surprise – will be used as the data sources to determine native language interference. Our findings show that additions of vowel sounds, changes of syllable, changes of height and place of vowel articulation, replacements of a consonant with another consonant, and elisions of consonants happened to the English words across the three songs. These phonetic changes should inform discussions about the relationship <b>between</b> <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melody</b> in songs that incorporate two or more languages (i. e., bilingual) ...|$|E
40|$|Findings on song {{perception}} and song production have increasingly suggested that common but partially distinct neural networks exist for processing lyrics and melody. However, the neural substrates of song recognition {{remain to be}} investigated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the neural substrates involved in the accessing "song lexicon" as corresponding to a representational system that might provide links between the musical and phonological lexicons using positron emission tomography (PET). We exposed participants to auditory stimuli consisting of familiar and unfamiliar songs presented in three ways: sung lyrics (song), sung lyrics on a single pitch (lyrics), and the sung syllable 'la' on original pitches (melody). The auditory stimuli were designed to have equivalent familiarity to participants, and they were recorded at exactly the same tempo. Eleven right-handed nonmusicians participated in four conditions: three familiarity decision tasks using song, lyrics, and melody and a sound type decision task (control) that was designed to engage perceptual and prelexical processing but not lexical processing. The contrasts (familiarity decision tasks versus control) showed no common areas of activation <b>between</b> <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melody.</b> This result indicates that essentially separate neural networks exist in semantic memory for the verbal and melodic processing of familiar songs. Verbal lexical processing recruited the left fusiform gyrus and the left inferior occipital gyrus, whereas melodic lexical processing engaged the right middle temporal sulcus and the bilateral temporo-occipital cortices. Moreover, we found that song specifically activated the left posterior inferior temporal cortex, which may serve as an interface between verbal and musical representations in order to facilitate song recognition...|$|E
5000|$|Maria Sherman of Fuse {{compared}} the track {{to the music}} of American band The Killers [...] "with a purposeful-youth tinge", while describing the beat of the bridge as [...] "pulsing". Additionally, Jacob Testa of Mind Equals Blown compared it with the works of bands Passion Pit and The Darkness. Adam R. Holz of Plugged In opined that [...] "Fake You Out" [...] talks about [...] "how hard it is to tell people the truth about ourselves, even those to whom we're supposedly the closest" [...] and pointed out references to suicide. Laura Coulter stated that the lyrics, especially the rap verse, talk about depression. Some publications noted a contrast <b>between</b> the song's <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melody.</b> Craig Roxburgh of Mind Equals Blown commented that the track [...] "does as the title says and fakes happiness with its beat, when it is in fact a rather sad song lyrically".|$|R

40|$|International audienceSongs {{constitute}} a natural combination of <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melodies,</b> {{but it is}} unclear whether and how these two song components are integrated during the emergence of a memory trace. Network theories of memory suggest a prominent role of the hippocampus, together with unimodal sensory areas, in the build-up of conjunctive representations. The present study tested the modulatory influence of the hippocampus on neural adaptation to songs in lateral temporal areas. Patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and healthy matched controls were presented with blocks of short songs in which lyrics and/or melodies were varied or repeated in a crossed factorial design. Neural adaptation effects were taken as correlates of incidental emergent memory traces. We hypothesized that hippocampal lesions, particularly in the left hemisphere, would weaken adaptation effects, especially the integration of <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melodies.</b> Results revealed that lateral temporal lobe regions showed weaker adaptation to repeated lyrics as well as a reduced interaction of the adaptation effects for <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melodies</b> in patients with left hippocampal sclerosis. This suggests a deficient build-up of a sensory memory trace for <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> a reduced integration of lyrics with melodies, compared to healthy controls. Patients with right hippocampal sclerosis showed a similar profile of results although the effects did not reach significance in this population. We highlight the finding that the integrated representation of <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melodies</b> typically shown in healthy participants is likely tied to the integrity of the left medial temporal lobe. This novel finding provides the first neuroimaging evidence for the role of the hippocampus during repetitive exposure to <b>lyrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> their integration into a song...|$|R
