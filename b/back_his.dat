5|$|Abraham Landis {{worked in}} Millville {{as a country}} physician. When Kenesaw was eight, the elder Landis moved his family to Delphi, Indiana and {{subsequently}} to Logansport, Indiana where the doctor purchased and ran several local farms—his war injury had caused him to scale <b>back</b> <b>his</b> medical practice. Two of Kenesaw's four brothers, Charles Beary Landis and Frederick Landis, became members of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his <b>back.</b> <b>His</b> daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that he had enough support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to <b>back</b> <b>his</b> nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E

5|$|During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a {{civil war}} between the Parthians later took place, which gave him the {{opportunity}} to escape prison. He took refuge with Augustus, who received him with friendliness, gave him <b>back</b> <b>his</b> daughter Iotapa and made him a Client King of Lesser Armenia. He died around 20 BC probably in Rome. Artavasdes I was succeeded in the Kingship of Media Atropatene by Asinnalus.|$|E
5|$|During the 1989 season, 11–year veteran Ottis Anderson, a Plan B Free Agent, {{emerged as}} the Giants new {{featured}} running <b>back.</b> <b>His</b> style of power running was an ideal fit for Parcells' offensive strategy and he ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531yards and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats {{was a member of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the {{escalating}} tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding <b>back</b> <b>his</b> poetry inspired by the events until 1920.|$|E

He respects Bhairava for his valour but {{believes}} that he will die in battle and consequently requests that Bhairava hold <b>back</b> <b>his</b> love for Mithra. Vikram is murdered by Ranadev when Sher Khan invades the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} efforts thus far, Manuel {{headed back to}} Constantinople. On their way <b>back,</b> <b>his</b> troops were {{surprised}} in line of march by the Turks. Despite this, they won a complete victory, routing the enemy army {{from the field and}} inflicting heavy losses. In the following year, Manuel drove the Turks out of Isauria.|$|E
5|$|Third ending: The narrator re-appears {{outside the}} house at 16 Cheyne Walk and turns <b>back</b> <b>his</b> pocket watch by fifteen minutes. Events {{are the same as}} in the second-ending version until Charles meets Sarah, when their reunion is sour. The new ending does not make clear the {{parentage}} of the child and Sarah expresses no interest in reviving the relationship. Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, wondering whether Sarah is a manipulative, lying woman who exploited him.|$|E

5|$|Cersei Lannister {{meets with}} Tommen Baratheon, who {{brings up the}} High Sparrow. Tommen is {{reluctant}} to provoke him, but Cersei says he is dangerous because he has no respect for the Crown. Tommen tells Cersei that Margaery's walk of atonement will happen soon. Cersei relays the information to Kevan Lannister and Olenna Tyrell in the Small Council chamber. Tyrell is horrified and pledges her army to defeat the Sparrows. Kevan has been ordered not to attack by Tommen, but agrees to stand down his army after Cersei says that by destroying the Sparrows he can have <b>back</b> <b>his</b> son Lancel, who {{is part of the}} order, and that Tommen will forgive him when he has Margaery back.|$|E
5|$|Despite the odds, {{a sizable}} force had mustered in Europe under his banner, {{defeating}} Murad II's subordinates. Murad II's furious reply eventually smashed this upstart and, in 1422, began the Siege of Thessalonica and Constantinople. John VIII {{then turned to}} his aging father, Manuel II, for advice. The result was that he incited yet another rebellion in the Ottoman ranks — this time supporting Murad II brother's claim, Kucuk Mustafa. The seemingly promising rebellion had its origins in Asia Minor with Bursa coming under siege. After a failed assault on Constantinople, Murad II was forced to turn <b>back</b> <b>his</b> army and defeat Kucuk. With these defeats, the Byzantines were forced once more into vassalage — 300,000 coins of silver were to be delivered to the Sultan as tribute on an annual basis.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{took part}} in the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland and in 1172 was made Lord of Meath; he spent much time away from Ludlow, and HenryII confiscated the castle in his absence, probably to ensure that Hugh stayed loyal while in Ireland. Hugh died in Ireland in 1186 and the castle passed to his son, Walter, who was a minor and did not take charge of the property until 1194. During Prince John's rebellion against Richard I in 1194, Walter joined in the attacks against the prince; Richard did not approve of this and confiscated Ludlow and Walter's other properties. Walter de Lacy offered to buy <b>back</b> <b>his</b> land for 1,000marks, but the offer was rejected until in 1198 the vast sum of 3,100marks was finally agreed.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, Bethe {{accepted}} an appointment {{as an assistant}} professor at the University of Tübingen, where Hans Geiger was the professor of experimental physics. One of the first laws passed by the new National Socialist government was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Due to his Jewish background, Bethe was dismissed from his job at the University, which was a government post. Geiger refused to help, but Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe <b>back</b> <b>his</b> fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places for Jewish students and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Burnet scaled <b>back</b> <b>his</b> {{laboratory}} work, {{taking one}} day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E
5|$|In 33 BC Antony met his {{coalition}} {{partner on}} the river Araxes; they agreed that Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median King should help Antony against Octavian. They interchanged parts of their troops. The domain of Artavasdes I was enlarged with parts of Armenia. Antony had returned a standard that the Median king had taken from Oppius Statianus in 36 BC, and also took Iotapa along with him. With {{the help of the}} Roman reinforcements Artavasdes I was initially able to repulse the Parthian attack. Before the Battle of Actium, Antony called <b>back</b> <b>his</b> Roman troops without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time Phraates IV defeated Artavasdes I who was captured in 30 BC.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring <b>back</b> <b>his</b> other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|Just when Caroline {{thinks she}} {{has managed to}} win Mac <b>back,</b> <b>his</b> former girlfriend Holly (Sally Phillips) returns to the hospital, to replace Angela. Things become even worse when it is {{discovered}} that she never had the abortion that {{was the cause of}} Mac and Holly's breakup years ago, and that Mac has a son. Caroline distances herself from Mac, and Guy starts {{to fall in love with}} her. Caroline however seems to have feelings for Jake Leaf (Darren Boyd), a complementary therapist. Guy takes actions into his own hands and throws a Swiss army knife into Jake's head. Sue then discovers that Holly is lying, that Mac is not her son's father after all. Holly leaves the hospital. Caroline dumps Jake and then tries to impress Mac again.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly scaled <b>back</b> <b>his</b> {{participation}} in Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1938–39 season, making himself unavailable {{for most of}} the campaign to spend time with his newborn son after half a year in England; he played in only two matches, against South Australia and arch-rivals Victoria. He took a ten-wicket haul in the latter match, but his figures of 6/152 and 4/60 were not enough to prevent defeat. Both teams were at full strength and eight of O'Reilly's victims were Test players, including batsman Lindsay Hassett twice. O'Reilly's only other match was for Bradman's XI against Rigg's XI in a match to commemorate the centenary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, in which he took a total of 7/129, to end the season with 19 wickets at 23.16.|$|E
