5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours <b>before</b> <b>bedtime</b> is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just <b>before</b> <b>bedtime,</b> requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack <b>before</b> <b>bedtime.</b> Lastly, limiting intake of liquids <b>before</b> <b>bedtime</b> can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities <b>before</b> <b>bedtime</b> is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly <b>before</b> <b>bedtime</b> or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly <b>before</b> <b>bedtime.</b> Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

25|$|Insomnia is {{a general}} term for {{difficulty}} falling asleep and staying asleep. Insomnia {{is the most common}} sleep problem, with many adults reporting occasional insomnia, and 10–15% reporting a chronic condition. Insomnia can have many different causes, including psychological stress, a poor sleep environment, an inconsistent sleep schedule, or excessive mental or physical stimulation in the hours <b>before</b> <b>bedtime.</b> Insomnia is often treated through behavioral changes like keeping a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating or stressful activities <b>before</b> <b>bedtime,</b> and cutting down on stimulants such as caffeine. The sleep environment may be improved by installing heavy drapes to shut out all sunlight, and keeping computers, televisions and work materials out of the sleeping area.|$|E

25|$|A 2010 {{review of}} {{published}} scientific research suggested that exercise generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep {{disorders such as}} insomnia. The optimum time to exercise may be 4 to 8 hours <b>before</b> <b>bedtime,</b> though exercise {{at any time of}} day is beneficial, with the exception of heavy exercise taken shortly <b>before</b> <b>bedtime,</b> which may disturb sleep. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia. Although these nonbenzodiazepine medications are generally believed to be better and safer than earlier generations of sedatives, they have still generated some controversy and discussion regarding side-effects. White noise appears to be a promising treatment for insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Lifestyle {{alterations}} {{to address}} the symptoms of BPH include physical activity, decreasing fluid intake <b>before</b> <b>bedtime,</b> moderating the consumption of alcohol and caffeine-containing products and following a timed voiding schedule.

25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours <b>before</b> <b>bedtime</b> and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles.

2500|$|Melatonin {{taken an}} hour or so <b>before</b> the usual <b>bedtime</b> may induce sleepiness.

In accordance with its phase response curve (PRC), a very small dose of melatonin can also, or instead, be taken some hours earlier as an aid to resetting the body clock; it must then be small enough not to induce excessive sleepiness.|$|R

25|$|Studies {{have also}} shown that {{children}} who are on the Autism spectrum or have learning disabilities, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or related neurological diseases can benefit from the use of melatonin. This is because they often have trouble sleeping due to their disorders.

Another cause of insomnia in children with ADHD is the use of stimulants used to treat their disorder.

40|$|Abstract: Life in 24 -h society {{relies on}} the use of {{artificial}} light at night that might disrupt synchronization of the endogenous circadian timing system to the solar day. This could {{have a negative impact on}} sleep–wake patterns and psychiatric symptoms. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of evening light emitted by domestic and work place lamps in a naturalistic setting on melatonin levels and alertness in humans. Healthy subjects (6 male, 3 female, 22 – 33 years) were exposed to constant dim light (< 10 lx) for six evenings from 7 : 00 p. m. to midnight. On evenings 2 through 6, 1 h <b>before</b> habitual <b>bedtime,</b> they were also exposed to light emitted by 5 different conventional lamps for 30 min. Exposure to yellow light did not alter the increase of melatonin in saliva compared to dim light baseline during (38 ± 27 pg/mL vs. 39 ± 23 pg/mL) and after light exposure (39 ± 22 pg/mL vs. 44 ± 26 pg/mL).

2500|$|Blue light, principally around 460 to 480nm, {{suppresses}} melatonin, {{proportional to}} the light intensity and length of exposure.

40|$|BackgroundInsomnia is a {{major public}} health problem in western countries. Previous small pilot studies showed that the {{administration}} of constant white noise can improve sleep quality, increase acoustic arousal threshold, and reduce sleep onset latency. In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the effect of surrounding broadband sound administration on sleep onset latency, sleep architecture, and subjective sleep quality in healthy subjects. MethodsEighteen healthy subjects were studied with two overnight sleep studies approximately one week apart. They were exposed in random order to normal environmental noise (40. 1 [1. 3][*]dB) or to broadband sound administration uniformly distributed in the room by two speakers (46. 0 [0. 9][*]dB). To model transient insomnia, subjects went to bed (“lights out”) 90 [*]min <b>before</b> usual <b>bedtime.</b> ResultsBroadband sound administration reduced sleep onset latency to stage 2 sleep (time from lights out to first epoch of non-rapid eye movement-sleep stage 2) (19 [16] vs. 13 [23][*]min, p[*]=[*] 0. 011; median reduction 38 % baseline).

40|$|Rationale Pharmacokinetics of {{melatonin}} {{in children}} might differ {{from that in}} adults. Objectives This study aims to establish a dose–response relationship for melatonin in advancing dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), sleep onset (SO), and reducing sleep onset latency (SOL) in children between 6 and 12 years with chronic sleep onset insomnia (CSOI). Methods The method {{used for this study}} is the randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Children with CSOI (n= 72) received either melatonin 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 15 mg/kg or placebo during 1 week. Sleep was assessed with log and actigraphy during this week and the week before. Outcomes were the shifts in DLMO, SO, and SOL. Results Treatment with melatonin significantly advanced SO and DLMO by approximately 1 h and decreased SOL by 35 min. Within the three melatonin groups, effect size was not different, but the circadian time of administration (TOA) correlated significantly with treatment effect on DLMO (rs=− 0. 33, p= 0. 022) and SO (rs=− 0. 38, p= 0. 004), whereas clock TOA was correlated with SO shift (r=− 0. 35, p= 0. 006) and not with DLMO shift. Conclusions No dose–response relationship of melatonin with SO, SOL, and DLMO is found within a dosage range of 0. 05 – 0. 15 mg/kg. The effect of exogenous melatonin on SO, SOL, and DLMO increases with an earlier circadian TOA. The soporific effects of melatonin enhance the SO shift. This study demonstrates that melatonin for treatment of CSOI in children is effective in a dosage of 0. 05 mg/kg given at least 1 to 2 h before DLMO and <b>before</b> desired <b>bedtime...</b>|$|R
