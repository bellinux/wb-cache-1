5|$|The continuo part {{is played}} by organ, <b>bassoon,</b> cello and violone in most {{movement}}s. In the 1723 version movement 10 (Suscepit Israel) has a bassett (Ba) part played exclusively by violins and viola in unisono. In the 1733 version this continuo line is given to a continuo that includes cello, but not <b>bassoon</b> and violone.|$|E

5000|$|This concerto [...] "has {{clarinets}} besides <b>bassoons</b> {{and string}} for accompaniment. They bring warmth and light colouring to this most attractive work, {{and in spite}} of unadventurous support they partner the <b>bassoons</b> in many typical phrases." ...|$|R
5|$|Unusually, {{the score}} omits oboes, English horns, bass clarinets, and trumpets. The <b>bassoons,</b> contrabassoons, and trombones play {{only in the}} first movement, and {{only for a few}} bars (<b>bassoons</b> and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).|$|R
50|$|The symphony is scored for two oboes, two <b>bassoons,</b> two {{horns and}} strings. In {{contemporary}} orchestras, it was usual to not {{write in the}} parts for the <b>bassoons</b> and harpsichord, and they would simply double the cellos and double basses if they were available in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line and act as the continuo; however, the <b>bassoons</b> in this symphony do not simply double the cellos and double basses. The duration is approximately 13 minutes.|$|R

5|$|In Grove, Nichols {{divides the}} chamber works into three clearly {{differentiated}} periods. The first four sonatas {{come from the}} early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and <b>bassoon</b> (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo divertissements alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity– less than ten minutes each– their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the Rapsodie nègre, FP 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the Trio for oboe, <b>bassoon</b> and piano (1926).|$|E

5|$|The cantata {{has seven}} movements, and is scored festively with four vocal parts and a Baroque {{orchestra}} of three trumpets, timpani, three oboes, <b>bassoon,</b> strings and continuo. Bach derived {{the music of}} the opening chorus from his Hunting Cantata, composed already in 1713.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} English cross-disciplinary music ensemble North Sea Radio Orchestra {{have recorded}} a small-ensemble instrumental {{version of the}} piece arranged for two violins, cello, clarinet, <b>bassoon,</b> oboe, piano, vibraphone, chamber organ and guitar. This appears on their 2008 album Birds.|$|E
5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, <b>bassoon,</b> violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The <b>bassoon</b> sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, an opening instrumental sinfonia and four choral movements interspersed by only two arias. He scored it for four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, {{and a small}} Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), <b>bassoon</b> (obbligato) (Fg) and basso continuo. The duration of the cantata is about 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in {{two parts}} of six movements each. It is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir (SATB), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three oboes (Ob), <b>bassoon</b> (Fg), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo.|$|E

5|$|The cantata is scored festively {{for three}} vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque {{instrumental}} ensemble of three corni da caccia (Co), timpani (Ti, listed with the winds), <b>bassoon</b> (Fg), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo.

Elgar regularly played the <b>bassoon</b> in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second <b>bassoon</b> doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E
