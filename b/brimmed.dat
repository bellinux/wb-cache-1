5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. The hat was normally a floppy, wide <b>brimmed,</b> woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|A shield {{in front}} of a mantle or cloak may be found among bishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches. However, some Eastern ecclesiastical {{variations}} omit the mantle but retain the mitre, cross and staff. Maronite bishops traditionally display a pastoral staff behind the shield, topped with a globe and cross or a cross within a globe. Eastern Catholic bishops may follow the Roman style with a low crowned, wide <b>brimmed</b> ecclesiastical hat, although the shield itself is often rendered in a Byzantine artistic style, and a mitre if present would be in the appropriate liturgical style.|$|E
5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk. The figure atop the granite obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long coat, a cape, and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing {{on the east side of}} the base, is dressed in a <b>brimmed</b> hat and short jacket.|$|E
5|$|Within Presbyterian Church heraldry, a minister's hat is {{represented}} as black {{with a single}} tassel on each side, sometimes blue, though a doctoral bonnet or Geneva cap may replace the <b>brimmed</b> hat. Clergy of the Chapel Royal display red tassels. The office of moderator does not have corporate arms, but for official occasions, a moderator may add tassels to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod. The moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten tassels on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield {{as can be seen}} in vol 41, p 152 of the Scots Public Register.|$|E
25|$|From 1987 to 2008, the red <b>brimmed,</b> primary home cap {{was also}} worn on the road. However, when the navy blue jerseys were {{introduced}} in 2008, they were paired with a navy blue cap, similar to the team's road cap worn from 1966 to 1971. While the red <b>brimmed</b> cap was still primarily worn with the gray road uniforms, the team sometimes wore the navy blue cap with the gray jerseys, and the red <b>brimmed</b> cap was occasionally worn with the navy blue jerseys. The red <b>brimmed</b> home batting helmets were also worn on the road from 1987 through 2008. Beginning in 2009, the navy blue cap became the official road cap and was paired with a navy blue road batting helmet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the 12th century the <b>brimmed</b> ‘chapel de fer’ helmet begins to be {{depicted}} and is, perhaps, a Byzantine development.|$|E
25|$|In Maramureș, {{traditional}} straw hats (clop, pl. clopuri) {{are very}} small, while in Satu Mare, Arad, Transylvanian Plain hats {{have a high}} crown. The tallest – around 30cm – {{can be found in}} Codru. In Oltenia and Teleorman, along the Danube, flat <b>brimmed</b> straw hats with rounded crown are worn. In Maramureș and Oaș Country, men also often wear their clopuri in the winter.|$|E
25|$|During the Paraguayan War between Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay versus Paraguay, Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan {{troops and}} {{officers}} primarily wore kepis (although many Brazilian troops wore <b>brimmed</b> hats, and Uruguayan and Argentine light infantry wore shakos). The Paraguayans mostly wore leather shakos, but senior officers were given kepis. Leather kepis were however issued as a forage cap to Paraguayan troops, {{and because of}} poor supply standards, were often seen in combat.|$|E
25|$|Hard {{felt hats}} {{are made by}} {{specialised}} craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița {{and may have been}} introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide <b>brimmed</b> hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and felt hats with broad brims up to 60cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. Hats with 40cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and Muntenia. Felt hats with hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry. Wide <b>brimmed</b> felt hats with a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear felt hats with very small brims, the present day fashion tending {{to do away with the}} brim altogether.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{majority}} of female figures in ancient Indian sculptures are devoid of a blouse, there are several instances of ancient Indian women wearing bras. The first historical reference to bras in India is found during the rule of King Harshavardhana (1st century AD). Sewn bras and blouses were very much in vogue during the Vijayanagara empire and the cities <b>brimmed</b> with tailors who specialized in tight fitting of these garments. The half-sleeved tight bodice or kanchuka figures prominently {{in the literature of}} the period, especially Basavapurana (1237 AD), which says kanchukas were worn by young girls as well.|$|E
25|$|Major {{clothing}} brands {{associated with}} bushwear are the broad <b>brimmed</b> Akubra hats, Driza-Bone coats and R.M. Williams bushmen's outfitters (featuring in particular: moleskin trousers, riding boots and merino woolwear). Blundstone Footwear and Country Road are also linked to this tradition. Made from {{the leaves of}} Livistona australis, the cabbage tree hat was the first uniquely Australian headwear, {{dating back to the}} early 1800s, and was the hat of choice for colonial-born Australians. Traditionally worn by jackaroos and swagmen in the blow-fly infested Australian outback, the cork hat is a type of headgear strongly associated with Australia, and comprises cork strung from the brim, to ward off insects.|$|E
25|$|The modern uniform {{was first}} issued {{at the start}} of the 1999 season. The overshirt was changed to the grey base with red piping and sleeves {{shortened}} so the undershirt was visible and pants were changed to grey with red piping. Also the socks changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002–2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red <b>brimmed</b> cap instead of the traditional red for night games played on a Friday night. The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned.|$|E
25|$|The 28th Arkansas Infantry mustered by {{companies}} and conducted its initial training near Fort Smith, Arkansas, {{on what the}} locals called the Mazzard Prairie. Initially, the regiment was poorly equipped; however, they were eventually supplied with modern Springfield rifle-muskets that had been captured at the First Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, and transported west. The regiment gained a reputation {{as some of the}} most disciplined and martial looking then training on Mazzard Prairie. In the Spring of 1863 the men was issued standard Columbus Depot uniforms, generally made from light-grey jean material with an eight button single breasted frock coat having dark blue trim on its straight stand-up collar and straight cuffs. They also were issued one pair of matching trousers and a simple black felt hat. The regiment's commissioned officers were mostly men of means before to the war, and it is assumed they would have indulged themselves at the many commercial uniform outfitters. The 36th Arkansas's microfilm records include many Quartermaster receipts showing the officers purchased gold braid, coats, silk sashes, white cotton shirts, and large <b>brimmed</b> hats.|$|E
25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and <b>brimmed</b> cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E
25|$|Many {{men went}} bareheaded and, {{apart from the}} Emperor, they were {{normally}} so in votive depictions, which may distort the record we have. In the late Byzantine period a number of extravagantly large hats were worn as uniform by officials. In the 12th century, Emperor Andronikos Komnenos wore a hat shaped like a pyramid, but eccentric dress {{is one of many}} things he was criticised for. This was perhaps related to the very elegant hat with a very high-domed peak, and a sharply turned-up brim coming far forward in an acute triangle to a sharp point (left), that was drawn by Italian artists when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos went to Florence and the Council of Ferrara in 1438 in {{the last days of the}} Empire. Versions of this and other clothes, including many spectacular hats, worn by the visitors were carefully drawn by Pisanello and other artists. They passed through copies across Europe for use in Eastern subjects, especially for depictions of the three kings or Magi in Nativity scenes. In 1159 the visiting Crusader Prince Raynald of Châtillon wore a tiara shaped felt cap, embellished in gold. An Iberian wide <b>brimmed</b> felt hat came into vogue during the 12th century. Especially in the Balkans, small caps with or without fur brims were worn, of the sort later adopted by the Russian Tsars.|$|E

500|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} differs notably {{from other}} heraldry {{in the use}} of special insignia around the shield to indicate rank in a church or denomination. The most prominent of these insignia is the low crowned, wide <b>brimmed</b> ecclesiastical hat, commonly the Roman galero. The color and ornamentation of this hat indicate rank. Cardinals are famous for the [...] "red hat", but other offices and other churches have distinctive hat colors, such as black for ordinary clergy and green for bishops, customarily with a number of tassels increasing with rank.|$|E
500|$|The noted New York fashion {{house of}} Mainbocher {{designed}} the uniforms. Their design services were secured, without cost, {{through the efforts}} of Mrs. James V. Forrestal, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The winter uniform was made from navy blue wool, worn with a white shirt and dark blue tie. [...] The jacket was single breasted and unbelted, with a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a <b>brimmed</b> hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. The summer uniform was much the same as the winter uniform, however, it was lighter in weight, made of white material and worn with white shoes. [...] Later, a gray and white striped, seersucker work uniform for summer was added, along with the wearing of slacks and dungarees when appropriate.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} costume {{was composed}} of a large, flowing red robe, over a matching red jumpsuit. A red, wide <b>brimmed</b> hat baring the circle-A insignia; a golden, metallic face mask; and red hood, completed the outfit. The folds of the robe concealed various weapons and gadgets. Breyfogle later expressed that the color scheme chosen held symbolic purpose. The red robes [...] "represented the blood of all the innocents sacrificed in war." [...] The gold cane, face mask, and circle-A symbol represented purity and spirituality. The connection to spirituality was also emphasized through the hat and loose fabric, which mimicked that of a priest. Breyfogle believed the loose clothes [...] " [...] better with a wide-brimmed hat. It's more of a colloquial style of clothing..." [...] However, observers have noted that Breyfogle's Christian upbringing may have also inspired the [...] "priestly analogy." ...|$|E
500|$|The uniforms {{worn by the}} SPARS {{were the}} same design and style as those worn by the WAVES, except for the service insignias; created for them by the New York fashion house of Mainbocher. The {{decision}} made regarding the type and style of the uniforms was largely that of the U.S. Navy Uniform Board. The standard uniform was a navy blue suit, consisting of a jacket and a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a <b>brimmed</b> hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. [...] The summer uniform was of the same design as the standard uniform, worn in white Palm Beach cloth, tropical worsted, or other light fabrics. Shoes were oxfords or pumps of white leather. The summer work wear was a grey and white striped seersucker dress with jacket.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every day when I wake up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media. Matthews explained {{in an interview that}} she wanted to turn to invert the idea of being Welsh from an apparent negative into a positive, [...] "We're not seen to be very good at anything. Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still {{wake up in the morning}} and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh. Hopefully by now people realise that Wales is <b>brimmed</b> full of talent and we're great people with massive brains." [...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The album became the first to be released for Catatonia in the United States, but failed to chart. The Washington Post called it [...] "overlooked".|$|E
500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx <b>brimmed</b> with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can I make it better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. [...] "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.|$|E
500|$|The ecclesiastical hat is a {{distinctive}} {{part of the}} achievement of arms of a Roman Catholic cleric. This hat, called a galero (or gallero), was originally a pilgrim's hat like a sombrero. It was granted in red to cardinals by Pope Innocent IV at the First Council of Lyon in the 13th century, and was adopted by heraldry almost immediately. The galero in various colors and forms was used in heraldic achievements starting with its adoption {{in the arms of}} bishops in the 16th century. In the 19th century the galero was viewed heraldically as specifically [...] "Catholic", but the Public Register of Arms in Scotland show Roman Catholic, presbyterian Church of Scotland and Anglican Episcopalian clergy all using the wide <b>brimmed,</b> low crowned hat. The galero is ornamented with tassels (also called houppes or fiocchi) indicating the cleric's current place in the hierarchy; the number became significant beginning in the 16th century, and the meaning was fixed, for Catholic clergy, in 1832. A bishop's galero is green with six tassels on each side; the color originated in Spain where formerly a green hat was actually worn by bishops. A territorial abbot was equivalent to a bishop and used a green galero. An archbishop's galero is green but has ten tassels. Bishops in Switzerland formerly used ten tassels like an archbishop because they were under the immediate jurisdiction of the Holy See and not part of an archiepiscopal province. Both patriarchs and cardinals have hats with fifteen tassels. A cardinal's hat is red or scarlet while a patriarch who is not also a cardinal uses a green hat; the patriarch's tassels are interwoven with gold. Primates may use the same external ornaments as patriarchs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} of 1946 Tolkien stated that he thought of Gandalf as an [...] "Odinic wanderer". Other {{commentators}} have also compared Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his [...] "Wanderer" [...] guise—an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide <b>brimmed</b> hat, and a staff.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>brimmed</b> hat called skiadion {{studded with}} pearls, with a neck-cover with the owner's name {{embroidered}} {{in gold and}} pendants [...] "similar {{to those of the}} emperor". The skiadion was an everyday headgear, but it was forbidden to despots who had not reached adolescence to wear it indoors. For ceremonies and festivities, the despot bore the domed skaranikon, decorated with gold metalwork, precious stones and pearls.|$|E
2500|$|The {{figure of}} Gandalf is {{particularly}} {{influenced by the}} Norse deity Odin in his incarnation as [...] "The Wanderer", {{an old man with}} one eye, a long white beard, a wide <b>brimmed</b> hat, and a staff. Tolkien, in a letter of 1946, nearly a decade after the character was invented, wrote that he thought of Gandalf as an [...] "Odinic wanderer". Much like Odin, Gandalf promotes justice, knowledge, truth, and insight.|$|E
2500|$|The unusual review order uniform {{worn by the}} {{regiment}} prior to the First World War included a wide <b>brimmed</b> black felt hat with a long flowing black plume of cocks feathers. This headdress was modeled on that of the Italian Bersaglieri and was unique in the British Empire. A dark green [...] "lancer" [...] style tunic was worn with white facings and chain mail epaulettes, together with dark blue [...] "overalls" [...] (tight fitting cavalry breeches) with white stripes.|$|E
2500|$|Operational Dress of Victoria Police {{consists}} of navy blue cargo/tactical pants, a navy blue long/short sleeved undergarment or shirt, an integrated operational equipment vest (IOEV), a navy blue baseball cap or a wide <b>Brimmed</b> hat (common in rural areas) and black boots. [...] When police members or protective service officers {{are assigned to}} duties where {{they are required to}} be easily identified, or for occupational health and safety reasons, a high-visibility yellow cover may be put on the IOEV.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{vertical}} emphasis, hair was pulled back at the sides and worn in a high knot or cluster of ringlets, often with a fringe (bangs) over the forehead. [...] False hair was commonly used. [...] Bonnets were smaller {{to allow for the}} elaborately piled hairstyles and resembled hats except for their ribbons tied under the chin. [...] Smallish hats, some with veils, were perched on top of the head, and <b>brimmed</b> straw hats were worn for outdoor wear in summer.|$|E
2500|$|Hoover's body lay {{in state}} in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, where Chief Justice Warren Burger eulogized him.

2500|$|The modern Indian Army wears {{distinctive}} parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garwhal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon and Naga Regiments wear broad <b>brimmed</b> hats {{of traditional}} style. Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the Rajputana Rifles) {{as well as}} the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry [...] wear rank badges, buttons and blackened wire embroidered articles of uniform in black instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from George himself, {{the only}} {{recurring}} {{character in the}} original adventures is the unnamed Man with the Yellow Hat. It was he who lured George into a trap with his hat, captured him in a bag, and forcibly brought him from Africa, and in his house that George lives. The Man often facilitates George's adventures by taking him somewhere, and even more often resolves the tension by intervening {{just in time to}} get George out of a tight spot. He is always seen wearing a bright yellow suit and a wide <b>brimmed</b> yellow hat. The Man is never mentioned by name in the original adventures or in any subsequent content over more than six decades.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approved}} headwear is {{the utility}} cover, an eight-pointed <b>brimmed</b> hat that is worn [...] "blocked", that is, creased and peaked. In the field, a boonie cover is also authorized. The trouser legs are [...] "bloused", or the cuffs are rolled inside and tightened over their boots with a spring or elastic band {{known as a}} [...] "boot band" [...] or [...] "blousing garter". With {{the introduction of the}} Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP), Marines now wear a color-coded rigger belt instead of the old web belt, indicating their level of proficiency in MCMAP (the web belt was phased out in 2008 due to a requirement for all Marines to achieve a tan belt rank by then).|$|E
2500|$|Companies of The Boys' Brigade used manuals on scout {{training}} in their programmes. In May 1903, Robert Baden-Powell became a vice-president. Baden-Powell promoted {{the idea of}} scouting and outdoor pursuits in the Boys' Brigade and other boys' organisations and schools. The Boys' Brigade formally began its boy scout scheme in 1906. Scout badges (Silver second class & Gold first class) were awarded in The Boys' Brigade and there were specialised Boys' Brigade Scout sections, which operated {{as part of a}} BB Company, but met at different times to train in scouting, who wore khaki or blue uniforms, neck scarves and the distinctive four dented broad <b>brimmed</b> fur felt hats. Boys of the Bournemouth & Poole Battalion of The Boys' Brigade participated in Baden-Powell's experimental camp on Brownsea Island in 1907. Baden-Powell did not originally intend to start a separate organisation.|$|E
2500|$|One {{location}} where cricket was being played was Bundaberg, where a ladies' town team {{had been established}} that was competing until as late as 1909. [...] Cricket players, like other female athletes of this era, dressed in ankle length skirts, wore long sleeved blouses, and wore a hat and tie. The uniforms {{made it difficult to}} play as they did not allow a full range of movement. [...] Another place where women played cricket on an all women's team was in Memerambi, a Queensland town that is to the southwest of Maryborough. In 1911, this team had several notable players including A. B. Postle who was the sister of the current world champion sprinter. By 1911, the skirts had changed to include fewer layers and allowed for greater movement of the legs. [...] This improvement was offset by the need to wear wide <b>brimmed</b> hats.|$|E
2500|$|The white home uniform, {{introduced}} in 1987, {{is the primary}} home uniform. The jersey has [...] "Braves" [...] written in script across the chest with the tomahawk logo underneath.

Player numbers appear {{on the back of the}} jersey with a nameplate above. The Braves script, player numbers, and piping are red with a navy blue border. The tomahawk is primarily red with blue and yellow detail and a navy blue border. The white pants have identical piping to the jersey about the belt loops and down the outside seam of the pants. The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a white nameplate. The player names originally used vertically arched lettering but, since 2006, the team has used radially arched lettering. The white uniform is paired with the standard home cap. It is a red <b>brimmed,</b> navy blue cap with a white embroidered [...] "script A" [...] logo.
