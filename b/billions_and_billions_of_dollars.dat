Our research on dynamic routing is meant to help minimizing this problem from individual perspective since we believe that traffic congestion is also directly related and can be influenced by individual’s decision making behavior. We focused on finding a solution that can be integrated to an existing system by using a routing algorithm that can forecast traffic congestion and finding the fastest route to get to the end point. The forecast will be based on the historical traffic information. Deriving on the notion that most traffic congestions happen almost at the same time during the day and the same hours daily, we have combined the historical real traffic data to be used in an algorithm to help an effective Dynamic Intelligent Algorithm for Navigation (DIANa) to avoid congestion or other road blockage.

40|$|In {{the end of}} 1920 s, {{there was}} a {{recession}} in the USA, which had disastrous consequences for the whole nation. Millions of people became unemployed, lost their property, and {{the situation in the}} country did not give reasons for optimism. During the great depression, the country was ruled by Herbert Hoover with his policy "drop on drop". Large problems require serious measures, and not administration in Hoover 2 ̆ 7 s way. USA came into even bigger recession, {{and that was the end}} of Hoover being president. After his bad administration during recession, it was logical for him to easily loose the next presidential elections in 1932 and to be remembered as a great loser. Presidential campaign in 1932 was mostly debate on causes and possible solutions of the crises. Herbert Hoover, who was unlucky to enter the White House only eight months before the Stock Exchange breakdown, fought tirelessly, but his efforts did not revive the economy. His democratic adversary, F. D. Roosevelt was already popular as a governor of the state of New York, during the crises. Roosevelt used to point out that depression originated in bad economical policy of Republicans during 1920 s. Hoover would answer that the economy was built on firm foundation, but it was shaken by crises in the world, beginnings of which date back to World War One. There was a clear implication behind this argument: Hoover had to count mostly on process on natural recovery, while Roosevelt was ready to use authorities of federal administration to make experimental attempts. The elections resulted in big victory of Roosevelt who won 22, 800, 000 of votes against Hoover 2 ̆ 7 s 15, 700, 000. The United States of America were entering an era of economic and political changes, started by Roosevelt in his New Deal programs. Although there were some inadequate effects, Roosevelt 2 ̆ 7 s program resulted in overcoming the recession, but it also made a way for the USA to become the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading economic power and to stay in that position until present tines, when their budget surplus annually amounts to <b>billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars...</b>|$|E

Hence the main objectives of the study was the determination of the role of NGOs in improving quality of life of its beneficiaries as well as to identify possible gaps among NGO and beneficiary interpretation of barriers for a quality life. The study was conducted in Southern Province of Sri Lanka, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods for better understanding of the issues. Quantitative study was carried as a survey, where a researcher administered questionnaire was used among a sample of 215 respondents. Four focus groups were used for the qualitative study, which each had five respondents. Quantitative study used 6 main areas, namely Social Freedom, Political Participation, Economic Access, Community Involvement and Personal Development to evaluate the role of NGOs. It concludes that NGOs should refrain themselves working related to securing Political Participation. There is no immediate need to improve Social Freedom; therefore current silence NGOs maintained in this area should be maintained. NGOs should keep up the good work and further expand their activities in relation with increasing Economic Access, increasing Community Involvement and improving Personal Development. While working with relation to Family Involvement should be done with lot of caution. Beneficiaries defined Quality of Life as Progress & Flourishing of the Children, ability to spend a Decent Life and spend that Life with Peace and Harmony. As far as first two components are concerned, NGOs are in the right track and doing a decent job, even though there are slight expectation differences. As far as spending a Peaceful and Harmonious life with family is concerned, NGOs are not expected to play a role. The study finally recommends the NGOs to apply a marketing oriented strategy by giving due consideration to donors as well as beneficiaries, thus allowing NGOs to narrow possible mismatches arising between two groups. This will increase the effectiveness of NGOs in improving quality of life of its beneficiaries...|$|E

40|$|I did {{not present}} at the conference. I was merely an attendee. The format of the conference was three rooms, and each room had a (usually) one hour {{presentation}} on a specific topic each hour from about 10 AM to 10 PM. Given the format, {{it was not possible}} to see all presentations. Let me say that I greatly appreciate the opportunity the A&PDF committee has provided me to attend this conference. The conference was educational, thought provoking, informative, and inspiring, if a little fear-inducing at times. The technical presentations that were most related to my job as a systems administrator at AU were "IPv 6 Playground", and "Wireless Security" (one of the presenters of the wireless security talk, Renderman, who I spoke with, is from Edmonton). The keynote talk by Dan Kaminsky, who literally holds one of seven keys that secure the Internet’s domain name system, was also quite technical. The IPv 6 discussion was illuminating in terms of how powerful a technology it is, how important, and how slow it’s adoption. I look forward to AU implementing IPv 6. Wireless Security was also very interesting in terms of how difficult it would be to efficiently secure a wireless network. Kaminsky’s talk went over several items, starting from the concept that the Internet was never designed for authentication (e. g [...] paraphrasing Kaminsky: “who cares about SVG resizing in the browser if we can’t securely handle authenticated sessions”) and that security considerations are brought too late into the design stage (”life is too short to defend broken code” says Kaminsky) to eventually flowing down into some innovative security concepts, such as using base 64 to encode strings to avoid injection and the problems with escaping Unicode symbols. For better or worse, the theme of this years HOPE conference was less technical and more related to what could be considered techno-democracy. I don't know if the organizers of the conference realized it, or if any attendees would agree, but it certainly seemed that there was considerably less focus on hard technical issues and more of a focus on privacy, journalism (the failure of newspapers being a hot button topic), and freedom of information [...] what one could term "soft security" rather than hard, technical issues. Talks such as “Grand Theft Lazlow”, “Privacy is Dead”, “From Indymedia to Demand Media” and others concentrated on many of these themes. I believe these soft threads were more powerful than specific technology at the conference because of the paradigm shift that has been occurring in the area of privacy [...] and not just online privacy, but the rapid alteration [...] some would say “erosion” [...] of privacy norms worldwide, as well as related efforts to maintain privacy and anonymity anonymity (e. g. Tor, encryption, Trackmenot) while using the Internet. There was a lot of democracy at work here. Google was a discussion point for several presenters, mostly regarding online privacy. For example, the talk “Privacy is Dead - Get over it” (the speaker is a working, highly regarded private detective) endearingly termed Google as “the mothership,” meaning that whenever an Internet user does something on the Internet (often but not always) using a google service, personal information is “beamed back up to the mothership. ” Humorous but also accurate. Google, Facebook, etc, store and cross-reference a stunning amount of information about their users. Because computing is very good at cross referencing data, for example with Google’s in-house technology MapReduce and Facebook using Hadoop, it is relatively easy to learn a lot about a single person through the knitting together of many separate pieces of information. That information is worth <b>billions</b> <b>and</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> for targeted advertising (e. g. Google has a market capitalization of 160 billion dollars, and most of that value is based on a single Google product: Adwords). These are extremely valuable companies simply because of their user data. Probably the most interesting part of the conference was the Wikileaks keynote speech. Politically, this was a very timely happening. Regardless of what one thinks of Wikileaks and their politics, news-wise this was quite the event. Julian Assange, the most visible Wikileaks member, was scheduled to give a talk regarding Wikileaks. However, given recent happenings the US government [...] which was in attendance through representatives of Homeland Security and the FBI, among others [...] had indicated that they would like to “speak” with Mr. Assange, and it was generally felt that should Mr. Assange step into US territory he would be detained by said agencies. Thus Mr. Assange did not show up to do his talk, instead another Wikileaks member gave the presentation. Interestingly, as much as the conference regarded soft security issues, hard technical systems, such as Tor, public key encryption, etc, are very important to creating security and anonymity for Wikileaks [...] which heavily relies on advanced technology to acquire and maintain anonymous leaks. Life and death literally hangs on the use and implementation of these technologies. I believe the biggest thing to take away from a conference such as this is that there are many dedicated people independently researching security and privacy issues and that the knowledge they posses is still only circulating in rather small circles. The Internet has brought large scale, rapid change to many areas of humanity, some for better and some for worse, and many of the attendees are attempting [...] often on their own, often utilizing technology [...] to reconcile, understand, and communicate that change. It was good to be a part of the discussion. The main visual theme of the conference is visions of the future from the past, so things that reference The World’s Fairs, The Jetsons, flying cars, DaVinci, Asimov, and so forth would be very appropriate. However, projects are not required to carry the central theme in any way. Some projects, such as OpenAMD, are already being planned to be simply visions of the future from the present, rather than referencing any futurist thoughts from antiquity. Some projects already in the works include… The Attendee Meta-Data Project (“OpenAMD”) An expansion of the RFID crowd tracking project from The Last Hope.
