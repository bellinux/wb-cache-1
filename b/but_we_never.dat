But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|In December 1994, Antestor {{recorded}} {{their first}} full-length album titled Martyrium. Arctic Serenades Records was originally supposed to release that album, {{but because of}} unknown reasons that never happened, and the band tried to get another label to release the album. American-based label Morphine Records would subsequently distribute bootleg copies of the album in 1997. In an interview, the drummer Armoth said: [...] "...we were in contact with a label called Morphine Records. But that was about signing a deal for the Martyrium album. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> signed a contract but that guy, Burrito, made several promotapes and sold {{every bit of it}} illegally 'cause he didn't have a contract." [...] However, the tape copies circulated in up to fifth generation copies and their audience grew fast. Martyrium was the last album that emphasized the band's death/doom direction.|$|E

[...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E

Leonnig from The Washington Post {{released}} an investigative report describing {{the details of}} the Secret Service's [...] "bungled" [...] response following the shooting. The Secret Service responded to the criticism, stating that the shots were fired from a quarter-mile away, resulting in echoes obfuscating their origin, and that initial witness accounts stated that the shots were fired at another vehicle from a black vehicle. An agent who asked to remain anonymous stated, [...] "I'm not saying this was our shining moment, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> stopped looking for [...]" [...] A former agent stated that the Secret Service needed to change its ways in order to prevent [...] "complacency" [...] and stop future attacks. As {{a direct result of the}} attack, additional security measures, such as personnel changes and physical improvements including additional surveillance cameras, were implemented at the White House. It was the first shooting at the White House since Francisco Martin Duran's fired shots at President Bill Clinton from the fence overlooking the north lawn on October 29, 1994.|$|E

500|$|Disney {{had been}} {{interested}} in producing abstract animation since he saw A Color Box by Len Lye from 1935. He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was [...] "no sudden idea... they were something we had nursed along several years <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> {{had a chance to}} try". Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns {{on the edge of a}} piece of sound film. In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger [...] "did was little triangles and designs... it didn't come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said." [...] Fischinger, like Disney, was used to having full control over his work and was not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939. Disney had plans to make the Toccata and Fugue an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.|$|E

500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy metal {{press and the}} release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches.

One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E
500|$|Manager Al López' {{decision}} not to start Pierce in the 1959 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers was highly controversial. After Cy Young Award winner Early Wynn started for Chicago in Game 1, Lopez chose to start Bob Shaw (18–6 in the regular season) and Dick Donovan (9–10) {{in the next two}} contests, which the White Sox lost by scores of 4–3 and 3–1. Pierce was held back until Game 4, and relieved in each of the final three games of the Series, allowing only two hits and no runs in four innings of work. In Game 4 he entered in the fourth inning with Chicago trailing 4–0, and pitched a hitless three innings before being pulled for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, when the Sox tied the game; the Dodgers went on to win 5–4. In Game 5 he entered in the eighth inning to protect a 1–0 lead, but only issued an intentional walk before Lopez again changed pitchers; the White Sox held on for the 1–0 win. Lopez even chose to start Wynn in Game 6 on two days' rest, but he was ineffective, and Chicago was behind 8–3 by the time Pierce was brought in to start the eighth inning; the Dodgers later added a run in the ninth inning to complete the 9–3 win and capture the Series championship. Being used out of the bullpen was a deep letdown for Pierce, who said in a 1982 interview, [...] "Other guys, Early Wynn and Bob Shaw, had better years than I did that year. And against the left-handed-heavy lineup the Dodgers threw at us, Al wanted his right-handers like Dick Donovan. There was no question I was disappointed, but I understood." [...] However, there have been suggestions that Lopez' decision had other, undisclosed motivations; noting his surprise that Lopez chose to use Pierce out of the bullpen, outfielder Al Smith recalled, [...] "We all knew why Al López didn't pitch him, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> told anyone and I won't say now. I will say that I thought he should have pitched. He'd been pitching all year, hadn't he?" ...|$|E
