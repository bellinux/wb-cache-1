40|$|Folic acid, as a {{water-soluble}} B-vitamin, is {{very important}} for women of childbearing age because of its key-role in many metabolic processes, particularly in cell growth and cell regeneration. A folic acid deficiency {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy could lead to defects of the spinal column, so-called neural tube defects. In contrast to adolescents and adults, who normally need about 400 microgram folate equivalents a day, pregnant and breastfeeding women are in need of 600 microgram. German-speaking countries document about 1 neural tube defect per 1000 births. In the case of recurrence, the risk is about 3 % and after a second occurrence about 10 %. On average, between 300. 000 and 400. 000 children are affected by these defects world-wide. In Austria the frequency ranges from 60 to 64 cases per year. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of neural tube defects can be reduced by the administration of folic acid before conception.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview about the non-cancer health effects for children from relevant chemical agents in our environment. In addition, a meta-analysis {{was conducted on the}} association between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and maternal smoking during pregnancy as well as postnatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In children, <b>birth</b> <b>deformities,</b> neurodevelopment, reproductive outcomes and respiratory system are mainly affected by chemical exposures. According to recent systematic reviews, evidence is sufficient for cognitive impairments caused by low lead exposure levels. Evidence for neurotoxicity from prenatal methylmercury exposure is sufficient for high exposure levels and limited for low levels. Prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and related toxicants results in cognitive and motor deficits. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a risk factor for preterm birth, foetal growth deficit and SIDS. The meta-analytic pooled risk estimate for SIDS based on 15 studies is 2. 94 (95 % confidence interval: 2. 43 - 3. 57). Postnatal exposure to ETS was found to increase the SIDS risk by a factor of 1. 72 (95 % CI: 1. 28 - 2. 30) based on six studies which took into account maternal smoking during pregnancy. Additionally, postnatal ETS exposure causes acute respiratory infections, ear problems, respiratory symptoms, more severe asthma, and it slows lung growth. These health effects are also of concern for postnatal exposure to ambient and indoor air pollution. Children differ from adults with respect to several aspects which are relevant for assessing their health risk. Thus, independent evaluation of toxicity in childhood populations is essentia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Prenatal alcohol-related {{disorders}} are highly prevalent {{and result in}} permanent, lifelong disabilities. The child may be born with debilitating <b>birth</b> <b>deformities</b> and severe cognitive deficits. These children have a low life expectancy, and a low quality of life. They are disproportionately represented in juvenile justice and foster homes, and {{they are more likely}} to be high school drop outs, incarcerated, or misdiagnosed, and have higher rates of mental illness. Despite these impairments, there are few state statutes in place that protect the rights of the fetus. This is because the fetus has not been recognized as a person. Feminist groups argue that if the fetus was granted personhood and rights, then women would be relegated to the inferior position of a fetal vessel. This paper addresses these concerns and advocates for state enforced mandatory rehabilitation for pregnant women who are addicted to substances. Mandatory rehabilitation has precedent and is a logical solution. Additionally, this paper investigates the controversy of whether there is a safe dosage that can be consumed while pregnant that will not harm the fetus. While there is no safe dosage found, and women are strongly advised to understand that an unnecessary risk is involved with any prenatal alcohol consumption, there is a body of evidence suggesting that low-level drinking may not have a clinically significant effect on the fetus. Thus, women should be allowed, within the law, to make the choice to drink lightly during pregnancy, because it is not assaulting the fetus. By drinking prenatally, the woman chooses not to provide the most optimal intrauterine environment. However, the fetus is not entitled to an optimally pregnancy, but is entitled to a non-assaulted developmen...|$|R

When post-weaning mortalities are added, the loss of potential replacement heifers in pastoral herds would be substantial, limiting the supply of breeding stock to peri-urban herds.

40|$|Many taxa {{are declining}} worldwide, {{and the cause}} of this decline has {{attracted}} massive concern (e. g. Caughley, 1994). One major contributor to endangerment has been habitat fragmentation, where a formerly wide-ranging taxon persists only as a series of small isolated populations (Knick and Rotenberry, 1995). Small isolated populations are not only more vulnerable to extinction through factors such as demographic and environmental stochasticity, but the loss of genetic variation may further increase the risk of extinction (e. g. Lande and Barrowclough, 1987; Madsen et al., 1999; Frankham et al., 2002). The Hungarian meadow viper (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis Méhely, 1893) {{is one of the most}} threatened snakes in Europe (e. g. Korsós, 1992; Ujvari et al., 2002). The former distribution of this taxon included the easternmost part of Austria, Hungary, Transylvania (Romania), and northern Bulgaria (Dely and Janisch, 1959). At present, however, small populations only exist in two regions of Hungary (in the Great Hungarian Plain between the rivers Danube and Tisza, and in the Hanság Nature Reserve, in north-western part of the country;Korsós, 1992). Since 1974 the meadow viper has received full legal protection in Hungary, with a present estimated nature conservation value of approximately 2000 EUR/specimen. Unfortunately, most of the few remaining wild populations are very small, fragmented and exhibit extremely low genetic diversity (Ujvari et al., 2002). In these population demographic and genetic factors have resulted in that the Hungarian meadow viper is suffering from severe inbreeding depression, resulting in chromosomal abnormalities, severe <b>birth</b> <b>deformities,</b> and low juvenile survival (Liptoi et al., 1999; Ujvari et al., 2000, 2002). The importance of maintaining large non-fragmented populations is further strengthened by the results from an Italian study where no such neonate abnormalities were documented from large, nonfragmented meadow viper populations (Filippi and Luiselli, 2004) ...|$|R

5000|$|Thus far, {{only three}} areas of {{research}} have garnered {{a limited amount of}} information regarding the effects of prenatal MA use on developing children, which include animals studies, a minimal number of human studies that have many limitations, and the recent cocaine literature. Though in recent years conducted by Pedro Melo, Vincente Zanon Moreno, Sheila Pons Vazquez, Maria Dolores Pinazo-Duran, Maria Amelia Tavares for the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Porto, Portugal researched rats who were exposed to MA use and its effects on the optic nerve myelination after prenatal exposure to this psycho-stimulant. It is known that MA use effects sensory systems and the optic nerve according to {{the results of this study}} proved to be a target tissue. It is often difficult to isolate psycho-stimulant use because often, the abusers of these substances are polydrug users, so animal studies are the closest thing to isolating the effects of just one psycho-stimulant. The Optic Nerve is suitable structure to look at because it is a well studied structure and homogeneous between species. At birth, for most species, the Optic Nerve is unmyelinated, but that changes with adulthood and most of the nerve becomes myelinated. In this study they gave doses of 5 mg/day from days 8 to 22 of pregnancy [...] The offspring were sacrificed at days 7,14, and 21. The treated MA group males had significantly smaller optic nerve diameter. The Optic Nerve area PND21 was significantly smaller than the unexposed control group. The cross section at this area also was significantly smaller. The final results concluded that there was an 80% increase in myelination on day 21, but only the female group. This is consistent with rapid aging of the Optic Nerve due to MA exposure. Western Blotting showed that postnatal days of 14 and 21 female group showed lower myelination basic protein level compared to the same control age group. [...] Though this study was conducted with the use of rats there is a high degree of similarity to rat and human anatomy, so this can be comparable to effects on humans. This cannot be confirmed though until MA exposed humans are studied postmortem. These studies, just as those of early prenatal cocaine exposure research, have a number of methodological problems that include small sample size and confounding due to maternal use of a variety of drugs. Yet, MA use in utero is believed to affect the development of a baby’s brain, spinal cord, heart, and kidney. [...] Studies have found short-term symptoms to include prenatal complications, such as premature delivery and <b>birth</b> <b>deformities,</b> along with strokes and brain hemorrhages prior to birth. Other investigations have revealed short-term neonatal outcomes to include small deficits in infant neurobehavioral function and growth restriction when compared to control infants.

Relata-se o caso de um cadáver de cadela, sem raça definida, de seis meses de idade, que ao ser submetido ao estudo anatomotopográfico revelou a presença de aplasia segmentar uterina (ASU) associada à hérnia de Morgagni (HM), agenesia ureteral (AU) e hipoplasia renal direita (HR). Além destas anormalidades, foi observada a presença de dextrocardia e de um defeito da parede abdominal supraumbilical, que caracterizam a forma incompleta da pentalogia de Cantrell, só descrita em humanos. O diagnóstico destas anormalidades foi baseado nos achados anatômicos e confirmado histologicamente. A despeito da raridade e complexidade das anormalidades descritas pela primeira vez em cadelas, a literatura sugeriu que o prognóstico pode ser favorável à vida do animal. Contudo, o diagnóstico precoce é essencial para se evitar as possíveis complicações destas patologias...|$|R

40|$|Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) {{is present}} in over one-third of the {{children}} investigated following urinary infection, and it is found in over 90 % of the children with renal scarring of chronic atrophic pyelonephritis [1]. New scars have been observed to develop only when infection occurs in a urinary tract in which the vesicoureteric valve is incompetent [1, 2]. Such coarse renal scarring {{is one of the}} commonest causes of hypertension in children [3] and {{is present in}} over 25 % of European children and young adults requiring dialysis or renal transplantation [4]. Apart from children with an obstruction to the outflow of urine (in whom the kidney is subjected to back pressure and is particularly vulnerable to infection), renal damage is most likely to be found among children with VUR. The early recognition of these susceptible children is obviously of the greatest importance. It is thought that VUR is generally present from <b>birth</b> and that <b>deformity</b> of the vesicoureteric junction with gross reflux may occasionally be part of a wider spectrum of congenital malformations of the urinary tract, though an aetiological role for infection has been proposed. Reflux may occur in more than one member of a family, and there are probably several modes of inheritance [5, 6]. Reflux tends to disappear with time. This has been observed in children [7 – 10]; it has been deduced in adults [11]; and it has been demonstrated in nonhuman primates [12]. In general, reflux is symptomless, and clinically the presence of VUR is usually unsuspected. Occasionally, in the older child or adult, transient loin pain may accompany micturition if there is marked reflux and the bladder has been allowed to become overdistended, with resulting distension of the renal pelvis. It may be suspected if residual urine is found on a second voiding within a few minutes of the first (double micturition). Because of the importance of early recognition of children with VUR and the lack of a noninvasive screening method for its detection, we have examined the clinical features of children presenting in hospital with urinary tract infection to determine whether there were any differences between those with and those without VUR...|$|R
