2500|$|Byrd's 1588 collection, which {{complicates the}} form as he {{inherited}} it from Robert Parsons, Richard Farrant and others, reflects this tradition. The [...] "psalms" [...] section sets texts drawn from Sternhold's psalter of 1549 {{in the traditional}} manner, while the 'sonnets and pastorals' section employs lighter, more rapid motion with crotchet (quarter-note) pulse, and sometimes triple metre (Though Amaryllis dance in green, If women could be fair). Poetically, the set (together with other evidence) reflects Byrd's involvement with the literary circle surrounding Sir Philip Sidney, whose influence at Court was at its height in the early 1580s. Byrd set three of the songs from Sidney's sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella, as well as poems by {{other members of the}} Sidney circle, and also included two elegies on Sidney's death in the Battle of Zutphen in 1586. But the most popular item in the set was the Lullaby (Lullay lullaby) which blends the tradition of the dramatic lament with the cradle-songs found in some early boy-plays and medieval mystery plays. It long retained its popularity. In 1602, Byrd's patron Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, discussing Court fashions in music, predicted that [...] "in winter lullaby, an owld song of Mr <b>Birde,</b> wylbee more in request as I thinke." ...|$|E

Long before Wordsworth, Thomas Watson, in his 'Epistle to the Frendly Reader' prefixed to his [Greek: EKATOMPATHIA] (1582), wrote: 'As for any Aristarchus, Momus, or Zoilus, if they pinch me {{more than}} is reasonable, thou, courteous Reader, which arte of a better disposition, shalt rebuke them in my behalfe; saying to the first [Aristarchus], that my <b>birdes</b> are al of mine own hatching,' &c.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{original}} names for the dodo was the Dutch [...] "Walghvogel", first used {{in the journal of}} Vice Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck, who visited Mauritius during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia in 1598. Walghe means [...] "tasteless", [...] "insipid", or [...] "sickly", and vogel means [...] "bird". The name was translated into German as Walchstök or Walchvögel, by Jakob Friedlib. The original Dutch report titled Waarachtige Beschryving was lost, but the English translation survived: On their left hand was a little island which they named Heemskirk Island, and the bay it selve they called Warwick Bay... Here they taried 12. daies to refresh themselues, finding in this place great quantity of foules twice as bigge as swans, which they call Walghstocks or Wallowbirdes being very good meat. But finding an abundance of pigeons & popinnayes parrots, they disdained any more to eat those great foules calling them Wallowbirds, that is to say lothsome or fulsome <b>birdes.</b> Another account from that voyage, perhaps the first to mention the dodo, states that the Portuguese referred to them as penguins. The meaning may not have been derived from penguin (the Portuguese referred to them as [...] "fotilicaios" [...] at the time), but from pinion, a reference to the small wings. The crew of the Dutch ship Gelderland referred to the bird as [...] "Dronte" [...] (meaning [...] "swollen") in 1602, a name that is still used in some languages. This crew also called them [...] "griff-eendt" [...] and [...] "kermisgans", in reference to fowl fattened for the Kermesse festival in Amsterdam, which was held the day after they anchored on Mauritius.|$|R

40|$|Is non-fiction also {{a part of}} children’ {{literature}}? In recent decades, children’s literature {{researchers have}} only considered fiction children’s literature (Maria Nikolajeva 1998 and Torben Weinreich 2004), and certain younger researchers has shown a tendency to write about experimental books by prize-winning authors (Bodil Kampp 2002). Very few researchers have shown an interest in non-fiction for children, and the consequence is that a great many publications for children have been overlooked. In the Nordic countries, Nina Goga’s doctoral thesis from 2008 is the only exception from this exclusive definition of children’s literature. In this article, I present a definition of children’s literature that includes non-fiction. In this definition, literature means ‛something written’ after ‛litera’ (Latin: letter). The purposes of the article are, on the one hand, to discuss different definitions and characteristics of non-fiction for children, {{and on the other hand}} to identify ways to analyze these books as literature for children. The article includes a discussion of a series of books about zoology by the Danish author Bent Jørgensen and the illustrator <b>Birde</b> Poulsen. One book in particular is discussed as an example of contemporary non-fiction and that is Om natten (In the Night, 2005). This book is subjected to analytical tools from literature studies, and one of the points is that non-fiction should be interpreted and described through a textanalytical approach...|$|E

The aim of {{this research}} is to study the influence of learning designed in accordance with Constructivist 5 E model activities on students?s academic success and their attitudes towards geography classes while teaching ?Environment and Society,? a secondary school 10 th grade subject. The basic research method is the pre-test/post-test experimental research technique with control groups. Throughout the research, a 40 -question Academic Success Test developed by the candidate has been used in order to measure the change in students?s success. In addition to this test, to observe students?s reception of geography class, Demirkaya (2003), and the ?Geography Class Behavioural Scale,? a likert scale developed by Co?kun (2004), have also been applied. Along with the 2 x 2 t-test (pre-test / post-test model with control groups), one-way variant test (repeated measures) has been adopted while analysing the sub-problems of the study and comparing the pre-test grades of test and control groups. The study has been carried out by studying on a test group and a control group from Y?ld?r?m Merkez ?mam Hatip Lycee 10 th grade students in the Spring term of 2010 - 2011 academic year. A total of 76 female students have kindly taken part in the study. Classes based on 5 E model have been conducted with the test group while teachers have been given the chance to choose and shape their teaching environment from other methods other than 5 E model for the control group. The results have shown that the test group exposed to Constructivist 5 E model has achieved considerable success and developed a keener behaviour towards geography classes in comparison with the control group students...|$|E
