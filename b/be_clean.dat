Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save {{near the end of}} the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when he seemed to <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> through on goal.|$|E
5|$|Living {{conditions}} were primitive in the camp, with trainees housed either under canvas in tents or in Nissen huts {{and they were}} responsible for cooking their own meals. Correct military protocols were enforced: Officers were saluted and uniforms had to <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> with brasses and boots shining on parade. At {{the end of each}} course the final exercise was a simulated night beach landing using live ammunition.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E

5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E

25|$|But Naaman's {{servants}} {{advised him}} that if Elisha had directed him to do some difficult thing {{he would have done}} it, so how much more should he do what Elisha directed when he said merely to wash and <b>be</b> <b>clean.</b> So Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh came back like the flesh of a little child.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Belgrand began {{rebuilding}} the water distribution and sewer system under the streets. In 1852 Paris had 142 kilometers of sewers, which could carry only liquid waste. Containers of solid waste were picked up each night by people called vidangeurs, who carried it to waste dumps {{on the outskirts of}} the city. The tunnels he designed were intended to <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> easily accessible, and substantially larger than the previous Parisian underground. Under his guidance, Paris's sewer system expanded fourfold between 1852 and 1869.|$|E

25|$|When Elisha heard, {{he invited}} the king to send Naaman to him, and so Naaman came to Elisha's {{house with his}} horses and his chariots. Elisha sent a {{messenger}} to Naaman {{to tell him to}} wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave his hands over Naaman. Naaman asked whether the Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, so that he might wash in them and <b>be</b> <b>clean.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> and oxygenated. One sign of high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans {{is the level of}} algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain.|$|E
25|$|Epoxy is more {{expensive}} than tape, but provides a greater mechanical bond between the heat sink and component, as well as improved thermal conductivity. The epoxy chosen must be formulated for this purpose. Most epoxies are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to the heat sink, and before the heat sink {{is placed on the}} component. The epoxy is then cured for a specified time, which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours. Faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures. The surfaces to which the epoxy is applied must <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> and free of any residue.|$|E

25|$|In Korea, {{unlike in}} China, Japan and Vietnam, the rice or soup bowl is not {{lifted from the}} table when eating from it. This {{is due to the}} fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing {{communal}} side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should <b>be</b> <b>clean,</b> because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal.|$|E
25|$|All mosques have rules {{regarding}} cleanliness, {{as it is}} {{an essential}} part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as wudu. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to <b>be</b> <b>clean</b> themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.|$|E
25|$|Charles did {{not learn}} to speak {{until the age of}} four nor to walk until eight, and was treated as {{virtually}} an infant until he was ten years old. His jaw was so badly deformed (an extreme example of the so-called Habsburg jaw) that he could barely speak or chew. Fearing the frail child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged {{to such an extent that}} at times he was not expected to <b>be</b> <b>clean.</b> When his illegitimate half-brother John of Austria the Younger obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair.|$|E
40|$|Let R be a {{commutative}} local ring. It is {{proved that}} R is Henselian if {{and only if}} each R-algebra which is a direct limit of module finite R-algebras <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean.</b> So, the matrix ring Mn(R) <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean</b> for each integer n> 0 if R is Henselian and we show that the converse holds if either the residue class field of R is algebraically closed or R is an integrally closed domain or R is a valuation ring. It is also shown that each R-algebra which is locally a direct limit of module-finite algebras, <b>is</b> strongly <b>clean</b> if R <b>is</b> a π-regular commutative ring. As in [10] a ring R <b>is</b> called <b>clean</b> if each element of R is the sum of an idempotent and a unit. In [8] Han and Nicholson proved that a ring R <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> {{if and only if}} Mn(R) <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> for every integer n ≥ 1. It is easy to check that each local ring <b>is</b> <b>clean</b> and consequently every matrix ring over a local ring <b>is</b> <b>clean.</b> On the other hand a ring R <b>is</b> called strongly <b>clean</b> if each element of R is the sum of an idempotent and a unit that commute. Recently, in [12], Chen and Wang gave an example of a commutative local ring R with M 2 (R) not strongly clean...|$|R
