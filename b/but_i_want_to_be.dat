They moved several times within Philadelphia in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site in Spring Garden. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith said that Virginia admitted, [...] "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy." [...] She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.|$|E
