25|$|Senator Johnson urged Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates to {{act quickly}} on the recommendation. “... {{it is my hope}} that <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the President can move forward on Master Sergeant Keeble’s case as expeditiously as possible,” Johnson said in a letter to Gates quoted in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.|$|E
25|$|Since {{our father}} divided the kingdom between us, <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I {{are held to}} share the land and its produce with our magnates, with whose help our forefathers possessed the lost land and repulsed the Arabs. Therefore, as the other magnates, whom you deprived, have {{returned}} their fiefs to count Ponce de Minerva, and you would not believe the rumours against them, I am returning behind my borders.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me. Don't you think we should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E

60|$|THE NINTH USE.--Therefore, now {{to speak}} {{a word to}} <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> so I shall conclude.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE (with sudden irritation). Oh, sir, go away; go away, <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> read {{improving}} books.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the vice}} {{president}} mentioned, John Kerry comes {{from the state of}} Massachusetts, which has taken as big a step as any state in the union to legalize gay marriage. Yet <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Senator Kerry say you oppose it. Are you trying to have it both ways? ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{our father}} divided the kingdom between us, <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I {{are held to}} share the land and its produce with our magnates, with whose help our forefathers possessed the lost land and repulsed the Arabs.

2500|$|William Blackstone, {{author of}} the famous Commentaries on the Laws of England (four volumes, 1765–1769) was one of Wilmot's close friends. Blackstone wrote to him on 22 February 1766, after the {{publication}} of the first volume of the Commentaries: [...] "Sir, Lord Mansfield did me the honour to inform me, that <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> himself had been so obliging as to mark out a few of the many errors, which I am sensible are to be met with in the Book which I lately published. Nothing can flatter me so much as that you have thought it worth the pains of such a revisal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is enough: I count <b>both</b> <b>thee</b> <b>and</b> Pepe {{as among}} my truest followers." [...] As Columbus said this, he walked away, {{resuming}} the dignified gravity that usually {{was seated in}} his countenance, and which so much aided his authority, by impressing the minds of others with respect. In a few minutes he and Luis descended to their cabin.|$|R
60|$|The ninth use. Therefore, now {{to speak}} {{a word to}} <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> so I shall conclude.|$|R
60|$|May God bless <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> enable <b>you</b> {{to send a}} {{brighter}} letter next time. Robert will be very anxious.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that instead of sympathizing with the unfortunate girl, <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Marmaduke exult in her disappointment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop that press!" [...] yelled their {{spokesman}} excitedly. [...] "Stop it, Smith, or we'll put <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> {{the machine}} out of business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Terrence, if {{you keep}} on saying such lovely things," [...] cried Paula," [...] I'll run away with <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Leo in the limousine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the thing}} would be so disagreeable, then, <b>both</b> to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> to her, in Heaven's name leave it alone," [...] said Percy Beaumont.|$|R
6000|$|Winifred laughed. [...] "They've {{naturally}} {{been watching}} <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and,</b> {{in a general}} way, there's only one decision they could have arrived at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Rover. <b>Both</b> of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> also Lowe can go," [...] was the colonel's reply. [...] "I {{will settle}} this affair with Brown and Martell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Polly, {{you must}} persuade Miss Snowe to {{undertake}} <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me; {{to make you}} steady and womanly, and me refined and classical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Edward,' replied my mother, timidly, 'you are a {{far better}} judge of all {{questions}} than I pretend to be. <b>Both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Jane are. I only said--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not my secret. But I'll {{see what}} I can do, because I think <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Jon {{ought to be}} told. And now I'll say good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll tell it her,' {{said the}} Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> don't speak a word till I've finished.' ...|$|R
60|$|Trick. Enter {{quickly into}} the still-house, <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> leave me to him: There is a spring-lock within, to open it when we are gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to cane you. You're a new boy. And I can't hit a cripple. Go away, <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> don't be naughty again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not believing, but knowing," [...] he answered--"knowing <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Edward. Besides, {{is it not}} almost invariable {{that the}} {{inventor}} is ruined by his invention--a Prospero by nature?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, father, I don’t {{think you}} look {{a year older than}} you did when I last saw you. <b>Both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> mother look good for another ten years yet.” ...|$|E
60|$|IGNOR. What! {{you are a}} man for revelations! I {{believe that}} what <b>both</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> {{all the rest of}} you, say about that matter, is but the fruit of distracted brains.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weep not, Maiden, {{there are}} other roads and perchance to-morrow thou shall walk them. Now lie down <b>and</b> sleep, <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> fear no dreams." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, no," [...] replied Mr. George, [...] "I {{have not}} said any such thing. That {{would be a}} great deal of trouble, <b>both</b> for <b>you</b> <b>and</b> for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Hect. I feel it for thee: Let {{me go to}} Priam, I'll {{break this}} treaty off; or let me fight: I'll be thy champion, and secure <b>both</b> her, <b>And</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> Troy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Promise me, then, {{to keep my}} secret, and {{you shall}} know all; <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Lucy must give me your words. I know you will not break them, when once given." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let it be {{got ready}} instantly; {{and if your}} post-boy can drive me to Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> him twice the hire you usually demand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It wouldn't be {{good for}} you to sleep here,' said the old hag, 'for if the people of the house come home and find you, they will kill <b>both</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A taxicab {{it shall}} be," [...] he decided. [...] "I am in funds {{just for the}} moment. Come along, <b>both</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I'll tell <b>you</b> all about it." ...|$|R
