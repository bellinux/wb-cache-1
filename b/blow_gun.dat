50|$|In Batman: Year One, it is {{depicted}} that Batman hid {{a few pieces}} of his arsenal in his leather boots, such as a <b>blow</b> <b>gun</b> (its length made it impossible to fit in Batman's belt compartment) with fast-acting anesthetic darts and an ultrasonic device built into his left heel.

The bottom is a flexible split sole design and is textured for a variety of surfaces. The boots also have steel toes, making them much more effective when on the offensive. Although Batman is already an elite swimmer, during the Batman: Hush storyline, it is revealed that he installed underwater propellers in the heels. In Batman Begins, a boot heel is revealed to contain an ultrasonic signaling device capable of calling live bats to it as a form of protection and cover for Batman during a getaway.

50|$|In {{one account}} {{outlined}} in the K'iche' Maya sacred text, the Popol Vuh, the gods created animals first, but were displeased when they could not speak or worship them. They then tried to make humans out of mud, but the mud people simply came undone. The gods once again attempted to make humans out of wood. The wood people, however, were stiff, could barely moved, and did not understand and thus did not respect their makers. The gods angrily destroyed them with rains and flood, and those wood people who escaped became spider monkeys. The spider monkeys were morphologically similar to humans but still lacked the ability to speak. In {{a different part of}} the Popol Vuh, Hunbatz (which literally means 1 Howler monkey) and Hunchouen (1 Spider monkey) are the older brothers of the Hero Twins. The Hero Twins won the favor of the gods after they defeated the gods of darkness and death. Naturally, Hunbatz and Hunchouen were jealous, and were always trying to find ways to end their brothers. One day, tired of their brothers’ jealousy, the Hero Twins led their older brothers to a tree and convinced them to climb it, asking them to retrieve birds they had stunned with a <b>blow</b> <b>gun.</b> When they arrived at the top, the tree grew and grew until the brothers were trapped and thus turned into monkeys.

They had to make both slender doors buy using the third rear doors and the front doors. After getting the right measurements they made the new doors. Then they put gold Naugahyde on the doors and spare tire carriers. The top in back is just side pieces, so a lid had to go over them to get the side pieces to fit. They put pompoms around this rectangular lid. The windshield frame was angled forward, with another frame to meet the top of windshield frame to make an open triangle.

The $22,000 ZZR featured two 425 CID Buick engines bored out to 440 CID, mounted in tandem with an Ansen Posi-shift Powerglide transmission with two carburetors per engine with a four holed Hilborn injector scoop.

40|$|Background: Bochdalek hernia is a {{congenital}} diaphragmatic hernia, {{and adult}} cases are rare, with a reported frequency of 0. 17 %– 6 % among all diaphragmatic hernias. Presentation of case: A 78 -year-old man {{was referred to}} our hospital with a sudden onset of whole abdominal pain after playing with a <b>blow</b> <b>gun.</b> Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed diaphragmatic hernia with the small intestine. We therefore diagnosed him with an incarcerated Bochdalek hernia associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure during use of <b>blow</b> <b>gun.</b> Laparoscopic repair was performed. The omentum, transverse colon, and small intestine were located in the left thoracic cavity, without ischemic change. After placing the herniated organs into the abdominal cavity, we performed a primary closure of the diaphragmatic defect with interrupted non-absorbable sutures. Discussion: It is generally recommended that all adult Bochdalek hernia patients undergo surgical repair to prevent life-threatening complications due to incarceration. Recently, laparoscopic techniques for repair the hernia have gained popularity, especially in elective cases. In our case, we could successfully perform emergency laparoscopic repair, as it {{is associated with a}} shorter inpatient hospitalization period. Conclusion: An incarcerated Bochdalek hernias associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure is an uncommon clinical finding in an adult, and laparoscopic repair of an incarcerated Bochdalek hernia is safe, feasible, and an excellent option as it is minimally invasive...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionA {{pneumatic}} tool or air tool such as <b>blow</b> <b>gun</b> dust cleaner {{is a tool}} driven by compressed air and spraying of the perineum can insufflate the colon due to its high pressure and high flow rate. Presentation of caseWe present a case of 4 year old boy who developed sudden onset of tense abdominal distention and developed peritonitis. Patient’s family initially denied a history of trauma. Radiologic examination showed pneumoperitoneum and colon dilatation. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a tension pneumoperitoneum, bloody ascitic fluid, multiple site of ecchymosis and serosal tear of the colon and a minute perforation of transverse colon. Postoperative reinvestigation revealed that the patient’s perineum was sprayed, using <b>blow</b> <b>gun</b> dust cleaner. DiscussionAir from {{pneumatic tool}}s produces column of air at pressure of 3. 5 – 8. 8 kg/cm 2 and pressure greater than the resting anal pressure of 0. 109 kg/cm 2 force air to enter the colon when the perineum is sprayed. Different degree of colon injury results when airflow is greater than 1. 46 L/m, and/or intraluminal pressure greater than 0. 109 kg/cm 2. In most children, initial anxiety {{to tell the truth}} result in difficulty to obtain good history. ConclusionSpraying of the perianal with excessive pneumatic force of greater than the resting anal pressure and high air flow rate causes multiple site colon injury and tension pneumoperitoneum due to colon perforation. Parent should be caution in children playing with high pressure pneumatic tool, and the importance of history is emphases for early correct diagnosis...|$|E
