500|$|After the 1990s, Landy {{continued}} a psychotherapeutic {{practice with}} licensure in New Mexico and Hawaii up until his death. He died, aged 71, on March 22, 2006 in Honolulu, Hawaii, of pneumonia while suffering from lung cancer. When asked what {{his reaction to}} Landy's death had been, Wilson responded: [...] "I was devastated." [...] In 2015, Wilson reflected, [...] "I thought he was my friend, {{but he was a}} very fucked-up man," [...] and also, [...] "I still feel that there was benefit.

500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E

500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Arkham Knight had received a [...] "Mature" [...] rating from the ESRB, rather than the [...] "Teen" [...] ratings previous installments in the franchise held. Sefton Hill and the Rocksteady team were caught off guard by the rating; Hill explained that they did not create the game with a specific rating in mind, but that [...] "It's unavoidable that some <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> is going to happen. But that doesn't mean we changed our approach. We're not including gratuitous blood or swearing. We want to deliver a true end with no compromises, and it takes us to some dark places." [...] Although he did not elaborate which content in particular triggered the [...] "M" [...] rating, Hill did note that a [...] "ratings analysis" [...] by Warner Bros. indicated that the content of certain [...] "key" [...] scenes in the game could affect its rating. The team decided to maintain the offending content so that it would not [...] "jeopardize" [...] their vision for the game and its thematics. In an in-depth explanation of the game's content, the ESRB revealed the existence of scenes where players can [...] "shoot unarmed characters and a hostage", and torture scenes taking place on a [...] "bloody operating table" [...] as well as using a vehicle's wheel.|$|E
500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> goes down and yet {{no one seems to}} care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 22, Sondheim had {{finished}} the four shows requested by Hammerstein. Julius and Philip Epstein's Front Porch in Flatbush, unproduced at the time, was being shopped around by Lemuel (Lem) Ayers. Ayers approached Frank Loesser and another composer, who turned him down. Ayers and Sondheim met as ushers at a wedding, and Ayers commissioned Sondheim for three songs for the show; Julius Epstein flew in from California and hired Sondheim, {{who worked with him}} in California for four or five months. After eight auditions for backers, half the money needed was raised. The show, retitled Saturday Night, was intended to open during the 1954–55 Broadway season; however, Ayers died of leukemia in his early forties. The rights transferred to his widow, Shirley, and due to her inexperience the show did not continue as planned; it opened off-Broadway in 2000. Sondheim later said, [...] "I don't have any emotional reaction to Saturday Night at all – except fondness. It's not <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics – the missed accents, the obvious jokes. But I decided, leave it. It's my baby pictures.

[...] The actor thought Troy would be a good father to Callum, but only if it was just them together. Speaking about his second stint in Neighbours, Brummer revealed that Troy is [...] "a great strategist", who knows how to push people to his advantage. He later said [...] "When we first saw Troy last year he wasn't aware that he fathered a child to Sonya and after things went a little bit awry towards the end of last year's stint, he'd gone away and spent a bit of time thinking about it and came back." ...|$|R

5000|$|The writers' {{biggest concern}} was {{making sure the}} characters' voices felt accurate. James Kuhoric says, [...] "A {{licensed}} comic book's first priority has {{to be that the}} actions and dialog are true to the series they comes from. As a fan, I can't stand picking up any book that reads like the writer didn't watch the show. It's sad to say, but I've read far more <b>bad</b> licensed <b>stuff</b> than good." [...] The writers held several discussions debating how the characters should act in certain scenes. Jeff Katz asserts that Freddy and Ash are [...] "defined by their tones", so getting their voices right was crucial; he feels the success of the first Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash came from their accurate characterization. However, artist Jason Craig feels that [...] "it's a tightrope to walk"; he enjoys Freddy's wisecracks but prefers the character to be darker, stating [...] "People forget he was a child killer. He was a very sadistic man." [...] Discussing the relationship between Freddy and Ash, Craig says that [...] "it's almost like watching two stand up comedians try to kill each other".|$|R

30|$|Regardless of bad mouthing or ballot stuffing, {{we follow}} six types of {{fraudulent}} raters’ behavior models summarized in Irissappane et al. (2012). The first three are “constant attack,” “camouflage attack,” and “whitewashing attack.” A “constant attack” {{indicates that a}} fraudulent rater consistently provides unfairly high (low) ratings to the target entity in a ballot <b>stuffing</b> (<b>bad</b> mouthing) scheme. A “camouflage attack” is performed by a strategical fraudulent rater, who will inject fair ratings to non-target entities to camouflage himself/herself, in addition to injecting unfair ratings to the target entities. This type of attack brings more challenges to the reliability of reputation systems, as {{it is more difficult}} to differentiate fraudulent raters from honest ones because their ratings are more similar to each other. In a “whitewashing attack,” a rater will inject unfair ratings to the target entity for a period. Subsequently, he/she whitewashes himself/herself by creating a new account and thereupon behaving as an honest rater.|$|R
500|$|Cibber's {{appointment}} as Poet Laureate in December 1730 was widely {{assumed to be}} a political rather than artistic honour, and a reward for his untiring support of the Whigs, the party of Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Most of the leading writers, such as Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and Henry Fielding, were excluded from contention for the laureateship because they were Tories. Cibber's verses had few admirers even in his own time, and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully that he did not think much of them. His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces incumbent on him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn, and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous parodies, some of which Cibber claimed in his Apology to have written himself. In the 20th century, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Lee considered some of Cibber's laureate poems funny enough to be included in their classic [...] "anthology of <b>bad</b> verse", The <b>Stuffed</b> Owl (1930). However, Cibber was at least as distinguished as his immediate four predecessors, three of whom were also playwrights rather than poets.|$|R

I have mark'd the brazen hell-faces of secession and slavery gazing defiantly from all the windows and doorways. I have everywhere found, primarily, thieves and scalliwags arranging the nominations to offices, and sometimes filling the offices themselves. I have found the north just as full of <b>bad</b> <b>stuff</b> as the south. Of the holders of public office in the Nation or the States or their municipalities, I have found that not one in a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection of the outsiders, the people, but all have been nominated and put through by little or large caucuses of the politicians, and have got in by corrupt rings and electioneering, not capacity or desert. I have noticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the helpless supple-jacks of comparatively few politicians. And I have noticed more and more, the alarming spectacle of parties usurping the government, and openly and shamelessly wielding it for party purposes." ...|$|E
