5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers.</b>|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers</b> on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

25|$|As the 1980s {{cognitive}} revolution made {{inquiry into}} internal subjective states respectable again, scientists returned to synesthesia. Led in the United States by Larry Marks and Richard Cytowic, {{and later in}} England by Simon Baron-Cohen and Jeffrey Gray, researchers explored the reality, consistency, and frequency of synesthetic experiences. In the late 1990s, the focus settled on grapheme → color synesthesia, {{one of the most}} common and easily studied types. Psychologists and neuroscientists study synesthesia not only for its inherent appeal, but also for the insights it may give into cognitive and perceptual processes that occur in synesthetes and non-synesthetes alike. Synesthesia is now the topic of scientific <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers,</b> PhD theses, documentary films, and even novels.|$|E
25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers</b> on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E

Between 1913 and 2008, the library stock increased from 12,000 volumes to two million including 17th- and 18th-century texts, maps, local Media and directories. It was designed with rooms for newspapers and journals, and a magazine room {{as well as}} lending and reference libraries. The 200 Scott-Robinson books about Kent {{are part of the}} local history collection.

25|$|As he {{continued}} his academic career abroad in Chile and France after the tightening of Brazilian military dictatorship, Cardoso published several <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers</b> on state bureaucracy, industrial elites and, particularly, dependency theory.

After presiding the International Sociological Association from 1982 to 1986 Cardoso was selected as a Fulbright Program 40th anniversary distinguished fellow and in that capacity was a visiting scholar and lectured at Columbia University on democracy in Brazil. Cardoso currently gives speeches and classes abroad. In June 2013 he was elected {{as a member of}} Academia Brasileira de Letras.

25|$|The workhouse system {{began to}} evolve in the 17thcentury {{as a way}} for parishes to reduce the cost to ratepayers of {{providing}} poor relief. The Workhouse Test Act of 1723 was introduced to prevent irresponsible claims on a parish's poor rate. Anyone seeking poor relief could be obliged to enter a workhouse and undertake a set amount of work, usually for no pay, a system known as indoor relief. Many parishes established workhouses during the 18th century, and Christchurch was no exception, the first one being built in Quay Road in 1768. When the workhouse moved to bigger premises in Fairmile in 1881, the property in Quay Road was purchased by the Druitts, a family of wealthy solicitors with a keen interest in history. The Druitt family turned the old workhouse into a museum which was bequeathed to the town. It opened as The Redhouse Museum in 1951. The Druitt family also left a property in the High Street {{to be used as a}} library together with all the <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>papers</b> they had collected and extensive gardens. James Druitt (five times mayor 1850, 1859, 1867, 1888, 1896) was instrumental in putting a stop to the ironstone mining at Hengistbury Head (see below). The second workhouse in Fairmile became Christchurch Hospital in 1948 after the Welfare State was introduced. A large proportion of the site was turned into housing in 1995.|$|E
