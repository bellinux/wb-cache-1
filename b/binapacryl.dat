Thus, the presence of pesticides in the environment emanates probably from the previous illegal use of these pesticide groups. The risk of the contamination of water column and bed sediment of aquatic environment is therefore of great concern due to the potential exposure of benthic-dwelling organisms such as fish and other edible aquatic organisms to the arrays of contaminants which could be transferred through different heterotrophic levels once in the food chain.|$|E
