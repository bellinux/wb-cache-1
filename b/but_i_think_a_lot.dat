5000|$|With Codes and Keys, the {{experimental}} {{side of the}} band was drawn out more through production than a set songwriting process. Nicholas Harmer stated: [...] "The making of this album {{was a little more}} open-ended as far as submitting different ideas if there were openings or holes for ideas to be submitted, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the experimentation came from the production side more than it did from the writing side." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yet his {{presence}} was compelling and characteristically welcomed {{by those who}} would otherwise be in disagreement. Many years later, Germaine Greer noted his influence on her: ...Harry, the utopian anarchist who had admired her red stockings, who believed people were perfect and who was not weighed down by the tremendous forces the anarchistic pessimists felt bore down on them all the time. [...] "Alas, I understand him much better now," [...] she said, twenty years later. [...] "... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the things I've done since I've done out {{of a desire to}} please Harry Hooton..." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Bears {{moved to}} 3-0 {{with a win}} in the season's third week at Detroit, {{a game in which}} the offense racked up 542 net yards and 47 points. The Bears' {{expected}} strong start set up a miracle match-up for ABC's Monday Night Football, as the 2-1 Philadelphia Eagles traveled to Soldier Field to face the undefeated Bears. The week preceding the game was filled with the drama of the Ditka-Buddy Ryan rivalry. Despite brash talk from Ryan, the Bears prevailed 27-13 and embarrassed the visitors on many fronts. Ditka used his usual sarcasm following the game, stating [...] "I'm not surprised (about the 4-0 start), <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people must be surprised, that we beat Cincinnati, Minnesota, Detroit and Philadelphia. We must be awfully lucky." ...|$|E

5000|$|Written by Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, and Sam Farrar, {{the song}} is about the narrator finding himself in a {{difficult}} situation when a relationship fades. [...] "Why won't you answer me? / The silence is slowly killing me / Girl you really got me bad," [...] he states in the lyrics. The song documents the decay of a relationship, familiar territory for the band. Frontman Adam Levine told MTV News: [...] "'Misery' is about the desperation of wanting someone really badly in your life but having it be very difficult. Kind of what all the songs I write are about. I'm not treading on new ground, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people - including myself - deal with that all the time. Relationships are difficult, and it's good therapy to write about them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prior {{to season}} four Priestley was {{critical}} of {{the promotion of the}} show, saying in response to people learning of the show via Twitter, [...] "Traditional advertising is also still get {{a great way to get}} the word out, and I think that our broadcasters have not done a good job with traditional means for our show. I’m going to be totally frank with you about that: I don’t think they've done a good job at all. I don’t understand, we’re the most awarded comedy in Canadian television history and half the people in this country don’t even know we exist, and I can’t fathom that.". Priestley later added, [...] "It's frustrating when you feel like you’re not being successful in getting the word out there, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of that has to do with budget and money, and money being allocated to other places.".|$|E
5000|$|An early {{version of}} [...] "In a Blackout" [...] was written by Leithauser for The Walkmen's seventh and final studio album, Heaven (2012): [...] "I could never get the part {{sounding}} good where I was playing. It sort of didn’t make much sense in The Walkmen anyhow." [...] Regarding the album's lyrical content, Leithauser noted that he often tried not to rewrite or overthink his words: [...] "We tried to keep a lot of original takes {{and a lot of}} original moments, so it did feel like naturally it did have sort of a narrative, and it was almost like there was a character in it that went {{all the way through the}} record. ... It did seem like there was a consistent voice that went through the whole thing, that’s inspired by the music." [...] Batmanglij likened his lyrical contributions to the album to that of an editor: [...] "I would contribute lyrics, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of what I brought was sort of focusing a narrative and trying to make sure that there was always a picture being painted." ...|$|E

5000|$|Owens {{commented on}} Beyond Fear's next studio album in an {{interview}} with Metal Asylum: [...] "It will always be classic metal <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the later songs that we recorded for the debut, like “Scream Machine”, became favorites for fans. And lyrics to a song like that were not so serious and more cliché metal lyrics, you know about a metal machine (laughs), so I think some of the new songs may go in that direction. We are still gonna have songs like “Save Me” but I think it will probably have some more aggression. We have been writing now, John Comprix and I, for a while, I have a lot of ideas and melodies in my head that I really can’t use anywhere else (laughs). Its nice I get to use em for Beyond Fear. I mean I have been a writer for many years but I don’t get to do it as much as I would like and Iced Earth just keeps me so busy but its nice that every once and sic a while I get to do my thing with Beyond Fear. And we get to take our time with this band and practice together. I mean that’s what I want to hear with all my influences on one album that’s what I like to do with Fear." ...|$|E

In this novel gives life to Carlos Daniel Bracho, a man who knows that the usurper, Paulina has replaced his wife Paola is under blackmail of it. [...] "I liked playing him because he is quite different from me, but we seem that we are not sexist. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more things and demand that others be respectful to me, because I am with them. Carlos Daniel has a weak character and that's not my case." [...] In an overview Fernando says [...] "I hardly had time to rest between a novel and another, but I accepted it gladly returned to work with friends and I liked the story. Besides best, was meeting someone as lovely as Gabriela Spanic. We understood so well that I think we are a fantastic couple. Besides, my character is not the typical leading man, is very innovative." [...] (Soap Opera Magazine). Fernando managed to change a bit the image of the telenovela, [...] "Yeah, I got that the protagonist of the telenovela will use beard and mustache and the costumes were something more casual. This had never been given, because the leading men always have to be impeccable; I've got that, without appearing too casual, my character has a different image, more youthful."
