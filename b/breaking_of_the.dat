5|$|Bond's number—007—was {{assigned}} by Fleming {{in reference to}} one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and {{which was one of}} the factors that led to the US entering the war.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 {{formed the basis for}} the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1523 Anne was {{secretly}} betrothed to Henry Percy, {{son of the}} 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle. In February/March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, which her sister Mary had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he {{would be free to}} marry Anne. When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church's power in England began. In 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice and its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.|$|E

5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in}} which their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thieves' legs (although {{this is not}} depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, {{with some of his}} pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 09:00 on 11 May, a {{small body}} of cavalry, {{followed by a}} larger body in the distance, was seen approaching Delhi along the road between that city and Meerut. The East India Company employees immediately noted that this was unusual, and the senior military officers present within the city attempted to contact Meerut by telegraph to enquire about the approaching troops, but the telegraph line between Delhi and Meerut {{appeared to have been}} cut. The 54th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, one of three Bengal Native Infantry regiments garrisoned within Delhi's Red Fort, was ordered to intercept them. A party of East India Company civil servants went to secure the fort's Calcutta Gate, but when they arrived they found that troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry had already taken control of it. A struggle ensued which led to the death of a cavalry trooper and a civilian. A small group of troopers from the regiment headed toward the city's jail and released the inmates, meeting with no resistance. The main body of the regiment then arrived, joining up with the party at the Calcutta Gate, and then collectively they entered the fort and attacked the civilians within. A small group from the advance party gained access to the private courtyard of Bahadur Shah II and told him that he should take command of them. The regiment spread out throughout the fort and the city, and was eventually joined in mutiny by the forces of Bahadur Shah II and members of the Bengal Native Infantry who were based within the fort; a widespread outbreak of looting, burning of buildings and murder of East India Company employees and civilian shopkeepers took place, and the Indian Mutiny began in earnest. The mutineers of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained at Delhi until the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siege of Delhi in September 1857. They withdrew first to Lucknow, then later to Nepal, where the majority of the men died through combat, disease or starvation. Those that eventually managed to make their way back to their homes found themselves shunned by their communities for their part in the mutiny. The regiment itself, in common with every other regiment of Bengal Light Cavalry, was disbanded {{at the end of the}} Indian Mutiny.|$|E
