5|$|Luton kicked-off the final, {{and both}} sides enjoyed early spells of possession, moving the ball about briskly. Arsenal tested the Luton back four in the eighth minute, when Davis' pass went over Johnson and the ball was {{collected}} by Thomas on the right flank. Charging towards the penalty area, he was impeded by the incoming Dibble and moved near the byline, but Johnson obstructed his eventual shot at goal. Minutes later, Luton had their first chance of the match from a long free kick, taken by Tim Breacker. The ball reached the Arsenal penalty area, and goalkeeper John Lukic failed to collect it; Harford got {{his head to the}} ball, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> went over the crossbar. Another Luton free kick, this time in the 13th minute, led to the opening goal. The Arsenal defence failed to clear Preece's incoming delivery, and Foster, thinking quick, managed to slip an angled pass in Brian Stein's direction. The midfielder scored – it was the second goal Arsenal had conceded in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

500|$|Regarding his {{decision}} not to have Talia Shire reprise her role as Adrian, Stallone told USA Today that, [...] "in the original script, she was alive. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn't have the same dramatic punch. I thought, 'What if she's gone?' That would cut Rocky's heart out and drop him down to ground zero." [...] Shire herself said that, in her view, [...] "The film has great regard for the process of mourning. Sly utilizes mourning to empower Rocky, and Adrian is made very mythical." ...|$|E

500|$|During a {{world tour}} in 2001, the Malaysian {{government}} canceled the band's {{show in the}} nation's capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the group's image and music. The government pointed the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead as inappropriate and told the members {{that they would be}} arrested if they performed. Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it is admirable of them trying to protect the young people in the country. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem." ...|$|E

[...] Robbie Daw of Idolator called it [...] "subtle", and wrote that [...] "it’s hard to imagine this song being worked as a single", but {{concluded}} saying that it [...] "definitely has an infectious hook". Anthony Balderrama of Consequence of Sound wrote that the song [...] "is what you’d expect to hear: a smooth beat and an international sound, but nothing you’ll keep on repeat. It seems like a match made in heaven, but ultimately it’s fairly safe." [...] Matthew Horton of BBC Music called the song [...] "superfluous".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{reported}} that this episode {{was an odd}} one produced by the show. [...] "I don't {{know if it was}} the off-balance tone the episode had because two of the three plots took place outside, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> wasn't as good as most episodes." [...] Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student called Jenna and Kenneth's plot a travesty, commenting that the two along with Grammer scamming Carvel was [...] "diabolical, and definitely not funny enough to justify the horribleness". In regards to the episode, itself, Sanders wrote that it was [...] "mostly awful".|$|E
500|$|An {{investigation}} by the New York Press asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program's effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no peer-reviewed research on the rundown had been published in any medical journal. Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack control groups and have other scientific failings. According to Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon, doctors investigating the program {{on behalf of the}} Fire Department concluded that it was not detoxifying. University of Georgia bioterrorism expert Cham Dallas also denied that the procedure could detoxify, saying [...] "It sounds great and they mean well, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> doesn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|Den of Geek {{selected}} the episode's special effects {{as a positive}} element, but was more critical of the episode as a whole. [...] "As Fringe goes," [...] the website explained, [...] "this ended up a rather lightweight narrative, which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe, and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent, and gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10. He observed, [...] "It isn't a bad episode. It's a good addition to the Fringe lore. It's well-written, has plenty of action, and the actors are great as usual. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> doesn't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season's cliffhanger, nor does it strike me as a fantastic new direction for the season." ...|$|E

OUWBC's winning president Chitty said [...] "It's a really special moment, something I've been working towards for three years" [...] while her counterpart Reid accepted that Cambridge [...] "didn't get off to [...] best start and Oxford did" [...] and that the conditions were [...] "pretty horrendous around the halfway mark with the wind against the tide and some pretty high waves". [...] Oxford's stroke Davies said: [...] "I'm so glad we can be role models to all the young women out there." [...] Cambridge's coach Baker noted [...] "We’ve got a young crew that {{has come a long}} way and they raced their best ...

500|$|In {{a review}} by DVD Verdict, Mike Pinsky stated that [...] "Turning the third episode over {{to such a}} character, when Michael passes off {{responsibility}} for picking a corporate health care plan to Dwight, is meant to draw laughs out of his megalomania. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> is not that funny." [...] Travis Fickett from IGN wrote positively of the episode, giving it a 7.9/10 [...] "good" [...] rating. He noted that [...] "there's something Stephen King about Dwight that creates an underlying layer of menace" [...] and that the episode is [...] "an early incarnation of [...] early days, its original [...] "paradigm" [...] – and arguably its strongest." [...] IGN later placed Jim and Pam's prank of creating fake diseases as ninth in its [...] "Top Ten Moments from The Office". Television Without Pity awarded the episode an A rating.|$|E
500|$|A Junior Vasquez remix of {{the song}} was {{performed}} at the 1995 Brit Awards. Madonna wore a white Versace dress and had long blonde extensions, her look being similar to the Versace advertisement campaign she was promoting at the time. She even invited Björk to feature in the performance; the singer turned it down, saying [...] "I {{was supposed to get}} [...] personal number and call her up, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn't feel right. I'd love to meet her accidentally, really drunk in a bar. It's just all that formality that confuses me". The performance was ranked number four on Marie Claires [...] "30 Best Brit Award Moments" [...] list. It was described by the magazine as the [...] "best opening performance" [...] at the Brits. A writer described that [...] " [...] pulled out all the stops, treating the audience to a light show and trio of satin-clad male dancers".|$|E
5000|$|The {{name has}} also been adopted by Zarahemla Books, {{according}} to publisher/owner Christopher Bigelow, because it's [...] "instantly recognizable to any Mormon insider, <b>but</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>just</b> an exotic-sounding name to any outsider." ...|$|R

500|$|In September 1993, Jackson {{appeared}} topless on {{the cover}} of Rolling Stone magazine with the hands of her then-husband René Elizondo, Jr. covering her breasts. The photograph is the original full-length version of the cropped image used {{on the cover}} of the Janet album, shot by Patrick Demarchelier. In the cover story, [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] by David Ritz, Jackson explained, [...] "sex has been an important part of me for several years. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> hasn't blossomed publicly until now. I've had to go through some changes and shed some old attitudes before feeling completely comfortable with my body. Listening to my new record, people intuitively understand the change in me". Ritz likened Jackson's transformation to Marvin Gaye as he stated, [...] " [...] just as Gaye moved from What's Going On to Let's Get It On, from the austere to the ecstatic, Janet, every bit as serious-minded as Marvin, moved from Rhythm Nation to Janet, her statement of sexual liberation".|$|E
500|$|Once all {{outstanding}} CSM-012 hardware {{problems were}} fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According {{to the final}} report of the accident investigation board, [...] "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." [...] This would appear to contradict the account given in Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jeffrey Kluger and astronaut James Lovell, that [...] "When the trio {{climbed out of the}} ship, … Schirra {{made it clear that he}} was not pleased with what he had seen," [...] and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that [...] "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> makes me uncomfortable.

500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game.
