5|$|Afterward, Bond {{admits to}} his spotter {{that he did}} not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be {{considered}} a failure <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not kill Trigger, and he hopes that M will fire him for it.|$|E
5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Joséphine a French defeat.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} answer, and I {{am sorry}} if you don't like it. If Innocent is happy, it is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> IS innocent. If he can defy the conventions, it is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> can keep the commandments. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not want to kill but to excite to life that a pistol is still as {{exciting}} to him {{as it is to}} a schoolboy. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not want to steal, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not covet his neighbour's goods, that he has captured the trick (oh, how we all long for it!), the trick of coveting his own goods. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex; it is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons. If he had really murdered a man, if he had really deserted a woman, {{he would not be able}} to feel that a pistol or a love-letter was like a song-- at least, not a comic song." ...|$|R

5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to leave}} an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's rule {{remained}} fragile in {{the eastern}} territories of the Kingdom of Hungary <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not send enough mercenaries to defend them. Suspecting that Martinuzzi was conspiring with the Ottomans, Castaldo had Martinuzzi murdered in late 1551. The Ottomans occupied the lowlands of Banat {{in the summer of}} 1552.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} stage, Garin {{had asked the}} race {{official}} Lefèvre for food, which was illegal. Lefèvre, who knew that Garin was {{the star of the}} race, broke the rules and gave him the food, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to be responsible for Garin leaving the race because of hunger.|$|E

5|$|Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} stewards to be allowed to race, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not post a lap time during the first part of qualifying. They gave him permission to start based on his satisfactory practice times.|$|E
5|$|At several {{stages of}} development, other actors were pursued for the film. In October 2010, Willis said that Steve Austin would reprise {{his role as}} villain Dan Paine. In November 2010, Charlie Sheen was {{reported}} to be in consideration for the role of a CIA agent hunting down Willis' Mr. Church. In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not find it intriguing.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E

6000|$|... "Teufelsdrockh {{does not}} belong to the herd of sensual and thoughtless men; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{perceive}} in all Existence a unity of power; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> believe that this is a real power external to him and dominant to a certain extent over him, and does not think that he is himself a shadow in a world of shadows. He had a deep feeling of the beautiful, the good and the true; and a faith in their final victory.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|Hull {{attempted}} {{to join the}} South African Air Force in 1935, but was turned down <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not speak Afrikaans.

5|$|In 1924, {{his family}} moved to New York City looking for a better way of life. When his parents, Rosendo and María {{enrolled}} him in school, he had to start from the first grade again <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know enough English.

When he was fifteen years old he began looking for work in Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation. Manitoba politician Elijah Harper, a Cree, opposed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord's process, and thus the Accord failed.|$|E
5|$|In October 1588 the Diet {{proposed}} {{to declare the}} sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did not accept the offer, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} in 1962, the Red Sox {{had been in the}} middle of a streak of 8 losing seasons. The team was so bad, that after a 13-3 loss to the Yankees on July 26, Red Sox ace Gene Conley got off the bus and {{attempted}} to leave the country and go to Israel. Conley was denied his request <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have a passport. Nonetheless, Conley did stay away from the team for 3 days.|$|E
5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not {{want them to be}} so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|After Groza retired, he entertained {{an offer}} {{to play for the}} San Francisco 49ers, but was {{reluctant}} to do so <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to move his family and insurance business to the West Coast. He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family.|$|E
