5|$|Despite {{positive}} initial reviews, which {{praised the}} film as a well-made cinematic transfer of the Thunderbirds television series, Thunderbirds Are Go soon {{proved to be a}} box office failure for the Andersons. The disappointment of this outcome was intensified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> Series Two of Thunderbirds would be cut down to six episodes and that AP Films' upcoming television project would be a brand-new series, which would later be titled Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and screened from 1967. To add to the lukewarm public response, negative critical reception of Thunderbirds Are Go has targeted, besides other aspects, the characterisation of the puppet cast, which has been seen as too minimal to sustain a feature-length production, the running time dedicated to model and effects shots, and the fantasy dream sequence starring Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which {{has been described as a}} poor scriptwriting idea on the part of the Andersons.|$|E
5|$|The {{venue for}} Il ritorno's première {{was at one}} time {{thought to be the}} Teatro Cassiano, but {{scholarly}} consensus considers it most likely that both the 1639–40 and 1640–41 performances were at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo. This view is supported by a study of the performance schedules for other Venice operas, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> the Manelli company had severed its connection with the Teatro Cassiano before the 1639–40 season. The Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, owned by the Grimani family, would also be the venue for the premières of Monteverdi's Le nozze d'Enea and Poppea. In terms of its staging Il ritorno is, says Carter, fairly undemanding, requiring three basic sets—a palace, a seascape and a woodland scene—which were more or less standard for early Venetian opera. It did, however, demand some spectacular special effects: the Phaecian ship turns to stone, an airborne chariot transports Minerva, a bolt of fire transforms Ulisse.|$|E
5|$|In the fleet, President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) burns {{her book}} of Pythia, and {{is unable to}} address the fleet because of feeling that she led the fleet nowhere, and believing the prophecy is a lost cause. Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and Anastasia Dualla (Kandyse McClure) revisit their relationship, and after their evening together, Dualla returns to her quarters, and commits suicide. Devastated by this, Admiral Adama acquires a handgun from a Marine and {{attempts}} to coerce Tigh (Michael Hogan) into killing him, which fails. Adama breaks down relieved and converses with Tigh about past memories, and Tigh reminding Adama of his duties as commander of the fleet. Adama eventually steps back into the CIC, and makes an announcement that he will find {{a home for the}} fleet, gives instructions to search for any nearby habitable star systems, and invites their new Cylon allies to join them. As the fleet prepares to leave Earth, which is determined to be uninhabitable, D'Anna (Lucy Lawless), devastated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> history repeats itself endlessly, decides to remain on Earth to die, rather than being hunted by Cavil.|$|E

25|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} on April 3, 1950, by Macmillan Publishers. Macmillan's interest in publishing it was encouraged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> Velikovsky had obtained a promise from Gordon Atwater, Director of the Hayden Planetarium, for a sky show {{based on the book}} when it was published. The book, Velikovsky's most criticized and controversial, was an instant New York Times bestseller, topping the charts for eleven weeks while being in the top ten for twenty-seven straight weeks. Despite this popularity, overwhelming rejection of its thesis by the scientific community forced Macmillan to stop publishing it and to transfer the book to Doubleday within two months.|$|E

25|$|Lawrence became {{increasingly}} guilt-ridden <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> Britain {{did not intend}} to abide by the commitments made to the Sharif, but still managed to convince Faisal that it would be to the Arabs' advantage to go on fighting the Ottomans. At the Versailles peace conference in 1919 and the Cairo conference in 1921 Lawrence lobbied for Arab independence, but his belated attempts to maintain the territorial integrity of Arab lands, which he had promised to Hussein and Faisal, and in limiting France's influence in what later became Syria and Lebanon were fruitless. However, as Churchill's adviser on Arab affairs (1921–22) Lawrence was able to lobby for a considerable degree of autonomy for Mesopotamia and Transjordan. The British placed Palestine, promised to the Zionist Federation in 1917, under mandate with a civilian administration headed by Herbert Samuel, and divided their remaining territory in the Middle East into the kingdoms of Iraq and Transjordan, assigning them to Faisal and his brother Abdullah, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Let X_ 1,X_ 2, [...] . be {{independent}} and identically distributed random variables {{on the real}} line with a joint continuous distribution function F. The stochastic behavior of the sequence of subsequent records is well known. Alternatively to that, we investigate the stochastic behavior of arbitrary X_j,X_k,j<k, {{under the condition that}} they are records, without knowing their orders in the sequence of records. The results are completely different. In particular {{it turns out that the}} distribution of X_k, being a record, is not affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> additional <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> X_j is a record as well. On the contrary, the distribution of X_j, being a record, is affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> additional <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> X_k is a record as well. If F has a density, then the gain of this additional information, measured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> corresponding Kullback-Leibler distance, is j/k, independent of F. We derive the limiting joint distribution of two records, which is not a bivariate extreme value distribution. We extend this result to the case of three records. In a special case we also derive the limiting joint distribution of increments among records...|$|R
25|$|When Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35-year-old {{graduate}} student (due {{to his work}} during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but he already had a Ph.D. They shared {{an interest in the}} fundamental problem of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form. Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA and the idea that {{it might be possible to}} guess a good molecular model of its structure. A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. Alexander Stokes (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure—but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion. Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the Alpha helix, they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.|$|E
