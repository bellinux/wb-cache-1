Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in {{childhood}} is relatively rare but the rate has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can occur at any age, including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years there has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> {{attention}} to this issue, such as recognition of unpaid work within SNA reports and a commitment by the UN to the measurement and valuation of unpaid work, emphasizing care work done by women.

A variable star {{of a different kind}} is Tau4 Serpentis, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This star has been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile, where cold infalling gas on to the star creates redshifted hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4billion in 1989 to $2.8billion in 2002, {{and in the}} process Germany lowered its coal use by 46percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750million in 1993 to $240million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax. However, the United States has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.|$|E

Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines.

5|$|There has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> {{recognition}} {{of the extent to}} which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Citi Bike {{finally began}} {{operations}} on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations.

At the time of implementation, {{it was the largest}} bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion would be complete by the end of 2016. There has <b>been</b> <b>increasing</b> interest in further expansion across New York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|Fluorite mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since <b>been</b> <b>increasing.</b> Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E

The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%.
