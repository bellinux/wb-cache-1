5|$|Flocks {{of birds}} appear {{to engage in}} play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it.

5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia and distinct {{in that it}} is the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage.

5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide. Many <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} 14 species of {{amphibians}} in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, of which 11 breed in the watershed. These species consist of 6 salamanders, 6 frogs, one newt, and one toad. There are seven species of reptiles in the watershed, of which five breed there. Five of these species are snakes and two are turtles. The biodiversity of <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed {{is much greater than}} that of amphibians or reptiles; there are approximately one hundred different species of <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nescopeck Creek watershed. A total of 29 mammals have been observed in the creek's watershed, including three species of bats, two species of mice, and two species of foxes.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} bottleneck in the recent past. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success. However, bottleneck and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of territoriality, as <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.|$|E
