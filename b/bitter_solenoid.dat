50|$|A Bitter {{electromagnet}} or <b>Bitter</b> <b>solenoid</b> {{is a type}} of electromagnet {{invented in}} 1933 by American physicist Francis Bitter used in scientific research to create extremely strong magnetic fields. Bitter electromagnets have been used to achieve the strongest continuous manmade magnetic fields on earth (up to 45 teslas - as of 2011).|$|E
