40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Presentation date: 1973 - 05 - 03 Sediment {{transport}} in a gravel-bottomed stream {{located in}} the Oregon Coast Range was studied {{to determine the effects}} of a single layer of large particles (the armour layer) located at the surface of the bed material. The bed load transport system was studied jointly with suspended sediment transport to understand the total transport system. The bed load was sampled using a vortex trough in the stream bed which transported the bed load material into a sampling pit adjacent to the stream. It was found that the armour layer controls the bed load transport system by preventing sand and finer material from the bed from being entrained in the flow unless the armouring particles are first moved. The bed load of an armoured stream can be calculated using the simplified Einstein <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>function</b> with a representative diameter for the stability parameter equal to the particle size of armouring material at which 35...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of {{bed load}} flux remains a {{significant}} problem in understanding braided river morphodynamics for geomorphic and engineering applications. Two sets of data from laboratory experiments on braided networks performed at the University of Trento (Italy) and at the University of Alberta (Canada) {{provide the basis for}} development of a dimensionless <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>function</b> and for testing a simple predictive model. Measured total sediment transport rates (time-averaged) at equilibrium channel configuration collapse to a single dimensionless relationship based on dimensionless stream power. Bed load fluxes predicted by the Parker and Bagnold functions and cross-section average hydraulic parameters under-predict the bed load flux, particularly at low shear stress. This is consistent with previous observation and theory demonstrating the significant influence of transverse variability of the hydraulic parameters in controlling and predicting bed load flux. A simple method for adjusting for this lateral variation is proposed for computing the sediment transport rate using topographic cross-sections of braided rivers. Results show good agreement with the measured values, suggesting that simple assumptions combined with the mean morphology of the channel may be sufficient to estimate mean bed load flux. Model predictions also highlight the significance of active bed width, rather than bed shear stress, as a fundamental ingredient in the prediction of the bed load rate and therefore, as an important morphological property to be modelled. The model also predicts similar behaviour in the at-a-station variability of bed load and in the importance of variation of active width, relative to bed shear stress, in the transport process...|$|E
40|$|The {{grain size}} {{distributions}} of bed load collected during flows {{that range from}} the threshold of motion to near bankfull in Nahal Eshtemoa, a coarse-grained ephemeral stream of southern Israel, give an unequivocal quantification of the change from unequal to near-equal mobility of grains of all available sizes. This second threshold occurs at ∼ 4. 5 times the shear stress associated with initial motion (4. 5 тc). The level determined in Eshtemoa {{is much higher than}} previously defined by laboratory flume studies. The difference probably reflects the tighter packing and the greater interlock of natural streambeds and carries implications for a number of issues, including the modeling of sediment transport, especially in the context of dryland reservoir sedimentation. The proportion of time that flow exceeds 4. 5 тc determines the size distribution of cumulative bed load. Using a flow duration/sediment transport approach, in which fractional transport rates by grain size class are predicted with Parker's [1979] <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>function,</b> it can be shown that the size distribution of bed load coarsens as the flow duration curve of individual flash floods incorporates progressively higher flows of variable duration. The method has utility because simple flood parameters such as peak discharge are imperfect predictors of sediment flux, particularly in desert streams where the shape of the flood hydrograph varies considerably from event to event. It is also shown that over a longer period (annual or decadal) the caliber of cumulative bed load depends upon the spectrum of flows in incident floods. The 4 -year hydrograph record in Eshtemoa provides a model-derived bed load size distribution just finer than the unarmored bed material. The Eshtemoa data set {{can also be used to}} show clearly that water discharge in this type of ephemeral stream is “effective” or “dominant” over a wide range of flow stage ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 1 times bankfull and that bankfull discharge is no more significant than a wide range of other states of flow in transporting bed load.

Although {{there are many}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport equations, {{there is still no}} consensus on which equation is the best and how to select a particular equation for a particular river.

Further, in many practical applications empirical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> equations are found to produce just as good <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> results as physically based equations. This study develops and tests two regression based equations for two rivers in Iran. One equation is based on hydraulic parameters and the other on geometric parameters. It is found that the Shields parameter, Froude number and shape factor are among the controlling hydraulic parameters of <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> while the grain size distribution and the water slope are the significant geometric parameters that affect the <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> A linear <b>function</b> showing more than 60 % variability in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> values seems sufficient to describe the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> data rather than a non-linear function.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport in the Diaoga River, a mountain stream in southwest China, to study the variation of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport with varying sediment supply. The rate of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport is greatly affected by incoming sediment (load and size). Under the same flow conditions, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rates may differ by three orders of magnitude depending on whether measurements were taken {{before or after the}} first flood of the year. The relation of the "bed load transport rate versus flow intensity" appears to have similar characteristics as a clockwise looped-rating curve. Experiments also were conducted during the non-flood season to study <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport processes with different incoming load from an upstream section. Bed load with different sizes can be grouped into two types: traveling <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and structural <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> Traveling <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> is composed of sediment finer than a critical size, D, and its transport rate depends mainly on the incoming sediment rate.

Strambed structures are arrangements of boulders and cobbles deposited during extreme floods, in a stable configuration exhibiting high dissipation of flow. Field experiments were carried out in a mountain stream in Yunnan, southwestern China, studying <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement on three typical streambeds, i. e., with well developed, partially developed, and no structures. An underwater observation and video-capturing system was designed to observe and measure the movement of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> particles. The initiation mode, trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> particles under the three conditions were observed and analyzed. Results showed that the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement was highly associated with streambed condition. With well-developed structures, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> particles moved intermittently through saltation and the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate was very low. For partially-developed structures most <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> particles moved through saltation but a portion of sediment moved in sliding and rolling.

Moreover, laminated load motion occurred and became {{the main component of}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport when the flow discharge and incoming sediment load were very high. Laminated load motion was a special form of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> motion with an extremely high intensity. Bed load transport and streambed structure both acted to dissipate flow energy and were mutually constraining. High rates of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport occurred in the streams with no or poor bed structures, and low <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport was associated with well developed structures.

The protrusion of these grains {{is expected to have}} significant influence on the turbulent flow field and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. A field study was conducted to examine the turbulent properties of the flow around naturally formed protruding cobbles at mountain river reach namely Rasil River. The application of Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) was adopted in this study as to measure three-dimensional velocity components (stream-wise, vertical and span-wise) at high frequency measurement. Bed shear stress which is the fundamental variable to link flow conditions to <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport was used to characterize the turbulent flow field in this study. Overlay Analysis in GIS was used as a tool to graphically evaluate performance of bed shear stress in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport study. The initial result from bed shear stress reveals that protruding cobble hadsignificantly modified the turbulent flow structure. High magnitude of bed shear stress that corresponds with the prevalent <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport activities was found to be concentrated on lower bed elevation zone. On the other hand, sheltering effect existed on the zone behind the protruding cobble thus result in weak or zero <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport actions. The derived critical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport zones then were further confirmed by the zonation of sweeps and ejections event from turbulent bursting cycle. The most transported <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> was found to be coincided with high magnitude of sweeps and ejections events. It is evident that river hydraulic survey needs to be done first to identify the most transported <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> zones before deploying <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sampler to get an accurate measurement of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport.

40|$|International audienceField {{measurements}} indicate that, in gravel <b>bed</b> rivers, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> {{may not be}} a one-to-one {{response to}} shear stress but may instead fluctuate a great deal over time for a given flow condition. Both in flume and field experiments, these fluctuations were often associated with migration of low-relief bed forms called <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sheets. Whereas several studies have described <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sheets as a consequence of grain sorting, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms responsible for their production and migration. These were investigated in flume experiments. A set of 20 experiments was conducted under constant feeding rate conditions, with mixtures of different uniform sediments and for slopes varying from 0. 8 to 9 %.

Fractional transport rates were measured in one run. Combined with the results of experiments previously conducted by authors with uniform sediments, this experiment showed that the highest (peak) solid discharges were essentially caused by the much greater mobility of the coarser gravels when transported within <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sheets.

40|$|International audienceTo {{calculate}} <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> engineers {{often use}} flow resistance equations that provide estimates of bed shear stress. In these equations, {{on the basis}} of the estimate of the appropriate hydraulic radius associated with the bed only, the bed roughness k s is commonly set as a constant, whatever the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> intensity. However, several studies have confirmed the existence of feedback mechanisms between flow resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> suggesting that a flow-dependent bed roughness should be used. Therefore, using a data set composed of 2282 flume and field experimental values, this study investigated the importance of these feedback effects. New flow resistance equations were proposed for three flow domains: domain 1 corresponds to no <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and a constant bed roughness k s = D (where D is a representative grain diameter), whereas domain 3 corresponds to a high <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate over a flat bed with a constant bed roughness k s = 2. 6 D. Between these two domains, a transitional domain 2 was identified, for which the bed roughness evolved from D to 2. 6 D with increasing flow conditions. In this domain, the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient f can be approximated using a constant for a given slope. The results using this new flow resistance equation proved to be more accurate than those using equations obtained from simple fittings of logarithmic laws to mean values. The data set indicates that distinguishing domains 2 and 3 is still relevant for <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> In particular, the data indicate a slope dependence in domain 2 but not in domain 3. A <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> model, based on the tractive force concept, is proposed. Finally, flow resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> equations were used together to calculate both shear stress and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> from the flow discharge, the slope, and the grain diameter for each run of the data set.

The data acquired were the distribution of flow speed {{and the spread of}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> along the estuary during dry season. Seventeen locations along the river estuary were selected started from about 1500 m upstream the coastline. The speed measurements were carried out in two points at each location, at 0. 6 of the river depth and on riverbed. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> measurements were done at points close to the riverbed (0. 4 to 0. 6 cm approaching the riverbed). The modeling of the river flow speed at the points near the riverbed {{as well as at the}} points 0. 6 of the depth during low tides showed a decrease in the speed distribution pattern with increasing distance up to the coastline. At the times of low tide, transports of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> takes place in the estuary region of Ranoyapo River. The increase of flow speed due to the increase of flow debit will result in the increase of flow velocity that may exceed the critical value.

Based on a specially designed underwater observation and video-capturing system, experiments on <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement under three streambed structure development scenarios, i. e., well developed, partially developed, and no streambed structures (plane bed), was conducted in a mountain stream in southwest China. Dynamic features of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport (starting mode, trajectory, velocity, and acceleration velocity) under these three typical streambed conditions were observed and analyzed. The streambed structure development degree was measured by a specially manufactured instrument to analyze correlation between <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and streambed structure development. Bed load movement strongly depends on streambed conditions of mountain streams. For channels with well-developed streambed structures, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> mainly move in intermittent saltation, and almost no other motion form occur, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is often very low under this condition.

The spatial distribution of sampling along the reach took into consideration the variance of river topography where 7 meanders, 2 islands and several bank depositions characterize the geometry of the river.

The streams are approximate Froude models of typical prototype braided streams but of no particular river. Slight viscous effects may {{be present in the}} models because particle Reynolds numbers are close to 70. Total <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> discharge was measured every fifteen minutes throughout each 60 hour run. In addition, 80 channel cross‐sections were measured in each run to establish the average channel geometry. Total <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> {{transport rate}} correlates well with total discharge and total stream power, although at a given stream power <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> discharge is greater when braiding is less intense and the width/depth ratio is lower. Analysis using unit stream power and cross‐section average bed shear stress reveals that the laboratory data conform to existing empirical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport relationships. However, comparison with field data from gravel‐bed rivers shows discrepancies that may be due to differences in bed material size gradation and bed sediment structure. At constant discharge, wide fluctuations in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> discharge occur with some regularity. Periods range from 2 to 10 hours in the models, which is equivalent to several tens of hours in a prototype. The presence of these long‐period fluctuations compounds the problems of field measurement of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> in braided streams...|$|R
40|$|River {{could have}} a very {{important}} role in improving the economy of a country when it is correctly and properly utilized. Nevertheless, rivers in Indonesia also have various problems, i. e. erosion and sedimentation which occur in many Indonesian rivers, one of it being the Sesayap River. Because of these problems, {{it is very important to}} do analysis on <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport, in order to find its amount in the existing river, so that optimal handling on the occurring erosion and sedimentation problems could be performed. This research aimed to obtain the amount of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport in Sesayap River, and then compare it to the field condition. The approaches used in this <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport analysis were Einstein approach and Frijlink approach, with data required for the analysis, which was water level elevation, topography data, and sediment gradation data. Based on the result of conducted <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport analysis, the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport analysis result in Seluwing area was higher than in the Port area. Therefore, sediment deposition or sedimentation would occur in the river segment on between both locations. Qualitatively or tendentiously, the above results showed consistency with what actually happened, or observed, in the field. If it assumed that the equivalent diameter of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> is 8 mm, the total of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport on Seluwing area and Port area with Einstein approach are 1, 582, 263 m 3 and 1, 219, 181 m 3. Therefore, the sedimentary deposit per day could be calculated by calculating difference of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport volume divided with total of the calculation day; which resulted sedimentary deposit per day of 2, 859 m 3. Whereas by using the Frijlink approach, the total of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport on Seluwing area and Port area were of 1, 391, 940 m 3 and 1, 080, 200 m 3, and sedimentary deposit per day of 2, 455 m 3. Based on the results, in order to normalize the Sesayap River, the dredging needed is 2, 859 m 3 /day based on Einstein approach and 2, 455 m 3 /day based on Frijlink approach...|$|R

40|$|A 14 -month {{continuous}} {{record of}} the spatial variation in the incidence and magnitude of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport was provided by nine pit traps sunk into the bed of a 21 -m-wide upland gravel bed river. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> data are related to a simultaneous record of average bed shear stress derived from the depth-slope product. The study reach is straight and includes a small, low-relief mid-channel bar which represents the divide between two zones of markedly different bed structure and stability. he bed of the left channel and bar tail is loose with an open framework, while that of the bar head and right channel is tightly interlocking and well imbricated. Bed surface grain size is similar throughout the reach. The two zones of contrasting bed structure have a strong influence {{on the threshold of}} sediment movement (τ c) and consequently the spatial pattern of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. Entrainment thresholds for the tightly structured bed are up to seven times higher than those for the loosely structured bed. Sediment transport is therefore most frequent in the left channel and over the bar tail, where flows with excess shear stresses (τ > τc) peaking at 8 τc constitute 19 % of the flow record. This is in marked contrast to the right channel and bar head, where excess shear stresses of maximum 1. 4 τc total only 1. 3 % of the flow record. However, despite the marked difference in the magnitude and duration of competent flows between the two contrasting bed areas, little difference in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> yield is observed between the nine traps when averaged over the 14 -month study period. This study shows that different zones of bed structure and stability in a channel will control the incidence and spatial pattern of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport but not necessarily the medium and long-term <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> yield. This has important implications for local and short-term <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sampling programs and the numerical modeling of sediment budgets and zone-to-zone <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transfer...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a novel Process-based Distributed Sediment Dynamic Model (PDSDM) to {{estimate}} watershed sediment budgets at spatiotemporal scales, with due {{consideration of the}} suspended <b>loads,</b> <b>bed</b> <b>loads</b> and their interactions within the hillslope and channels. To overcome the limitations of existing approaches, in this model, hillslope and channel sediment dynamics have been modelled separately and the links between hillslope sediment processes and channel sediment dynamics have been strengthened. Fractional sediment <b>loads</b> (<b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and suspended load), their interactions and overall basin-scale sediment budgets have been investigated to represent in-stream sediment dynamics properly. Also, modelling of channel bed level variations has been linked with watershed sediment dynamics and an investigation of climate change conditions on watershed sediment dynamics has been carried out. The PDSDM has been developed by integrating an existing Distributed Hydrological Model (DHM) with newly developed sediment modules for: (i) suspended sediment dynamics at hillslope; (ii) suspended sediment dynamics at channel; (iii) <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> estimation and transport at channel; and (iv) channel bed level variations. In PDSDM, a transport capacity equation is used {{as one of the}} key parameters for estimating suspended sediment dynamics whilst the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is calculated by a <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport equation. The PDSDM has been upgraded by incorporating options to select from and use different transport capacity equations and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport equations to simulate suspended and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport processes in catchment areas. The model has been applied to two different hydro-climatic areas (the Abukuma River Basin in Japan and the Latrobe River Basin in Australia) to ensure its applicability. The modelling outcomes from the application areas {{have been found to be}} consistent in estimating watershed sediment dynamics. Overall, our proposed PDSDM reveals a robust sediment dynamic model that considers all relevant catchment parameters along with a detailed modelling of hillslope and channel areas separately...|$|R
