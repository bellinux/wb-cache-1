The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett {{to him and}} thus diminishing his ideal stature.|$|E

Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> breed the beetles in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, the {{reestablished}} government in Brussels attempted to disarm and demobilize the resistance. In particular, the government feared the organizations would degenerate into armed political militias which could threaten the country's political stability. In October 1944 the government ordered {{members of the}} resistance to surrender their weapons to the police and, in November, threatened to search the houses and fine those who had retained them. This provoked significant anger among resistance members, who had hoped {{that they would be}} able to continue fighting alongside the Allies in the invasion of Germany. On 25 November, a large demonstration of former resistance members took place in Brussels. As the crowds moved towards the Parliament, British soldiers fired on the crowd, which they suspected to <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make left-wing coup d'état. 45 people were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner had a rocky {{relationship}} with the United States. Several items from a US air force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a diplomatic crisis. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley {{said that they were}} standard tools used in counter-terrorism tactics which were being taught to the Argentine police during the joint operation, and asked for the return of the seized materials. Kirchner blamed the whole country for the 2014 default, ruled by US judge Thomas P. Griesa. She said in a cadena nacional ("national network") address that the US may <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> oust her from power, or even assassinate her. She said this a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her. The idea was rejected by opposition leader Elisa Carrió as a mere conspiracy theory.|$|E
5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E
5|$|In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an {{alliance}} of Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward was eventually captured by Isabella's forces and {{the custody of the}} king was assigned to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had backed Isabella's invasion. Henry, reoccupying most of the Lancaster lands, was made constable of Kenilworth and Edward was transported there in late 1326; Henry's legal title to the castle was finally confirmed the following year. Kenilworth was chosen for this purpose by Isabella probably both because it was a major fortification, and also because of the symbolism of its former owners' links to popular ideals of freedom and good government. Royal writs were issued in Edward's name by Isabella from Kenilworth until the next year. A deputation of leading barons led by Bishop Orleton was then sent to Kenilworth to first persuade Edward to resign and, when that failed, to inform him that he had been deposed as king. Edward formally resigned as king in the great hall of the castle on 21 January 1326. As the months went by, however, it became clear that Kenilworth was proving a less than ideal location to imprison Edward. The castle was in a prominent part of the Midlands, in an area that held several nobles who still supported Edward and were believed to <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> rescue him. Henry's loyalty was also coming under question. In due course, Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved by night to Berkeley Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Isabella continued to use Kenilworth as a royal castle until her fall from power in 1330.|$|E
