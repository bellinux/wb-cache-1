The major portion of the review is devoted to important developments in the abiotic formation of bioorganic monomers and their condensation to biopolymers under conditions presumed to have prevailed on the primeval earth. Special attention is given to contributions shedding light on the mechanism of synthesis and selection of amino acids and on interactions of amino acids and polypeptides with nucleotides and oligonucleotides...|$|E
40|$|A {{large amount}} of waste cooking oil has become an {{environmental}} issue around the world. This oil is renewable and biodegradable than the corresponding products made from petroleum sources. The major concern in this study focuses on {{the resistance of the}} biopolymer to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. The virgin oil (VO) and waste oil (WO) was converted into <b>biomonomer.</b> By adding <b>biomonomer</b> with an appropriate amount of 4, 4 ’-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and solvent, the virgin oil polymer (VOP) and waste oil polymer (WOP) were produced. The biopolymer (BP) were added with low loading metal oxide filler which is 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 % of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) to form biopolymer composite (BPC). The resistance to UV light and mechanical properties of BP and BPC were determined after exposure the thin films in UV weatherometer {{for an extended period of}} time at 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000 and 3000 hours. The results based on the spectroscopic analysis of UV-Vis and FTIR confirmed the photodegradation processes of BP and BPC of VOP and WOP. The increasing absorbance in UV-Vis spectra indicated the formation of quinone after UV-irradiation of BP and BPC of VOP and WOP. Furthermore, BP thin films shows rapid loss of tensile strength but the increased loading of TiO 2 can improve mechanical performance. Visual inspection based on the colour changes of the thin films showed quinone (yellow) formation of the irradiated films of BP and BPC of VOP and WOP. As a conclusion, the effect of prolonged exposure to UV light, in general promotes photo degradation for BP but BPC gives slower chemical modification. The innovative biopolymer composite were successfully designed and developed by adding the TiO 2 as UV stabilizer to reduce the photo-degradation of the biopolymer...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a lightweight composite (LC) based on Portland cement concrete with waste lightweight aggregate (WLA) additive was carried out to improve the sustainability and environmental impact and to offer potential cost savings without sacrificing strength. Treatment of {{the surface of the}} LC exposed to environmental attack by coating with biopolymer based on waste cooking oil doped with titanium dioxide photocatalysis (TOP) with superhydrophilic property was found to affect the mechanical properties of the LC in a systematic way. The results of compressive strength showed that the composite achieved the minimum required strength for lightweight construction materials of 17. 2 [*]MPa. Scratch resistance measurements showed that the highest percentages loading of superhydrophilic particles (up to 2. 5 % of <b>biomonomer</b> weight) for LC's surface coating gave the highest scratch resistance while the uncoated sample showed the least resistances. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures revealed the difference between the surface roughness for LC with and without TOP coating. TOP is also formulated to provide self-cleaning LC surfaces based on two principal ways: (1) the development by coating the LC with a photocatalytic superhydrophilic, (2) if such a superhydrophilic is illuminated by light, the grease, dirt, and organic contaminants will be decomposed and can easily be swept away by rain...|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} metabolic {{engineering tools}} and strategies to engineer synthetic enzyme pathways, {{the number and}} diversity of commodity and specialty chemicals that can be derived directly from renewable feedstocks is rapidly and continually expanding. This of course includes a number of monomer building-block chemicals {{that can be used}} to produce replacements to many conventional plastic materials. This review aims to highlight numerous recent and important advancements in the microbial production of these so-called ‘biomonomers’. Relative to naturally-occurring renewable bioplastics, <b>biomonomers</b> offer several important advantages, including improved control over the final polymer structure and purity, the ability to synthesize non-natural copolymers, and allowing products to be excreted from cells which ultimately streamlines downstream recovery and purification. To highlight these features, a handful of <b>biomonomers</b> have been selected as illustrative examples of recent works, including polyamide monomers, styrenic vinyls, hydroxyacids, and diols. Where appropriate, examples of their industrial penetration to date and end-product uses are also highlighted. Novel <b>biomonomers</b> such as these are ultimately paving the way towards new classes of renewable bioplastics that possess a broader diversity of properties than ever before possible...|$|R

50|$|A number {{bioplastic}} {{classes have}} been synthesized from {{plant and animal}} derived fats and oils. Polyurethanes, polyesters, epoxy resins {{and a number of}} other types of polymers have been developed with comparable properties to crude oil based materials. The recent development of olefin metathesis has opened a wide variety of feedstocks to economical conversion into <b>biomonomers</b> and polymers. With the growing production of traditional vegetable oils as well as low cost microalgae derived oils, there is huge potential for growth in this area.|$|R
40|$|Steady state {{cultivation}} and multidimensional {{data analysis}} (metabolic fluxes, absolute proteome, and transcriptome) are used to identify parameters that control the increase in biomass yield of Lactococcus lactis from 0. 10 to 0. 12 C-mol C-mol 21 {{with an increase in}} specific growth rate by 5 times from 0. 1 to 0. 5 h 21. Reorganization of amino acid consumption was expressed by the inactivation of the arginine deiminase pathway at a specific growth rate of 0. 35 h 21 followed by reduced over-consumption of pyruvate directed amino acids (asparagine, serine, threonine, alanine and cysteine) until almost all consumed amino acids were used only for protein synthesis at maximal specific growth rate. This balanced growth was characterized by a high glycolytic flux carrying up to 87 % of the carbon flow and only amino acids that relate to nucleotide synthesis (glutamine, serine and asparagine) were consumed in higher amounts than required for cellular protein synthesis. Changes in the proteome were minor (mainly increase in the translation apparatus). Instead, the apparent catalytic activities of enzymes and ribosomes increased by 3. 5 times (0. 1 vs 0. 5 h 21). The apparent catalytic activities of glycolytic enzymes and ribosomal proteins were seen to follow this regulation pattern while those of enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism increased more than the specific growth rate (over 5. 5 times). Nucleotide synthesis formed the most abundant <b>biomonomer</b> synthetic pathway in the cells with an expenditure of 6 % from the total ATP required for biosynthesis. Due to the increase in apparent catalytic activity, ribosome translation was more efficient at higher growth rates as evidenced by a decrease o...|$|E
40|$|Waste cooking oils are {{problematic}} disposal {{especially in}} the developed countries. Options for disposing of waste cooking oil are limited. Pouring waste cooking oil down to the drain or sewers leads to clog and odour as well as damage wastewater leading to problems for humanlife. Thus, in this research, vegetable waste cooking oil is used as raw material to produce foam. This foam was crosslink with flexible isocyanate type Polymethane Polyphenyl (Modify polymeric-MDI) and further processed into granulate (powder) {{to be able to}} hot compress by hot compression moulding technique. These fabricated samples were namely as biopolymer. The conversion process of <b>biomonomer</b> into BP was examined using Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTiR) show the complete conversion of BP from bio-monomer indicated by 3351 cm- 1 of N-H and carbonyls C=O functional groups at 1743 cm- 1. Meanwhile the weight loss of BP as a function of temperature was determined by using Linseis Thermal Analyser (STA) (TG + DTA) indicating 3 distinct regions comprises of soft and hard segment degradation region at 253 °C and 410 °C respectively. The moulding pressure of 31 bar to 44 bar was set with different weight of granulate of BP from 110 gm to 160 gm. The compressed BP gives the highest tensile and flexural value of 4. 89 MPa and 18. 08 MPa respectively. Evidently, both compress BP of the highest tensile and flexural were affected by the highest density of 1. 42 g/cm 3. In general, the higher the compression moulding pressure the less void was examined, as well as the weight of granulates in the mould. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) of fracture morphology surface of BP shows both ductile and brittle modes, and experiencing a ductile to brittle transition. This is due to increase interfacial strength at higher moulding pressure with good interfacial adhesion between granulates. Thus, the optimal combination of compression moulding parameters is helpful for polymer manufacturing with better mechanical properties such as tensile and flexural strength...|$|E
40|$|The first eon of the Earth, Hadean, is {{no doubt}} {{critical}} {{for the evolution of}} Earth towards a habitable planet and the origin of life. However, there is almost no petrologic record preserved for this piece of history because of the long-term geological reworking. In this study, batch experiments simulating the interaction between the early Earth's ultramafic crust and H 2 O-CO 2 atmosphere were performed in order to gain some new insights into the direct interaction and its influence on the evolution of mineral, atmosphere, ocean and the prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. Electron microscopic observations (including SEM and TEM) show that the secondary minerals produced in the experiments mainly include phyllosilicates, carbonates and Fe-oxide. Phyllosilicates which are essential for <b>biomonomer</b> synthesis can be found in each of our experiments. Different rock-water-H 2 O systems result in different clay minerals with varied crystal habits. Carbonates can be found in experiments carried out at temperature below 400 ºC. With the experimental temperature decrease from 400 ºC to 200 ºC, the formed carbonates change from calcite, dolomite and magnesite accordingly. Energy dispersive spectroscopy reveals the incorporation of iron in all kinds of carbonates. Hexagonal magnetite nanoplates are observed in komatiite-H 2 O-CO 2 experiment carried out at 450 ºC. The mineralogical compositions imply that the interaction between the early Earth's ultramafic crust and H 2 O-CO 2 atmosphere were able to produce clay minerals, carbonates and oxides on the rocky planets such as Earth, which was corroborated by the recent discovery of layered clay minerals and carbonates assemblages on Mars. More importantly, these secondary minerals are effective in catalyzing the inorganic molecular to biomolecules that are essential in prebiotic chemical evolution. The GC measurement of the gaseous phases trapped in the capsule after experiments show that abiogenetic methane, ethane and propane as well as hydrogen were detected in most our experiments. The relative concentrations of these gases are higher in high temperature experiments, which indicate high productivity of CH 4 and H 2 during the interaction between the early Earth's ultramafic crust and H 2 O-CO 2 atmosphere. The abiotic formation and accumulation of H 2, methane, and short hydrocarbon would not only provide material basis for the chemical evolution towards life but also play essential roles in preventing the surface of the Earth from freezing in the Hadean eon while the Earth was suffering from extensive precipitation of atmospheric CO 2 and the faint young sun. Generally, the earliest interaction between the Earth's ultramafic crust and H 2 O-CO 2 atmosphere could have changed the physicochemical condition of the Earth's surface that favored the prebiotic chemical evolution towards life. published_or_final_versionEarth SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

The experimental system consisted of gypsum as the mineral to which an oligonucleotide template attaches (Poly-C or Poly-U) and (5 -prime) -AMP, (5 -prime) -GMP, (5 -prime) -CMP and (5 -prime) -UMP as the interacting <b>biomonomers.</b> When Poly-C or Poly-U were used as adsorbed templates, (5 -prime) -GMP and (5 -prime) -AMP, respectively, were observed {{to be the most}} strongly adsorbed species...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} a {{prebiotic}} environment in which concentration, condensation, and chemical evolution of biomolecules could have occurred is proposed. The principal reactions expected of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, {{and some of their}} precursors in this environment are discussed. The model is based on the concept of a fluctuating system in which hydration and dehydration processes occur in a cyclic manner, with allowance for high concentrations of soluble salts, such as chlorides and sulfates. It is concluded that the proposed prebiotic environment with its dynamical characteristics is a plausible model for the chemical evolution from <b>biomonomers</b> through random oligomers toward self-replicating chemical systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Bernal {{suggested}} that clays might {{have played a}} significant role in primitive earth through the process of concentration and adsorption of the biologically formed <b>biomonomers</b> and thus protecting them against hydrolytic fission. Adsorption of adenine was studied in presence of montmorillonite clay with or without cations Ca 2 +,Cu 2 +,Mg 2 +. Studies carried out have shown that adsorption of adenine was dependent on pH and shows Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Percent binding and values of Langmuir adsorption isotherm on montmorillonite clay with or without divalent cations show that adsorption trend largely depend on the nature of adsorbate and the adsorbent...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} pH and adsorbed ions on the {{adsorption}} of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides on montmorillonite clay was studied experimentally. The specific nucleotides examined were: 5 prime-AMP; 3 -prime AMP; and 5 prime-CMP. The pH of the clay samples was adjusted to various {{levels in the}} 2 - 12 pH range using microliter volumes of concentrated acid (1 N HCl) and base (1 NHNaOH). It was found that preferential adsorption among nulceotides was dependent on the pH level and {{on the characteristics of}} the substituted metal cation and anion exchange mechanisms. Below pH 4, adsorption was attributed to cation and anion exchange mechanisms. Above pH 4, however, adsorption was attributed to the complexation mechanisms occurring between the metal cations in the clay exchange site and in the biomolecule. The possible role of homoionic clays in the concentration mechanisms of <b>biomonomers</b> in the prebiotic environment is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{directed}} {{synthesis of}} biopolymers in an abiotic environment is presumably a cyclic sequence of steps {{which may be}} realized in a fluctuating environment such as a prebiotic pond undergoing wetting-drying cycles. Soluble mineral salts have been proposed as {{an essential component of}} this fluctuating environment. The following sequence may be considered as a most primitive mechanism of information transfer in a fluctuating environment: (1) adsorption of a biomolecule onto a soluable mineral salt surface to act as an adsorbed template; (2) specific adsorption of <b>biomonomers</b> onto the adsorbed template; (3) condensation of the adsorbed biomonomers; and (4) desorption of the elongated oligomer. In this investigation, the salts selected for study were CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O(gypsum), SrSO 4, and several other metal sulfates and chlorides. Adsorption of the monomeric species, gly, 5 'AMP 5 'GMP, and 5 'CMP was investigated. The adsorbed template biopolymers used were Poly-A, Poly-G, Poly-C, and Poly-U. The results of studies involving these experimental participants, the first two steps of the proposed primitive information transfer mechanism, and condensation of amino acids to form oligomers in a fluctuating environment are to be reported...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a {{ubiquitous}} molecule in the Universe. It {{is a compound that}} is easily produced in significant yields in prebiotic simulation experiments using a reducing atmosphere. HCN can spontaneously polymerise under a wide set of experimental conditions. It {{has even been}} proposed that HCN polymers could be present in objects such as asteroids, moons, planets and, in particular, comets. Moreover, {{it has been suggested that}} these polymers could play an important role in the origin of life. In this review, the simple organics and <b>biomonomers</b> that have been detected in HCN polymers, the analytical techniques and procedures that have been used to detect and characterise these molecules and an exhaustive classification of the experimental/environmental conditions that favour the formation of HCN polymers are summarised. Nucleobases, amino acids, carboxylic acids, cofactor derivatives and other compounds have been identified in HCN polymers. The great molecular diversity found in HCN polymers encourages their placement at the central core of a plausible protobiological system.
