25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction engine types {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the <b>back</b> <b>axle.</b> This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.|$|E
500|$|Curt accompanies Steve, last year's {{high school}} student class president, and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the back-to-high-school sock hop. In one story line, Curt is desperate to find a {{beautiful}} blonde girl driving a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird that he sees {{en route to the}} dance: at a stoplight, she appears to say [...] "I love you" [...] before disappearing around the corner. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its <b>back</b> <b>axle.</b> The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth. Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing. It turns out to be [...] "The Blonde" [...] who says she knows him and maybe she would see him cruising the coming night. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he decided {{to go to college and}} will be leaving that morning.|$|E
2500|$|On the August 21 {{episode of}} Raw, DX {{repeatedly}} vandalized Vince's property by [...] "DX" [...] on first Vince's $30 million private jet, then {{the front of}} the WWE World Headquarters building, and finally Vince's limousine (as well as tying a chain to the <b>back</b> <b>axle</b> of the limousine, causing the axle to be violently pulled off when Vince and Shane tried to leave).|$|E

50|$|The website of the International Alliance of Morris owners {{explains}} that this car {{was designed by}} Morris-Commercial, the part of Morris's empire that made commercial vehicles and their engines and Morris gearboxes and <b>back</b> <b>axles.</b> This 15.9 hp Morris-Commercial engine was intended for a truck.|$|R
2500|$|The Routemaster was a {{departure}} from the traditional chassis/body construction method. It {{was one of the first}} [...] "integral" [...] buses, with a combination of an [...] "A" [...] steel sub-frame (including engine, steering and front suspension) and a rear [...] "B" [...] steel sub-frame (carrying rear axle and suspension), connected by an aluminium body. The gearbox was mounted on the underside of the body structure with shafts to the engine and <b>back</b> <b>axle.</b> Later pre-war London trolleybuses, however, had previously adopted chassisless construction.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{was fitted}} with a purpose built 18.3-litre V12 engine based on a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and Sunbeam Arab aero engines. [...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by {{a complex set of}} 16 gears {{from the front of the}} crankshaft - a very similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per bank of cylinders. A 4-speed transmission initially drove a <b>back</b> <b>axle</b> with differential with a shaft drive rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple crown wheel and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a foot brake acting on the transmission and a hand brake on the rear drums. Suspension was also typical, with half-elliptic springs all round damped by Andre Hartford friction shock absorbers.|$|E

This car combined semi-elliptic front suspension with transverse rear springing. The bodies built at Sparkbrook {{were among the first}} all-metal bodywork. Engines gearboxes and <b>back</b> <b>axles</b> were supplied for other Siddeley-Deasy cars.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle had an {{air-cooled}} OHC four-cylinder boxer engine with 2490 cc and [...] power. The car had 3 axles, {{of which}} both <b>back</b> <b>axles</b> were driven.

60|$|Not {{without much}} {{difficulty}} did the three youths {{manage to get}} the ropes disentangled from the rear wheels and the <b>back</b> <b>axle.</b> It was found {{that one of the}} hooks had gone into a tire, causing a blow-out that, in the general excitement, nobody had noticed. But otherwise everything seemed to be all right, apart, of course, from the broken brake rod, and the boys were thankful.|$|E
5000|$|PD1/1: This {{version was}} {{supplied}} {{exclusively to the}} City Coach Company of Brentwood, whose main service was an inter-urban run from Wood Green in East London to Southend-on-Sea in Essex, the twenty vehicles being delivered to City with bodies by Alexander, J.C.

60|$|They swung {{out on the}} running-board, now awash. With slight squeals {{they dropped}} into the cold stream. Dripping, laughing, his clothes {{clinging}} to him, he ducked down behind the car to get the jack under the <b>back</b> <b>axle,</b> and with the water gurgling about her and splashing its exhilarating coldness into her face, she stooped beside him to yank the stiff new chains over the rear wheels.|$|E

Milt was, with a hatchet from his camping-kit, cutting down a large scrub pine. He dragged it to the Gomez and hitched it to the <b>back</b> <b>axle.</b> The knuckles of the branches would dig into the earth, the foliage catch at every pebble.|$|E
6000|$|It was speedily {{apparent}} that Sir Richmond was an experienced and excellent driver. He took the Charmeuse {{out into the}} traffic of Baker Street and westward through brisk and busy streets and roads to Brentford and Hounslow smoothly and swiftly, making a score of unhesitating and accurate decisions without apparent thought. There was very little conversation until they were through Brentford. Near Shepherd's Bush, Sir Richmond had explained, [...] "This is not my own particular car. That was butted into at the garage this morning and its radiator cracked. So I had {{to fall back on}} this. It's quite a good little car. In its way. My wife drives it at times. It has one or two constitutional weaknesses--incidental to the make--gear-box over the <b>back</b> <b>axle</b> for example--gets all the vibration. Whole machine rather on the flimsy side. Still--" ...|$|E
50|$|The Roadster was the {{original}} car and was based around Triumph Herald components. The two seat body built of aluminium and glass fibre had a radiator grille slightly similar to pre-war Alfa Romeo sports cars. In 1981 the Morris Marina became the donor car replacing the Triumph and the Marina engine became standard although many customers fitted engines, gearboxes and <b>back</b> <b>axles</b> of their own choice. Fitted with the two-litre inline-six from a late Triumph Vitesse, {{a top speed of}} 177 km/h was achievable.|$|R
50|$|All models had {{a ladder}} frame with two axles on semi {{elliptical}} leaf springs. A set <b>back</b> front <b>axle</b> allowed a wheelbase of only 9 ft, allowing {{a very short}} turn radius.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle had an {{air-cooled}} OHC {{four-cylinder engine}} with 1981 cc rated to [...] power. Fuel consumption {{was up to}} 20 liters per 100km. The car had 3 axles, of which both <b>back</b> <b>axles</b> were driven, resulting in offroad capabilities significantly superior {{to the majority of}} contemporary models. It had 4 gears and 1 reverse gear. The truck chassis, based on the Tatra backbone chassis conception, has 908kg empty weight, and passenger version weighted typically 1300-1400 kg. The Tatra T72 was capable of traveling at 65 km/h speed. In the most common passenger version it was capable of carrying 13 men besides the driver, or 1500 kg of cargo.|$|R
60|$|They hooked {{it to the}} <b>back</b> <b>axle,</b> and Harding {{cautiously}} led {{the team}} down the incline while Devine went to the leading horses' heads, and the others checked the wagon with the tackle. The teams were obviously nervous, and the pole-horses now and then lifted their haunches {{to hold back the}} load, although they did not feel much of its weight. After some trouble Harding got the wagon round the first turning, taking the leaders {{up the side of the}} ravine in order to do so; but the trail ahead was steeper, and the big drop not far below. They chocked the wheels with logs while they moved the tackle, and Harding stood for a few moments, breathing heavily, as he looked down into the gorge. He could see the snowy trail wind for a short distance among the trees, and then it dipped out of sight beyond a turn. It was beaten hard, and here and there its surface caught a ray of light and flashed with an icy gleam. They were half-way down; but the worst was to come.|$|E
6000|$|The troops waded the stream, {{which was}} up to their necks in the deepest part. Teams were crossed by {{attaching}} a long rope {{to the end of}} the wagon tongue passing it between the two swing mules and by the side of the leader, hitching his bridle as well as the bridle of the mules in rear to it, and carrying the end to men on the opposite shore. The bank down to the water was steep on both sides. A rope long enough to cross the river, therefore, was attached to the <b>back</b> <b>axle</b> of the wagon, and men behind would hold the rope to prevent the wagon [...] "beating" [...] the mules into the water. This latter rope also served the purpose of bringing the end of the forward one back, to be used over again. The water was deep enough for a short distance to swim the little Mexican mules which the army was then using, but they, and the wagons, were pulled through so fast by the men at the end of the rope ahead, that no time was left them to show their obstinacy. In this manner the artillery and transportation of the [...] "army of occupation" [...] crossed the Colorado River.|$|E

[...] Now: [...] "It's still distinctly understood that I am not engaged to him, and I'm not going to be surprised into kissing him when he comes down like a wolf on the fold."

[...] Now: [...] "Ohhhhhh geeeeee whizzzzzz! I wonder if he'll let us go any farther in the car? He's so managerial, and dad is sure to take his side. He tried to scare us off by that telegram to Fargo." [...] Now: [...] "He'd be horrified if he knew about that bum brake. Milt didn't mind. Milt likes his womenfolks to be daring.

5000|$|Riders usually pedal a {{few times}} for speed, and then perform various stunts often {{involving}} difficult and/or awkward stances on pegs, mounted to the axles of their front or back wheels. Pegs are aluminum or plastic tubes, which are bolted onto {{both sides of the}} front and <b>back</b> <b>axles.</b> When flatland riding first began, most riders would do one trick and then return to the pedals. However, by combining different body and bicycle positions into [...] "combos" [...] and [...] "linking" [...] them together, riders began to do several tricks in a row without stopping between each move. Flatland riding is now usually a combination of many different kinds of moves, often linked together non-stop as the rider goes through as many as 10-12 consecutive moves, and position/direction changes, before returning to the pedals.|$|R
