With the end of IRAT's lease in 1971 the Co-op found a base in a long-term squat in a former dairy at 13a Prince of Wales Crescent in Kentish Town. For most of its life the LFMC was based in Gloucester Avenue in Camden in a run down building which {{for a number of years}} also housed the London Musicians Collective. In 1997 the LFMC moved together with London Video Arts to the new Lux Centre, Hoxton Square.|$|E
40|$|Till now {{communication}} is possible of 7 <b>bit</b> <b>information</b> data string by transmitting 11 bit data string in single frame {{due to this}} speed of communication system is very slow. And we can transmit very minimum number of configuration of data string. To increase the speed of communication system and increase the numbers of configuration data string author design some communication system by different methodologies of Hamming code. About all these communication systems all methodologies are discuss here. First, author design communication system to make communication by even parity check method for 25 <b>bit</b> <b>information</b> data string. In second paper, author design communication system to make communication by odd parity check method for 25 <b>bit</b> <b>information</b> data.

40|$|Hamming {{code for}} error {{detection}} and correction methodology {{is used for}} error free communication in communication systems. In communication system information data is transferred from source to destination through channel. In between, source and destination, data may be corrupted due to any type of noise. To find original information we use Hamming code error detection and correction technique. In hamming code error detection and correction technique, to get error free data at destination, we encrypt information data according to even and odd parity method before transmission of information at source end. In this project 14 <b>bit</b> <b>Information</b> data {{is divided into two}} groups of 7 bit data. After this division each group is encrypted using four Redundancy bit. In this way 14 <b>bit</b> <b>information</b> data at sender end is now converted into two groups of 11 bit data (with redundant bits). Both groups are joined to make total 22 <b>bit</b> <b>Information</b> data. At Receiver end 22 <b>bit</b> <b>information</b> data in divided into two groups of 11 bit data and each group is detected and corrected using even and odd parity check method. After correction both group are joined together to Receive 22 bit original information data. Here, Xilinx ISE 10. 1 Simulator has been used for simulating VHDL Code.
