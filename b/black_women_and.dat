In Cleveland, Ohio, after an officer was acquitted at trial in the shooting of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, BLM protested.

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (<b>black</b> <b>women)</b> <b>and</b> analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Type II endometrial carcinomas usually {{occur in}} older, post-menopausal people, in the United States {{are more common}} in <b>black</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> are not {{associated}} with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia.

They can appear to be epithelial ovarian cancer on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with {{a greater risk of}} relapse and/or metastasis.|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of <b>black</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Macandal {{is a black}} slave, first {{introduced}} on the same plantation as Ti Noel. He is admired for his qualities that are irresistible to <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> his ability to captivate men. He regales tales of great kingdoms and speaks of epic battles in which the animals were allies of men, of the incarnation of the serpent, of a queen who was the Rainbow, and of horses adorned with silver coins. Macandal has his left arm amputated after a machinery accident on the plantation of Lenormand de Mezy and, unable to complete heavy work, is {{put in charge of}} pasturing the cattle. He departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi about which he is taught more by an old, mysterious woman who is something of a witch. Macandal leaves the plantation, attains the ability to transform into various beings, and is represented as having superhuman powers due to his possession by the gods.|$|E
5|$|Makeba's {{music was}} also popular in Europe, and she {{travelled}} and performed there frequently. Acting {{on the advice}} of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.|$|E

25|$|Materialist {{feminism}} {{has been}} criticized for assuming universal oppression of women. By focusing on capitalist relations combined with patriarchy, materialist feminism fails to include women of different classes, sexualities and ethnicities.

She instead noted the ways that values of the family are different for <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> men, just as the division of labor is also radicalized.|$|E

25|$|Much of Alice Walker’s progeny {{admits that}} while she is {{the creator of the}} term, Walker fails to {{consistently}} define the term and often contradicts herself.

25|$|Historians {{believe that}} cotton farming was {{introduced}} into the United States by immigrants. While it was recorded in Florida in 1556 and in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, {{it is believed that}} cotton has been planted and cultured in the United States since 1621. Plantation owners brought mass supplies of labor (slaves) from Africa and the Caribbean and Mexico to farm the fields during cotton harvests. <b>Black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children were also employed in the industry. Cotton farming became a major issue of racial conflict {{in the history of the}} United States, particularly during the 19th-century. Prior to the U.S Civil War, cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850. After, Southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the North, and many white Democrats were concerned about how many of them were being employed in the U.S. cotton industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners. They urged white farmers in the South to take control of the industry, which from time to time resulted in strikes by black cotton pickers; for instance blacks led by the Colored Farmer's Association (CFA) strikers from Memphis organized a strike in Lee County, Arkansas in 1891, which resulted in much violence. Black cotton farmers were very important to entrepreneurs which emerged during industrialization in the United States, particularly Henry Ford.|$|E

500|$|Critic Hilton Als {{believes}} that {{the title of this}} book may have an additional significance. [...] A prevailing theme in Gather Together is how one Black female was able to survive in the wider context of post-war America, but it also speaks for all <b>Black</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> how they came to survive in a white-dominated society.

500|$|In 1786, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor {{was formed}} by {{citizens}} concerned {{at the size of}} London's indigent Black population, many of whom had been expelled from North America as Black Loyalists — former slaves who had fought {{on the side of the}} British in the War of Independence. Others were discharged sailors and some a legacy of British involvement in the slave trade. The committee distributed food, clothing, medical aid and found work for men, from various locations including the White Raven tavern in Mile End. They also helped the men to go abroad, some to Canada. In October 1786, the Committee funded an ill-fated expedition of 280 black men, 40 <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> 70 white women (mainly wives and girlfriends) to settle in Sierra Leone.

And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet, it's a cultural moment." [...] Claiming the album should bring her critical praise, the magazine concludes its review with the statement [...] "he princess of America's black royal family has announced herself sexually mature and surrendered none of her crown's luster in the process. <b>Black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> their friends, lovers and children have a victory in Janet." [...] Robert Christgau originally gave the album an [...] "honorable mention" [...] in consumer guide for The Village Voice, wherein he complimented its erotic songs and cited [...] "Funky Big Band", [...] "Throb", and [...] "Be a Good Boy" [...] as highlights. Billboard magazine gave a positive review, stating [...] "estined to be an instant smash, Ms. Jackson's latest is a glamorous assortment of styles—pop, dance, R, rock, jazz, rap—each delivered with consummate skill and passion.

500|$|Sal Cinquemani noted her {{popularity}} had eclipsed Michael Jackson's, [...] "as {{she would}} continue to do {{for more than a}} decade." [...] Music scholars John Shepherd and David Horn wrote that as a crossover artist on the pop and R charts, she emerged [...] "the most dominant female performer of the 1980s" [...] behind Whitney Houston. Dan Rubey observed that she presented herself as a role model for <b>black</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> as a creative intellect whose work advocated the advancement of black people. Joseph Vogel stated that her rising popularity {{towards the end of the}} decade was important for several reasons, [...] "not the least of which was how it coincided with (and spoke to) the rise of black feminism." [...] At a time when radio airplay and MTV primarily catered to white rock musicians, her album and its predecessor garnered widespread critical acclaim alongside other [...] "unprecedented breakthroughs" [...] by black women—including Alice Walker's The Color Purple (1982), Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987) and Patricia Hill Collins's Black Feminist Thought (1990)—musically capturing the spirit of the movement and presenting an alternate model on both womanhood and feminism to that of Madonna. Regarding her diverse appeal among youth, he also stated: [...] "Janet didn't have the vocal prowess of Whitney Houston, or the poetic subtlety of Kate Bush; she didn't have Annie Lennox's penchant for the avant-garde or Madonna's predilection for shock. But none of these artists achieved the cross-racial impact (particularly on youth culture) of Janet. And none of them had an album like Rhythm Nation 1814." ...|$|E
