40|$|Abstract. Karchmer, Kushilevitz and Nisan {{formulated}} {{the formula}} size problem as an integer programming problem called the rectangle <b>bound</b> and introduced {{a technique called}} the LP <b>bound,</b> which gives a formula size lower <b>bound</b> by showing a feasible solution of the dual problem of its LP-relaxation. As extensions of the LP <b>bound,</b> we introduce novel general techniques proving formula size lower <b>bounds,</b> named a quasi-additive <b>bound</b> and the Sherali-Adams <b>bound.</b> While the Sherali-Adams <b>bound</b> is potentially strong enough to give a lower <b>bound</b> matching to the rectangle <b>bound,</b> we prove that the quasi-additive <b>bound</b> can surpass the rectangle <b>bound.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMinimal <b>bounds</b> on {{the mean}} square error (MSE) are {{generally}} used in order to predict the best achievable performance of an estimator for a given observation model. In this paper, {{we are interested in}} the Bayesian <b>bound</b> of the Weiss–Weinstein family. Among this family, we have Bayesian Cramér-Rao <b>bound,</b> the Bobrovsky–MayerWolf–Zakaï <b>bound,</b> the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound,</b> the Bobrovsky–Zakaï <b>bound,</b> the Reuven–Messer <b>bound,</b> and the Weiss–Weinstein <b>bound.</b> We present a unification of all these minimal <b>bounds</b> based on a rewriting of the minimum {{mean square error}} estimator (MMSEE) and on a constrained optimization problem. With this approach, we obtain a useful theoretical framework to derive new Bayesian <b>bounds.</b> For that purpose, we propose two <b>bounds.</b> First, we propose a generalization of the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound</b> extending the works of Bobrovsky, Mayer–Wolf, and Zakaï. Second, we propose a <b>bound</b> based on the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound</b> and on the Reuven–Messer <b>bound,</b> representing a generalization of these <b>bounds.</b> The proposed <b>bound</b> is the Bayesian extension of the deterministic Abel <b>bound</b> and is found to be tighter than the Bayesian Bhattacharyya <b>bound,</b> the Reuven–Messer <b>bound,</b> the Bobrovsky–Zakaï <b>bound,</b> and the Bayesian Cramér–Rao <b>bound.</b> We propose some closed-form expressions of these <b>bounds</b> for a general Gaussian observation model with parameterized mean.

5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with <b>bounding</b> hops and the tail held high.|$|E

5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their <b>bounding</b> abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, <b>bounding</b> over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a <b>bounding</b> motion.|$|E
5|$|Two {{prominent}} {{forms of}} display among these animals is whistling and <b>bounding.</b> Instead of scent-marking its territory, the reedbuck {{will give a}} shrill whistle to make the boundaries of its territory be known. As it whistles, it expels air through its nose with such a force that the whole of its body vibrates. These whistles, usually one to three in number, are followed by a few stotting bounds. This behaviour {{is also used to}} raise alarm in herds. In this, the reedbuck raises its neck, exposing the white patch on its throat, but keeping the tail down, and leaps in a way similar to the impala's jumps, landing on its forelegs. This is accompanied by the popping of the inguinal glands in the legs. Fights begin with both opponents holding their horns low, in a combat stance; followed by the locking of horns and pushing one another. These fights can even lead to deaths.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. <b>Bounding</b> {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E
