5|$|The {{increased}} use of the English language globally has {{had an effect on}} other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death, and to claims of linguistic imperialism, and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.|$|E
25|$|The socioeconomic/environmental {{hypothesis}} {{proposed that}} smoking results <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> with schizophrenia are unemployed and inactive, so smoking relieves boredom.

25|$|Forest fires: Like {{in other}} {{countries}} with very hot summers and seasonal drying of soils and vegetation, every year {{large areas of the}} Portuguese forest are destroyed. This has an important impact on the economy <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> and industries depend on forestry related activities. It is also a very dramatic ecological problem and a safety issue for the populations.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} {{fears that the}} disease would further spread <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were still living in unsanitary camps {{as a result of}} the {{earthquake}} earlier in the year. Those concerns came despite claims that the outbreak had been contained in the north and central parts of the country. The Pan American Health Organisation predicted that 270,000 people would be infected within a year of the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|Training {{involves}} the systematic teaching of skills, concepts, or attitudes {{that results in}} improved performance in another environment. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> hired for a job are not already versed in all the tasks the job requires, training {{may be needed to}} help the individual perform the job effectively. Evidence indicates that training is often effective, and that it succeeds in terms of higher net sales and gross profitability per employee.|$|E
25|$|Some {{newspapers}} {{have dealt with}} the criticism by moving the strip from the comics page to the editorial page, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> believe that a politically based comic strip like Doonesbury does not belong in a traditionally child-friendly comics section. The Lincoln Journal started the trend in 1973. In some papers (such as the Tulsa World and Orlando Sentinel) Doonesbury appears on the opinions page alongside Mallard Fillmore, a politically conservative comic strip.|$|E
50|$|But {{the clocks}} were still {{aligned with the}} local noonday sun. Following the {{invention}} of the locomotive in 1830, time had to be synchronized across vast distances in order to organize the train schedules. This eventually {{led to the development of}} time zones, and, thus, global isochronous time. These time changes were not accepted everywhere right away, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people's</b> lives were still tied closely to the length of the daytime. With the invention in 1879 of the light bulb, that changed too.|$|R

25|$|Aripiprazole, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Abilify among others, is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic. It is recommended and primarily used {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Other uses include as an add-on treatment in major depressive disorder, tic disorders, and irritability associated with autism. According to a Cochrane review, evidence for the oral form in schizophrenia is not sufficient to determine effects on general functioning. Additionally, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> dropped out of the medication trials before they were completed, the overall strength of the conclusions is low.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is {{extracted}} {{from the town of}} Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> especially foreign tourists, {{do not know how to}} determine what is real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{humpback}} dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is {{endemic to}} West Africa. Several stocks {{have been identified}} with numbers ranging from tens to a few hundred. Abundance estimates are lacking. Gaps in the species range and hence distribution is evident. Bycatch is only documented in a few West African countries. Surveys and evaluations need to be conducted to determine the presence/ absence of humpback dolphins in their historical range. Conservation measures need to be implemented to save this species. <b>Because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> live off the sea, it is not feasible to have complete gillnet closures. Some areas may be designated as off-limits to gillnet fisheries. Eco-tourism may be implemented successfully because of high species diversity.|$|E

25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through {{behavioral}} change, as mentioned above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people {{to make changes in}} their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E

Another was that his third cousin Charlotte Gedeon said Elmer carried her grandmother's casket during a funeral.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Gernsback {{decided to}} merge Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories into Wonder Stories. The {{reason for the}} merger is unknown, {{although}} {{it may have been}} that he needed the space in the printing schedule for his new Aviation Mechanics magazine. Bleiler has suggested that the merger was caused by poor sales and a consequent need to downsize. In addition, Air Wonder Stories was probably focused on too specialized a niche to succeed. In an editorial just before Science Wonder Stories changed its name, Gernsback commented that the word [...] "Science" [...] in the title [...] "has tended to retard the progress of the magazine, <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> had the impression that it is a sort of scientific periodical rather than a fiction magazine". Ironically, the inclusion of [...] "science" [...] in the title was the reason that science fiction writer Isaac Asimov began reading the magazine; when he saw the August 1929 issue he obtained permission to read it from his father {{on the grounds that it}} was clearly educational. Concerns about the marketability of titles seem to have surfaced in the last two issues of Science Wonder, which had the word [...] "Science" [...] printed in a color that made it difficult to read. On the top of the cover appeared the words [...] "Mystery-Adventure-Romance", the last of which was a surprising way to advertise a science fiction magazine.|$|E

2500|$|When {{producing}} alphabetized {{lists of}} Portuguese names, generally {{the full name}} is used.

2500|$|Eating in the sukkah {{does not}} cause a {{parallel}} problem <b>because</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> simply enjoy eating outdoors {{in the shade of}} a sukkah. Hence, seeing someone eating in a sukkah does not per se lead one to assume it is still ḥol hamoed. Likewise, eating in the sukkah does not per se impinge on one's own celebration of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, the prevalent practice is to eat in the sukkah on Shemini Azeret outside the Land of Israel, but not to recite the berakhah for sitting in a sukkah, as reciting it would [...] "impinge" [...] on the unique status of Shemini Atzeret.|$|E
