5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> owl.

In the 1260s, however, the Welsh leader Llywelyn ap Gruffudd exploited a civil war between Henry III and rebel barons in England to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> power, and was formally recognised as the prince of Wales under the Treaty of Montgomery.|$|E

5|$|Ghost {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the StarCraft series. The series is set in a distant part of the galaxy called the Koprulu Sector and begins in the year 2499. Terran exiles from Earth are governed by a totalitarian empire, the Terran Dominion, that is opposed by several smaller rebel groups. Two alien races discover humanity: the insectoid Zerg, who begin to invade planets controlled by the Terrans; and the Protoss, an enigmatic race with strong psionic power that attempt to eradicate the Zerg. Ghost takes place four years after the conclusion of , in which the Zerg <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> power in the sector and leave both the Protoss and the Dominion in ruins. The game follows the story of Nova, a young ghost agent—a human espionage operative with psychic abilities—in the employ of the Dominion.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Sultan Selim I (1512–1520) {{successfully}} {{expanded the}} empire's {{southern and eastern}} borders by defeating Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty in the Battle of Chaldiran. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into Algeria and Egypt, and created a naval presence in the Red Sea. Subsequently, a contest started between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> sea power in the Indian Ocean, {{with a number of}} naval battles in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived {{as a threat to the}} Ottoman monopoly over the ancient trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe. Despite the increasingly prominent European presence, the Ottoman Empire's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E

5|$|The area roughly {{located between}} the Danube, Tisza and Dniester rivers – {{approximately}} coinciding with modern-day Romania – became {{home to a}} varied group of Thracian peoples including Getae and Dacians sometime around the 7th to 6th centuries BC. The Getae and Dacians are related, but, distinct peoples that are sometimes treated as a single group {{under the name of}} Geto-Dacians. The Getae and Dacian peoples held many cultural and linguistic similarities. The Getae living in the lower Danube basin were able to establish regular trading commerce with the Greek cities along the coast of the Black Sea. The Dacians were located in the Carpatho-Danubian basin along the southern border of the Carpathian Mountains. This geographic isolation allowed the Dacians to survive catastrophic struggles – often with the Getae – and thrive to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> tribe by the 1st century BC.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{also offers}} {{speculation}} on the pack-hunting habits of Albertosaurus. The leg {{proportions of the}} smaller individuals were {{comparable to those of}} ornithomimids, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger Albertosaurus were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult Albertosaurus in mass. A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> predators on their islands. However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Protoss are now led by Zeratul and Artanis. They {{begin to}} {{evacuate}} the surviving population of Aiur to the dark templar homeworld of Shakuras under a fragile alliance between the two untrusting branches of the Protoss. On Shakuras, they are misled by Kerrigan into attacking the Zerg to advance Kerrigan's quest to securing power over the Zerg. This deception comes after she reveals that a new Overmind has entered incubation. Meanwhile, Earth decides to take action in the sector, sending a fleet to conquer the Terran Dominion and capture the new Overmind. Although successfully taking the Dominion capital Korhal and enslaving the Overmind, the UED's efforts to capture Mengsk are thwarted by a double agent working for Kerrigan, Samir Duran. Kerrigan, allying with Mengsk, Fenix and Raynor, launches a campaign against the UED, recapturing Korhal. She turns against her allies, however; Fenix and Duke both perish in the ensuing attacks. Kerrigan later blackmails Zeratul into killing the new Overmind, giving her full control over the entire Zerg Swarm. After defeating a retaliatory attack by the Protoss, Dominion, and the UED (consequently destroying {{the last of the}} UED fleet), Kerrigan and her Zerg broods <b>become</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> power in the sector.|$|E
