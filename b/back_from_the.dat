5|$|Many {{commentators}} credit Obama with averting {{a threatened}} depression and pulling the economy <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Great Recession.

The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Parthian wars, tribal groups {{along the}} Rhine and Danube took {{advantage}} of Rome's preoccupation with the eastern frontier (and the plague that the Romans suffered from after bringing it <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east) and launched a series of incursions into Roman territories, including the Marcomannic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans {{at each end of}} the bridge cross the former towpaths.

5|$|A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa Donovan (Alice Kremelberg), is {{declared}} brain dead at {{a hospital}} and is pulled off life support. While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead and yells highly classified naval missile codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes are tied to a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Montana was {{tasked with}} convoy escort and {{training}} ship duties. With {{the end of}} the war in November 1918 came a new task, transporting American soldiers <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battlefields of Europe. She made six round trips to France and carried back a total of 8,800men. Montana was then transferred to the Puget Sound Naval Yard in Washington State, where she was decommissioned and renamed Missoula. She remained in the reserve fleet until 1930, when she was stricken under the terms of the London Naval Treaty. The ship was eventually sold for scrap in 1935 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the arrival of}} foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E

5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable {{to have the}} transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E

5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Born in West Germany, Wever {{moved to}} the United States as a child, where he took up {{baseball}}. He played baseball {{in high school and}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on 17 September 1982. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which he tried to pitch through for two years before having surgery in 1984. He tried to come <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> injury in 1985, but retired. After retiring, he opened a bar in San Francisco, which he continues to run.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front line, were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E

5|$|Fighting stopped {{following}} a Croatian counter-attack that pushed the JNA <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of Šibenik. Although some ground {{was lost to}} the Yugoslavs, especially around the town of Drniš, northeast of Šibenik, the ZNG captured several JNA and Yugoslav Navy facilities in the city, including dozens of navy vessels and several coastal artillery batteries. The captured batteries were used to support defence of the city. The JNA Šibenik garrison was evacuated {{following a}}n agreement between the Croatian officials and the JNA, except for several comparably small JNA posts in the city which were captured by the ZNG.|$|E
5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's 2006 {{season began}} with a tough game against No. 2 Notre Dame. Though the Yellow Jackets lost 14-10, they took an early 10-0 lead over heavily favored Notre Dame until the Fighting Irish scored 14 {{unanswered}} points to win the game. Tech bounced <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> narrow loss by winning five straight games, including a 38-27 victory in Blacksburg, Virginia against the No. 11 Virginia Tech Hokies, who would later go on to finish second in the division.|$|E
