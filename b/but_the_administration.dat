At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The theories of the American educator John Dewey especially influenced him.

25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly {{with a small group}} of strike leaders to hammer out an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not feel compelled to recognize the union. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> did rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, 1880, an African American cadet at West Point, Johnson Chesnut Whittaker, {{was found}} bruised and beaten in his cot. He {{claimed that he}} had been {{attacked}} by fellow cadets, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> claimed he had fabricated his story to win sympathy. Whittaker was court-martialed and expelled for allegedly faking an assault on himself staged by his fellow cadets. A Congressional investigation into the incident resulted in Schofield's removal from his post as superintendent in 1881.|$|E

Prior to his emigration to Kuwait in 1956 for another teaching job, al-Hout obtained Lebanese citizenship, despite reservations by his father. It was during his brief stay in Kuwait that he met Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian activists. Two years later, after correspondence with Salim al-Lawzi, he returned to Lebanon where he was given the post of chief editor at the Lebanese magazine al-Hawadeth run by al-Lawzi. He soon gained a reputation of being a Nasserist—a supporter of Egyptian president at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser—journalist.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} {{of the present}} college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking {{the support of the}} trustees, the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, Edward Harkness, finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{insisted on}} special {{status as a}} longstanding belligerent during the war, {{concerned}} {{that if it were}} treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by William L. Clayton, promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany. However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|The Sooners {{play their}} home games at Gaylord Family - Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. The stadium was {{formerly}} called Oklahoma Memorial Stadium <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> decided to add 'Gaylord Family' {{to recognize the}} contributions made by Edward K. Gaylord and his family over the years (estimated at over $50million). The playing surface is called Owen Field after Bennie Owen, Oklahoma's coach from 1905 to 1926. The stadium was built in 1923 with an original capacity of 500. In 1925, 16,000seats were added and 16,000 more seats were added in 1929 bringing the total capacity to 32,000. The stadium has had a natural grass playing surface {{for the majority of}} its existence. The stadium had an artificial turf from 1970 to 1994. The stadium had a major renovation in 2003 when a new upper deck was added to {{the east side of the}} stadium, adding over 8,400 new seats. The current capacity is 82,112, which makes it the 14th largest college stadium in the U.S. and second largest in the Big 12 Conference. Despite the official capacity, the Sooners routinely average well above capacity, most recently 85,056 for the 2011 season. The largest crowd ever was 87,939 on September 17, 2016 against Ohio State.|$|E

500|$|Further {{treatment}} for complications of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, or low blood pressure may be required. [...] Metabolic acidosis is treated by administering sodium bicarbonate. Low {{blood pressure is}} usually treated with intravenous fluid replacement, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of dopamine or norepinephrine {{may be required to}} restore blood pressure. The management of rhabdomyolysis includes ensuring adequate hydration and urinary alkalinization; a complication of rhabdomyolysis is acute renal failure which may require management with hemodialysis. However, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or other extracorporeal techniques do not remove cicutoxin from the blood and are therefore not useful in enhancing elimination.|$|E
500|$|Taft {{had ordered}} {{government}} officials not {{to comment on}} the fracas. In January 1910, Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Iowa Senator Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service, Taft would have approved a fraudulent claim on public lands. According to Pringle, this [...] "was an utterly improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office". Pinchot was dismissed, much to his delight, and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt. A congressional investigation followed, which cleared Ballinger by majority vote, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney, Louis D. Brandeis, proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated, which Taft belatedly admitted. The Ballinger–Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda.|$|E

Kværner felt that the Public Roads Administration should bear the extra costs, demanding NOK 108 million in compensation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> denied this, resulting in a lawsuit. On 26 January 1996, Nordhordland District Court supported the administration, but gave the plaintiff partial support, claiming the administration should take part of the costs through improper choice of material. The Public Roads Administration was sentenced to pay NOK 34 million to Kværner. Both sides appealed to Gulating Court of Appeal, which on 18 February 1998 refuted all of Kværner's claim regarding the steel boxes, and sentenced the administration to pay NOK 7.5 million. In addition, Kværner had to pay the administration NOK 19.5 million in penalties for overrunning the contract date. However, the court's decision was not unanimous. The plaintiff appealed to case to the Supreme Court, who unanimously confirmed the ruling of Gulating Court of Appeal. In addition, the plaintiff was sentenced to pay the defendants legal costs of NOK 910,000.|$|E
