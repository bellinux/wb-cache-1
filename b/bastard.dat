5|$|Edward William <b>Bastard</b> {{was born}} in Wilton, a parish just outside Taunton, the second son of Henry Horlock <b>Bastard.</b> He was educated at Sherborne School, and played for the school cricket team.

During his time at Sherborne, he also played some games for Dorset.|$|E

5|$|During the university's summer break, <b>Bastard</b> {{made his}} debut for Somerset. His first {{match for the}} county was against the MCC in late July. He {{appeared}} six further times in 1883, against county opposition, and in all matches that season, collected 52 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 30.20. In 1883, he also made his highest first-class score, making 47 runs during Somerset's second innings against Hampshire. He came into bat with the score at 86 runs for the loss of seven wickets, and was the last wicket to fall, by which time Somerset had moved to 181, and <b>Bastard</b> had shared a tenth wicket partnership of 74 with Arnold Fothergill. Even so, Somerset lost the match by seven wickets.|$|E
50|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the <b>Bastards</b> are led by a child genius known as Superior (who {{claims to be the}} son of the Leader). It was also {{revealed that the}} <b>Bastards</b> were actually normal teenagers who were mutated by exposure to radiation by Superior as well as given false memory implants.

5|$|The {{main event}} was the tag team match between John Cena and Batista versus {{the team of}} King Booker and Finlay. Batista {{wrestled}} the match with his left arm taped up due to a previous injury. Both teams wrestlers inconclusively until Cena applied the STFU on Booker. Finlay broke the submission hold, and The Little <b>Bastard</b> ran into the ring. Little <b>Bastard</b> attempted to kick Cena, but accidentally kicked himself in his head when Cena {{moved out of the}} way. Then, Booker tried to superkick Batista, but Batista moved out of the way, and Booker accidentally hit Finlay. Batista then delivered a Batista Bomb and pinned Booker to earn the victory for his team.|$|E

5000|$|It is soon {{revealed}} {{during the}} battle that the other <b>Bastards</b> of Evil members were originally teenagers who were kidnapped by Superior, exposed to various forms of radiation, given personal narrative implants, and false memories of their forgotten childhood as the children of those supervillains. When Araña and Nomad are kidnapped, the <b>Bastards</b> of Evil plot to kill them on national television. When the Young Allies arrived and convinced the <b>Bastards</b> of Evil members to in-fight themselves, Aftershock remembers her true identity of Danielle Blunt and causes her to attack Singularity who remembers his true identity of Devin Touhy. Singularity turns on Superior while the other <b>Bastards</b> of Evil members question their true identities. This gave the Young Allies the opportunity to defeat them after Superior uses his telekinetic abilities to rip Singularity in half. Superior and the remaining <b>Bastards</b> of Evil were incarcerated at the Raft. While in his cell, Superior plans {{to find a way}} to escape incarceration, wipe the memories of the remaining <b>Bastards</b> of Evil, and create [...] "new siblings" [...] to serve him.|$|R

They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics to a lesser degree. Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or <b>bastard</b> metals.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John <b>Bastard</b> was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. <b>Bastard</b> immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Bastards</b> were a {{collaborative}} artists' group including F Scott Hess, John Frame, Steve Galloway, Peter Zokosky, Michael C. McMillen, and Jon Swihart. Swihart remembers {{the origins of}} The Bastards: [...] "The <b>Bastards</b> grew out of this drawing group we have where we get together and draw from the model. We'd hang out afterwards and drink beer and talk. Naturally, we started collaborating on pieces, at first just joking around, but as they became pretty good, we decided to formalize The <b>Bastards.</b> The name refers to the pieces not having any clear parentage. That's also how {{a lot of people}} probably consider us". The <b>Bastards</b> exhibited at Hunsaker/Schlesinger, Santa Monica, CA, in 1997, and Davidson Galleries, Seattle, WA, in 1999 ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bastards</b> reached #28 in Germany {{and also}} charted in Sweden and Japan. The AllMusic review states: [...] "..gloriously {{distorted}} thrashers such as 'On Your Feet or on Your Knees' and 'Death or Glory' set the pace, and 'Born to Raise Hell' is undoubtedly {{one of the}} band's greatest latter-day classics.." [...] Ultimate Classic Rock ranked <b>Bastards</b> as the 4th best Motörhead album, commenting: [...] "..Motörhead’s remarkably efficient response to the all-time career low of March or Die, 1993’s <b>Bastards</b> now stands {{as one of their}} greatest achievements.." ...|$|R
5|$|Somerset's first {{match of}} 1885 {{commenced}} on 16 July 1885, over {{two months after}} Nottinghamshire faced Sussex and Surrey travelled to Hampshire to open the first-class county cricket season in England. Somerset began their season at home against Hampshire, and after losing the toss were asked to field. Somerset's bowlers restricted the visitors to 175runs in the first innings, during which <b>Bastard</b> took a career-best eight wickets in the innings, conceding 54 runs (eight for 54) off his 38four-ball overs. In reply, Somerset fell short of equalling their opponents and were bowled out for 153, Radcliffe top-scoring with 51runs. <b>Bastard</b> collected another three wickets in the second innings, granting him one of two career ten-wicket hauls, and Winter took four as Somerset bowled Hampshire out for 111, leaving themselves needing 134 to win. None of Somerset's top four batsmen reached 20 runs, but an unbeaten 50 from Hewett, accompanied by 32 from the number seven, Farrant Reed, helped Somerset achieve a five-wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|Surrey {{visited the}} County Ground, Taunton {{a few days}} later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their {{previous}} fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. <b>Bastard,</b> who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. <b>Bastard,</b> presumably due to the weakness {{of the rest of the}} county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling to take two for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings: Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again.|$|E
