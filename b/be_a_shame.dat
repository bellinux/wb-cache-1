500|$|As it {{had done}} during the Olympics, Royal Mail honoured Britain's Paralympic gold medallists by {{painting}} a post box gold in each of their home towns (along with an additional post box outside the National Spinal Injuries Centre in Stoke Mandeville, in honour of {{its role in the}} Games' history), and featured them on commemorative stamps released throughout the Games. Royal Mail originally planned only to release a series of six stamps with group portraits of Britain's medallists; however, the decision was met with backlash from critics, who argued that the organization was discriminating against Paralympians by not granting them the same individual recognition as their Olympian counterparts. Olympic shadow minister Tessa Jowell was also critical of Royal Mail's plan, saying that the stamps were a symbolic aspect of Britain's celebration of the Olympics and that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if this important symbol was not offered to our Paralympian heroes as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Uematsu enjoys writing lyrical pieces, but {{tries not}} to be genre-specific. He asserts that expressing the {{emotions}} he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I think it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". The absence of character themes was due to him finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme. The soundtrack features a Latin choral track [...] "Liberi Fatali", which translates to [...] "Fated Children"; its melody forms a musical theme heard in several other pieces in the soundtrack, such as [...] "SeeD" [...] and [...] "The Landing", while the name of [...] "Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec" [...] is the recurring lyrics in [...] "Liberi Fatali".|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{declared the}} gameplay was {{an improvement over}} the original. John Davison of GamePro wrote [...] "BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic." [...] VanOrd praised Mass Effect 2 for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked. He noted that the shooting is [...] "more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter". Similarly, GameSpys Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original Mass Effect [...] "walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] Mass Effect 2 has become a much more focused shooter experience". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it. Despite the praise, some publications like GameCritics and RPGamer expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it [...] "stripped-down" [...] and with a [...] "dumbed-down feeling". Some reviewers also criticized the slow planet scanning. Game Revolution {{felt it was a}} [...] "chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole [...] "does more than enough {{to live up to its}} predecessor". Italian journalist Jaime d'Alessandro of la Repubblica defined Mass Effect 2 as [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "a great sci-fi fresco that would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to miss." ...|$|E

500|$|Regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{wrote the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy VIII. He tried to base the songs {{off of the}} emotional content of when they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I think it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame.</b> When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dann shootings also {{fueled the}} debate about {{criteria}} for committing mentally ill people to mental health facilities against their will.

2500|$|Car and Driver on the L-82 in December 1972, “…when {{it comes}} to making a choice, the L82 is the engine we prefer. Duntov and the other Corvette {{engineers}} gravitate toward the big blocks because they like the torque. And granted, the 454s will squirt through traffic with just a feather touch on the gas pedal. But, to us at least, the small block engine contributes to a fine sense of balance in the Corvette that is rare in any GT car, so rare that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to exchange it for a few lb.-ft. of torque.” ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{practically}} impossible for bitter antagonists {{to arrange a}} time, place, agenda, and procedures that are mutually acceptable, so an outside instigator/promoter is necessary. Successful peace talks were orchestrated by the United States in 1978–79 and by Norway in 1993. If the American government is reluctant to assume such a unilateral responsibility, then an alternative is the International Quartet (United States, Russia, the United Nations, and the European Union)—still with American leadership. An overwhelming majority of citizens of Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, and Palestine want peace, with justice for all {{who live in the}} Holy Land. [...] It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if the world community fails to help them reach this goal.|$|E
2500|$|The album itself {{received}} generally positive reviews by the UK critics, Keith Cameron of the NME {{gave the}} record {{seven out of}} ten in his review. Cameron compared Suede to The Smiths; he wrote, [...] "'Suede' faces the same problems [...] and similarly fails to deliver on a few, admittedly trifling, levels". However, he concluded, [...] "This is the solid, quality, ring-of-confidence debut [...] dreamed the band would produce". Stuart Maconie of Q gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. In his review he drew comparisons to Bowie, Morrissey and Marr. In conclusion he said [...] "Bowie and the Smiths are obvious points of reference. From each, Suede have taken an alien sexual charisma, a peculiarly claustrophobic Englishness and brazenly good tunes. Moreover, rarely has a record from the indie sector come with such a burning sense of its own significance." [...] In Select, Steve Lamacq noted [...] "a feeling {{in the air that}} they haven't fully let themselves go yet", concluding: [...] "As debuts go this isn't exactly Suede in flames: but what a smouldering attempt." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent wrote that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if the eagerness to get the backlash underway stopped their excellent album getting the respect it deserves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Okereke responded {{critically}} to {{comments made}} by Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis in early 2007. Liam called Bloc Party [...] "A band off of University Challenge", while Noel dismissed them as [...] "indie shit". In retaliation, Okereke stated, [...] "I think Oasis are the most overrated and pernicious band of all time. They had a totally negative and dangerous impact upon the state of British music. They have made stupidity hip. They claim to be inspired by The Beatles but, and this saddens me, they have failed to grasp that The Beatles were about constant change and evolution. Oasis are repetitive Luddites." [...] Ironically, when Oasis cancelled their headlining set at the Rock-en-Seine festival near Paris in August 2009 (the concert where the Gallagher brothers clashed backstage, which resulted in Oasis splitting up), it was Okereke who announced to the crowd that Oasis had cancelled their slot during Bloc Party's set, sarcastically declaring the breakup to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame.</b> He dedicated their track [...] "Mercury" [...] to the Oasis fans [...] "who really, really wanted to see those inbred twins," [...] referring to the Gallagher brothers after announcing to the crowd [...] "so I guess by default, we are headlining!" ...|$|E
