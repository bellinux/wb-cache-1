5|$|A more narrow <b>bail-in</b> process {{pertaining}} to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, {{a federal court}} may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if the court determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) {{are not subject to}} preclearance.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the <b>bail-in</b> of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E

40|$|This Policy Brief {{argues that}} some {{important}} considerations are {{missing in the}} current heated debate in the eurozone on bail-outs and <b>bail-ins,</b> the size of liquidity facilities and {{the terms of a}} crisis resolution mechanism. It is organised in three sections, the first of which surveys the diverse outcomes since the launch of the euro. This illustrates how the benefits the euro can generate depend on the degree of openness, flexibility and income correlation among euro area countries: these are economic concepts which over time are affected by policies. The second section reviews the main failings and fault lines that brought about the current sovereign crisis. The third section postulates that to exit the crisis we need to unravel the factors behind each fault line. The author argues that the achievements of EMU are to some extent interlinked with the crisis and stresses the need to explain what EMU can and cannot do and the rationale for its unique governance...|$|R
40|$|We examine if junior debtholders monitor {{banks and}} if such {{monitoring}} constrains risk-taking. Leveraging an unexplored natural {{experiment in the}} U. S. that changes the priority structure of claims on failed banks’ assets, we provide novel insights into the debate on market discipline. We document asymmetric effects for monitoring effort depending on whether a creditor class moves up or down the priority ladder. Conferring priority to all depositors causes declines in deposit interest rates but increases interest rates for non-deposit liabilities, suggesting greater incentives for junior debtholders to exert monitoring effort. Consistent {{with the idea that}} senior claims require lower risk premiums, banks increasingly rely on deposit funding following changes in priority structure. More intensive monitoring also influences conduct: subordinating non-depositor claims reduces risk taking. Our results inform the debate about <b>bail-ins</b> and highlight that changes in the priority structure are a complementary tool to regulation which has received little attention in prior work...|$|R

40|$|Eurozone {{has gone}} through turmoil of {{sovereign}} debt crisis just after the detrimental effect of global financial crises of 2007 / 2008. Sovereign debt crisis of the eurozone was caused by bank-sovereign interdependence and lack of fiscal union in the eurozone. Financial fragmentation in the eurozone financial markets was an immediate outcome. Banking union of the EU is a regulatory and institutional remedy for main financial problems of the eurozone post global financial crisis. It is clear signal that lessons have been learned from the two crises. Stricter regulation (single rule book) aims to increase the quality of banks. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SRM), and Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) aim to unify and better the standards of supervision and resolution in the EU. With emphasis on <b>bail-ins,</b> and EU level backstops, bank-sovereign interdependence should be dismantled and chances of financial crisis reoccurrence with huge costs for taxpayers should be significantly lower. There are important elements of Banking Union that could be introduced in non-eurozone transition countries both members and nonmembers of the EU...|$|R
40|$|I {{will speak}} {{from the point}} of view of a citizen of the South who is looking at that has {{happened}} in the euro area and worries about its future. The North-South divide, or debtors-credits divide, makes the euro area feel like it is 1997. Only Germany feels it qualifies for the Economic Monetary Union (EMU); the others must adjust before they can receive any benefit from monetary union. This implies that some countries are stuck in a fixed exchange rate system with just the minimum benefit from monetary union. We know this doesn't work. A monetary union needs an insurance mechanism. Insurance via <b>bail-ins</b> won’t work. A union of stability can’t be based on defaults. What is the rationale? Mostly short-term German domestic politics, which is the wrong way of designing the future of EMU. This divide feels very similar to the debate on inequality—why is there an obsession with fiscal and monetary austerity? Because, at the margin, it benefits the wealthy. Why did Japan take so long to fight deflation? Because rural voters, overrepresented in the Diet, didn't mind and politicians just wanted to be reelected. It is the same in EMU now. At the margin, all the policy choices benefit a German minority. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Financial Stability Board (FSB) {{published}} in October 2011 a guideline document entitled [...] "Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions" [...] {{which deals with}} the current bailout regime. The scope of this planned <b>bail-in</b> regime for participating countries is not just limited to large domestic banks. In addition to these [...] "systemically significant or critical" [...] financial institutions, the scope also applies to two further categories of institutions, a) Global SIFIs, in other words, cross-border banks which happen to be incorporated domestically {{in a country that}} is implementing the <b>bail-in</b> regime, and b) [...] "Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs)", such as clearing houses. The inclusion of FMIs in potential bail-ins is in itself a major departure. The FSB defines these market infrastructures to include multilateral securities and derivatives clearing and settlement systems, and a whole host of exchange and transaction systems, such as payment systems, central securities depositories, and trade depositories. This would mean that an unsecured creditor claim to, for example, a clearing house institution, or to a stock exchange, could in theory be affected if such an institution needed to be bailed-in. The inclusion of FMIs means that large parts of the global financial system is susceptible to <b>bail-in</b> and could potentially be bailed-in.|$|E

5000|$|The {{difference}} between a bailout and a <b>bail-in</b> was first realised {{by the events of}} the 2012-2013 Cypriot financial crisis. Two Cypriot banks were exposed to a haircut of upwards of 50% in 2011 during the Greek government-debt crisis, leading to fears of a collapse of the Cypriot banks. Rumours circulated for a time, then in early 2013 matters came to a head. On 25 March 2013, a €10 billion bailout was announced by the Troika — a loose coalition of the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund — in return for Cyprus agreeing to close its second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank). The Cypriots had to agree to levy all uninsured deposits there, and possibly around 40% of uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus (the island's largest commercial bank). No insured deposit of €100k or less was to be affected. [...] The levy of deposits that exceeded €100k was termed a [...] "bail-in", to differentiate it from a bailout because of the depositor fund levy. [...] The Bank of Cyprus executed the depositor <b>bail-in</b> on 28 April 2013.|$|E
50|$|In 2015 Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi {{had planned}} to bail-out CariChieti and 3 other banks that were also under A.S., but they were bail-out by Italian National Resolution Fund instead, for a {{recapitalisation}} of €2 billion (€141 million for CariChieti). European Commission ruled that the bail out of Banca Tercas by FITD in 2014 was a state aid, while new Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive of EU required to <b>bail-in</b> some investors of the bank before any state intervention.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{maritime}} {{in origin}} being {{the act of}} removing water from a sinking vessel using a smaller bucket. A bailout differs from the term <b>bail-in</b> (coined in the 2010s) under which the bondholders and/or depositors of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) are forced {{to participate in the}} process, but taxpayers supposedly are not. Some governments have the power to participate in the insolvency process: for instance, the U.S. government intervened in the General Motors bailout of 2009-2013.|$|E
50|$|However, the bail-out of Banca delle Marche, CariChieti, CariFerrara and Banca Etruria by the {{government}} (though utilized the mandatory contribution of all Italian banks), also <b>bail-in</b> of shareholders and subordinated bond holders, had caused public controversy that many bond holders were actually retail investors, making the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive unpopular {{as a tool to}} bail out the bank. A private bail-out fund must be created {{to solve the problem of}} the banking system. In early 2016, FITD added a voluntary scheme in its article of associations, which bail out Banca Tercas by voluntary contribution of the member banks of FITD. (It was followed by Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, a small bank in mid 2016) Even before the introduction of the voluntary scheme, FITD officials had also declared that the fund could not bail out the aforementioned four banks entirely, due to the fund's small size. The resolution fund bailed out the banks by €3.7 billion only were in fact aided by <b>bail-in.</b> A large private equity fund was demanded if large to medium-sized banks of Italy were required to be bailed out. Atlante was aimed at a size of €4-6 billion with a promise that the investment was profitable in order to attract investors in market condition.|$|E
50|$|On 3 May 2016, Decree-Law N°59/2016 was announced, {{which the}} retail investors {{of the bond}} of the 4 banks would be {{refunded}} (up to €100,000, same as deposit insurance) if they purchased the bond on or before 12 June 2014, the date of Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive was passed in the European Parliament. The decree-law {{was a response to}} criticism of the <b>bail-in</b> of all investor of the bank, which Italian bank often sold risky bond to their depositors. The refund scheme: Fondo di solidarietà, would be managed by FITD.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, the bail-out of Banca delle Marche, CariChieti, CariFerrara and Banca Etruria along, {{the four}} small-sized banks (definition of small: total assets between €21.5 billion and €3.6 billion), {{had to write}} down €8.5 billion of bad loans to €1.5 billion (and {{transferred}} to a [...] "bad bank", REV - Gestione Crediti, a company without banking license, in early 2016), causing Italian National Resolution Fund for about €3.7 billion capital injection and recapitalization, {{as well as the}} <b>bail-in</b> of shareholders and subordinate bond investor.
