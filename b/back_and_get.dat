While waiting for their flight, Mitchell realizes {{that he does not}} have his wallet - that includes his ID - with him and he has to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it. Phil offers to drive him back home, something that upsets Claire because Phil leaves her alone while he knows how much nervous she is when they are about to fly. Manny is kept for questioning after his name matches a name on a no-fly list and Haley flirts with a boy while Dylan is trapped inside the Dunphy's house.|$|E
25|$|Ohio State {{appeared}} {{to take control}} of the game right from the opening kickoff, when Rex Kern kept the ball and ran for 25 yards on the first play from scrimmage. Jim Otis would carry the next three plays for another first down. The Buckeyes got the ball to the Michigan 11, when the Wolverine defense ended the drive on a fourth down-and-two to take over. Michigan failed to get a first down, and the Buckeyes would get the ball <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> on the scoreboard first, on a 1-yard touchdown run by Otis. A missed extra-point left the score 6–0 in favor of the scarlet-and-gray.|$|E

Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do.

500|$|When Reba McEntire {{made her}} Grand Ole Opry debut on September 17, 1977, she almost {{did not make}} it in the door after a guard at the Opry gate missed her name on the night's list of performers. Her parents and older sister, Alice, drove 1,400 miles round trip from their Oklahoma home to see {{what turned out to be}} Reba's three-minute {{performance}} that night. Her act was cut from two songs to just one—"Invitation to the Blues"—because of a surprise appearance from Dolly Parton. McEntire was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on January 17, 1986. [...] "The Grand Ole Opry is a home," [...] she says. [...] "It's a family. It's like a family reunion, when you come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> to see everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|North Korean anti {{aircraft}} fire struck Sebille's P-51 as {{he turned}} to make a second run, heavily damaging the aircraft and it began trailing smoke and glycol coolant. Sebille had intended to release his second bomb, but he radioed Johnson that he had been hit and injured, probably fatally. Johnson radioed back Sebille should try to head for a US emergency landing strip in Taegu a short distance away, but Sebille responded with his last known words, [...] "No, I'll never make it. I'm going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> that bastard (sic)". He dove straight toward the APC that was his target. He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular , he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns. His plane sustained even heavier damage, and he crashed into the North Korean convoy destroying a large contingent of North Korean ground troops and vehicles though being killed instantly himself.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the usual}} pattern of {{alternating}} sea duty with service ashore, Burroughs's next assignment was the aviation {{desk at the}} Bureau of Ordnance in Washington, D.C., in March 1943. Halsey was supportive of this, telling him to [...] "Go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> things straightened out back there! Try to get those guys off the dime!" [...] He proposed that a special Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) be established specifically devoted {{to the development of}} aircraft weapons, which he had long felt had been neglected by the Navy in favor of shipboard weapons, and he nominated himself, as a naval aviator with postgraduate ordnance education, to command it. NOTS was authorised by the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, [...] and in December 1943, Burroughs assumed command of the new station in the Mojave Desert.|$|E

2500|$|Roy Wilkins {{announced}} that W. E. B. Du Bois {{had died in}} Ghana the previous night; the crowd observed {{a moment of silence}} in his memory. Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois as a Communist—but then insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he didn't. Wilkins said: [...] "Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century his was the voice that was calling you to gather here today in this cause. If you want to read something that applies to 1963 go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a volume of The Souls of Black Folk by Du Bois, published in 1903." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Ryan set {{his first}} major record when he struck out 383 batters in one season, beating Sandy Koufax's old mark by one. Remarking on this feat, Koufax joked, [...] "Yeah, and he also surpassed my total for bases on balls in a single season by 91. I suspect half of those guys he struck out swung rather than get hit." [...] Ryan threw two no-hitters in 1973. In the second one, on July 15 against the Detroit Tigers, he struck out 17 batters – most in a {{recorded}} no-hitter. (This record would later be tied by Max Scherzer on October 3, 2015.) Ryan was so dominant in this game, it led to one of baseball's best-remembered pranks. Tigers first baseman and cleanup hitter Norm Cash came to the plate with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, having already struck out twice, and was carrying a clubhouse table leg instead of a bat. [...] Plate umpire Ron Luciano ordered Cash to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a regulation bat, to which Cash replied, [...] "Why, I won't hit him anyway!" [...] With a regulation bat in hand, Cash did finally make contact, but popped out to end the game.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 2015, Haye {{and his new}} {{promotion}} and management team, Salter Brothers Entertainment, announced his comeback fight against WBA #10 ranked heavyweight Mark de Mori. The fight took place on 16 January 2016 (marketed by Salter Brothers Entertainment as [...] "Haye Day") at the O2 Arena in London, and was Haye's first fight {{in more than three}} years since stopping Dereck Chisora in 2012. Coming into the fight, Australian De Mori had lost only once in 33 career bouts and 26 of his 29 victories had come via knockout, albeit against limited opposition. It was announced on 6 January 2016 that Haye and the Salter Brothers had struck a deal for the comeback fight to be shown on free-to-air entertainment channel Dave, the largest non-PSB broadcaster in the UK and the channel's first ever live sport broadcast. Haye commented on the broadcast deal, stating: [...] "I'm looking forward to putting on a great show for the fans on 'Haye Day' at The O2 on January 16 and I'm delighted that my first fight in three-and-a-half years is going to be available free to air on Dave, giving {{as many people as possible}} the chance to watch my comeback. I was determined to make this comeback fight free to everybody and fans should sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> ready for another fun-fuelled ride as I look to regain the heavyweight championship of the world." [...] In a world's first, Salter Brothers Entertainment also partnered with YouTube to live-stream the event outside of the UK to a global audience for free.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his regular}} season debut, Luck threw his first career {{interception}} to Chicago Bears cornerback Tim Jennings. He would later throw his first career {{touchdown pass to}} Donnie Avery. Ultimately, Luck completed 23 of 45 passes for 309 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions, as the Colts lost 41–21. The next week against the Minnesota Vikings, Luck threw for 224 {{yards and two touchdowns}} with no interceptions. Additionally, Luck got his first career win in the NFL and did this by completing his first game-winning drive of his professional career. Before a week 5 showdown with the Green Bay Packers and reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano was diagnosed with leukemia and had to take a leave of absence. Rallying the team for their coach (a movement that become known as [...] "CHUCKSTRONG") Luck completed his second career game-winning drive by throwing a touchdown to Reggie Wayne with 35 seconds left to pull off the stunning upset. Luck's then career-best 362-yard passing effort set a new rookie QB mark in Colts franchise history. The 18-point comeback also was the best by a rookie quarterback since Matthew Stafford, the first pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, led a 21-point rally for the Lions vs. the Browns in 2009. Luck completed 31 of 55 for 362 yards and three total touchdowns (2 passing, 1 rushing). Luck won his first career road and overtime game during a week 8 game against the division rival Tennessee Titans. A touchdown pass to running back Vick Ballard on the first drive of overtime gave the Colts a 19–13 victory. In a week 9 win against the Miami Dolphins, Luck threw for 433 yards, a new record for most yards in a game by a rookie QB (surpassing Cam Newton's 432 against the Green Bay Packers in 2011). Luck later sent his jersey from the Dolphins game to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Through Week 9, Luck had thrown for the same number of yards as his predecessor, Peyton Manning. In Week 13 against the Detroit Lions, Luck and the Colts were trailing 33–21 with 2:39 left. After throwing a touchdown to fellow rookie LaVon Brazill, Luck and the Colts were able to get the ball <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> to the Lions' 14-yard line, facing a 4th down with [...] :04 left. Luck then threw a screen pass to Donnie Avery who got free and ran in for the winning score, marking a big moment in Luck's early career. The win gave Luck his eighth on the season – the most wins by a rookie quarterback drafted first overall in NFL history, as well as his fifth game-winning drive on the season, tying Vince Young and Ben Roethlisberger for the most by a rookie quarterback. On December 23, 2012, Luck broke the record for most passing yards in a season by a rookie against the Kansas City Chiefs, throwing 205 to bring his season total to 4,183. Cam Newton held the previous record with 4,051 yards.|$|E

60|$|William the Quaker, whose curiosity {{led him to}} go {{among the}} rest, {{proposed}} that they should make a ladder, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> upon the top, and then throw wild-fire into the tree, and smoke them out.

50|$|A fly route, {{also called}} a streak route or go route, {{is a pattern}} run by a {{receiver}} in American football, where the receiver runs straight upfield towards the endzone. The goal of the pattern is to outrun any defensive <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> behind them, catching an undefended pass while running untouched for a touchdown. Generally, the fastest receiver on the team or any receiver faster than the man covering him {{would be the one}} to run these routes. When run down the sidelines, a fly can be called a fade route.|$|R
