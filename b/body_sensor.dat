5000|$|A body {{area network}} (BAN), also {{referred}} to as a wireless body area network (WBAN) or a <b>body</b> <b>sensor</b> network (BSN), is a wireless network of wearable computing devices. [...] BAN devices may be embedded inside the body, implants, may be surface-mounted on the body in a fixed position Wearable technology or may be accompanied devices which humans can carry in different positions, in clothes pockets, by hand or in various bags.Whilst there is a trend towards the miniaturization of devices, in particular, networks consisting of several miniaturized <b>body</b> <b>sensor</b> units (BSUs) together with a single body central unit (BCU). Larger decimeter (tab and pad) sized smart devices, accompanied devices, still {{play an important role in}} terms of acting as a data hub, data gateway and providing a user interface to view and manage BAN applications, in-situ. The development of WBAN technology started around 1995 around the idea of using wireless personal area network (WPAN) technologies to implement communications on, near, and around the human body. About six years later, the term [...] "BAN" [...] came to refer systems where communication is entirely within, on, and in the immediate proximity of a human body. A WBAN system can use WPAN wireless technologies as gateways to reach longer ranges. Through gateway devices, it is possible to connect the wearable devices on the human body to the internet. This way, medical professionals can access patient data online using the internet independent of the patient location.|$|E

This facilitates independent energy-aware radio activation policies, so that <b>body</b> <b>sensors</b> can calculate the time they can remain in power-sleep modus (see [22]). Further, the MCS field is also thought for future multirate medical applications in BSNs (i.e., scalability in terms of application-oriented medical <b>body</b> <b>sensors).</b>|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{improvement}} of wireless communication and semiconductor technologies, the <b>body</b> area <b>sensor</b> network (BASN) is fast developing. The BASN {{which is also}} referred to as the WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network), is widely used in medical applications and comprises of <b>Body</b> <b>Sensors</b> attached to human <b>body.</b> These <b>body</b> <b>sensors</b> will help to monitor the interior functions of the body.

These days <b>body</b> <b>sensors</b> are emerging as wearable computers such as Computer clothing, Google glass, Smart watches etc which paves the way for using it in many more real time applications.

40|$|International audienceAt present, several {{solutions}} {{are available for}} monitoring patient health using <b>body</b> <b>sensors.</b> In hospitals, healthcare wireless sensor networks (HWSNs) offer support to access these sensors to allow for continuous patient monitoring. To improve the quality-of-life of the hospitalized patients, {{it is important to}} let them walk around the monitored area. This ability brings several challenges to HWSNs with mobility support. Because of the crucial importance of the sensed parameters, the HWSNs must be in continuous communication with the <b>body</b> <b>sensors.</b> The connection between <b>body</b> <b>sensors</b> and a HWSN is performed through an access point. Indoor communications are limited in terms of signal propagation and, therefore, several access points to cover large areas are deployed. To maintain the sensors' accessibility, these should frequently change their point of attachment by performing a mechanism known as a handover. Handover mechanisms are able to support the intra-mobility of sensors in networks within the same domain. This paper surveys the most recent intra-mobility solutions with special focus on handover approaches {{that can be used in}} HWSNs. An in depth review of the related literature is performed in order to present the state of the art on this paper, to discuss the available solutions, and to point out open issues for further research...|$|R
