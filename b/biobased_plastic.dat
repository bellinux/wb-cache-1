40|$|International audienceDue to {{depletion}} of fossil resources and global environmental respect awareness, interest in <b>biobased</b> <b>plastic</b> materials is tremendously growing. Direct extraction of vegetal polymers like cellulose {{followed by a}} chemical modification to bring new properties {{is one of the}} paths to produce a bioplastic. Progressively replaced by oil-based polymers in the sixties, thermoplastic cellulose esters are now reconsidered for various materials applications. To improve mechanical weaknesses of cellulose esters based materials, the technique of blending has been widely used. Various blending candidates of cellulose esters have been studied, but mostly with the goal to make the material biodegradable. For this purpose Polyestercarbonates, Polylactides and Polyhydroxyalcanoates were used. To our knowledge, small interest has been paid on durable cellulose ester based blends. More particularly, only few studies have considered the good mechanical properties of cost-effective and easy-available polyolefins as blending partners of cellulose esters...|$|E
30|$|An {{estimation}} {{procedure for}} biobased carbon content of polyethylene composite was studied using carbon- 14 (14 C) concentration ratios {{as measured by}} accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS). Prior to the measurement, additives and fillers in composites should be removed because they often contain {{a large amount of}} biobased carbon and may shift the estimation. Samples of resin with purity suitable for measurement were isolated from composites with a Soxhlet extractor using heated cyclohexanone. After cooling of extraction solutions, the resin was recovered as a fine semi-crystalline precipitate, which was easily filtered. Recovery rates were almost identical (99 %), even for low-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene, which may have lower crystallinity. This procedure could provide a suitable approach for estimation of biobased carbon content by AMS {{on the basis of the}} standard ASTM D 6866. The biobased carbon content for resin extracted from polyethylene composites allow for the calculation of biosynthetic polymer content, which is an indicator of mass percentage of the <b>biobased</b> <b>plastic</b> resin in the composite.|$|E

40|$|With {{a steady}} {{annual growth rate}} of 8. 7 % from 1950 to 2012, finding a class of {{materials}} that is as successful as plastics will be very hard. Today, petroleum-based plastics, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyamide (PA) are used {{in more and more}} applications and they have become an essential part of our modern lifestyle. Packaging, particularly food packaging, covers a big part of this plastics industry and trends like convenience and portioning have led to an increased use of raw materials, which is currently mainly crude oil. Environmental (consumer awareness, CO 2 -emissions) and economic reasons (dependence of oil industry) has triggered the interest of the food and packaging industry towards packaging materials made from renewable resources. Furthermore, increasing research and development in the field of these novel plastics leads to more and more applications and emerging new materials (Lagarón & Lopez-Rubio, 2011, OECD, 2013, Philp, 2014, Plastics Europe, 2013). Although the interest in <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics</b> is growing, a lot of stakeholders in the Flemish food industry are doubtful regarding the introduction of <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics.</b> This can mainly be attributed to the lack of knowledge regarding these new materials and their possibilities. Therefore, the aim of this research was to increase the knowledge of the different stakeholders within the food industry concerning <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics</b> by trying to close the gap between the academic world, where a lot of research in the field of <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics</b> is performed and the food/packaging industry to whom this research could be of great value...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wood plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) {{in general}} combine wood residuals with thermoplastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The basic idea {{in this work}} is to replace these olefin plastic matrixes in WPCs with a so-called <b>biobased</b> <b>plastic,</b> namely poly(lactic acid) (PLA). To reduce the water sensitivity of such biocomposites, for typical outdoor use, the idea is also to incorporate a modified wood component. The aim of this work was to study the microstructure of injection moulded WPCs based on PLA and modified wood, and to investigate some of their micromechanical behaviour. Four different PLA/wood formulations (weight-% ratio 50 / 50) were studied: PLA combined with 1) unmodified MDF fibres, 2) acetylated MDF fibers: 3) acetylated wood particles: and 4) thermally modified wood particles. The processing effects on the form {{and shape of the}} wood component were studied by a matrix extraction procedure combined with light microscopy. The microstructure of the WPCs were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a sample preparation technique based on UV laser ablation, i. e. a surface preparation procedure allowing microscopic observations without microtoming. Microtensile testing was performed on samples prepared from the core and skin layers of the WPC samples. It was observed that the processing of the WPCs resulted in severe damage and fragmentation of the wood fibres and particles. Especially, the processing with a thermally modified wood component yielded a lot of wood cell wall fragments/fines. Good dispersion of the wood reinforcements in the PLA matrix was observed in all cases, even though the distribution and orientation of the fibres varied between different regions in the samples. No principal fibre orientation was outlined in the core, while closer to the surface regions the fibres tend to orient in the flow direction. Supposedly a turbulence effect {{at the end of the}} moulded samples also induced disorientation of the fibres. Long and slender shape, i. e. a higher aspect ratio, of the wood components were as expected found to be more efficient as a reinforcement than particulate shaped ones. The composites with acetylated MDF fibers were also observed to be weaker than composites with unmodified ones. On the other hand, SEM observations of fracture surfaces exhibited better reinforcement-matrix interaction for the modified wood than for the unmodified wood. Although the fracture surfaces observations outlined the importance of fibre orientation, with a more brittle type of failure in the core and fibre breakage or debonding closer to the surface, there was no significant difference found between mechanical properties for the core and skin layer specimens. Other factors have therefore to be investigated in order to explain the rather uniform strength measurements within different regions in the composites. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Petroleum-based {{plastics}} {{possess a}} high durability and usually are low-cost materials. However, reducing our carbon footprint {{is becoming more}} important every day, so these plastics probably {{have to be replaced}} by a more sustainable alternative such as polymers based on renewable bio-resources. At present, different biobased plastics (or biobased polymers) are slowly finding their way towards the commodity plastic market. The biodegradability of some biobased plastics is an advantage when they are disposed in the environment and it also facilitates efficient recycling. Polylactic acid (PLA), being a thermoplastic biodegradable biobased polymer, can serve in many classic polymer applications. Although PLA is an eco-friendly <b>biobased</b> <b>plastic</b> with excellent biocompatibility, overall processability, and low energy consumption during production, it has drawbacks as well, which currently limits its use in certain applications. The main limitation of PLA that was addressed in this work is the low crystallization rate. Conventional polymer processing methods operate at very high cooling rates. Therefore, processing a plastic with a low crystallization rate would lead to poorly crystalline or fully amorphous materials. The low level of crystallinity in these materials leads to a low quality and inconsistent polymer products. PLA’s slow crystallizing nature therefore restricts fast and/or mass manufacturing of PLA based products. Enhancing the PLA crystallinity and crystallization rate could boost the possibilities of use significantly and concomitantly would do good to the material properties such as stiffness, strength, heat deflection temperature and chemical resistance. Efficient routes to enhance the crystallization kinetics of PLA include the increase of nucleation density by adding a heterogeneous nucleating agent and the increase of chain mobility by addition of plasticizers. When using a biodegradable nucleating agent in combination with a biodegradable biopolymer, the resulting product could be completely biodegradable. In the presented research the attention was directed to increasing the nucleation density by the addition of crystallizable, bio-based, biodegradable molecules such as polypeptides. From the perspective of mutual compatibility, as determined by molecular simulations, the nucleating ability of some polypeptides appeared to be promising. Ultimately, polyalanine was selected as the best candidate to experimentally evaluate its nucleating efficiency in a PLA matrix. Polyalanine was synthesized and characterized. It was found that polyalanine has a very high thermal stability. After synthesis, polyalanine mainly adopts an α-helical conformation which, in absence of any solvent, converts into β-sheet structures at temperatures higher than 210 °C. An α-helical to β-sheet crystal transition at these temperatures was not reported before. The resulting β‑sheet crystals degraded at much higher temperatures without showing a prior melting transition. Polyalanine fibers were produced and characterized to evaluate whether polyalanine exhibited any nucleating abilities for a PLA matrix. The fibers were added to a PLLA matrix and from POM measurements it was clear that they acted as nucleating agents. Further, polyalanine was also dispersed more finely in the PLA matrix. via two different techniques: solvent blending and melt blending. In the case of solvent blended samples, it was suggested that polyalanine is an efficient nucleating agent but that at high concentrations it may also impede the PLA crystal growth. For the melt blended samples, polyalanine effectively acted as a nucleating agent as well and, in contrast to the solvent blended samples, higher concentrations of polyalanine seemed to be more effective. By adding polyalanine to the PLA matrix, the PLA crystallization was sped up significantly and the PLA crystallinity almost doubled. Increasing the crystallinity and mainly increasing the crystallization rate is an important step in the future development of PLA based products. In industry the increased crystallization rate means an important time gain in industrial plastic article manufacturing processes which employ high cooling rates. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) is {{a well-established}} method {{to evaluate the}} potential environmental impacts of product and service systems throughout their life cycles. However, it can happen that LCAs for the same product have different and even conflicting outcomes. LCA results need to be robust and trustworthy if they are used in decision making. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate whether {{the use of multiple}} data sets and multiple modelling options can increase the robustness of LCA results. The research starts with identifying reasons for differences in LCA results for the same product. The results of ten existing LCAs for disposable beverage cups are compared to each other as to examine the consistency and robustness of these results. The comparison of the LCAs shows no consistent best or worst cup material. And, the quantitative results for cups made from the same material vary across the LCAs. The evaluation of the methodological choices and the used data sources in each LCA made it possible to identify possible sources for discrepancies in the LCA results. Reasons for differences in results include the variation in the properties of the cups, production processes, waste treatment options, allocation options, choices in system boundaries, impact indicators, and potentially also the data sets that are used. The thesis next describes a novel method to evaluate and include the influence of data sets and modelling choices on the LCA results. The method is applied in a case study of a disposable polystyrene (PS) beverage cup. The study purposely uses different data sets from various sources for processes with an influential contribution to the LCA results. The study includes two waste treatment options (incineration and recycling). The multiple data sets represent the variability among processes, and the waste treatments represent choices in the modelling of the life cycle of the PS cup. This variability among the data sets for a similar process is presented as a spread in the results. This spread in the results for the PS cup is caused by differences in the amount and type of the used resources and energy, reported emissions, the origin of the production location, the time period of data collection, or choices in the value of recycled PS. The overlapping spread in the quantitative results for incineration and recycling prevents a decisive conclusion on the preferred waste treatment option for the PS cups. Next, the method for the use of multiple data sets and modelling choices is applied in a comparative LCA of disposable beverage cups. Three cups are compared: a PS cup, a polylactic acid cup (PLA, a <b>biobased</b> <b>plastic),</b> and a cup made from biopaper (paper with a lining of biobased-plastic). The waste treatment options consist of incineration and recycling for all three cups, and additionally composting and anaerobic digestion for the PLA and biopaper cup. The use of multiple data sets and modelling choices leads to a considerable spread in the LCA results of the cups. The results do not point to the most environmentally friendly cup material, and neither to a preferred waste treatment option. The results clearly identify composting, however, as the least preferred waste treatment option for the PLA and biopaper cups. The spread in the results makes the comparison of the results for the cups more complex, but the results provides more robust information for decision makers. The combined inclusion of the variability among data sets and the waste treatment options makes the results more trustworthy. The thesis then dives deeper into the methodological modelling of recycling in LCA and describes and evaluates six widely used recycling modelling methods: three substitution methods, an allocation method, the recycled-content method, and the equal-share method. The main difference among the six methods lies in the assumption on where and how to apply credits for recycled material in the life cycle of the product. These six methods are applied in two case studies: a disposable PS beverage cup and an aluminium beverage can. The results for the aluminium can clearly depend on the applied recycling modelling method, the recycling rate of the disposed cans, and the amount of recycled material used in the cans. The results for the PS cup additionally depend on the consideration of a drop in the quality of the recycled PS compared to the original PS, and the other waste treatments (landfilling and incineration) for the cups. Including several recycling modelling methods in the LCA incorporates the various underlying modelling philosophies of the methods, and thus makes the results more robust. This thesis demonstrates the added value of including multiple data sets and multiple modelling choices in LCA. The use of multiple data sets is especially useful if general processes instead of specific processes are used in the representation of the product system. The use of multiple data sets increases the accuracy of the results, and is a supplemental tool next to statistical methods which increase the precision of the results. The simultaneous handling of variability among data sets and modelling choices is hardly performed in LCA. The method presented in this thesis fills this gap and provides a transparent tool to capture these uncertainties. The trade-off between an increase in the robustness of the results and the additional demand for resources (time, money, effort) should be assessed, and depends on the goal of the study and on the intended use of the results. This thesis shows that inclusion of the uncertainty in the LCA results provides the decision maker with valuable information. This thesis thus provides a useful method to increase the robustness of LCA results.  ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) resins with linear (L-PLA) and {{branched}} structure (B-PLA) were selected, and {{the solid}} state foaming technology {{was applied to}} prepare PLA foams. B-PLA foams exhibited a high expansion ratio of about 40 and cell density of 105 − 6 cells/cm 3, whereas L-PLA foams only had the highest expansion ratio of 29. 8 and cell density of 103 − 6 cells/cm 3. When PLA resins were induced crystallization during CO 2 saturation, however, the prepared L-PLA foams presented the highest expansion ratio of 37. 4 and cell density of 106 − 7 cells/cm 3. The cell structure evolution of PLA foams with the foaming time suggested that the in situ formed crystal domains supplied nucleating sites to enhance cell nucleation and acted as physical cross-linking points to stabilize cell structure. These interesting results demonstrated that the induced crystallization might be more attractive than the chain modification to improve the foaming behavior using solid state foaming technology.

40|$|This paper aims to {{incorporate}} sustainability assessment into the material selection processes during early-stage product (re) design, when time and data availability for such assessments are usually limited. A material selection framework is presented and illustrated step-by-step {{with a case}} study aiming to identify biobased alternatives for petrochemical plastics used for (flame retardant) panels. After an initial screening step, the technical performance of selected materials is measured. A cradle-to-grave screening life cycle assessment compares the environmental performance of the candidate and reference materials on greenhouse gas emissions, non-renewable energy use and agricultural land use per kilogram. A simplified cost analysis is performed. The environmental and economic indicators are corrected for each candidate's technical performance by estimating expected weight changes in the final product based on material indices.

The prepared samples were subjected to molecular, thermal, diffractometric and mechanical characterization. The barrier performances to O 2, CO 2 and N 2 gases were also evaluated, envisioning for these new materials an application in food packaging. The presence of the side alkyl groups did not alter the thermal stability, whereas it significantly reduced the sample crystallinity degree, making these materials more flexible.

40|$|Lactic acid, an attractive, {{renewable}} chemical {{for production}} of <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics</b> (polylactic acid, PLA), is currently commercially produced from food-based sources of sugar. Pure optical isomers of lactate needed for PLA are typically produced by microbial fermentation of sugars at temperatures below 40 [*]°C. Bacillus coagulans produces L(+) -lactate {{as a primary}} fermentation product and grows optimally at 50 [*]°C and pH  5, conditions that are optimal for activity of commercial fungal cellulases. This strain was engineered to produce D(−) -lactate by deleting the native ldh (L-lactate dehydrogenase) and alsS (acetolactate synthase) genes to impede anaerobic growth, followed by growth-based selection to isolate suppressor mutants that restored growth. One of these, strain QZ 19, produced about 90  g L- 1 of optically pure D(−) -lactic acid from glucose in <  48  h. The new source of D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) activity {{was identified as a}} mutated form of glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH; D 121 N and F 245 S) that was produced at high levels {{as a result of a}} third mutation (insertion sequence).

40|$|Plastics are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} fabrication of daily objects. Due to limited oil reserves, more and more research is performed towards <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics.</b> Wheat gluten {{is one of the}} raw materials deserving special attention in this respect. Many different gluten based materials have been developed in the last years, ranging from rubberlike to very brittle materials. In order to expand the product possibilities, different processing routes have also been explored. In this thesis, the focus is on spinning with the aim of producing gluten based fibers. To produce these fibers, a wet spinline was built. To test and validate this spinline, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used. The rheological behavior of aqueous PVA solutions with different degree of hydrolysis, molecular weight and concentration was determined and correlated with their spinnability. It was concluded the spinnability of PVA solutions is highly dependent on the degree of hydrolysis of the used PVA. To investigate the spinnability of aqueous solutions of reduced gliadin containing urea, the rheological characteristics have been determined, while varying the ureum and gliadin concentration. Aqueous urea solution exhibit a time dependent rheology, which can be changed by applying different levels of shear. In a last step, composites based on flax fibers and a gluten matrix were produced. In the production of the prepregs, a solvent was used to extract the gluten proteins. This solvent composition was optimized for extractability and mechanical properties of the resulting composite. Adding a reducing agent greatly improved the extractability of wheat gluten proteins. The expensive dithiothreitol has more effect than the cheap, but less efficient sodium sulfite. In longitudinal direction the mechanical properties of the resulting composite remain the same, whereas they get better in the transverse direction. The extractability can also be increased by adding a base. The mechanical properties in transverse direction decreased dramatically, possibly due to too severe processing conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|An {{energy and}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) balance study {{was performed on}} the production of the bioplastic polyethylene furandicarboxylate (PEF) starting from corn based fructose. The goal {{of the study was to}} analyze and to translate experimental data on the catalytic dehydration of fructose to a simulation model, using the ASPEN Plus modeling software. The mass and energy balances of the simulation model results were then used as inputs for a process chain analysis (by application of the life cycle assessment methodology, LCA) and compared to its petrochemical counterpart polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The production of PEF can be divided into three main units: the production of fructose from corn starch; the conversion of fructose into Furanics and subsequent recovery and upgrading; and the oxidation to the monomer 2, 5 -furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and polymerization with ethylene glycol (EG) into PEF. The ASPEN Plus simulation model describes the conversion of fructose into Furanics, subsequent recovery and upgrading and a CHP unit. The production of fructose from corn starch and the oxidation and polymerization into PEF were based on the literature. In total, six model cases were analyzed, using different sets of underlying experimental data; four cases based on crystalline fructose and two cases on high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Fructose can be converted into Furanics at efficiencies between 38 % and 47 %. The production of PEF can reduce the NREU approximately 40 % to 50 % while GHG emissions can be reduced approximately 45 % to 55 %, compared to PET for the system cradle to grave. These reductions are higher than for other <b>biobased</b> <b>plastics,</b> such as polylactic acid (PLA) or polyethylene (PE). With an annual market size of approximately 15 million metric tonnes (Mt) of PET bottles produced worldwide, the complete bottle substitution of PEF for PET would allow us to save between 440 and 520 PJ of non-renewable energy use (NREU) and to reduce GHG emissions by 20 to 35 Mt of CO 2 equivalents. If also substantial substitution takes place in the PET fibres and film industry, the savings increase accordingly. The GHG emissions could be further reduced by a switch to lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as straw, but this requires additional research...|$|R
40|$|The {{plastics}} {{industry is}} increasingly oriented towards {{the use of}} polymers from natural origin (<b>biobased)</b> replacing <b>plastics</b> derived from petrol chemistry (fossil-based). Recently, some aliphatic polyamides were revalued by industries for packaging and for long-term applications but still low investigated. Moreover, nanoclays have been proven to improve mechanical and barrier performance of fossil based PAs. On the other hand, these superior properties of PA nanocomposites usually have as a "side effect" the increase of the brittleness by suppressing plastic deformation at the crack tip, which greatly limits the application of these materials. In this study two kinds of bio-polyamides were investigated: PA 10. 10 and PA 6. 10. As filler a natural montmorillonite modified with methyl hydrogenated tallow bis- 2 -hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium (Cloisite® 30 B-Cl 30 B) was used. PAs were melt blended with clay using a co-rotating twin screw extruder LEISTRITZ ZSE 18 / 40 D. Neat polymers were also processed {{to have the same}} thermal history. Pellets obtained by the first extrusion were dried before the film extrusion. A single screw extruder (Eurotech Extrusion Machinery S. r. l.) (L= 80 cm D= 25 mm) equipped with a flat die was used. Samples for mechanical characterization were die cut and tested with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using a Zwick 10 universal testing machine. Specimens for EWF were prepared according to the ESIS protocol and conditioned at 33 % of R. H. and room temperature. Before testing, a fresh razor blade was carefully tapped into ligament of specimen to introduce two aligned sharp pre-cracks. The free ligament length (l) was left in the range from 5 to 22 mm. The specific work of fracture (wf) was obtained by dividing the integrated area of the load-elongation curve with the initial ligament area. The essential work of fracture (we) and the plastic term (β*wp) are easily obtained from the best linear regression of a set of values represented in a graph plotting wf versus l (Figure 1 a). An estimation of the shape and dimensions of the necked zone surrounding the fractured ligament was done in order to derive the wp value (Figure 1 b). Clay did not significantly affect the work required for the onset of crack propagation (we) in PA 6. 10 while decrease in PA 10. 10. The plastic work (β*wp) of both PA was increased with clay. The individual nanoparticles act as stress concentration points, which promoted cavitations and thus induced relatively large local deformation.

40|$|Until now, petrochemical-based {{plastics}} {{have been}} extensively used as packaging materials {{thanks to their}} low cost and excellent physic-mechanical properties. Unfortunately, as it is well-known, these materials are not readily degraded in the environments where they are disposed once their function has ended. As a consequence, {{thousands of tons of}} plastic packaging are disposed in landfills every year, causing a continuous pollution increment. In this view, replacing non-degradable plastics based on fossil oil with sustainable bio-based, biodegradable materials for short time applications is of great environmental importance. Among <b>biobased</b> and biodegradable <b>plastic</b> packaging materials, one of the most economically competitive polymer class is represented by aliphatic polyesters, that have attracted considerable attention in last decades as they combine the afore mentioned features with interesting physical and chemical properties. In this framework, the present research work focused on the modification of some interesting aliphatic polyesters, in order to prepare new materials, which guarantee full compostability and offer suitable characteristics, especially in terms of mechanical and barrier properties to be used in food packaging applications. Simple, ecofriendly, cost-effective synthetic strategies have been employed to obtain the designed materials. All the synthesized polymers have been deeply characterized by the molecular, thermal and mechanical point of view. Moreover, their barrier properties have been studied to prove their suitability for packaging applications. Lastly, lab-scale composting experiments have been carried out, in order to check their potential compostability. Solid-state properties and biodegradation rate can be tailored acting on chemical structure, copolymer composition and polymer architecture: in particular, the introduction of different amounts of ether- or thio-ether linkages or short ramifications along macromolecular backbone of parent homopolymer, or simply acting on soft/hard ratio in block structures permitted to modulate mechanical behaviour and biodegradation rate of the parent homopolymer itself, without compromising the good properties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{integrates}} two complementary {{life cycle}} assessment (LCA) studies with the aim to advice facility managers on the sustainable use of cups, either disposable or reusable. Study 1 compares three disposable cups, i. e., made from fossil-based polystyrene (PS), <b>biobased</b> and compostable <b>plastic</b> (polylactic acid; PLA) and paper lined with PLA (biopaper). Study 2 compares the disposable PS cup with reusable cups that are handwashed or dishwashed. Methods: Existing LCA studies show inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results, {{due to differences in}} used data and modeling choices. The comparison of disposable cups, study 1, deliberately applied multiple inventory data sets for relevant life cycle processes and multiple crediting principles for recycling. Included waste treatment options in study 1 were incineration, recycling, composting, and anaerobic digestion (last two not for the disposable PS cup). The PS cup is next compared with handwashed and dishwashed reusable cups (study 2). LCAs for the reusable cups use single data sets, and explore the influence of an increasing number of reuses. Cup LCA results were only compared within, and not across impact categories. All data relate to cups used with hot beverage vending machines in Dutch office settings. Results and discussion: Impact results for each disposable cup show large and overlapping spreads. This prevents identifying a preferable disposable cup material, though still allows cautious preferences about waste treatment processes. Composting biocups is less good than other waste treatment processes. Average impact results for anaerobic digestion perform in almost all impact categories better than incineration for the PLA cup. Average impact results for recycling perform slightly better than incinerating for both biocups, but not for the PS cup. This comparison is affected, however, by the relatively large credits for avoided Dutch electricity production. Impact results for reusable cups do not perform better than disposable cups if both are used once. Impact results for the reusable cups contain large uncertainty due to widely varying user behavior. Conclusions: Overall results do not allow any preference for one of the disposable cups or for disposable versus reusable cups. All cups can be used for more than one consumption. This gives a considerable environmental gain for the second and third hot beverage consumption with all cups. Facility managers can encourage a second or third serving with the same cup by financial incentives, only putting on dishwashers around noon and after working time, and/or consumer awareness activities. </p...|$|R
30|$|Therefore {{researchers}} have been searching for new, alternative materials {{which can be used}} as good substitutes for conventional plastics (Emadian et al. 2016). One of them is production of <b>biobased</b> and biodegradable <b>plastics</b> [BP]. Nowadays, bioplastics constitute about one per cent of the about 300 million tons of plastic produced annually. Production of bioplastics in 2014 reached approximately 2 million tons globally; moreover, it is predicted that in 2019 production will reach almost 8 million tons (Bioplastics 2015). Generally, BP can be divided in two groups, renewable resource-based polymers and petroleum-based polymers (Penkhrue et al. 2015). The first group is derived from renewable resources (Guo et al. 2012) such a biomass of organic waste material or crops (Kershaw 2015), it can be produced by microorganisms or obtained from genetically modified plants (Shah et al. 2008). Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are renewable source-based polymers. Polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly(butylenes succinate) (PBS) are petroleum based. Despite this fact, they can be degraded by microorganisms s in the natural environment (Koitabashi et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; Penkhrue et al. 2015). In this process, known as biodegradation, compounds commonly occurring in the natural environment (Bhardwaj et al. 2012), such as CO 2, H 2 O, NH 4, N 2, H 2 and biomass are produced. Therefore bioplastics do not negatively affect the natural environment. Biodegradation is the partial or complete hydrolysis of a polymer by microbial activity with the positive influence of photodegradation (Kershaw 2015). However, this process can also be time consuming and often high temperature is required. For example, it has be confirmed that high temperature (60  °C) is the best for PLA degradation (Prema et al. 2013; Sukkhum et al. 2009). Moreover 20  months were required to decomposition of PLA in soil (Urayama et al. 2002) in contrast to the compost, where degradation was lasted 45 – 60  days. Other biodegradable plastics are more susceptible to microbial attack in the natural environment than PLA (Tokiwa and Calabia 2006), required time and temperature are lower. On the other hand, it should be search for microorganisms, which are able to decompose biodegradable plastics at temperatures as low as possible. Due to growing pollution of the world, it is necessary to improve the biodegradation process of bioplastic by reduction of the time or by decreasing the temperature required for an efficient process. Moreover, by finding microorganisms which can assimilate many types of bioplastics it is possible to make the biodegradation process more efficient.|$|R
