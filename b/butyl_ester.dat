In addition, the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives in the commercial formulations was tested.

A commercial formulation of 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was used to test the hypothesis that the majority of the odour associated with many agrichemicals is due to manufacturing impurities and/or additives. Using dynamic dilution olfactometry, pure 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester was determined to be odourless. 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, which has an intense odour, was identified as a manufacturing impurity in the formulation. An estimate of its odour threshold (1. 95 ppb) was measured using the technique of dynamic dilution olfactometry. Other significant odorants in the formulation were iso-octanol and an aromatic solvent. The aromatic solvent is responsible for the majority of the odour associated with the 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester formulation, assuming no significant masking or synergistic effects between the odorants. The odour concentrations generated from the spraying of the herbicides under simulated aerial application conditions were measured using dynamic dilution olfactometry. The mean odour concentrations for 2, 4 -D ethylhexyl ester (22, 350 OUc/m³) and MCPA (23, 400 OUc/m³) were about 2 -fold higher than the values for 2, 4 -D <b>butyl</b> <b>ester</b> (12, 070 OUc/m³) and 2, 4 -D amine (10, 000 OUc/m³).

Coumarin chromophores were {{successfully}} bonded onto ethylene-co-butyl acrylate (EBA) with a <b>butyl</b> <b>ester</b> content of 17 % {{under mild conditions}} in solution via microwave irradiation. The synthesis consisted of three steps: partial conversion of butyl esters into carboxylic acid groups, conversion of carboxylic acid functionalities into acid chloride groups and esterification using 7 -(3 -hydroxy-propoxy) coumarin. The EBA modified with coumarin groups was characterized using FTIR, NMR, UV spectroscopy and thermal methods. The EBA modified with coumarin moieties (EBA-g-coum) was crosslinked by irradiating at 365 nm, and the coumarin photodimers were cleaved by irradiating at 280 nm. The reversibility of the photoreactions in the solid state was monitored using UV spectroscopy. Additionally, the mechanical properties of the materials were determined. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The enzyme system AlkBGT from Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 can {{efficiently}} ω-functionalize {{fatty acid}} methyl esters. Outer membrane protein AlkL boosts this ω-functionalization. In this report, it is shown that whole cells of Escherichia coli expressing the AlkBGT system can also ω-oxidize ethyl nonanoate (NAEE). Coexpression of AlkBGT and AlkL resulted in 1. 7 -fold-higher ω-oxidation activity on NAEE. With this strain, initial activity on NAEE was 70 U/g (dry weight) of cells (g cdw), 67 % {{of the initial}} activity on methyl nonanoate. In time-lapse conversions with 5 mMNAEE the main product was 9 -hydroxy NAEE (3. 6 mM), but also 9 -oxo NAEE (0. 1 mM) and 9 -carboxy NAEE (0. 6 mM) were formed. AlkBGT also ω-oxidized ethyl, propyl, and <b>butyl</b> <b>esters</b> of fatty acids ranging from C 6 to C 10. Increasing {{the length of the}} alkyl chain improved the ω-oxidation activity of AlkBGT on esters of C 6 and C 7 fatty acids. From these <b>esters,</b> application of <b>butyl</b> hexanoate resulted in the highest ω-oxidation activity, 82 U/g cdw. Coexpression of AlkL only had a positive effect on ω-functionalization of substrates with a total length of C 11 or longer. These findings indicate that AlkBGT(L) can be applied as a biocatalyst for ω-functionalization of ethyl, propyl, and <b>butyl</b> <b>esters</b> of medium-chain fatty acids. </p...|$|R

Two active inhibitory compounds were isolated by activity-guided fractionation, using recombinant Nitrosomonas europaea containing luxAB genes derived from the bioluminescent marine gram-negative bacterium Vibrio harveyi. The compounds were identified as methyl-p-coumarate and methyl ferulate, respectively. Their nitrification inhibitory properties were confirmed in chemically synthesized preparations of each. The IC 50 values of chemically synthesized preparations were 19. 5 and 4. 4 Î¼M, respectively.
