40|$|We report new {{records from}} {{ornithology}} surveys conducted at Kusad Mountain and Parabara savanna in Guyanaâ€™s southern Rupununi region during October and November 2013. Both localities had existing species lists based on surveys conducted in 2000, {{but had not}} been formally surveyed since. We surveyed birds over 15 field days, adding 22 and 10 species to the existing lists for Kusad and Parabara, respectively. Our findings augment prior knowledge of the status and distribution of birds in this region of the Guiana Shield. The southern Rupununi harbors high avian diversity, including rare species such as Rio Branco Antbird (Cercomacra carbonaria), Hoary-throated Spinetail (Synallaxis kollari), <b>Bearded</b> <b>Tachuri</b> (Polystictus pectoralis), and Red Siskin (Spinus cucullatus), which {{are likely to continue}} to draw tourism revenue to local communities if their habitats remain intact...|$|E
