40|$|In this paper, two {{developed}} {{methods of}} tooth root {{load carrying capacity}} calculations for <b>beveloid</b> gears with parallel axes are presented, in part utilizing WZL software GearGenerator and ZaKo 3 D. One method calculates the tooth root load-carrying capacity in an FE-based approach. For the other, analytic formulas are employed to calculate the tooth root load-carrying capacity of <b>beveloid</b> gears. To conclude, both methods are applied to a test gear. The methods are compared both {{to each other and}} to other tests on <b>beveloid</b> gears with parallel axes in test bench trials...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} contact {{characteristics}} of <b>beveloid</b> gear pairs with intersected, crossed and parallel axes. Tooth contact analysis (TCA) is performed {{to examine the}} meshing and bearing contact of the <b>beveloid</b> gear pairs composed of a pinion and a gear. In addition, the principal directions and curva-tures of the pinion and gear surfaces are investigated and the contact ellipses of the mating tooth surfaces are also studied. Numerical illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the computational re-sults. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{approach}} {{for the analysis}} of tooth contact and load distribution of straight <b>beveloid</b> gears with parallel axes is proposed. The approach is based on application of influence coefficient method that accommodates the influence of contact deformation and tooth deflection. Computer program has been written to calculate the distribution of pressure. Results have been analyzed and validated by comparison with studies carried out by the finite element method with the aid of ANSYS general purpose computer program. Suggestion has been given to minimize the drawback generated by stress concentration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{test bed}} of closed-end {{mechanical}} <b>beveloid</b> gear with intersecting axes {{is designed to}} measure various parameters. In order to analyze the reasonableness of the structural design and test {{the performance of the}} test bed, a three-dimensional solid simulation model of the test bed is set up first with virtual simulation technology to analyze motion characteristics of test-bed and modal analysis to analyze the vibration characteristics of the key components. Simulation test obtains the vibration mode of the test gear box and drive gear box, providing a useful result for the optimization of the test bed. This solves some problems such as that a common test bed cannot test gear with intersecting axis and must have the same test pair gear, and inaccuracies of measuring transmission efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A high {{efficiency}} special transmission decelerator is designed by scheme design, structural design, optimization design, and return difference analysis and computer simulation. Small teeth difference transmission {{with the first}} level bevel gear pair and the second level <b>beveloid</b> gear pair is adopted as the form of transmission in the decelerating system. Great torque and big bending moment are available by transmission ratio formula deduction, force analysis and strength analysis. The particle swarm optimization and the genetic algorithm have been combined and the mutation operator optimization model has been proposed to optimize the design of decelerator. Then the transmission with large transmission ratio, high torque, high power and high precision will be realized in small space. This model has solved the problems of particle swarm optimization in mechanical design. For example, there are more variables, it is constrained and it is easily precocious. This model has provided the theoretical basis for the optimum design of microminiaturization gear system.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{teeth of}} {{ordinary}} {{spur and helical}} gears are generated by a (virtual) rack provided with planar generating surfaces. The resulting tooth surface shapes are a circle-involute cylinder {{in the case of}} spur gears, and a circle-involute helicoid for helical gears. Advantages associated with involute geometry are well known. <b>Beveloid</b> gears are often regarded as a generalization of involute cylindrical gears involving one additional degree-of-freedom, in that the midplane of their (virtual) generating rack is inclined with respect to the axis of the gear being generated. A peculiarity of their generation process is that the motion of the generating planar surface, seen from the fixed space, is a rectilinear translation (while the gear blank is rotated about a fixed axis); the component of such translation that is orthogonal to the generating plane is the one that ultimately dictates the shape of the generated, envelope surface. Starting from this basic fact, we set out to revisit this type of generation-by-envelope process and to profitably use it to explore peculiar design layouts, in particular for the case of motion transmission between skew axes (and intersecting axes as a special case). Analytical derivations demonstrate the possibility of involute helicoid profiles (beveloids) transmitting motion between skew axes through line contact and, perhaps more importantly, they lead to the derivation of designs featuring insensitivity of the transmission ratio to all misalignments within relatively large limits. The theoretical developments are confirmed by various numerical examples...|$|E
