40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to show that}} the Swiss cantons do not care –or do not care that much– of the {{obligation}} of the article 100 of the federal Constitution, namely to adapt their fiscal policy according to the business cycle. More secifically, the paper aims at confirming on a factual basis that the cantonal fiscal policies are pro-cyclical.

Whereas in most cantons {{it can be seen that}} the <b>budgetary</b> <b>proposals</b> for 2003 are either neutral toward the business cycle or more often procyclical. This statement is reinforced by statistical studies carried out by various researchers both at the cantonal individual level and allover the cantons using data for the long run. The meta-analysis of these studies shows that the Swiss cantons usually had behaved procyclically since there had been systematically and clearly more pro- cyclical impulses than contra-cyclical impluses. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{typology}} of organizational arrangements {{between state and}} local public health agencies {{was used as a}} framework within which the organizational environment of the local health department was studied for its effects on program development and implementation by local public health departments. Data collected in a national sample of local health officers were used in measuring the effect of four different patterns of administrative relationships on the selected characteristics of local health department programs. Important differences were observed among the four organizational types with regard to constraints on programs and program priorities, and health officers' perceptions of the primary functions of local health departments and sources of local health department funding. These findings were then used as a baseline from which to consider the possible impact of recent federal health <b>budgetary</b> <b>proposals</b> (specifically, block grants) both on existing patterns of intergovernmental relations and on the funding and operation of local health department programs. It was determined that the most likely general development arising from these proposed changes in federal budgetary policy is that the administrative control of state health agencies over those at the local level is likely to be enhanced. Other likely developments include changes in the programs and priorities of local health departments related to reductions in overall funding levels for human services and forced competition for fewer dollars by an enlarged constituency...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss visions and realities in recent Norwegian {{governmental}} reports on libraries. How realistic are the government's plans? Do the commitments in the reports comply with the <b>budgetary</b> <b>proposals?</b> How do the local libraries interpret them? Would a change in government affect the public libraries, as they are funded by municipal authorities and local politicians? Design/methodology/approach – The methods used are a qualitative analysis of interviews and an examination of the reports and relevant statistical data. Six public libraries, of different types and geographical distribution, were chosen for analysis. Statistical and economic data were obtained from the KOSTRA database (Municipality-State-Reporting) from Statistics Norway and the annual ALM (Archives, Libraries, Museums) publication Statistics for Archives, Libraries and Museum (Statistikk for arkiv, bibliotek og museum). Findings – The budget proposals of the Norwegian government indicate willingness to implement the commitments in the governmental reports, with the exception of the small amounts allocated to competence development and model libraries. The reports do not address the serious challenges facing Norwegian public libraries. Practical implications – The paper discusses the latest official plans and strategies for Norwegian libraries. This should interest library employees and library and information students and teachers, as well as governmental representatives and politicians. Originality/value – The in-depth analysis of a selection of Norwegian public libraries could be valuable for librarians in Norway, as well as in other countries, in times of budget cuts, decreasing resources and financial difficulties...|$|R

5000|$|Although the November 2010 {{election}} left Republicans {{in control}} of the House, Democrats remained {{in control of}} the Senate and the White House, resulting in a division of power that would lead to a series of clashes over spending priorities and other policy matters. In early 2011, some Republicans threatened to force a shutdown unless the President and Democratic-controlled Senate agreed to much deeper spending cuts. Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois said the country might need a government shutdown as a form of [...] "shock therapy" [...] to raise awareness {{of the state of the}} federal government's finances. Conservative activists held rallies in early 2011 urging Republican lawmakers to shut down the government if necessary to push Democrats to agree to Republican <b>budgetary</b> <b>proposals.</b> When Democrats said a government shutdown would have catastrophic effects on the economy and would hurt American families, many conservatives said Democrats were overstating the severity of the effects a shutdown would produce. A Gallup poll of public opinion showed that the majority of Republicans were in favor of shutting down the government rather than having congressional Republicans accept a compromise budget plan, while the majority of Americans overall (including majorities of Democrats and of independents) preferred that lawmakers reach a compromise deal. In April 2011, Republicans in the House of Representatives threatened to shut down the government unless the Senate and the President agreed to further spending cuts as well as to cuts in federal funding for Planned Parenthood and other birth-control providers and to curtailing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to enforce the Clean Air Act and carbon dioxide emissions. House Republicans gave Speaker John Boehner an ovation when he informed them that he was advising the House Administration Committee to begin preparations for a possible shutdown. A budget deal was agreed to less than two hours before a shutdown would have begun.|$|R

40|$|This letter {{responds}} to your {{request for an}} updated analysis {{of the effects of}} proposals to limit costs related to medical malpractice (“tort reform”). Tort reform could affect costs for health care both directly and indirectly: directly, by lowering premiums for medical liability insurance; and indirectly, by reducing the use of diagnostic tests and other health care services when providers recommend those services principally to reduce their potential exposure to lawsuits. Because of mixed evidence about whether tort reform affects the utilization of health care services, past analyses by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have focused on the impact of tort reform on premiums for malpractice insurance. However, more recent research has provided additional evidence to suggest that lowering the cost of medical malpractice tends to reduce the use of health care services. CBO has updated its estimate of the <b>budgetary</b> effects of <b>proposals</b> for tort reform to reflect that new information. Background on Tort Reform Under current law, individuals may pursue civil claims against physicians and other health care providers for alleged torts—breaches of duty that result in personal injury...|$|R
40|$|Grace to the {{analysis}} of several commercial companies effectively performed “on the field”, we could remark the necessity to change the method of cost calculation, our motivation being related to the simplification of calculations and the reduction of the labour volume, but especially the necessity to know in due time the deviations occurred as well as the causes having led to their apparition. The importance of knowing the deviations in due time results from the very basic characteristics of the constructions execution, i. e. the performance of works during several budgetary years, which leads to the modifications of prices and materials, the introduction of new technologies, and to the performance of open air activities, making the execution of constructions works be influenced by the atmospheric condition. But {{the most important aspect of}} knowing the deviations is the correct determination of expenses and their inscribing in the corresponding period, in view of determining the result of the <b>budgetary</b> year. Our <b>proposal</b> for the enhancement of the method of cost calculation in constructions is the application of the standard cost method in the variant “single standard cost”.

40|$|The large {{reserves}} of East Asian central banks {{have received a}} great deal of attention (Aizenmann and Marion (2002)). Some observers consider that these have made regional finances more robust and better able to weather sudden withdrawals of capital. Others have criticised the reserves as low-yielding external assets that are accumulated at the expense of higher-yielding domestic investment. Others worry that exchange rate management that gives rise to the reserves might result in investment in the traded goods sector that will prove wasteful if exchange rates subsequently appreciate. Less attention has been paid to the financing of the reserve build-up. The financing, or sterilisation, of the foreign exchange reserve build-up has presented an opportunity for bond market development, but policy has not made the most of this opportunity. While the interest bearing debts issued by central banks to finance the reserve build-up have added to the sum of public debts outstanding, they have generally also segmented that market into government debt per se and central bank debt. While from a macroeconomic standpoint this choice seems innocent, from a market development standpoint it has serious drawbacks. This paper starts by considering the alternatives faced by a central bank in financing large holdings of foreign exchange reserves. These choices are ranked, with use of government securities in the first position. Then the transactions needed to use government securities to finance reserves when these are held by the central bank are outlined. Then the benefits of this approach are adduced and the issues that must be faced are discussed. These include the attitude of the government and the rating agencies above all, and the practical questions of the return to be paid to the government for its deposit at the central bank, the duration of the extra government debt and consistency with the government <b>budgetary</b> process. This <b>proposal</b> was originally made with reference to East Asia, especially Indonesia, Korea...|$|R
