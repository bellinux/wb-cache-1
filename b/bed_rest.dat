5|$|Unless {{a person}} has medical {{problems}} preventing movement, after a person starts anti-coagulation therapy <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> {{should not be used}} to treat acute deep vein thrombosis. There are clinical benefits associated with walking and no evidence that walking is harmful, but people with DVT are harmed by <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> except when it is medically necessary.|$|E
5|$|Gabrielle and Carlos are in {{the middle}} of a {{prolonged}} divorce. Carlos has moved into an apartment across town and Gabrielle is forced to care for Xiao-Mei, who is over eight months pregnant and on <b>bed</b> <b>rest.</b> During an argument, Gabrielle threatens to send Xiao-Mei back to China after she has the baby. Later, Gabrielle discovers that Xiao-Mei has run away and enlists Carlos' help to find her. The two bicker before acknowledging the challenges they will face while trying to raise a child as a divorced couple. Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan) finds Xiao-Mei in a house that she has been trying to sell and notifies the Solises.|$|E
5|$|Haddock {{has been}} trying to get the local stonemason to fix a broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva Bianca Castafiore invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes <b>bed</b> <b>rest.</b> Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore {{presents}} Haddock with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.|$|E

5|$|In early 2002, Ebert was {{diagnosed}} with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> {{and was unable to}} speak, eat, or drink for a period of time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took {{time off for}} vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s {{and by the time}} of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E

5|$|While {{traveling}} to Antananarivo after a {{performance at the}} 2006 Donia Festival in Nosy Be, Jaojoby {{and his family were}} involved in a road accident. The singer suffered four broken ribs, lung damage and a fractured pelvis that necessitated emergency surgery in Réunion, three weeks of hospitalization, and prolonged physical therapy to enable Jaojoby to regain the ability to walk. Fans of the singer used mail and the Internet to successfully raise the funds required to cover medical expenses related to the accident. After several weeks of <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> following the surgery, Joajoby went on to make a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, engineered materials for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

5|$|Sheila {{continued}} with her secretarial course, then {{trained as a}} hairdresser, and briefly found work as a model with the Lucie Clayton agency, which included two months' work in Tokyo. She got pregnant again, and she and Colin married at Chelmsford Registry Office in May 1977 when Sheila was 20, but she lost the baby at six months. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> in hospital, {{she gave birth to}} the twins. At around this time, Colin began an affair, one that led to his leaving Sheila five months after the birth. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left a party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist. The couple divorced in May 1982.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on <b>bed</b> <b>rest</b> followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E
