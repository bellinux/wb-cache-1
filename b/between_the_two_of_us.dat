5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

I'm far more conservative than he is, and I've always loved the hands-on stuff"; and Alan told Airport Journals in 2006 that, [...] "Dale is more practical —unbelievably practical, in fact.

2500|$|I can't {{think of}} a more {{important}} moment in my life... said this meeting, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> was very special for him. It was for me, too. In his concern for human rights, Dr. Ikeda is ahead of {{many people in this}} century. [...] He is a calm spirit, a humble man, a man of great spiritual enlightenment. We met for about an hour and talked about my life and challenges concerning the youth in our countries... Our meeting can {{serve as a model for}} anyone. So the photograph of our first meeting is very important because it is history in the making.|$|E
2500|$|Haggard {{collaborated with}} many other artists {{over the course of}} his career. [...] In the early 1960s, Haggard {{recorded}} duets with Bonnie Owens, who later became his wife, for Tally Records, scoring a minor hit with [...] "Just Between the Two of Us." [...] As part of the deal that got Haggard signed to Capitol, producer Ken Nelson obtained the rights to Haggard's Tally sides, including the duets with Owens, resulting in the release of Haggard's first duet album with Owens in 1966, also entitled Just <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us.</b> The album reached number four on the country charts, and Haggard and Owens recorded a number of additional duets before their divorce in 1978. Haggard went on to record duets with George Jones, Willie Nelson, and Clint Eastwood, among others.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{viewed the}} {{betrayal}} as a relief and release for {{herself as an}} actor, and as a [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "open" [...] moment for Lexa. [...] "It's the first real time you get to see—apart from —this is a scene where she makes a really strong choice, {{but you can see}} that it's hard for her to do, and she does care," [...] Debnam-Carey stated. She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt [...] " [...] always knew [...] was going to [...] Now those cards are back on the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else." ...|$|E

60|$|So I was a liar in Dolby's belief. He {{thought he}} had been sold, and at a cheap rate; but he divided his sarcasms quite fairly and quite equally <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He was full of ironical admiration of his childishness and innocence in letting a {{wandering}} and characterless and scandalous American load him up with deceptions of so transparent a character that they ought not to have deceived the house cat. On the other hand, he was remorselessly severe upon me for beguiling him, by studied and discreditable artifice, into bragging and boasting about his poor game {{in the presence of}} a professional expert disguised in lies and frauds, who could empty more balls in billiard pockets in an hour than he could empty into a basket in a day.|$|E

[...] "I'll vamoose," [...] he said to himself, with resolution. [...] "I'll put me mines in order, and go down into the valley and take the girl with me--God bless her! We'll take a little turn as far as New York. I'll put long miles <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and all this sporting record of mine. She don't like it, and I'll quit it. I'll begin a new life entirely." [...] And a glow of new-found virtue filled his heart. Of Wilkinson he had no fear--only disgust. [...] "Why should the fool pursue me?" [...] he repeated. [...] "He took his chances and lost out. If he weren't a 'farmer' he'd drop it." ...|$|E

We would make it as lively as possible for him up at the Castle; and, I don't know how your preserves are, but ours have been scarcely touched yet. <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> at any rate, he could have as much shooting as he liked. And I would ask the Fergusson girls to come and stay," [...] she went on, getting more and more in love with her plan. [...] "He was so much taken with Amy, you know, when they were down here before.

We have got so ravelled up (and all by my fault) that I know very well the least I could do is just to hold my tongue, which was what I {{intended}} fully, and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you again. But, my dear, it has become merely necessary, and no way by it. You see, this estate of mine has fallen in, which makes me rather a better match; and the--the business would not have quite the same ridiculous-like appearance that it would before. Besides which, it's supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying) {{that it would be better}} to let them be the way they are. In my view, this part of the thing is vastly exaggerate, and if I were you I would not wear two thoughts on it. Only it's right I should mention the same, because there's no doubt it has some influence on James More. Then I think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before. I think we did pretty well together. If you would look back, my dear--" ...|$|E
