5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for <b>birth</b> <b>trauma.</b> Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E

2500|$|The {{depression}} of abandonment grief creates a sustained type of stress that constitutes an emotional trauma {{which can be}} severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection. [...] A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' triggers primal separation fear, {{also referred to as}} primal abandonment fear – the fear of being left with no one to take care of one’s vital needs. [...] Our first anxiety is a response to separation from Mother. [...] This sensation is stored in the amygdala – a structure set deep into the brain’s emotional memory system responsible for conditioning the fight/freeze/flight response to fear. [...] Primal fear may have been initiated by <b>birth</b> <b>trauma</b> and even have some prenatal antecedents. The emotional memory system is fairly intact at or before birth and lays down traces of the sensations and feelings of the infant’s separation experiences. [...] These primitive feelings are reawakened by later events, especially those reminiscent of unwanted or abrupt separations from a source of sustenance.|$|E

(p.219) Also the article [...] "Chiropractic: A Profession at the Crossroads of Mainstream and Alternative Medicine" [...] states that, “chiropractic was to be a revolutionary system of healing {{based on the premise that}} neurologic dysfunction caused by ‘impinged’ nerves at the spinal level was the cause of most dis-ease”. (p.218) [...] The mechanisms that are claimed to alter nervous system function and affect overall health are seen as speculative in nature, however, clinical trials have been conducted that include “placebo-controlled comparisons [...] comparisons with other treatments”. (p.220) The American Chiropractic Association promotes chiropractic care of infants and children [...] under the theory that “poor posture and physical injury, including <b>birth</b> <b>trauma,</b> may be common primary causes of illness in children and can have a direct and significant impact not only on spinal mechanics, but on other bodily functions”.|$|E

40|$|In the {{epidemiologic}} {{context of}} maternal obesity and {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D), the incidence of gestational diabetes has significantly increased in the last decades. Infants of diabetic mothers are prone to various neonatal adverse outcomes, including metabolic and hematologic disorders, respiratory distress, cardiac disorders and neurologic impairment due to perinatal asphyxia and <b>birth</b> <b>traumas,</b> among others. Macrosomia is the most constant consequence of diabetes and its severity is mainly influenced by maternal blood glucose level. Neonatal hypoglycemia is the main metabolic disorder that should be prevented {{as soon as possible}} after birth. The severity of macrosomia and the maternal health condition have a strong impact on the frequency and the severity of adverse neonatal outcomes. Pregestational T 2 D and maternal obesity significantly increase the risk of perinatal death and birth defects.

40|$|Objective to {{describe}} the development and application of a brief counselling intervention for women who have experienced a traumatic birth. Intervention the <b>birthing</b> <b>trauma</b> counselling model reflecting women's need to establish a therapeutic connection with a midwife, talk about their birth experience and have their feelings validated. Gaps in understanding of events need explanation and explicit connections made between the event and subsequent emotions and behaviours. Developing a rational understanding of birthing events and how labour may have been managed differently assists women to revise their assumptions about maternity care and gain a sense of control. Fostering social support, reinforcing positive approaches to coping and exploring solutions to restoring self-confidence and reducing anxiety may help re-establish psychological equilibrium. Discussion and conclusion the counselling intervention is consistent with trauma theory and draws on cognitive behavioural therapy principles. Midwives are well placed to provide counselling support to women experiencing birth-related distress. Further testing of the intervention in the clinical setting with a large sample is required.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To develop Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) to {{identify}} potential in-hospital patient safety {{problems for the}} purpose of quality improvement. DATA SOURCE/STUDY DESIGN: The data source was 2, 400, 000 discharge records in the 1997 New York State Inpatient Database. PSI algorithms were developed using systematic literature reviews of indicators and hand searches of the ICD- 9 -CM code book. The prevalence of PSI events and associations between PSI events and patient-level and hospital-level characteristics, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and hospital charges were examined. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PSIs were developed for 12 distinct clinical situations and an overall summary measure. The 1997 event rates per 10, 000 discharges varied from 1. 1 for foreign bodies left during procedure to 84. 7 for <b>birth</b> <b>traumas.</b> Discharge records with PSI events had twofold to threefold longer hospital stays, twofold to 20 -fold higher rates of in-hospital mortality, and twofold to eightfold higher total charges than records without PSI events. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that PSI events were primarily associated with increasing age (p <. 001), hospitals performing more inpatient surgery (p <. 001), and hospitals with higher percentage of beds in intensive care units (p <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The PSIs provide an efficient and user-friendly tool {{to identify}} potential inhospital patient safety problems for targeted institution-level quality improvement efforts.
