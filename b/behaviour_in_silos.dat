40|$|AbstractDiscrete and {{continuum}} modelling of granular flow in a {{conical hopper}} discharge is presented. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) {{is used for}} discrete modelling and Finite Element Method based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for continuum modelling. The ALE model has shown its capability to model granular flow and macroscopic <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> <b>silos</b> in the authors’ previous work (Wang et al., 2013). The use of ALE overcomes mesh distortion problem due to material large deformation which is often encountered in standard finite element modelling of silo discharge. However, there is still limitation when a continuum method is used to model silo discharge, in particular, to pursue particle-scale features in such granular flow. In this study, wall pressure, flow pattern and flow rate during silo discharge are investigated using both ALE and DEM simulation. Classical theories are used as a comparison, to verify the two numerical models. By comparison, it is indicated that both FE model using ALE formulation and DEM model {{have the capacity to}} model the granular behaviour and wall pressure for granular process in silos. The conclusion that ALE has advantages over DEM in wall pressure prediction giving stable pressure profile with smooth trend; while DEM has the ability to evaluate the role of particle-scale parameters on macro-scale response in such granular flow after carefully smoothing out the results has been drawn in the present study...|$|E

40|$|In {{industry}} {{the flow}} of mineral particles <b>in</b> <b>silos</b> playa very {{important role in the}} recovery of these particles into containers for bagging and transport. The silo design parameters and particulate properties are restricting the flow behavior <b>in</b> <b>silos</b> thereby controlling the rate of packing into containers as a finished product or else in the utilization of these particles for subsequent unit operations down the processing line. Further, telescopic silos have been introduced recently in mining industry [1] for dust suppression in quarries, gravel pits by minimizing the distribution of dust and fines in to the surrounding areas. There are factors affecting the flow behavior <b>in</b> <b>silos</b> [2] such as particle size, angle of repose. moisture content, static electric charges of powders and so on.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and tests}} a two-dimensional discrete dynamic {{model for the}} simulation of granular flows <b>in</b> <b>silos</b> and hoppers. The granular material considered {{is assumed to be}} an assembly of viscoelastic discs and the motion of such a particle system is shown to be governed by a set of nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations. This system of equations is then solved numerically using the centered finite difference scheme. Based on the model presented, a computer program has been developed and used to analyse the flow behaviour of granular materials during filling and emptying of a silo. The results show that the discrete dynamic model developed is capable of modelling granular flows <b>in</b> <b>silos,</b> particularly predicting wall pressures and analysing flow blockage...|$|R

40|$|Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is {{associated}} with the detrimental effect of browning fruit and vegetables, however interest within PPO containing forage crops has grown since the brownng reaction was associated with reduced nitrogen (N) losses <b>in</b> <b>silo</b> and the rumen. The reduction in protein breakdown <b>in</b> <b>silo</b> of red clover (high PPO forage) increased the quality of protein, improving N-use efficiency (NUE) when fed to ruminants. A further benefit of red clover silage feeding is a significant reduction <b>in</b> lipolysis <b>in</b> <b>silo</b> and an increase in the deposition of beneficial C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in animal products, which has also been linked to PPO activity. PPOs protection of plant protein and glycerol based-PUFA <b>in</b> <b>silo</b> is related to the deactivation of plant proteases and lipases. This deactivation occurs through PPO catalysing the conversion of diphenols to quinones which bind with cellular nucleophiles such as protein reforming a protein-bound phenol (PBP). If the protein is an enzyme the complexing denatures the enzyme. However, PPO is inactive in the anaerobic rumen and therefore any subsequent protection of plant protein and glycerol based-PUFA in the rumen must be as a result of events that occurred to the forage pre-ingestion. Reduced activity of plant proteases and lipases would have little effect on NUE and glycerol based-PUFA in the rumen due to the greater concentration of rumen microbial proteases and lipases. The mechanism for PPOs protection of plant protein in the rumen is a consequence of complexing plant protein, rather than protease deactivation per se. These complexed proteins reduce protein digestibility in the rumen and subsequently increase un-degraded dietary protein flow to the small intestine. The mechanism for protecting glycerol-based PUFA has yet to be fully elucidated but may be associated with entrapment within PBP reducing access to microbial lipases or differences in rumen digestion kinetics of red clover...|$|R
