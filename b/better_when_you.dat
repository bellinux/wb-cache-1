5|$|After Simpson's {{decision}} {{to focus on}} Fightstar, the band entered Criterion Studios in London with producer Mark Williams to begin work on their first EP, They Liked You <b>Better</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Were Dead. It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together. Recording sessions were often interrupted, since Simpson {{was in the midst}} of a sold-out series of Wembley shows with Busted.|$|E
5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, They Liked You <b>Better</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Were Dead, was a critical success.|$|E
25|$|The mere {{pocketing}} of a ball isn't that hard; in fact, it's relatively simple. What drives many, {{many players}} to distraction is {{the unpredictability of}} the cueball's path of travel...the game of billiards requires you to drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly asks you to stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> understand the how and why of a ball's getting {{from one place to}} another.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of They Liked You <b>Better</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Were Dead, the band were approached by their management about whom they wanted to produce their debut full-length album. They requested Colin Richardson; initially sceptical about their chances, Richardson agreed to collaborate after he listened to their demos. Fightstar entered studios in west London and Surrey with Richardson in October 2005. Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums. When recording began, he called the band [...] "very focused" [...] and {{said that there was}} a [...] "real buzz because nobody knows what to expect." [...] Grand Unification is a loose concept album, influenced by and based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. With lyrics loosely based on the personal experiences of Charlie Simpson and Alex Westaway, its underlying concept revolves around two people who experience the last few days of their lives {{before the end of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|They Liked You <b>Better</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Were Dead, {{released}} on 28 February 2005 {{after a brief}} UK promotional tour. It was a critical success, though Punknews.org reviewed it negatively. Alex Westaway, the band's lead guitarist and co-lyricist, drew its artwork (based on Edward Norton) for the booklet; the EP's lead single, [...] "Palahniuk's Laughter", was inspired by David Fincher's film Fight Club (1999), which in turn {{was based on the}} novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. [...] "Palahniuk's Laughter" [...] received heavy rotation on music-video channels and spent many weeks on charts based on video and radio requests. The track, originally entitled [...] "Out Swimming in the Flood", was renamed after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The EP's UK version contained five tracks (including a sixth hidden track), and was ineligible for the UK Singles Chart. It was released the following year in North America as an extended mini-album by Deep Elm Records. The release was praised by critics, despite initial scepticism due to Simpson's former pop career with Busted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Raines married Virginia Hilton, {{a classmate}} at Seminole High School. The couple had two children: Tim Jr. ("Little Rock"), and André ("Little Hawk"). In high school, {{he was a}} running back and has said he enjoyed {{football}} [...] more than baseball at the time. [...] On the matter between the two he reflects, [...] "...in football I was a running back, so in the NFL my career would have probably lasted {{six or seven years}} and in baseball I ended up playing 23 years. In baseball you can play a long time so I think it's <b>better</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think of it in that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, the {{distance}} between the pitcher and home plate was extended by nine feet, resulting in a dramatic increase in batting averages. The rule change helped Zimmer statistically, as he compiled a [...]308 batting average, the first of four [...]300 seasons. However, Zimmer bemoaned the rule change's effect on pitchers: [...] "They are making the pitcher a mere automaton. By and by they will make him stand on a cake of ice and pitch. Say what you will, the pitcher is the central figure in the game. People pay their money to see base ball, and the more scientific it is the <b>better.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> put a pitcher out of sight and make a toy of him you are working squarely against the interests of the game, in my opinion." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Bosh!" [...] remarked Edith unceremoniously. [...] "Mabel and Chris {{will have}} a far <b>better</b> time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are married and can present them yourself. Tell them from me that its no fun being 'out' and the longer they put it off the better they'll enjoy {{themselves}} later on. Besides, Colonel Harris will take them about." ...|$|R
