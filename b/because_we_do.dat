500|$|In Amsterdam, {{three days}} of filming took place. Woodley and Elgort were filmed on a canal-side public bench. On July 2, 2014, The Guardian {{reported}} that the bench had gone missing, and city officials {{said they did not}} know where it was. Amsterdam city spokesman, Stephan van der Hoek said: [...] "It's a bit embarrassing, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> keep good track of them, but it's gone all right". He promised to install a new bench within weeks. Just a week later, Entertainment Weekly said the Amsterdam film office had tweeted a photograph taken during the re-installation of the stolen bench; Amsterdam film commissioner Simon Brester said it was the same bench, not a replacement.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> genuinely get worked up and we like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Facinelli was not {{originally}} cast as Carlisle Cullen. [...] " [...] liked me, {{but there}} was another actor that the studio was pushing for", Facinelli said. For unknown reasons, that actor was not able to play the part and Facinelli was selected in his place. The choice of Ashley Greene to portray Alice Cullen was the subject of fan criticism due to Greene being [...] taller than her character as described in the novel. Meyer had also stated that Rachael Leigh Cook resembled her vision of Alice. Nikki Reed had previously worked with Hardwicke on Thirteen, which they wrote together, and Lords of Dogtown. Reed commented, [...] "I don't want to say it's a coincidence, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> work well together, and we have a great history. I think we make good work, but it's more that the people that hire [...] to direct a film of theirs [...] most likely seen her other work." ...|$|E

500|$|Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008–09 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1–1 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying [...] "I do not {{see it as a}} big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not want you anymore", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to [...] "pay a bit of money". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3–2 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; [...] "moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3–0 home defeat.|$|E

[...] Two days later, however, he was contradicted by Judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, saying [...] "we have no political prisoners in Iran" [...] because Iranian law does not mention such offenses, ...

2500|$|There is {{a fairly}} simple method for {{producing}} models of NFU in bulk. Using well-known techniques of model theory, one can construct a nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism j (not a set of the model) which moves a rank [...] of the cumulative hierarchy of sets. We may suppose {{without loss of generality}} that [...] We talk about the automorphism moving the rank rather than the ordinal <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not want to assume that every ordinal in the model is the index of a rank.|$|E
2500|$|Svoboda {{members have}} denied {{the party is}} anti-Semitic., Jewish Telegraphic Agency (May 25, 2009), Kyiv Post (27 December 2012) Party leader Tyahnybok stated in November 2012 “Svoboda is not an anti-Semitic party, Svoboda is not a xenophobic party. Svoboda is not an anti-Russian party. Svoboda is not an anti-European party. Svoboda is simply and only a pro-Ukrainian party”. In defense of these accusations, Tyahnybok has stated [...] "I have {{repeatedly}} said that Svoboda is not an anti-Semitic organization. If you have any comments on our views, go to court. But nobody will, because everyone understands that even biased Ukrainian courts cannot pass any sentence against Svoboda <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not violate Ukrainian laws."

2500|$|Scientist Isaac Newton saw God as the masterful creator whose {{existence}} {{could not}} be denied {{in the face of}} the grandeur of all creation. Nevertheless, he rejected polymath Leibniz' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the Opticks, Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:St. Thomas believed that the existence of God is self-evident in itself, but not to us. [...] "Therefore I say that this proposition, [...] "God exists", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject.... Now <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the buildup}} to the 2004 presidential election, a dispute {{in the press}} {{occurred}} between O'Keefe and NASA climatologist James Hansen.

[...] "The administrator [...] interrupted me," [...] Dr. Hansen said in the New York Times, [...] "he told me that I should not talk about dangerous anthropogenic interference, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know enough or have enough evidence for what would constitute dangerous anthropogenic interference."

Dr. Einaudi confirmed that Mr. O'Keefe had interrupted the presentation to say that these were [...] "delicate issues" [...] {{and there was a lot}} of uncertainty about them.

2500|$|Propositional {{logic is}} closed under truth-functional connectives. [...] That is to say, for any {{proposition}} , [...] {{is also a}} proposition. [...] Likewise, for any propositions [...] and , [...] is a proposition, and similarly for disjunction, conditional, and biconditional. [...] This implies that, for instance, [...] is a proposition, and {{so it can be}} conjoined with another proposition. [...] In order to represent this, we need to use parentheses to indicate which proposition is conjoined with which. [...] For instance, [...] is not a well-formed formula, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know if we are conjoining [...] with [...] or if we are conjoining [...] with [...] [...] Thus we must write either [...] to represent the former, or [...] to represent the latter. [...] By evaluating the truth conditions, we see that both expressions have the same truth conditions (will be true in the same cases), and moreover that any proposition formed by arbitrary conjunctions will have the same truth conditions, regardless of the location of the parentheses. [...] This means that conjunction is associative, however, one should not assume that parentheses never serve a purpose.

2500|$|Taste can be {{objective}} {{in terms of}} the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) {{but it can also be}} subjective in terms of what we deem [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad." [...] Taste is [...] "subjective, objective, and qualitative". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. [...] "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)". We cannot tell someone they do not think something tastes good <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael F. Whiting, {{director}} of Brigham Young University's DNA Sequencing Center {{and an associate}} professor in BYU's Department of Integrative Biology, concluded in his article [...] "DNA and the Book of Mormon: A Phylogenetic Perspective" [...] that Book of Mormon critics attempting to use DNA [...] "have not given us anything that would pass the muster of peer review by scientists in this field, because they have ignored the real complexity of the issues involved. Further, they have overlooked the entire concept of hypothesis testing in science and believe that just because they label their results as 'based on DNA,' they have somehow proved that the results are accurate or that they have designed the experiment correctly. At best, they have demonstrated that the global colonization hypothesis is an oversimplified interpretation of the Book of Mormon. At worst, they have misrepresented themselves and the evidence in the pursuit of other agendas." [...] Additionally, although he admits the usefulness of population genetics and of DNA in inferring historical events, he contests that, [...] "given the complexities of genetic drift, founder effect, and introgression, the observation that Native Americans have a preponderance of Asian genes does not conclusively demonstrate that they are therefore not descendants of the Lamanite lineage, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know what genetic signature that Lamanite lineage possessed {{at the conclusion of the}} Book of Mormon record." [...] Lastly, he concludes, [...] " [...] a strong possibility that there was substantial introgression of genes from other human populations into the genetic heritage of the Nephites and Lamanites, such that a unique genetic marker to identify someone unambiguously as a Lamanite, if it ever existed, was quickly lost." [...] and that, [...] "here are some very good scientific reasons for why the Book of Mormon is neither easily corroborated nor refuted by DNA evidence, and current attempts to do so are based on dubious science" [...]|$|E
