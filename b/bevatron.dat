5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the <b>Bevatron.</b> He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's <b>Bevatron</b> set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{national}} laboratories passed to the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. That year, Lawrence asked for $15 million for his projects, which included a new linear accelerator and a new gigaelectronvolt synchrotron which {{became known as the}} <b>bevatron.</b> The University of California's contract to run the Los Alamos laboratory was due to expire on July 1, 1948, and some board members wished to divest the university of the responsibility for running a site outside California. After some negotiation, the university agreed to extend the contract for what was now the Los Alamos National Laboratory for four more years, and to appoint Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer as its director in October 1945, as a professor. Soon after, Lawrence received all the funds he had requested.|$|E

While Goldhaber had previously worked in physical chemistry, she was able to transition to high energy physics and form a collaboration with her husband working on nuclear emulsion. The Goldhabers hoped to use their nuclear emulsion technique with the newly opened <b>Bevatron</b> — at the time the highest energy accelerator in operation — and it was through their methods that they observed some of the earliest interactions between K− mesons and protons. Using the <b>Bevatron</b> and the nuclear emulsion technique Goldhaber was the first to observe mass splitting in charged E hyperons as well as the first nuclear interactions of the antiproton.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the University of California {{as a full}} professor, Alvarez {{had many}} {{ideas about how to}} use his wartime radar {{knowledge}} to improve particle accelerators. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the [...] "big idea" [...] of this time would come from Edwin McMillan with his concept of phase stability which led to the synchrocyclotron. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the <b>Bevatron,</b> which began operating in 1954. Though the <b>Bevatron</b> could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.|$|E
500|$|Allison rebuilt his accelerator, {{which he}} called the [...] "kevatron", because it could {{accelerate}} particles to energies of 400 KeV. The name was {{a reference to the}} massive <b>bevatron</b> being built at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which was planned to accelerate particles to billions of electron volts. Allison still believed that there were useful results still to be found with low energies. He became a pioneer of what became known as [...] "heavy ion physics", accelerating protons and deuterons, and using lithium and beryllium as targets. The data on these reactions of light elements would subsequently prove useful in the study of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} the <b>Bevatron</b> was designed, it was {{strongly}} suspected but not known, that each particle had a corresponding anti-particle of opposite charge, identical in all other respects, a property known as charge symmetry.The anti-electron, or positron had been first observed in the early 1930s, and theoretically understood {{as a consequence of}} the Dirac equation at about the same time. Following World War II, positive and negative muons and pions were observed in cosmic-ray interactions seen in cloud chambers and stacks of nuclear photographic emulsions.The <b>Bevatron</b> was built to be energetic enough to create antiprotons, and thus test the hypothesis that every particle has a corresponding anti-particle. And, in 1955, the antiproton was discovered using the Bevatron; the 1959 Nobel Prize in physics for Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain for leading the project. [...] The antineutron was discovered soon thereafter by Oreste Piccioni and co-workers, also at the <b>Bevatron.</b> Confirmation of the charge symmetry conjecture in 1955 led to the Nobel Prize for physics being awarded to Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain in 1959.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Bevatron</b> {{received}} {{a new lease}} on life in 1971, when it was joined to the SuperHILAC linear accelerator as an injector for heavy ions. [...] The combination was conceived by Albert Ghiorso, who named it the Bevalac. [...] It could accelerate a wide range of stable nuclei to relativistic energies. [...] It was finally decommissioned in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Edward Joseph Lofgren (January 18, 1914 - September 6, 2016) was an American {{physicist}} in {{the early}} days of nuclear physics and elementary particle research at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL).

50|$|In 1948, having {{completed}} his experimental work, Chamberlain returned to Berkeley {{as a member}} of its faculty, where he, Segrè, and other physicists investigated proton-proton scattering. In 1955, a series of proton scattering experiments at Berkeley's <b>Bevatron</b> led to the discovery of the anti-proton, a particle exactly like a proton except negatively charged. Chamberlain's later research work included the time projection chamber (TPC), and work at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bevatron</b> was a {{particle}} accelerator [...] - [...] specifically, a weak-focusing proton synchrotron [...] - [...] at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S., which began operating in 1954.

50|$|One of {{the early}} large synchrotrons, now retired, is the <b>Bevatron,</b> {{constructed}} in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The name of this proton accelerator comes from its power, {{in the range of}} 6.3 GeV (then called BeV for billion electron volts; the name predates the adoption of the SI prefix giga-). A number of transuranium elements, unseen in the natural world, were first created with this machine. This site is also the location of one of the first large bubble chambers used to examine the results of the atomic collisions produced here.|$|E
50|$|Since the antineutron is {{electrically}} neutral, it cannot {{easily be}} observed directly. Instead, {{the products of}} its annihilation with ordinary matter are observed. In theory, a free antineutron should decay into an antiproton, a positron and a neutrino in a process analogous to the beta decay of free neutrons. There are theoretical proposals of neutron-antineutron oscillations, a process that implies the violation of the baryon number conservation. The antineutron was discovered in proton-antiproton collisions at the <b>Bevatron</b> (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) by Bruce Cork in 1956, {{one year after the}} antiproton was discovered.|$|E
50|$|While on a {{visit to}} the (fictional) Belmont <b>Bevatron</b> in the 1957 novel's near-future year of 1959, eight people become stuck in a series of subtly and not-so-subtly unreal worlds.

These ersatz universes are later revealed to be solipsistic manifestations of each individual's innermost fears and prejudices, bringing the story in line with Dick's penchant for subjective realities. As well as his future discussions of theology and fears about McCarthy-era authoritarianism, the novel skewers several human foibles.|$|E
