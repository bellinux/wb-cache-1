2500|$|In 2001, Khan {{set up a}} {{production}} company known as Aamir Khan Productions. Its first film was Lagaan. The movie was released in 2001, starring Khan as the lead actor. The film was selected as India's official entry to the 74th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, but it lost to No Man's Land. The film won numerous awards at several Indian award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA, and won the National Film Award for Most Popular Film, an award shared between Khan and the film's director, Ashutosh Gowariker. Khan later commented on the loss of Lagaan at the Oscars: [...] "Certainly we were disappointed. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> really kept us in our spirits was that the entire country was behind us".|$|E

2500|$|Even Maine Senator Edmund Muskie {{tested the}} limits of {{political}} muscle when he brushed against Leavitt's following. It was arranged for Muskie to go ice-fishing with Bud Leavitt—or as Muskie adviser Clyde MacDonald Jr. put it, [...] "possibly the greatest political event that could be arranged at that time." [...] MacDonald lived next to columnist Leavitt, whom the Muskie aide inveigled to accompany Muskie on a fishing trip to an Ellsworth, Maine, lake. Muskie landed the prize-winning fish, headlined in the next day's Bangor newspaper. As Muskie recalled, his fishing trip with Leavitt made a deeper impression than most of his electoral efforts. [...] "Muskie {{throughout the rest of}} his career would say, 'You know, I fought for Dickey-Lincoln , and I prevented them from closing Loring, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> people talk about is that fish.'" ...|$|E

Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was a big guy -- hell of a nice guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't you just put it on the Rambler Classic wheel-base? That way you've got V-8 availability and you've got more room inside it." [...] And then on top of that he added an inch to the roof while I was in Europe.

Entertainment Weekly {{reviewer}} Leah Greenblatt wrote that the album is [...] "as turgidly epic as the tenets of the genre demand" [...] with Conley [...] "mak no bones about his bad mood". She added that the band [...] "have rediscovered their riff-heavy melodics {{to go along with}} Alarm impressively righteous indignation". Gigwise staff member David Renshaw wrote that the instrumentation is [...] "nothing spectacular," [...] while noting that [...] "there are riffs piled on top of riffs ... and a few funky basslines ... <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps you coming back to this album is the lyrics". He said that with the album's [...] "heart on sleeve honesty set to a riff-tastic backdrop there is no reason that this album will not bring them the success expected of them on Stay What You Are".|$|E
