40|$|A {{compressively}} strained pseudomorphic Si 1 -xGex film being debonded from Si substrate by {{selective etching}} forms wrinkles with a uniform space periodicity. The present study provides experimental evidences and a theoretical {{model for the}} wrinkling process. To allow large deflection, non-linear Von Karman plate theory is employed. The amplitude and wavelength of wrinkles are determined by minimizing the total free energy of a debonded wrinkled film. The wrinkling analysis {{has shown that the}} amplitude and wavelength of wrinkled film are an outcome of a subtle compromise between bending energy, and normal and shearing components of the stretching energy. The wave number nondimentionalized over the depth of etch {{is a function of the}} membrane strain of a <b>bonded</b> <b>film,</b> Poisson’s ratio, and the nondimensional film thickness...|$|E
40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films were investigated. A pin-on-disk type of testing apparatus was used; {{in addition to}} sliding a hemispherically tipped rider, a rider with a 0. 95 -mm-diameter flat area was slid against the film so that a lower, less variable contact stress could be achieved. Two stages of lubrication occurred: in the first, the film supported the load and the lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of a thin surface layer between the rider and {{the bulk of the}} film. The second occurred after the <b>bonded</b> <b>film</b> had worn to the substrate, and consisted of the shear of very thin lubricant films between the rider and flat plateaus generated on the metallic substrate asperities. The film wear mechanism was strongly dependent on contact stress...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of how bonded solid lubricant films lubricate and wear (in general), the tribological properties of polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films were studied (in specific). A pin-on-disk type of testing apparatus was used; but in addition to sliding a hemispherically tipped rider, a rider with a 0. 95 mm diameter flat area was slid against the film. This was done so that a lower, less variable contact stress could be achieved. Two stages of lubrication occurred. In the first, the film supported the load. The lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of a thin surface layer (of the film) between the rider and the bulk of the film. The second occurred after the <b>bonded</b> <b>film</b> had worn to the substrate, and consisted of the shear of very thin lubricant films between the rider and flat plateaus generated on the metallic substrate asperities.

40|$|Deposition of {{carbonaceous}} films onto {{inner walls}} of small diameter tubes has been studied. A small size radio frequency plasma jet system with nozzles made from tungsten or graphite has been installed coaxially inside the tube. Changes in H 2 + CH 4 (+ 02) gas compositions affected strongly the coating conditions on inner {{walls of the}} tube. The growth rate distributions of the microcrystalline primarily sp 3 <b>bonded</b> <b>film</b> along the substrate area indicate an important role of the afterglow and peripheral regions of the plasma jet. Films were deposited onto Si, Mo, W, Cu, and Fe surfaces. At particular conditions incorporation of the substrate material into the growing films was observed. Contamination f films from the W nozzle was detectable only when oxygen was admixed in the working gas. Deposit ion of films onto the inner walls of hol low sub-strafes and tubes of internal diameters d > d by the plasma-assisted methods represents a p rob lem in many applications. In tubes with conductive walls of d> 20 mm a p lasma source may be installed insid...|$|E
40|$|NASA s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Project {{will send}} a six-wheeled rover to Mars in 2009. The rover will carry a {{scientific}} payload designed to search for organic molecules on the Martian surface during its primary mission. This paper describes the development and testing of a <b>bonded</b> <b>film</b> lubricated bushing system {{to be used in}} the mobility system of the rover. The MSL Rover Mobility System contains several pivots that are tightly constrained with respect to mass and volume. These pivots are also exposed to relatively low temperatures (- 135 C) during operation. The combination of these constraints led the mobility team to consider the use of solid film lubricated metallic bushings and dry running polymeric bushings in several flight pivot applications. A test program was developed to mitigate the risk associated with using these materials in critical pivots on the MSL vehicle. The program was designed to characterize bushing friction and wear performance over the expected operational temperature range (- 135 C to + 70 C). Seven different bushing material / lubricant combinations were evaluated to aid in the selection of the final flight pivot bushing material / lubricant combination...|$|E
