25|$|At {{the time}} of the Armistice, the Scots Greys were at Avesnes. To enforce the terms of the Armistice, the Scots Greys were ordered to cross into Germany, {{arriving}} there on 1 December 1918. However, although they would <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> police the terms of the armistice until a final treaty could be completed, they were almost immediately dismounted. By the beginning of 1919, the Scots Greys were reduced to 7 officers and 126 other ranks. This was approximately the size of one of its pre-war squadrons. After almost five years of service on the continent, the Scots Greys returned home to Britain on 21 March 1919 via Southampton.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That is what I am expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages. After the event she was appaulded by the crowd and said: [...] "It was great to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Olympic Games and tell people Somalia is still here." ...|$|E

2500|$|The anthropic {{principle}} was discussed by Leonard Susskind {{as well as}} Carlo Rovelli, who mentions it in his essay. [...] The {{anthropic principle}} claims {{that the universe is}} the way it is because if it was not specifically like how we see it, we would not <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> describe it. Leonard Susskind expands by talking about the idea that the anthropic principle can be seen as a threat to the mentality that every law governing the cosmos is set in stone; thus being unalterable.|$|E

[...] Noticeably frail, Groucho took a bow for his deceased brothers. [...] "I wish that Harpo and Chico could <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> share with me this great honor," [...] he said. [...] He also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes. Groucho's final appearance was a brief sketch with George Burns in the Bob Hope television special Joys (a parody of the 1975 movie Jaws) in March 1976. His health continued to decline the following year; when his younger brother Gummo died at age 84 on April 21, 1977, Groucho [...] was never told for fear of eliciting still further deterioration of his health.|$|E
