5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near {{the periphery of the}} cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Multinucleated and <b>binucleated</b> cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E
50|$|The fate of <b>binucleated</b> cells depends {{largely on}} the type of cell they {{originated}} from. A large percentage of <b>binucleated</b> cells arising from normal cells remain in interphase and never enter mitosis again. Cells that contain many mutations before they become binucleate {{are much more likely to}} proceed through subsequent rounds of mitosis. One study found that more than 50% of <b>binucleated</b> cells never entered mitosis again while greater than 95% of cancer cells were able to proceed through mitosis. Subsequent rounds of mitosis in <b>binucleated</b> cells have much higher rates of errors in chromosomal disjunction making it much more likely for cells to accumulate mutations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Binucleated</b> {{cells can}} be {{observed}} using microscopy. Cells must first be fixed to arrest them wherever {{they are in the}} cell cycle and to keep their structures from degrading. Their nuclei and tubulin must next be made visible so that binucleation can be identified. DAPI is a dye that binds to DNA and fluoresces blue. For this reason, it is particularly useful at labeling nuclei. Antibody probes can be used to label tubulin fluorescently. The immunofluorescence may then be observed with microscopy. <b>Binucleated</b> cells are most easily identified by viewing tubulin, which surrounds the two nuclei in the cell. <b>Binucleated</b> cells may be mistaken for two cells in close proximity when viewing only nuclei.|$|E
