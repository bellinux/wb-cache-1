40|$|International audienceA {{major issue}} of potato {{cultivation}} in temperate zones is the {{potato cyst nematode}} Globodera rostochiensis. Population density of G. rostochiensis is high in Mexican potato fields. Control currently consists of the inefficient application of high doses of chemical nematicides. We evaluated the population density of G. rostochiensis in potato production plots in central Veracruz, Mexico. Plots were treated with the biocontrol agent Paecilomyces sp. and rotation with two different leguminous crop plants, Pisum sativum and Vicia faba. A random block experimental design was used with four different treatments over two crop cycles: (1) biological control with crop rotation, (2) crop <b>rotation</b> only, (3) <b>biological</b> control applied to soil left in fallow, and (4) soil left in fallow only. We measured the number and content of cysts, {{and the number of}} J 2 juveniles of G. rostochiensis in the soil. We then estimated the infestation level in soil and the multiplication rate (Pf/Pi). The number of free-living nematodes was also quantified. Results show that the highest mitigation of G. rostochiensis was observed for the <b>biological</b> control <b>rotation,</b> with 89. 2  % reduction, and for the biological control fallow treatments with 84. 4  % reduction. In rotation plots, infestation level decreased by 30. 7  %. In the <b>biological</b> control <b>rotation</b> and <b>biological</b> control fallow treatments, the Pf/Pi was 0. 1 and 0. 15, respectively. The highest Pf/Pi of 0. 93 was found in the fallow plots.

40|$|In this work, we {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} agronomic factors in the selection for herbicide resistance in Apera spica-venti L. Beauv. (silky windgrass). During {{a period of three}} years, populations were collected in more than 250 conventional fields across Europe and tested for resistance in the greenhouse. After recording the field history of locations, a geo-referenced database has been developed to map the distribution of herbicide-resistant A. spica-venti populations in Europe. A Logistic Regression Model was used to assess whether and to what extent agricultural and <b>biological</b> factors (crop <b>rotation,</b> soil tillage, sowing date, soil texture and weed density) affect the probability of resistance selection apart from the selection pressure due to herbicide application. Our results revealed that rotation management and soil tillage are the factors that have the greatest influence on the model. In addition, first order interactions between these two variables were highly significant. Under conventional tillage, a percentage of winter crops in the rotation exceeding 75 % resulted in a 1280 -times higher risk of resistance selection compared to rotations with less than 50 % of winter crops. Under conservation tillage, the adoption of &gt; 75 % of winter crops increased the risk of resistance 13 -times compared to rotations with less than 50 % of winter crops. Finally, early sowing and high weed density significantly increased the risk of resistance compared to the reference categories (later sowing and low weed density, respectively). Soil texture had no significant influence. The developed model can find application in management programs aimed at preventing the evolution and spread of herbicide resistance in weed populations...|$|R
40|$|Political {{efforts are}} made in the European Union (EU) to reduce {{pesticide}} use and to increase the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM). Within the EU project ENDURE, research priorities on pesticide reduction are defined. Using maize, {{one of the most important}} crops in Europe, as a case study, we identified the most serious weeds, arthropod pests, and fungal diseases as well as classes and amounts of pesticides applied. Data for 11 European maize growing regions were collected from databases, publications and expert estimates. Silage maize dominates in northern Europe and grain production in central and southern Europe. Crop rotations range from continuous growing of maize over several years to well-planned rotation systems. Weeds, arthropod pests and fungal diseases cause economic losses in most regions, even though differences exist between northern countries and central and southern Europe. Several weed and arthropod species cause increasing problems, illustrating that the goal of reducing chemical pesticide applications is challenging. Pesticides could potentially be reduced by the choice of varieties including genetically modified hybrids, cultural control including crop <b>rotation,</b> <b>biological</b> control, optimized application techniques for chemicals, and the development of more specific treatments. However, restrictions in the availability of alternative pest control measures, farm organization, and the training and knowledge of farmers need to be overcome before the adoption of environmentally friendly pest control strategies can reduce chemical pesticides in an economically competitive way. The complex of several problems that need to be tackled simultaneously and the link between different control measures demonstrates the need for IPM approaches, where pest control is seen in the context of the cropping system and on a regional scale. Multicriteria assessments and decision support systems combined with pest monitoring programs may help to develop region-specific and sustainable strategies that are harmonized within a EU framewor...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted during {{three years at}} two locations in semiarid regions of Morocco, {{to determine the effect}} of fertilizer N on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, N uptake, water use and water use efficiency. Cropping systems included clean fallow, winter chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and wheat with four rates of fertilizer nitrogen. Isotopic N was used to determine N recovery and <b>biological</b> N fixation. <b>Rotation</b> and applied N increased wheat yield, N uptake and water use efficiency. Fallow resulted in more soil nitrate and soil water compared to chickpea or wheat, which resulted in greater yield increase for wheat following fallow than wheat after wheat or wheat after chickpea even with applied N. Grain yield increase ranged from 82 to 92 % in a normal year and 189 to 389 % in a dry year. Wheat yield after chickpea was higher than yield from continuous wheat despite similarities in soil water and nitrate-N. The percent of N biologically fixed by chickpea ranged from 61 to 74 %. Since the whole chickpea plant is taken from the field in Morocco, chickpea took 18 kg N/ha from the soil during a normal year and 5 kg/ha during a dry year. Applied N slightly increased water use but water use efficiency was increased through the increase in yield due to applied N and rotation treatments. Winter chickpea used as much water as wheat but was less efficient at producing dry matter and grain yield because of its slow growth during winter. Although the percent of real N recovery ranged only from 25 to 32 %, soil residual N increased only when 120 kg N/ha was applied on wheat after wheat. Wheat yield in unfertilized plots increased with soil nitrate-N levels. The limited data however, did not make it possible to determine critical levels of soil nitrate, but they indicated that soil nitrate level for wheat after fallow is higher than the other studied rotations. ...|$|R

30|$|The climate {{effect on}} mean annual {{increment}} at <b>biological</b> <b>rotation</b> age (MAImax) is derived only for stands which are or soon will be close to rotation age, i.e. European beech and Scots pine stands aged 81 and older and oak stands aged 121 and older {{at the end of}} the respective projection period. The rationale of this restriction is that we derive MAImax based on the simulated stand’s top height using static site index assessment refraining from the dynamic influence of changing site conditions which is a permissible approximation in this case. In order to obtain MAImax-values for younger stands taking climate change into consideration we would need to project forest growth climate-sensitively for younger stands beyond 2070. However, for this study no data on climate projections beyond 2070 is available. Therefore, only stands close to rotation age warrant a meaningful interpretation of MAImax-values under climate change conditions.|$|E
40|$|Declines {{in plant}} {{diversity}} will likely reduce soil microbial biomass, alter microbial functions, and threaten the provisioning of soil ecosystem services. We examined whether increasing temporal plant biodiversity in agroecosystems (by rotating crops) can partially reverse these trends and enhance soil microbial biomass and function. We quantified seasonal patterns in soil microbial biomass, respiration rates, extracellular enzyme activity, and catabolic potential three times over one growing season in a 12 -year crop rotation {{study at the}} W.  K.  Kellogg <b>Biological</b> Station LTER. <b>Rotation</b> treatments varied from one to five crops in a 3 -year rotation cycle, but all soils were sampled under a corn year. We hypothesized that crop diversity would increase microbial biomass, activity, and catabolic evenness (a measure of functional diversity). Inorganic N, the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and dissolved organic C and N varied seasonally, likely reflecting fluctuations in soil resources during the growing season. Soils from biodiverse cropping systems increased microbial biomass C by 28 – 112  % and N by 18 – 58  % compared to low-diversity systems. Rotations increased potential C mineralization {{by as much as}} 53  %, and potential N mineralization by 72  %, and both were related to substantially higher hydrolase and lower oxidase enzyme activities. The catabolic potential of the soil microbial community showed no, or slightly lower, catabolic evenness in more diverse rotations. However, the catabolic potential indicated that soil microbial communities were functionally distinct, and microbes from monoculture corn preferentially used simple substrates like carboxylic acids, relative to more diverse cropping systems. By isolating plant biodiversity from differences in fertilization and tillage, our study illustrates that crop biodiversity has overarching effects on soil microbial biomass and function that last throughout the growing season. In simplified agricultural systems, relatively small increases in crop diversity can have large impacts on microbial community size and function, with cover crops appearing to facilitate the largest increases...|$|R
40|$|A farm {{trial on}} {{integration}} of finfish (i. e., tilapia) in shrimp (Penaeus monodon) culture {{was conducted in}} Negros Occidental, Philippines to prevent luminous vibriosis in shrimp. The farm engaged in shrimp monoculture from 1987 to 1995. However, the prevailing luminous vibriosis outbreaks that started in 1994 prompted the farm operator to shift to tilapia culture in 1995 - 1996. The farm resumed shrimp operations in 1996 but by this time tilapia had already been integrated in the culture system. This paper reports {{on the results of}} the trial for 1999 using three ponds (ponds 7, 9, 29). These ponds had previously been used for tilapia culture for two years. During shrimp culture, they drew water from reservoirs stocked with tilapia and within the shrimp ponds tilapia are also stocked inside cages. This technology integrates crop <b>rotation,</b> <b>biological</b> pretreatment and polyculture into one system. During the culture period the chemical and bacteriological quality of soil, water and shrimp were monitored. Water quality parameters were within normal ranges for shrimp culture. Luminous bacterial counts in water and shrimp were consistently below 10 colony forming units (cfu) /ml and 103 cfu/hepatopancreas (hp), respectively. These levels are below threshold levels associated with luminous vibriosis outbreaks. With a stocking density of 19. 43 shrimp postlarvae (PL) /m 2, pond 7 yielded 2, 605 kg shrimp/ha with an estimated survival of 35. 65 % after 109 days of culture (DOC). With a stocking density of 18. 69 PL/ m 2, pond 9 yielded 5, 472 kg shrimp/ha with survival of 100 % after 148 DOC. With a stocking density of 19. 33 PL/m 2, Pond 29 yielded 5, 702 kg shrimp/ha with survival of 82. 66 % after 151 DOC. The relatively low production in pond 7 {{can be attributed to the}} inferior quality of the batch of stocked shrimp PL that already had a low survival of 50 % at DOC 30. Comparing the production performance from this present trial with that of this and other farms before the 1994 outbreaks, these good results cannot simply be attributed to chance despite of the lack of control in this farm trial. These results are consistent with the results of a previous trial of the same farm, the ongoing verification trials in Negros Occidental, and the observations of many farmers in other parts of the country on the potential of shrimp-finfish integration in preventing luminous vibriosis in shrimp...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{technical}} knowledge gaps for sustainable timber production in tropical forests {{is the lack of}} reliable information on tree growth, which is indispensable for defining cutting cycles and estimating harvest volumes. We applied dendroecological methods to measure and model the diameter growth (dbh) of mahogany Swietenia macrophylla and cedar Cedrela odorata in humid tropical forests of community-managed concessions in the Maya Biosphere Reserve, Petén, Guatemala. The width of growth rings was determined in increment cores from 32 trees of S. macrophylla and 27 of C. odorata and the annual nature of rings demonstrated using COFECHA software. A standardised chronology derived through comparisons among trees was obtained for 1927 - 2014 for S. macrophylla 1944 - 2014 in C. odorata. Sigmoidal functions were fitted to represent the relationship between stem diameter and tree age. S. macrophylla showed a long-term mean annual increment (MAI) of 0. 43 cm yr- 1 and tree ages were 40 - 184 yr. Based on the age at which the MAI curve crosses the curve of current annual increment (CAI), this species reaches its <b>biological</b> <b>rotation</b> at 92 yr, at 48 cm dbh. Estimated long-term MAI for C. odorata was 0. 65 cm yr- 1 and the ages of the trees sampled were 35 - 110 yr. This species reaches its <b>biological</b> <b>rotation</b> at 85 yr and 65 cm dbh, as compared to the 60 cm minimum cutting diameter. An attempt to correlate the width of growth rings with precipitation and temperature did not reveal an overriding climate signal in the growth data. Statistically significant correlations were found between precipitation measures from the previous year and current growth for Swietenia macrophylla, but not for Cedrela. Temperature variables of the previous and current years were both positively and negatively correlated with growth in both species. In conclusion, MAI for S. macrophylla is close to the 0. 4 cm yr- 1 used by Guatemalan authorities for harvest planning, but our results show that this MAI underestimates growth and yield of C. odorata. Biological criteria for the determination of the rotation time of S. macrophylla are not consistent with the official minimum harvesting diameter of 60 cm...|$|E
30|$|This study {{illustrates}} {{a method to}} assess {{the long-term effects of}} persistent dryer climate conditions on forest growth and productivity by comparing mean single-tree volume increment, periodic volume increment and mean annual increment at <b>biological</b> <b>rotation</b> age (MAImax) under constant climate conditions and under three climate projections until 2070. The projected changes in forest growth within a specified uncertainty range serve as quantitative contributions to provide decision support in forest planning, e.g. adapting silvicultural management strategies, evaluating species future site suitability and assessing the impact on timber supply. The quantitative analysis of possible productivity changes under persistent dryer climate complements the expert-knowledge based drought vulnerability assessment which is applied in northwestern Germany today (cf. Table 2). The drought vulnerability assessment as a synoptic approach qualitatively aggregates the effects of drought on tree growth, vitality and mortality based on thresholds for site water budget. The reported projection of productivity changes quantifies effects of persistent dryer climates on forest growth separately. In addition, the effects of drought on vitality and mortality still needs to be quantified on a level suitable for forest management.|$|E

Inter-annual variation of Chinese fir tree-ring widths were measured for the controlled burning, brush clearing and natural forest sites. The mean annual diametric growth of Chinese fir was 0. 56 cm·year− 1 for the natural forest, 0. 80 cm·year− 1 for the brush clearing site and 1. 10 cm·year− 1 for the controlled burning site.

Liebl.), is analysed comparing the simulation results under three different climate projections to a baseline scenario with constant climate until 2070. For the analysis we distinguish three 20 -year projection periods, i.e. the first period from 2011 to 2030, the second from 2031 to 2050 and the third from 2051 to 2070. In {{the course of the}} simulations more and more individual trees are removed by the thinning and harvesting algorithm or due to mortality and new trees are introduced by the ingrowth algorithm. Ingrowth, on the other hand, is not identical on a single tree basis among the four simulation runs. Thus, although starting with quite a number of individuals in 2011 in later periods the data base for tree-wise comparison becomes too small especially in younger age classes. Therefore, tree collectives are selected for comparison (cf. Additional file 1 : Tables S 1 and S 2). Under each scenario all trees of one species, i.e. pine, beech or oak, being alive {{at the end of the}} respective 20 -year projection period or being cut or dying because of density induced mortality during the period form one collective. As a result 9 collectives under the baseline scenario (3 periods × 3 species) are compared to 27 collectives under climate change (3 periods × 3 species × 3 climate scenarios). For each tree within the collectives the mean annual volume increment is predicted.|$|E
40|$|Emory oak (Quercus Emoryi) is a {{dominant}} tree species in San Rafael Valley in southeastern Arizona. However, basic {{information about the}} effects of coppice thinning on the growth and yield of this species is lacking. Thus, objectives of the study were to measure the effects of coppice thinning on Emory oak survivor growth, ingrowth, and mortality, which are the basic components of a growth budget. This study determined gross growth, net growth, and yield estimates. In addition, this study evaluated the mean annual growth (MAG) values in relation to the <b>biological</b> <b>rotation</b> age of Emory oak in southeastern Arizona. Coppice thinning treatments were applied to sprouts of different ages. Height and diameter at root collar measurements were taken immediately after thinning and again 5 years later. Sprouts were classified into 5 age groups, 4 stump diameters, and 3 level of coppice thinnings and an unthinned control. The interactions of these treatments and their effect on growth and yield were analyzed. Stump diameters did not significantly affect the growth components, growth estimates, or yield estimates. The number of residual sprouts significantly affected the growth components, growth estimates, and yield estimates. Survivor growth, gross growth, net growth, and yield were lowest for 1 residual sprout, except for net growth of 8 -year-old sprouts. There {{were no significant differences in}} net growth between the different coppice thinning treatments. At age 8 -year-old sprouts, the mean annual growth of individual sprouts increased as the number of residual sprouts per stump reduced. Based on this relationship, it is recommended that 1 residual sprout be left when thinning sprouts. Age of sprouts significantly affected growth. There was an increase in the mortality of the control sprouts in the 6 th year. Based on those results, it is recommended that thinning be conducted in the 5 th year of the sprout's growth. Proper timing of thinning can reduce the rotation age of Emory oak sprouts, if the rotation is based on achievement of a specified diameter. To draw firm conclusions {{about the effects of}} thinning on shortening the rotation age, the study measurement needs to be continued into the future...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analyzed}} the effects of silvicultural treatments on carbon (C) budgets in Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) plantations in the southeastern United States. We developed a hybrid model that integrated a widely used growth and yield model for loblolly pine with published allometric and biometric equations to simulate in situ C pools. The model used current values of forest product conversion efficiencies and forest product decay rates to calculate ex situ C pools. Using the model to evaluate the effects of silvicultural management systems on C sequestration over a 200 year simulation period, we concluded that site productivity (site quality), which can be altered by silviculture and genetic improvement, was the major factor controlling stand C density. On low productivity sites, average net C stocks were about 35 % lower than in stands with the default average site quality; in contrast, on high quality sites, C stocks were about 38 % greater than average productivity stands. If woody products were incorporated into the accounting, thinning was C positive because of the larger positive effects on ex situ C storage, rather than smaller reductions on in situ C storage. The use of <b>biological</b> <b>rotation</b> age (18 years) was not suitable for C sequestration, and extended rotation ages were found to increase stand C stock density. Stands with an 18 -year-rotation length had 7 % lower net C density than stands with a 22 -year-rotation length; stands with a 35 -year-rotation length had only 4 % more C than stands harvested at age 22 years. The C sequestered in woody products was an important pool of C storage, accounting for ~ 34 % of the average net C stock. Changes in decomposition rate, associated with possible environmental changes resulting from global climate change, affected C storage capacity of the forest. When decay rate was reduced to 10 % or increased to 20 %, the C stock in the dead pool (forest floor and coarse woody debris) was reduced about 11. 8 MgC∙ha− 1 or increased about 13. 3 MgC∙ha− 1, respectively, compared to the average decay rate of 15 %. The C emissions due to silvicultural and harvest activities were small (~ 1. 6 % of the gross C stock) compared to the magnitude of total stand C stock. The C model, based on empirical and biological relationships, appears appropriate for use in regional C stock assessments for loblolly pine plantation ecosystems in the southern U. S...|$|E
