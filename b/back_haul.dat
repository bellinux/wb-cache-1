50|$|Government {{agencies}} and utilities are turning toward {{advanced metering infrastructure}} (AMI) systems as part of larger “smart grid” initiatives. AMI extends automatic meter reading (AMR) technology by providing two way meter communications, allowing commands to be sent toward the home for multiple purposes, including time-based pricing information, demand-response actions, or remote service disconnects. Wireless technologies are critical elements of the neighborhood network, aggregating a mesh configuration of up to thousands of meters for <b>back</b> <b>haul</b> to the utility’s IT headquarters.|$|E
50|$|Traditional cellular, or Radio Access Networks (RAN), {{consist of}} many {{stand-alone}} base stations (BTS).

Each BTS has its own cooling, <b>back</b> <b>haul</b> transportation, backup battery, monitoring system, and so on. Because of limited spectral resources, network operators 'reuse' the frequency among different base stations, which can cause interference between neighbouring cells.|$|E

50|$|In February, 1987, {{the station}} {{launched}} its fledgling 2 man news operation, covering a major local news story, a deadly tornado in neighboring Jones county. That small beginning led to personnel {{growth and the}} production of half-hour newscasts airing weekdays at 6 and 10pm. This evolution grew out of the station's early practice of gathering local news stories and feeding them to sister station WJTV daily (via the <b>back</b> <b>haul</b> of a terrestrial microwave link) for inclusion in one block of WJTV's 6 and 10 PM newscasts. WHLT (in 1998) relaunched a full news department with shows known as 22 Daily News, had the same branding and slogan ("It's About Time") as the product at sister station WIAT in Birmingham, Alabama. Despite attaining decent ratings and winning numerous awards, it was unable to attract local advertising through consistent viewership. As a result, its newscasts were canceled after just two years.|$|E

We developed a decentrali 7 cd approach in which a specially designed market organizes competition and information to minimize the cost of back-hauls without the direct intervention of administrative negotiations or command-and- control types of scheduling. We employed laboratory experimental methods to test the concept, examine its performance against theoretical benchmarks, and explore its limitations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Free-Space Optical {{communication}} {{technology is a}} potential solution to the last mile or broadband access problem. Conventional free-space optical (FSO) communication is over a single link between two nodes. We explore multi-channel FSO communication system using compact (a maximum of a Sq. Ft) 2 -dimensional antennas with multiple communication links between them to achieve very high aggregate bandwidths (100 's of Gbps). But, close packaging of optical channels on the arrays causes inter-channel interference, reducing per channel capacity. We model the error due to inter-channel interference for such arrays and estimate the channel capacity. We address the multi-channel interference issue by both array design and by employing optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) for free-space optical communications and show that we can achieve multi Gbps bandwidths using such arrays. Possible applications for such multi-channel FSO systems can be in multi-hop broadband access networks or mesh networks and in <b>back</b> <b>haul,</b> connecting wireless base stations. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{issue of}} Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Part A {{represents}} {{a summary of}} the recent discussion meeting ‘Communication networks beyond the capacity crunch’. The purpose of the meeting was to establish the nature of the capacity crunch, estimate the time scales associated with it and to begin to find solutions to enable continued growth in a post-crunch era. The meeting confirmed that, in addition to a capacity shortage within a single optical fibre, many other ‘crunches’ are foreseen in the field of communications, both societal and technical. Technical crunches identified included the nonlinear Shannon limit, wireless spectrum, distribution of 5 G signals (front haul and <b>back</b> <b>haul),</b> while societal influences included net neutrality, creative content generation and distribution and latency, and finally energy and cost. The meeting concluded with the observation that these many crunches are genuine and may influence our future use of technology, but encouragingly noted that research and business practice are already moving to alleviate many of the negative consequences...|$|E
30|$|A basic {{version of}} the VRP is the capacitated VRP (CVRP) in which each vehicle has a known {{capacity}} and two other versions of CVRP are symmetric and asymmetric. Lots of new constraints are added on the route construction and made practical applications of the VRP (Toth and Vigo 2002). For example, Split-Delivery VRP (SDVRP) is a relaxation of the VRP in which the same customer can be served by different vehicles if it reduces the overall costs. It saves the total distance traveled {{as well as the}} number of required vehicles by allowing split deliveries (Jin et al. 2008). Hasani-Goodarzi and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam (2012) studied a split vehicle routing problem (SVRP) with capacity constraint for the multi-product cross-docks to determine the best vehicle routes and the optimal number of the utilized vehicles. By developing the CVRP, a VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW) can be obtained for which the service to each customer must start within a certain time window and the vehicle must remain at the customer’s location throughout the service. Delivery of food or newspaper is a simple example for the VRPTW. Another extension of the CVRP is VRP with Backhauls (VRPB) in which the customers may demand or return some goods. The customers are divided into two groups: line haul and <b>back</b> <b>haul</b> customers. Each line haul customer requires a given quantity to be delivered while a given quantity of products must be picked up from <b>back</b> <b>haul</b> customers. The next VRP model is the VRP with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD). The vehicles have the responsibility for delivering the goods to customers and picking the goods up at the customer locations. Another well-known generalization of the VRP is Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP). In the MDVRP, there are several depots instead of just one depot and every customer is visited by a vehicle based at one of the several existing depots, while every vehicle route must start and end at the same depot. By presentation of the initial VRP and basic models introduced above, many researchers studied algorithms and models for different versions of the VRP.|$|E
40|$|While only {{relatively}} recently standardized, IEEE 802. 16 orWiMAX {{networks are}} receiving {{a great deal}} of attention in both industry and research. This is so because with the increased emphasis on multimedia data, apart from the general advantage of wireless, 802. 16 promises wider bandwidth and QoS as part of the standard. As a <b>back</b> <b>haul</b> network for other networks, in particular the 802. 11 a/b/g/e or WiFi networks, it is well suited. As for any new technology, there are many open questions of which Transmission Scheduling and Connection Admission Control (CAC) are the most prominent. The standard intentionally makes no statement about either function. Different from other performance models we have seen, we consider an analytical framework which takes into account the close relationship between the CAC algorithms and the Scheduler algorithms and is applicable to each mode of operation and admission control paradigm specified by the standard. The long term objective of this work is to present a hybrid analytic and simulation model, based on the proposed framework, for modelling QoS metrics in 802. 16 networks...|$|E
