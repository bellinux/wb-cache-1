He later said in 1975, [...] "When I took my obligation {{as a master}} mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that I would ever {{be added to the}} company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States." [...] Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like that. I had a sense of foreboding about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> it as gonna be as bad as it was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E
500|$|The Powerpuff Girls series {{debut on}} November 18, 1998, {{was the highest}} rated premiere in Cartoon Network's history at the time. During its run, the series {{consistently}} scored the highest rating for an original series each week for the network across {{a wide range of}} demographics—from young children to adults. In October 2000, Cartoon Network credited the series for its Friday night prime time ratings win among cable networks. By the end of 2000, merchandising based on the series encompassed a whole variety of products, including T-shirts, toys, video games, lunchboxes, and dishware. Concerning the show's success, Craig McCracken has stated, [...] "I thought it would get on Cartoon Network and college kids would watch it and there would be a few random T-shirts out there in the rave scene or in record shops. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that it would take off to this extent." [...] Following the series' fourth season, the closing of Hanna-Barbera Productions and the death of its executive William Hanna in 2001, McCracken left it to focus on his new animated series, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, leaving Chris Savino to take his place and the production of The Powerpuff Girls was moved to Cartoon Network Studios. The show's last original run episode was on March 25, 2005; in all, six seasons were made. Cartoon Network had offered to give McCracken and Savino a seventh season of the series, but they believed the series had run its course.|$|E

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
