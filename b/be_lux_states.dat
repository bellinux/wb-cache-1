40|$|ABSTRACT An {{illumination}} room {{is needed}} by humans to recognize objects visually. Lighting has {{an influence on}} the function of a room. Therefore we need the lights as the main lighting source that can support the function room. Generally used for indoor lighting arrangements on-off principle. Lighting settings with on-off principle is based only on the condition of the light dark room, regardless of the contribution from the outside as the sun. This often resulted in inconvenience and inefficiency use of electrical energy. Therefore, adjustment is necessary lighting (illumination) generated light. Control principle used is fuzzy. Fuzzy inference system used in this room is the lighting controllers Sugeno method. The composition rules using the AND operator, while for the COG method is used defuzzyfication (Center of Gravity). As a main controller in the system using a microcontroller with input from the light sensor (LDR). The output of the controller then displayed on the LCD as a viewer and as an input the voltage regulator circuit. This system works in the room (in door) using the model of a house with three rooms as a model. From the simulation results with fuzzy control, if the setpoint of rooms 200 <b>lux</b> and <b>state</b> rooms <b>are</b> light at 80 lux, the light will produce light at 125 lux, if the setpoint 300 lux and 50 lux room condition, then lighting the lamp <b>is</b> 250 <b>lux,</b> and if the setpoint 150 lux and 30 lux room condition, then lighting the lamp <b>is</b> 125 <b>lux.</b> Keyword: Fuzzy controller, Illumination, Microcontroller...|$|R
