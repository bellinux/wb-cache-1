40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} potential pathogenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrheic hens and chickens originating from intensive <b>battery</b> <b>rearing</b> in North Algeria, {{the presence of}} a large range of virulence factors and markers was studied in 50 strains by DNA-DNA hybridization on colonies and phenotypic tests. The sequences we focused on were those coding for adhesins F 5, F 41, F 17, Pap, Afa, and Sfa; intimin Eae; and toxins STa, STb, LT 1, Stx 1, Stx 2, CNF 1, and CNF 2. The phenotypes explored were the colicins, aerobactin, hemolysins, and hemagglutinin production and serum resistance. The genotypic and phenotypic tests enabled us to categorize the isolates into two distinct groups: those with a potential to invade the host (27 strains were serum resistant and/or produced aerobactin), among which three strains were also potentially diarrheagenic, one strain was LT 1 + F 17 + Afa+ Pap+ (enterotoxigenic E. coli) and the two others were Stx 1 (verotoxigenic E. coli). Twenty-three strains were colicinogenic, including 19 strains producing colicin V. This latter factor was also detected in isolates negative for the other virulence factors. On the basis of the type of erythrocytes agglutinated, we established 14 mannose-resistant hemagglutination patterns among the 37 strains tested, including 22 serum-resistant and/or aerobactin producing strains and 15 strains negative for these two characters. None of the strains produced alpha hemolysin, whereas two strains produced beta hemolysin and enterohemolysin, respectively. Congo red fixation was observed in 25 strains. No relationship could be detected between Congo red fixation and the presence of other virulence markers, such as serum resistance and aerobactin production. This study shows that among isolates originating from the feces of diarrheic chickens, the proportion of potentially diarrheagenic E. coli strains is low. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were for comparing the effect of batteries and deep litter rearing systems of domesticated Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, on the concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc from the quail meat and offal in Ismailia, Egypt. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 quail meat and their offal samples were randomly collected from two main quail rearing systems: Battery (Group I) and deep litter system (Group II) for determination of concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. In addition, 80 water and feed samples were randomly collected from water and feeders of both systems in the Food Hygiene Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University for heavy metals determination. Results: The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in Group I were 0. 010, 0. 027, 1. 137, and 0. 516 ppm and for Group II were 0. 093, 0. 832, 0. 601, and 1. 651 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in quail feed in Group I were 1. 114, 1. 606, 5. 822, and 35. 11 ppm and for Group II were 3. 010, 2. 576, 5. 852, and 23. 616 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in quail meat for Group I were 0. 058, 5. 902, 10. 244, and 290 ppm and for Group II were 0. 086, 6. 092, 0. 136, and 1. 280 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc for liver samples in Group I were 0. 15, 8. 32, 1. 05, and 3. 41 ppm and for Group II were 0. 13, 8. 88, 0. 95, and 4. 21 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in kidney samples for the Group I were 0. 24, 4. 21, 1. 96, and 4. 03 ppm and for Group II were 0. 20, 5. 00, 1. 56, and 3. 78 ppm, respectively. Kidney had the highest concentration levels of heavy metals followed by liver then muscles. The highest concentration levels of copper were observed in liver samples. The order of the levels of these trace elements obtained from the four different quail organs is Ca > Pb > Zn > Cu. Lead and cadmium concentration levels in quail meat samples were exceeded the Egyptian standardization limits and suggesting a health threat from lead and cadmium to the quail consumers. Conclusion: <b>Battery</b> <b>rearing</b> system is more hygienic than deep litter system from the point of heavy metals pollution of water and feeds of quail. Feed samples from battery system had means concentration levels of lead not significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than those samples from deep litter system. Meanwhile, water samples from battery system had means concentration levels of cadmium, copper, and zinc significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than those samples from deep litter system. Quail may carry health risks to consumers...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 480 unsexed Bobwhite quail {{were used to}} {{determine}} if placement of feed and water relative to the heat source influenced body weight and mortality to 4 weeks of age. Body weights at 4 weeks of age were significantly lighter when water was located away from the heat source. Mortality and feed conversion were not influenced by placement of feed and water. POULTRY SCIENCE 53 : 1625 - 1627, 1974 UNEXPLAINED body weight gains and mortality in Bobwhite quail were en-countered in earlier experiments where birds were presumed to be receiving nutritionally adequate diets. Additionally, it was noted that not all the quail left the heat source to obtain feed and water. Bobwhite quail chill readily when first hatched and apparently exhibit torpor (Sturkie, 1965). This study was conducted to determine if the placement of the feed and water within the batteries would improve the management in <b>battery</b> <b>reared</b> quail and thus reduce the unexplained growth and mortality dif-ferences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{available}} energy of several poultry by-product meal products {{were determined by}} various experimental methods. It is imperative to determine the accurate {{available energy}} value for these products for proper diet formulation and product usage. Leghorn roosters and turkeys were tube fed the products for the assay based on the True Metabolizable Energy (TME) system. Three week old <b>battery</b> <b>reared</b> chicks and poults were fed each product as 50 % of a basal diet. The birds were fed for three days with total consumption and excreta measured. Apparent Metabolizable Energy (AME) was then calculated. Endogenous pens were included to make adjustments for AME. Lastly, ileal contents of the chicks and poults were collected to determine ileal AME. There were few differences in assay methodologies noted. Significantly different ME values among assay techniques were found in only four of 15 products. The variable nature of poultry by-product meal led to significant differences in mean ME values among products. There {{was no difference between}} pooled AME and TME values, or species. It appears that the TME values commonly determined with Leghorn roosters is acceptable for broilers and turkeys. An effort was made to develop an equation that could predict the TME value of a poultry by-product meal product given the proximate analysis and mineral composition. The first equation, using proximate and mineral data, was inadequate with an R = 0. 11. Adding 2 the gross energy as a predictor variable greatly improved the effectiveness of the prediction equation (R =...|$|R
