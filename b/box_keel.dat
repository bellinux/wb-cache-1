40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of a typical Australian omni-directional stem drive tug a series of physical model tests with systematically varied hull appendages have been carried out. Three hull configurations where tested, the first corresponds to the traditional stem drive hull, the second with significantly reduced skeg area aft and the third with reduced skeg area and the addition of a <b>box</b> <b>keel</b> from the stem to the aft end of the skeg. The latter being the intended configuration. The anticipated outcome of these changes Is to reduce negative thruster-hull interaction and to improve {{the performance of}} the tug at high speeds and in the so-called indirect mode where hull forces are used to supplement reduced thruster forces. The model experiments show that the changes move the centre of pressure of the sway force forward, towards the tow point, and increase both the sway force coefficient and the profile area making the sway force larger. As a result of this the performance of the tug in pushing and in the indirect mode at high speed have been significantly increased while performance in pulling direct has remained essentially unchanged. The experiments also show that there is reduced thruster hull interaction when pulling direct...|$|E

50|$|The <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle is a {{terrestrial}} species, {{and can be}} frequently {{found in}} small caves and rock crevices. It {{can also be found}} in forests, in deep layers of leaves.|$|R
50|$|Specimens of {{at least}} the {{northern}} and central Vietnamese taxa hybridize—apparently in the wild—with <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle males to produce the turtles once considered a separate species or subspecies, Cuora serrata.|$|R
50|$|<b>Keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtles are herbivorous, and eat wide {{variation}} of vegetation {{in the natural}} environment, with a preference for wild fallen fruits. They will also occasionally eat worms snails and other meat.|$|R
50|$|The male <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle is very {{aggressive}} during {{the act of}} mating. In some instances the male turtle will chase and injure a female. The male will often persist until the female allows its advances.|$|R
25|$|Numerous {{other species}} are farmed in smaller quantities. Among {{these is the}} rare golden coin turtle (Cuora trifasciata), {{fetching}} almost US$1,800 per turtle, as opposed to around $6.50 for a common Chinese softshell turtle, or $80 for a <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle (Cuora mouhotii) sold to pet trade, due to its rarity and purported medicinal value.|$|R
50|$|Asian {{box turtles}} are turtles {{of the genus}} Cuora in the family Geoemydidae. There are about 12 species. The <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle (Pyxidea mouhotii syn. Cuora mouhotii) is often {{included}} in this genus, or separated in the monotypic genus Pyxidea. Genus Cuora is distributed from China to Indonesia and the Philippines, throughout mainland south-east Asia and into northern India and Bhutan.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of the <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle {{has been on a}} steep decline in some areas, particularly Vietnam. This can be attributed to people capturing them for food and pets, as well as Vietnam legally exporting large numbers. Although there are other possible reasons behind this population decline, deforestation and hunting have proven to be a major threat to these turtles especially.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle's {{upper shell}} (carapace) has three large, raised ridges and is {{serrated}} {{on the back}} end. The lower shell (plastron) is different variations of brown in color, ranging from light brown to dark brown. The upper jaw is strong, while the snout is short and curved. The feet are only partially webbed, which suggest a terrestrial lifestyle {{as opposed to an}} aquatic one.|$|R
50|$|A Swordfish hull was {{obtained}} from Fairey Marine via a local boat builder. They modified the hull moving {{the position of the}} mast, cutting a slot and fitting a <b>keel</b> <b>box.</b> Several members of the Locks Sailing club were interested in this project and formed a committee with Fairey Marine, resulting in the 'committee modified Swordfish'. This was renamed the 'Albacore'. The committee agreed that this boat be allocated Albacore number 1.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is in May through September. The average clutch size was four eggs, which are smooth, white, and about 4.4 cm long. On average they typically lay two clutches in a {{breeding season}}. Like many other turtles the <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle {{does not care}} for its young. Females have been noted to dig nests with their rear legs and cover the clutches with soil, and also to lay eggs under fallen leaves.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001 {{the event}} was renamed the Volvo Ocean Race. The Farr Yacht Design-designed Illbruck Challenge was victorious in 2002. However, Farr's Volvo Ocean Race boats fared less well in 2006 as all four of his designs {{experienced}} problems after various failures in their Farr-designed keel canting mechanisms, including an abandonment of the yacht Movistar which was unable to prevent {{the flow of water}} through the <b>keel</b> <b>box</b> and, to this day, lies on the ocean floor, unrecovered.|$|R
5000|$|C. mouhotii is {{sometimes}} treated {{as the sole}} species of the monotypic genus Pyxidea. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA has provided evidence that the species {{is part of the}} [...] "Cuora group", a monophyletic group of Asian box turtles, and the name Pyxidea should probably be synonymized with Cuora, making the <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle part of that genus. Other phylogenetic studies of Cuora support this conclusion. In addition, its morphology is not distinct enough from that of Cuora species to keep it separate, and it is known to hybridize with Cuora galbinifrons.|$|R
500|$|The Aquarium {{is working}} to {{conserve}} endangered Asian turtle species through captive breeding. [...] Since 2011, its scientists have coordinated species survival plans for four turtle species, the <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle, the endangered spiny turtle, the endangered four-eyed turtle, and the critically endangered Arakan forest turtle. [...] It is the only accredited zoo or aquarium in the United States to hatch another critically endangered southeast Asian species, the Beal's eyed turtle. [...] The Aquarium's collection of these turtles, which reached 20 individuals by 2015, has grown large enough to provide founding individuals for populations at other institutions, beginning with the Knoxville Zoo.|$|R
5000|$|Cuora serrata, {{originally}} {{described as}} Cuora galbinifrons serrata by Iverson & Mccord (1992) and later considered a distinct species by Obst & Fritz (1997) are hybrids {{as shown by}} the genetic studies of Stuart & Parham (2004). These hybrids are bred in the wild (evolution in progress) as mentioned Buskirk et al. (2005) ad documented {{for the first time in}} the wild by Shi et al. (2005), but not in captivity as [...] "novelty" [...] pets as suggested by Parham et al. (2001) and Stuart & Parham (2004), between the <b>Keeled</b> <b>Box</b> Turtle and taxa of the Indochinese Box Turtle complex. Unnamed hybrids of several other Cuora taxa are also known, as are intergeneric hybrids like Mauremys iversoni (Pritchard & Mccord, 1991), a hybrid between Cuora trifasciata and Mauremys mutica which are intentionally produced in Chinese turtle farms, see Parham et al. (2001).|$|R
50|$|Asia has a rich reptile fauna. Earless monitor lizards, snakes of the {{families}} Uropeltidae, Acrochordidae and Xenopeltidae and gavials are endemic to Asia. The crocodiles include mugger crocodile, gharial, false gharial and saltwater crocodile. The more common of the numerous snakes are pipe snakes (Melanophidium, Plectrurus, Rhinophis, Uropeltis), sea snakes, Elapids (king cobra, Bungarus, Calliophis, Naja, Walterinnesia), vipers (Azemiops, Daboia, Dendrelaphis, Echis, Hypnale, Protobothrops, Trimeresurus, Ovophis, Pseudocerastes, Gloydius etc.), colubrids (Achalinus, Amphiesma, Boiga, Calamaria, Cerberus, Coluber, Enhydris, Lycodon, Oligodon, Opisthotropis, Rhabdophis, Pareas, Psammophis, Ptyas, Sibynophis, Spalerosophis, Trachischium etc.) and blind snakes. The lizards include geckos (Agamura, Alsophylax, Asaccus, Calodactylodes, Cyrtodactylus, Chondrodactylus, Cnemaspis, Cyrtopodion, Dixonius, Gehyra, Gekko, Gonydactylus, Hemidactylus, Hemiphyllodactylus, Lepidodactylus, Luperosaurus, Perochirus, Pristurus, Teratolepis, etc.), Xenosauridae (Shinisaurus), monitor lizards, skinks. There are also about 100 species of turtles and tortoises (Russian tortoise, <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle, Batagur, Aspideretes, Chinemys, Chitra, Cistoclemmys, Cuora, Geochelone, Heosemys, Indotestudo, Mauremys, Ocadia, Pangshura, Pelochelys, Rafetus, Sacalia etc.).

40|$|We studied {{reproduction}} and nesting of the <b>keeled</b> <b>box</b> turtle (Cuora mouhotii) during 2003 and 2009 on Hainan Island, China. We {{found the first}} gravid turtle on 28 April and nesting was from May until July, with a peak in mid-June. We observed the first fresh nest on 1 June and last fresh nest on 27 July. Some females laid eggs from 1 clutch in 2 batches. Clutch size ranged from 1 to 5. Mean egg measurements were as follows: length, 4. 5 cm; width, 2. 7 cm; and mass, 19. 8 g. There was no significant relationship between turtle body size (mass, length, height, and width) and clutch size or egg size (mass, length, and width). Clutch size was significantly correlated with the egg mass and egg width. Possible low fertility, low hatching rate, and the long period to reach maturity imply that C. mouhotii has a low intrinsic rate of population increase. This, combined with overcollecting and habitat destruction, requires development of more effective conservation strategies for this endangered species.
