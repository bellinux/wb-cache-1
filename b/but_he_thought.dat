5|$|The Hollywood Reporter critic Jay A. Fernandez {{said that}} Never Let Me Go was an {{engaging}} film, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that its overall impact {{was not as}} emotionally devastating as the book. Cleveland Magazines Clint O'Connor strongly approved the acting performance of Garfield, and Eric Kohn from IndieWire praised the script and the photography of Kimmel and Garland.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his {{best course of action}} would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and {{he added that the}} game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

5|$|Three {{months later}} royalist general Pío Tristán {{advanced}} {{in the north}} with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus {{of the city of}} Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, still much less than the 3,000 at Tristan's command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán. By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution, but failed to do so because of political disputes between the members. It did not take measures regarding the national flag, but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.|$|E

25|$|The new premier, Alexander Stuart, offered Reid the {{position}} of Colonial Treasurer in January 1883, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it wiser to accept the junior office of Minister for Public Instruction.

25|$|After {{only a few}} matches, Colley was {{replaced}} with Barry Darsow in a match aired on the February 14, 1987 edition of Superstars. In an RF Video shoot interview with Eadie and Darsow, Eadie said that Colley {{was replaced}} {{because he was too}} recognizable to the fans as the man who previously performed as Moondog Rex. The WWF pitched a few potential replacements to Eadie, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> fans would recognize the suggested replacements. However, Eadie felt that many WWF fans would not recognize Darsow, who had been working for Jim Crockett Promotions as Krusher Khruschev alongside Nikita Koloff. Darsow had left Crockett following a dispute in order to take over the role of Smash.|$|E
25|$|McQueen {{developed}} a persistent cough in 1978. He gave up cigarettes and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. Shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after filming The Hunter, a biopsy revealed pleural mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure {{for which there}} is no known cure. A few months later, McQueen gave a medical interview in which he blamed his condition on asbestos exposure. McQueen believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers' protective suits and helmets could have been involved, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging from pipes aboard a troop ship while in the Marines.|$|E

25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E

500|$|Josiah Royce (1855–1916) {{built on}} the {{transcendental}} idealism view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. <b>But,</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> this was only true insofar as our conscience also required loyalty to [...] "a mysterious higher or deeper self." ...|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline {{believed}} that Hergé's drawing became more assured throughout {{the first version}} of the story without losing any of its spontaneity. He thought that the story began in [...] "the most inoffensive way", and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a Boy Scout, something he argued reflected Hergé's [...] "moral debt" [...] to Wallez. Biographer Benoît Peeters opined that Tintin in the Congo was [...] "nothing spectacular", with some [...] "incredibly cumbersome" [...] monologues, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the illustrations [...] "a bit more polished" [...] than those in Land of the Soviets. Believing the plot to be [...] "extremely simple", he thought that Tintin's character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Wales {{had a more}} mixed {{opinion about}} the episode, rating it a [...] "good" [...] 7 out of 10. He {{considered}} it imaginative with [...] "more brilliant ideas...than most other shows can muster in an entire season", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the episode [...] "never quite brought its cacophony of ideas {{together to form a}} satisfying whole", and the conclusion [...] "failed to resonate effectively against the hodgepodge of insane ideas and action". Because of the large amount of ideas, Wales also pointed out that the characterisation was [...] "scant", especially on Liz 10 and the Smilers. However, he praised Smith's and Gillan's chemistry and Moffat's [...] "crackling dialogue". In February 2013, Moffat cited [...] "The Beast Below" [...] as his least-favourite among the episodes he wrote, describing it as [...] "a bit of a mess".|$|E

500|$|In May 1925 the Oxford {{production}} of The Cherry Orchard {{was brought to}} the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Gielgud again played Trofimov. His distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for BBC Radio, which his biographer Sheridan Morley calls [...] "a medium he made his own for seventy years." [...] In the same year Noël Coward chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play The Vortex. For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward's role of Nicky Lancaster, the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother. It was in Gielgud's words [...] "a highly-strung, nervous, hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion." [...] He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it [...] "a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Wheeler {{spoke to}} the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), asking it to expel parapsychology, which had been {{admitted}} ten years earlier {{at the request of}} Margaret Mead. He called it a pseudoscience, saying he did not oppose earnest research into the questions, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the [...] "air of legitimacy" [...] of being an AAAS-Affiliate should be reserved until convincing tests of at least a few so-called psi effects could be demonstrated. In the question and answer period following his presentation [...] "Not consciousness, but the distinction between the probe and the probed, as central to the elemental quantum act of observation", Wheeler incorrectly stated that J. B. Rhine had committed fraud as a student, for which he apologized in a subsequent letter to the journal Science. [...] His request was turned down and the Parapsychological Association remained a member of the AAAS.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} average critical reviews. Simon Brew {{of science}} fiction blog Den of Geek said the episode was [...] "by turns ambitious and predictable" [...] but [...] "still quite entertaining". The {{first part of the}} review mentioned an objection from his wife that the bus trapped in the sand [...] " [...] really fake", despite the episode being actually filmed in Dubai, and then mentioned Brew's appreciation of the concept of people stranded in the desert and concluded that [...] "made a fair fist of it". Brew positively reviewed Michelle Ryan's performance—comparing her performance to be on par to her role in Bionic Woman rather than her role as Zoe Slater in EastEnders—and Lee Evans' performance as Malcolm Taylor, calling him the highlight of the episode because of his dialogue. He closed his review by saying that [...] "'Planet of the Dead' was passable enough": he thought it [...] "never really gelled" [...] for him; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it was overall entertaining and was excited ...|$|E
