50|$|Along with <b>bonding</b> <b>type</b> and atomic radii, {{metallic}} crystalline {{structures are}} also {{dependent on a}} quantum-mechanical mechanism. Unlike other crystals, in a metallically bonded solid, the electrons move freely throughout the solid, which are held in the solid by their attraction to the positively charged nuclei. A Schrödinger equation is used to display the wave function of electrons, which {{is dependent on the}} quantum numbers n and l, along with a constant, the Bohr radius, and the distance of the electrons from an ion core. It can also be shown from the probability density of an electron, that the electrons in a metallic solid are generally closer to the ionic cores than they were as individual atoms. This causes a decrease in the potential energy of the electrons. However, the assembly of the solid structure also confines the electrons to a smaller space than that in which they normally operate. This results in an increase in the kinetic energy of the electrons. The stability of the structure {{is a result of the}} fact that the decrease in potential energy is much more drastic than the increase in kinetic energy. The larger the atomic radius of an atom, the greater the decrease in potential energy will be when the metal solid is formed. Also, the fewer valence electrons an atom has, the smaller the increase in kinetic energy will be. Together these trends explain the observation that elements to the left and lower down the periodic table are more likely to be metals.|$|E

The physical-chemical brittleness nature of materials with covalent <b>bonding</b> <b>type</b> has been determined; it consists in the adsorption of the harmful introduction impurities, mainly gas ones, over grain and subgrain boundaries.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{improvement is}} {{introduced into the}} description of the bonding types of mixtures NiSnut, PdSnui, and PtSnM by considering the <b>bonding</b> <b>type</b> rules of confluence, collectivity, and spin compensation. The number of bonding figures has decreased to two in each mixture, namely to FU 2 of Pt, Pd, Ni and FB 2 C 4 of Sn. The stability of the FB 2 C 4 figure with increasing valence electron concentration always begins in the NiAs homeo- type. While the structures at lower valence electron concentrations are ho- meotypes of close packings, the structures at higher valence electron concentrations exhibit an anionic partial structure into which the A 10 atoms are inserted.
