5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} <b>body</b> <b>wash</b> after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E

40|$|National {{guidelines}} do {{not support}} preoperative <b>body</b> <b>washing</b> to reduce surgical site infections, instead recommending bathing or showering with soap. Yet preoperative <b>body</b> <b>washing</b> continues to be widely used in many hospitals across Europe. This paper suggests that existing trials of preoperative <b>body</b> <b>washing,</b> upon which guidelines are based, are dated and proposes a new investigation of preoperative <b>body</b> <b>washing</b> using modern definitions of surgical site infection with standardised patient follow up, modern surgical techniques and well designed trials. This paper provides a critique of existing guidelines and describes a randomised trial with 60 participants to compare the effect of soap and two antiseptic washing products on colony forming units (CFUs) {{for up to six}} hours. Chlorhexidine gluconate and octenidine were significantly more effective than soap in reducing CFUs in the underarm, and chlorhexidine was significantly more effective than soap in reducing CFUs in the groin. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effect of contingent food deliveries on grooming movements in rats. The grooming sequence was divided into three topographically distinct behaviors: paw washing, face <b>washing,</b> and <b>body</b> <b>washing.</b> The first experiment found that rates of paw <b>washing</b> and <b>body</b> <b>washing</b> increased reliably under a food contingency, but face washing did not. A second experiment replicated these findings, and, in addition, showed that the average duration of paw <b>washing</b> and <b>body</b> <b>washing</b> decreased in length when followed by food. Placing a contingency on face washing, however, produced {{an increase in the}} rate of paw washing but no increase in face washing. It was concluded that, on the one hand, paw <b>washing</b> and <b>body</b> <b>washing</b> may be influenced by operant contingencies {{in the same way as}} behaviors such as lever pressing. On the other hand, increases in paw washing under the face washing contingency suggested that increases in the rate of grooming movements may occur by means other than operant relations...|$|R
