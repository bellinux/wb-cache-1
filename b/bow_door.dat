25|$|The {{first sign}} of trouble aboard Estonia was when a {{metallic}} bang was heard, caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was {{on the outskirts of}} the Turku archipelago, but an inspection—limited to checking the indicator lights for the ramp and visor—showed no problems. Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew. At about 01:15, the visor in which the ship's <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> opened separated, and the ship immediately took on a heavy starboard list (initial 30 to 40 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck. Estonia was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was also}} {{interesting}} {{in its use}} of ro-ro for the Trans Tasman route. The cargo did not necessarily just contain truck and trailer units, but was also cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotorua was built with a large angled stern ramp that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf {{without the need for}} a specialist linkspan as required by most ro-ro ships. She also had a <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> which could be used if a linkspan was present in a port, thus allowing cargo to be worked both forward and aft speeding up turn around time.|$|E
2500|$|The wreck was {{examined}} and videotaped by remotely operated underwater vehicles and by divers from a Norwegian company, Rockwater A/S, contracted {{for the investigation}} work. The official report indicated that the locks on the <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> had failed from the strain of the waves and the door had separated {{from the rest of}} the vessel, pulling the ramp behind it ajar. The bow visor and ramp had been torn off at points that would not trigger an [...] "open" [...] or [...] "unlatched" [...] warning on the bridge, as is the case in normal operation or failure of the latches. The bridge was also situated too far back on the ferry for the visor to be seen from there. While there was video monitoring of the inner ramp, the monitor on the bridge was not visible from the conning station. The bow visor was under-designed, as manufacturing and approval process did not consider the visor and its attachments as critical items regarding ship safety. The first metallic bang was believed to have been the sound of the visor's lower locking mechanism failing, and subsequent noises were the visor 'flapping' against the hull as the other locks failed, before tearing free and exposing the bow ramp. The subsequent failure of the bow ramp allowed water into the vehicle deck, which was identified as the main cause of the capsizing and sinking: RORO ferries with their wide vehicle decks are particularly vulnerable to capsizing if the car deck is even slightly flooded because of free surface effect: the fluid's swirling motion across such a large area hampers the boat's ability to right itself after rolling with a wave.|$|E
5000|$|A public Court of Inquiry {{into the}} {{incident}} was held under British judge Lord Justice Barry Sheen in 1987.It found the sinking was caused by three main factors—Stanley's failure to close the <b>bow</b> <b>doors,</b> Sabel's failure {{to make sure the}} <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> were closed, and Lewry leaving port without knowing whether the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> were closed. While the court determined the immediate cause of the sinking was Stanley's failure to close the <b>bow</b> <b>doors,</b> it was very critical of Sabel for not being in a position to prevent the disaster, calling his actions [...] "the most immediate" [...] cause of the sinking.|$|R
5000|$|Never {{far from}} controversy, Ridley had to apologise {{following}} the Herald of Free Enterprise Disaster in 1987, for remarking {{that he would}} not be pursuing a particular policy [...] "with the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> open". The ship had capsized, with loss of 193 lives, as a result of sailing with its <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> open.|$|R

50|$|In a <b>bow</b> visor <b>door,</b> {{the forces}} {{acting on the}} door from {{the impact of the}} waves are absorbed by the hinges and locks which may fail. With clam doors, the forces of the waves are absorbed by the {{surrounding}} bow superstructure. Furthermore, on seagoing vessels there should be inner <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> or 'collision bulkhead doors' in place behind the loading ramp. These doors are an upper extension of the collision bulkhead and act as a secondary barrier against water entering the car deck, should the primary <b>bow</b> <b>door(s)</b> fail.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{factor that}} contributed to the {{capsizing}} was the [...] "squat effect". When a vessel is under way, the movement under it creates low pressure, which has the effect of increasing the vessel's draught. In deep water the effect is small but in shallow water it is greater, because as the water passes underneath it moves faster and causes the draught to increase. This reduced the clearance between the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> and water line to between 1.5 m and 1.9 m. After extensive tests, the investigators found that when the ship travelled at a speed of 18 kn, the wave was enough to engulf the <b>bow</b> <b>doors.</b> This caused a [...] "step change": if the ship had been sailing at less than 18 knots and not in shallow water, people on the car deck would probably have had time to notice the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> were open and close them.|$|R
50|$|In October 1983, Herald of Free Enterprises {{sister ship}} Pride of Free Enterprise had sailed from Dover to Zeebrugge with the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> open, after her {{assistant}} boatswain fell asleep.It was therefore believed that leaving the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> open alone {{should not have}} caused the ship to capsize. However, tests by the Danish Maritime Institute after the accident found that once water began to enter the vehicle deck of a RORO, it was likely that the vessel would capsize within 30 minutes, while other tests showed {{that the lack of}} watertight subdivision common on other vessels allowed the weight of water to flow freely and increase the likelihood of capsizing.|$|R

50|$|In December 2000, her bow ramp {{collapsed}} {{while at}} sea. Following this, the MCA required a secondary door to be fitted behind the <b>bow</b> <b>door.</b> A bid {{by the council}} for money to replace her was unsuccessful.. A new bow ramp was fitted in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Swift was {{designed}} to allow quick turnarounds at port. It {{is equipped with a}} <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> which allows vehicles to drive on at either end and drive straight off {{at the end of the}} journey. The vessel was able to use existing terminal facilities in both ports.|$|E
50|$|The {{ships were}} {{constructed}} by Schichau-Unterweser AG in Bremerhaven, Germany. Propulsive power was {{by means of}} three 8000bhp 12-cylinder Sulzer medium-speed diesel engines driving variable-pitch propellers. The vehicle deck <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> were constructed by Cargospeed, Glasgow, Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 March 1987, {{the ferry}} Herald of Free Enterprise (owned by Townsend-Thoresen) was {{just outside the}} port when it took on water due to the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> {{remaining}} open, became unstable and capsized, killing 189 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{had both}} <b>bow</b> and stern <b>doors</b> leading onto the main vehicle deck, making them roll-on/roll-off, {{combined}} with ramps {{that led to}} upper and lower vehicle decks. Thanks to their shallow draught, they could beach themselves and use the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> for speedy unloading of troops and equipment. The ships also had helicopter decks on both the upper vehicle deck and behind the superstructure.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, seven LSTs of the De Soto County-class were constructed. These were an {{improved}} version over earlier LSTs, {{with a high}} degree of habitability for the crew and embarked troops. Considered the [...] "ultimate" [...] design attainable with the traditional LST <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> configuration, they were capable of 17.5 kn.|$|E
50|$|Equipment failure {{caused the}} {{shipwreck}} of cruiseferry Estonia in 1994. The stress of stormy seas on hull and bow especially caused the bow visor to break off, in turn tearing the watertight <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> open and letting seawater flow onto the car deck. She capsized with tragic consequences. Failure of pumps {{can lead to}} the loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire.|$|E
50|$|The mammoth eight-engine {{design was}} {{intended}} {{for use as a}} military transport, with a large <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> admitting vehicles and bulky freight to the upper deck. It was also designed for use as a long-range bomber, flying tanker, aerial minelayer and U-boat supply vessel. By 1943, it was realized that long-range flying boats were not needed due to the worsening war situation, and the Do 214 project was canceled.|$|E

50|$|Following the war, LST-568 {{performed}} occupation {{duty in the}} Far East. She {{was caught}} in a typhoon off Ulithi Atoll on 15 September 1945, during which winds reached 120 kn; near the eye of the storm, LST-568 was badly damaged, losing her <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> and suffering flooding.|$|R
5000|$|Finlaggan is of ro-ro {{design with}} {{bow and stern}} ramps. She is the first CalMac ship to have [...] "clam shell" [...] <b>bow</b> <b>doors,</b> that open sideways. The car deck is {{partially}} open at the stern and has a mezzanine deck capable of taking an additional 18 cars.|$|R
50|$|On 18 August 2008 {{the ship}} {{experienced}} problems opening the <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> in Santander for cars to be off-loaded. As {{a result of}} this the ship had to re-dock, aft into the port first, and the vehicles had to reverse off. This led to further delays and the problem was not fixed before the next crossing to Plymouth later that day; meaning that vehicles had to reverse or make a U-turn to disembark.|$|E
50|$|Antrim Princess {{was built}} by Hawthorn Leslie & Co. at Hebburn-on-Tyne in 1967. The ship was notable as being British Rail's first {{seagoing}} ship to be fitted with a <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> and therefore, was the very first Sealink drive-through ferry. She also broke with the Company's long tradition of using steam turbine propulsion for its channel vessels, a move that introduced the funnel design that was to become synonymous with British Rail and later Sealink ferries.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Toll NZ {{bought out}} Tranz Rail, and the Interisland Line was renamed the Interislander. Both ships were repainted {{in a new}} livery, with a fern {{replacing}} Pelorus Jack on the funnel - {{he moved to the}} hull with the logo. In 2005, Toll leased Challenger, which in 2007 was renamed [...] Kaitaki was the first Interislander ferry without a rail deck, and the first with a <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> (all the other ferries were stern boarding).|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} other sinkings {{involving}} roll-on roll-off ferries e.g. the [...] and [...] (which both sank in storms they should have survived), {{as well as the}} [...] (which capsized due to water ingress into the car deck through the <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> inadvertently left open when the vessel was under way).|$|R
25|$|On 6 March 1987, the Townsend-Thoresen branded {{car ferry}} Herald of Free Enterprise capsized just outside Zeebrugge's harbour about 25 minutes after departure. A {{subsequent}} inquiry {{determined that the}} ship's <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> had been left open allowing water to get onto the car deck. 193 people {{died as a result}} of the sinking.|$|R
50|$|On 10 March 2006 {{the ship}} made {{national}} headlines when she {{collided with the}} linkspan in Southampton, causing significant damage to the ferry's 'Southampton Side' <b>Bow</b> <b>doors.</b> Vehicles, including an Ambulance carrying a patient (Who was evacuated by dinghy) had to remain onboard for over eight hours while engineers forced the door open.|$|R
50|$|Floating drydocks, of {{this and}} other types, were capable of {{flooding}} themselves, opening up a <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> to permit a damaged vessel to enter. Once the damaged vessel was {{within the bounds of}} the floating drydock, and the door was closed, the water was pumped out of the floating drydock, permitting repair work to be performed on the damaged vessel. Such work in battle areas was often of a temporary nature, primarily to return the damaged vessel to seaworthy condition.|$|E
50|$|The Army and RAN {{disagreed}} on {{aspects of}} the Landing Ship Medium Mark II's design. Unlike other contemporary designs, it was planned that the ship would not carry smaller landing craft, but rather discharge her cargo via a ramp fitted to her bow. While the Army wanted the ship to have a <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> to enable her to be beached, the navy preferred a fully sealed bow {{so that she could}} make 20 kn and sail in convoys. These differing views were not resolved, and the design team experienced problems meeting the Army's requirements.|$|E
50|$|USS Sumter (LST-1181) was {{the third}} ship of the twenty ship , which {{replaced}} the traditional <b>bow</b> <b>door</b> design LST. Two derrick arms support a 30 short ton t capacity, 112 ft long bow ramp for the unloading of tanks and other vehicles ashore, additionally, amphibious vehicles can be launched from the tank deck via the ships stern gate and the ships flight deck can accommodate most Navy helicopter types. A between-decks ramp allows easy access from the tank deck to the main deck to off-load all equipment from the bow.|$|E

She had further problems with her <b>bow</b> <b>doors,</b> requiring withdrawal from service for overhaul of her hydraulic systems in Birkenhead.|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas Ridley, a {{government}} minister at the time, was criticised for {{alluding to the}} accident (while speaking on another subject) on 10 March 1987. He {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "although he is the pilot of the parliamentary Bill, he has not got his <b>bow</b> <b>doors</b> open". He apologised for the remark.|$|R
