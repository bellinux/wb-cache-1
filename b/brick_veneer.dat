A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a <b>brick</b> <b>veneer,</b> has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the rigidity of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the {{population}} of Minneapolis was growing rapidly, increasing 351 percent from 1880 to 1890. With {{the number of people}} moving into the city, lower-cost housing was needed for immigrants who were new to Minnesota. [...] The street had originally been platted as an alley between 22nd and 23rd Avenues South, but William Ragan developed it as a street and labeled it 22½ Avenue. [...] The houses were situated close together on narrow lots, with very narrow side yards and no front yards. [...] This almost gives the impression of rowhouses. [...] Most of the houses were built with <b>brick</b> <b>veneer</b> on timber frames, and they have uniform-sized roof slopes, modified flat arch windows, and open front porches.|$|E

2500|$|At Los Angeles High School ( [...] from Pacoima Dam) {{where the}} {{exterior}} {{walls of the}} main pre-Field Act building (constructed 1917) were unreinforced brick masonry, long portions of the parapet and the associated <b>brick</b> <b>veneer</b> broke off and some fragments fell through the roof to a lower floor, while other material landed on an exit stairway and into a courtyard area. The main building was demolished {{at a cost of}} $127,000, and none of the various post-Field Act buildings were damaged at the site. Except for the concrete gymnasium, all of the buildings at Sylmar High School ( [...] from Pacoima Dam) were post-Field Act, one-story, wood construction. Abundant cracks formed in the ground at the site, and some foundations and many sidewalks were also cracked. The estimate for repairs at the site was $485,000. At , Hubbard Street Elementary School was the closest school to Pacoima dam, and was also {{less than a mile from}} the Veterans Hospital complex. The wood frame buildings (classrooms, a multipurpose building, and some bungalows) were built after the Field Act, and damage and cleanup costs there totaled $42,000. Gas lines were broken and separation of the buildings' porches was due to lateral displacement of up to six inches.|$|E

50|$|A masonry veneer wall {{consists}} of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed {{on one or}} {{both sides of a}} structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry. In this context the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The <b>brick</b> <b>veneer</b> is generally connected to the structural wall by brick ties (metal strips that are attached to the structural wall, as well as the mortar joints of the <b>brick</b> <b>veneer).</b> There is typically an air gap between the <b>brick</b> <b>veneer</b> and the structural wall. As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the structural wall will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and weep holes can be left {{at the base of the}} <b>brick</b> <b>veneer</b> to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.|$|E

The residence shares the setback as the summer cottages but lacks the raised first floor and wrap- around porch featured on the summer cottages (photos 1 and 2)." ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{earthquakes}} struck {{close to}} Christchurch city in New Zealand generating high level ground excitations that caused severe geotechnical effects and widespread structural damage.

Light timber framed construction performed well for life safety {{but there were a}} large number seriously damaged, heavy masonry caused significant problems when inadequately reinforced. Changes to the construction standards are needed to improve foundation requirements and lateral wall bracing. Earth building damage to modern houses is discussed in reference to the New Zealand Earth Building Standards, and particularly the non-specific design clauses which specify a consistent reinforcing approach.

40|$|Wells, Nevada {{had about}} 80 {{commercial}} and government buildings that {{were subjected to}} shaking from the 2008 Wells earthquake, a magnitude 6 event within 9 km of town. Over half of the nonresidential buildings were damaged (42 +), 17 of these had major damage. Modern construction performed well, although all buildings in Wells had some cracks from being rocked back-and-forth strongly. The worst damage was to buildings in the historical district of Wells, {{many of which were}} unoccupied and were poorly maintained. One building collapsed and three buildings were partially collapsed by the earthquake; these were two-story buildings, except in one case, where the collapse may have been caused by debris falling from a two-story building. Fifteen buildings lost sections of parapets and/or walls. Most of the severely damaged buildings were unreinforced masonry bearing-wall buildings (URMs), but there were also damaged wood-frame buildings with unreinforced <b>brick</b> <b>veneers</b> and walls. Twelve of the 16 unreinforced brick buildings in the Wells historical district had major damage. Several buildings in other parts of Wells also had significant damage, most notably the City Hall, City Shop and high school buildings. A particularly damaging component of unreinforced masonry walls was the crowning, concrete bond beam on the top of most URM walls. In many cases, the upper parts of these walls were only two wythes wide (two bricks wide). When these crowning bond beams destabilized and fell, they came down in larger pieces than the bricks of the wall. In one cas...|$|R
