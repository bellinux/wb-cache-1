50|$|Streptomyces griseoflavus is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from garden soil. Streptomyces griseoflavus produces <b>bicozamycin,</b> colabomycins A, colabomycins C, germacradienol and hormaomycin.|$|E
50|$|Bicyclomycin (<b>Bicozamycin)</b> {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} antibiotic active against Gram-negative bacteria and the Gram-positive bacterium, Micrococcus luteusn that was isolated from Streptomyces sapporonesis and Streptomyces aizumenses in 1972. It belongs to a class of naturally occurring 2,5-diketopiperazines, that {{are among the most}} numerous of all the naturally occurring peptide antibiotics.This clinically useful antibiotic is rapidly absorbed in man when given intramuscularly, has low toxicity and has been used to treat diarrhea in humans and bacterial diarrhea in calves and pigs.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>bicozamycin,</b> a poorly absorbable antibiotic, {{in the treatment}} of acute diarrhea was assessed in a prospective, double-blind study of 140 adults from the United States visiting Guadalajara, Mexico. Patients randomly received <b>bicozamycin</b> (500 mg orally four times daily) or placebo for 3 days. The mean duration of illness was shorter in the <b>bicozamycin</b> than the placebo treatment groups for patients with diarrhea due to Shigella (37 versus 90 hours; p = 0. 01), toxigenic Escherichia coli (31 versus 60 hours; p = 0. 003), and unknown pathogens (18 versus 41 hours; p = 0. 02). Cramps were significantly relieved by <b>bicozamycin</b> in all patients. Treatment failed in significantly fewer patients treated with <b>bicozamycin</b> than those treated with placebo when diarrhea was associated with Shigella, Salmonella or toxigenic E. coli. <b>Bicozamycin</b> was well tolerated and appears to be effective therapy for acute travelers' diarrhea of diverse causes. These data show the value of an antibiotic in the therapy of toxigenic E. coli infection and indicate a need to reevaluate the clinical dictum that nonabsorbable antibiotics are ineffective against invasive enteropathogens. <b>BICOZAMYCIN</b> was first described in 1972 by Miyoshi and associates (1). Less than 3 % of the antibiotic is ab-sorbed after oral administration (2). The primary action of <b>bicozamycin,</b> as studied in Escherichia coli, appears to be interference with biosynthesis of lipoprotein and as-sembly to peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall (3). The antimicrobial spectrum of biocozamycin includes many aerobic gram-negative bacilli and most enteropa-thogens such as Shigella, Salmonella, and E. coli; howev-er, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and gram-positive organisms seem to be resistant to <b>bicozamycin</b> (4). Oral bicozamy-cin {{has been shown to be}} much more effective than oral kanamycin against shigellosis in Rhesus monkeys (5).

40|$|During a {{therapeutic}} trial of <b>bicozamycin</b> (BI) for traveler's diarrhea, aerobically grown, gram-negative bacteria, predominantly Escherichia coli, were decreased by 2 to 3 logs per g of stool; {{the number of}} BI-resistant gram-negative bacteria did not increase. Resistant species were most often Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Morganella morganii, and few BI-resistant E. coli strains were isolated. Cross-resistance between BI and other antimicrobial agents was not found. Resistance to BI could not be transferred or mobilized to an E. coli K- 12 recipient...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of Gram positive anaerobic cocci on plain cotton wool and albumin coated swabs held in various transport media was investigated. Results suggested {{that in most}} cases Amies', Stuart's and VMGII media do not offer any more protection to the bacteria than storing swabs dry in their containers. A technique was developed for the isolation and identification of Gram positive anaerobic cocci from the mouth and vagina, incorporating <b>bicozamycin</b> in the medium as a selective agent. Few strains were recovered from the oral cavity, but larger numbers were isolated from the vagina. Using a minimum number of antibiotic sensitivity and biochemical tests, including analysis of end products by gas-liquid chromatography, most isolates were identified to species level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{total of}} 518 fecal samples {{collected}} from 183 apparently healthy cattle, 180 pigs and 155 broilers throughout Japan in 1999 were examined {{to determine the}} prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella. The isolation rates were 36. 1 % in broilers, 2. 8 % in pigs and 0. 5 % in cattle. S. enterica Infantis was the most frequent isolate, found in 22. 6 % of broiler fecal samples. Higher resistance rates were observed against oxytetracycline (82. 0 %), dihydrostreptomycin (77. 9 %), kanamycin (41. 0 %) and trimethoprim (35. 2 %). Resistance rates to ampicillin, ceftiofur, <b>bicozamycin,</b> chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid were S. enterica Senftenberg {{was found in the}} isolates obtained from one broiler fecal sample.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} susceptibilities of 50 strains of Salmonella spp., 80 strains of Shigella spp., and 50 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 14 Yersinia enterocolitica, 6 Aeromonas hydrophila, 4 Plesiomonas shigelloides, 9 Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 30 Campylobacter jejuni strains that were {{recently}} isolated from worldwide sources were determined for 10 antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial agents tested included ampicillin, <b>bicozamycin,</b> doxycycline, enoxacin (CI- 919), erythromycin, furazolidone, amdinocillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ampicillin resistance occurred frequently in strains of Salmonella and Shigella spp. and enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. The most active agents against {{all of the}} bacteria tested were enoxacin and norfloxacin. Furazolidone and amdinocillin were also highly active against the majority of strains. Trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were inhibitory at low concentrations against all test except C. jejuni isolates. The in vitro {{results of this study}} confirm the high prevalence of bacterial resistance to ampicillin. However, this work also identifies four antimicrobial agents, enoxacin, furazolidone, norfloxacin, and amdinocillin, that would be appropriate for further testing in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the use of poorly absorbed antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} traveler’s diarrhea. Poorly absorbed oral antibiotics can deliver high concentrations of drug to the site of enteric infection with minimal risk of systemic adverse effects, toxicity, and drug interactions. Compared with systemically absorbed oral antibiotics, poorly absorbed oral antibiotics may be less associated with the pressure that leads to the devel-opment of bacterial resistance, because they do not affect bacteria outside the gastrointestinal tract. In clinical studies, poorly absorbed oral antibiotics, including aztreonam, <b>bicozamycin,</b> and rifaximin, were more effective than and as well tolerated as placebo; in particular, rifaximin was as effective as oral ciprofloxacin in reducing the duration of illness in traveler’s diarrhea. More research is warranted to delineate the effects of poorly absorbed antibiotics in invasive infection and to assess the potential for the development of bacterial resistance. Given the high likelihood that traveler’s diarrhea has a bacterial cause, Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend empirical antibiotic therapy for its treatment [1], and persons traveling from developed to developing countries have been advised to carry an...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between antimicrobial agent use and antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from healthy pigs using data from 2004 to 2007 in the Japanese Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (JVARM). Fecal E. coli isolates from 250 pigs (one isolate each from a pig per farm) were examined for antimicrobial resistance. Information on the use of antimicrobials within preceding 6 months and types of farms recorded in JVARM was collected and statistically analyzed against the resistance patterns. In the univariate analysis, associations between both therapeutic and feed additive use of antimicrobials, and resistance to dihydrostreptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, ampicillin, cefazolin, ceftiofur, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, colistin, and <b>bicozamycin,</b> and husbandry factors were investigated. In multivariable analysis, generalized estimating equations were used to control geographical intraclass correlation. Confounding for structurally unrelated associations was tested using generalized linear models. The results suggested direct and cross selections in the associations between use of aminoglycosides in reproduction farms and resistance to kanamycin, use of tetracyclines in larger farms and resistance to oxytetracycline, use of beta-lactams and resistance to ampicillin, use of phenicols and resistance to chloramphenicol, and use of fluoroquinolones and resistance to nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin. Coselection was suggested in the use of tetracyclines and chloramphenicol resistance. The associations between use of beta-lactams and dihydrostreptomycin resistance, use of macrolides and ampicillin and oxytetracycline resistance, and use of colistin and kanamycin resistance were significant, but were confounded by the simultaneous use of homologous antimicrobials.
