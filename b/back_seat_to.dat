5|$|The episode's finale is Don's day and {{the trip}} to Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh. As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} at having her needs and desires take a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the {{other side of the}} conversation from {{the first part of the}} episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|The Five {{was among}} the myriad of {{subjects}} Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, Nadezhda von Meck. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> his official duties {{as a professor of}} chemistry.|$|E

25|$|Ascani {{was born}} on May 29, 1917 in Beloit, Wisconsin to Italian {{immigrants}} just 14 years after the Wright brothers achieved powered flight. His interest in aviation was sparked in 1927 when he watched Charles Lindbergh fly overhead in the Spirit of St. Louis on his historic flight to Paris. His family moved to Rockford, Illinois, several miles downriver from Beloit, where Ascani attended Rockford High School and enjoyed a hobby building model airplanes. He graduated as high school valedictorian in 1935 and attended Beloit College for two years. In 1937, Ascani was accepted at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated 34th out of a class of 425 and in 1941 was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. Engineering took a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> aviation when Ascani was sent to Hicks Field for initial flight training and Foster Army Air Field for advanced flight training.|$|E

25|$|Paleolithic peoples {{suffered}} less {{famine and}} malnutrition than the Neolithic farming tribes that followed them. This was partly because Paleolithic hunter-gatherers accessed {{a wider variety}} natural foods, which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine. Many of the famines experienced by Neolithic (and some modern) farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on {{a small number of}} crops. It is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods. The greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in Paleolithic diets than Neolithic diets may have also allowed Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than Neolithic agriculturalists. It has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods, with meat likely taking a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> plants. It is also unlikely that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were affected by modern diseases of affluence such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity, and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common onset of these conditions.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing {{the injured}} left ankle that {{he picked up}} a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 {{friendly}} loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.|$|E

[...] Chris Ryan of MTV News commented on the video, saying, [...] "We L-U-V Barbie because she's a trendsetter and a strident, unique artist. But with great style comes great responsibility. Her video for 'Massive Attack,' the first single off her long-awaited debut album, is bananas".|$|E

A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support.

500|$|Initial {{reactions}} among {{film critics}} were mixed.

Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would {{stand the test of}} time. Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace. Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "Blade Crawler", and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as [...] "science fiction pornography". Pauline Kael praised Blade Runner as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in [...] "human terms".|$|E

Each police force has different policies on prisoner transportation. Some allow compliant prisoners to be transported in response cars, ensuring that one officer sits in the rear with the prisoner, and the prisoner sits behind the passenger seat.|$|R

[...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly graded the video a B. Greenblatt believed the video was reverential and painterly, but criticized it by saying [...] "Fifteen"'s most powerful lyrics were outdone by the dreamy design. Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, [...] "Taylor Swift is 'Fifteen' all over again in the new music video for her song of the same name."

[...] Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, [...] "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [...] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." [...] David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, [...] "f you consider the movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, [...] "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this." ...|$|E

500|$|Paramount {{felt the}} film was too {{controversial}} for release, giving it only a few preview showings and a one-week run in Detroit before shelving it. The film's first theatrical release occurred in France on July 7, 1982. In the United Kingdom, {{it was part of}} the 37th Edinburgh International Film Festival and the 27th London Film Festival in 1983, and was released late that year by United International Pictures. It received positive reviews in both countries. Lisa Dombrowski of Film Comment notes, [...] "In the end, Sam Fuller's White Dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests, as support for freedom of expression took a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> Paramount's bottom line and the NAACP's ongoing battles with Hollywood over representation and employment.
