40|$|Discrimination <b>based</b> {{on health}} <b>status</b> {{is a serious}} problem in China, which {{influences}} the fundamental rights of millions of people. This thesis mainly discusses the nature, characteristics and reasons of discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> in China. As a contextual and socio-legal study, this thesis employs doctrinal, empirical, historical, international & comparative law methods to provide a comprehensive and in-depth study on tackling discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> in China. It is among the earliest researches that focus on the specific topic of discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> in China. This thesis argues that various factors are responsible for continuing discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> in China. Particularly, the fragmentary, incomplete, ambiguous and conflicting legislation, the ineffective, arbitrary and bureaucratic administration, the dependant and ineffective judiciary, the less active nongovernmental actors, and other relevant political, economic, medical and cultural factors, interact with one another to cause continuing discrimination. To pursue this argument, first, the thesis clarifies the necessity to prohibit discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> by analysing relevant definitions and theories of such discrimination. Second, the thesis explores how discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> has been tackled in international law and domestic law in various other jurisdictions, in order to reveal international responsibility China should bear and foreign lessons China can learn. Third, the thesis examines how discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> has been tackled in Chinese history and reality to understand why such discrimination remains serious today. Fourth, the thesis discusses findings of the author’s fieldwork on tackling discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> in China to investigate the effectiveness of the current anti-discrimination regime. Based on the above analyses, the thesis finally concludes the main reasons for continuing discrimination <b>based</b> on health <b>status</b> in China and proposes a more effective antidiscrimination regime in China to prohibit such discrimination...|$|R

Upon the retirement of the strike craft all combat ships of the navy were based at Naval Base Simon's Town and the Durban base was reduced to a naval station in 2002.

In 2012 a decision to base the navy's offshore patrol flotilla in Durban led to a programme of renovation to restore the facility back to full naval <b>base</b> <b>status.</b> In December 2015 it was redesignated a naval base as the home port of the patrol flotilla.|$|E

Shortly thereafter the base was designated as an aerial port of embarkation, giving Charleston AFB more prominent role in MATS.

5000|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to find remnants of these wartime airfields as most were converted into municipal airports, while others transitioned to the newly established United States Air Force in 1947. Two remained as active USAF installations until 1960 and a third until 1962, at which time they, too, were converted into purely civilian airports, the latter as a commercial airport. A fourth became a joint civil-military commercial airport hosting a Florida Air National Guard fighter-interceptor group until 1968 when the airport was permanently closed and replaced by a newly constructed international airport and concurrently constructed Air National Guard base also hosting the same Air National Guard fighter unit. A fifth remained as an active Strategic Air Command bomber, tanker and reconnaissance base, later incorporating a commercial jetport and becoming a joint civil-military airport in 1962 until {{the closure of the}} USAF installation in 1975 and its conversion to a civilian commercial international airport in 1975-76. A sixth remained as an active Tactical Air Command then Air Combat Command fighter base until 1995. Having been substantially damaged by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, it was converted to air reserve <b>base</b> <b>status</b> as a fighter base for the Air Force Reserve Command and a fighter alert detachment site for the Florida Air National Guard. The remaining airfields that transitioned from USAAF to USAF continue to function as modern day active U.S. Air Force installations.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Subclinical rumen {{acidosis}} {{is considered}} a frequent pathologic condition of acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> in dairy cows. The objectives {{of the study were}} to measure parameters of acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> in simultaneously obtained rumen fluid and urine samples and to evaluate the diagnostic value of urine parameters to predict subclinical rumen acidosis. Material and methods: Rumen fluid samples were obtained using the Geishauser stomach tube from 348 dairy heifers and dairy cows in 10 dairy farms. Simultaneously urine samples were taken by bladder catheterization. The parameters rumen pH, urine pH, and net-acid-base-excretion (NABE) were measured; base/acid-ratio (B/A-ratio) was calculated. Results: The associations between rumen pH and urine pH (r = 0. 19, p < 0. 001), rumen pH and NABE (r = 0. 13, p = 0. 018) as well as rumen pH und B/A-ratio (r = 0. 13, p = 0. 017) were characterized by low correlation coefficients. Values for sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of all parameters of urine acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> predicting rumen acidosis were also low. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The results of the study indicate that the parameters of urine acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> are not suitable to estimate the rumen acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> under field conditions. The diagnosis of rumen acidosis requires the measurement of pH in rumen flui...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that there is a close {{relationship}} between potassium and the acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> in the peripheral blood as acidosis causes decreased potassium secretion and increased reabsorption in the collecting ducts. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between the potassium concentration and the pH in plasma {{is well known}}. Therefore, we hypothesized that AA infusion for nephroprotection in ERT might lead not only to hyperkalemia but also to a substantial alteration of the acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> namely metabolic acidosis. To the best of our knowledge, no data are published investigating the acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> after AA co-infusion during ERT. A potential correlation could have direct clinical implications as acidosis can be easily corrected by commercially available, inexpensive bicarbonate infusions or oral bicarbonate therapy.|$|E

40|$|The acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> of a {{dairy cow}} is {{maintained}} within a narrow range. The key mechanisms involving blood, cells and lungs, perform this function. Although other minerals {{have an impact}} on acid base metabolism, the minerals used in dietary cation-anion balance (DCAB) namely sodium (Na), potassium (K) and chloride (Cl) have the greatest effect. Hence, acid <b>base</b> <b>status</b> implicates other biological functions of dairy cows. Low DCAB prepartum reduces the incidence of milk fever and increases the productivity by simmering down the severity of hypocalcaemia.
