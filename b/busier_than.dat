5|$|With {{his film}} career behind him, Whale found himself at a loose end. He {{was offered the}} {{occasional}} job, including the opportunity to direct Since You Went Away for David O. Selznick, but turned them down. Lewis, meanwhile, was <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> ever with his production duties and often worked late hours, leaving Whale lonely and bored. Lewis bought him a supply of paint and canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, Lyme Regis was an {{important}} port, <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> Liverpool {{and one of the}} main links between England and mainland Europe. The combination of strong Puritan beliefs, and demands from King Charles I for ship money meant that upon the outbreak of the First English Civil War, the town was sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause. Two local members of parliament (MP), Thomas Trenchard and Walter Erle claimed Lyme Regis for the Parliamentarians in 1642, and set about fortifying the town. Thomas Ceeley, another local MP, was assigned as governor of the town and its forces. He immediately set about removing those with Royalist loyalties from the area, and sent harrying forces around the region, as far as Exeter and Somerset. Lyme Regis had no permanent fortifications, and so Robert Blake established a set of earthen walls, ditches and forts {{around the perimeter of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forecast}} for the 2005 season {{was produced by}} the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) in the second month of the year. In their report, the organization cited a list of analog years – 1952, 1957, 1985, 1991, and 1993 – with similar oceanic and atmospheric patterns. An overall total of 17 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes was forecast, above the average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), meanwhile, released their seasonal outlook on May16, predicting 11 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes. The organization noted that when the Atlantic basin was <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> average, as expected in 2005, the eastern Pacific generally saw lesser activity. That same day, NOAA issued a {{forecast for}} activity across the central Pacific, expecting 2 to 3 tropical cyclones to occur across the basin. A normal season averaged 4 to 5 tropical cyclones, including 1 hurricane. A near-normal El Niño–Southern Oscillation existed across the equatorial Pacific throughout 2005, which indicated conditions generally less conducive for activity there.|$|E

50|$|The {{station is}} {{considerably}} less <b>busy</b> <b>than</b> other stations {{on the same}} stretch of line. In 2007 only 2.735 million entries and exits were recorded, compared with Holloway Road's 7.487m and Caledonian Road's 5.333m. It is largely deserted outside rush hours except on Arsenal match days.|$|R
25|$|The {{scheme was}} not {{considered}} a great success. In fact, during periods of severe service disruption, {{it was not unusual}} to see several trains buffer-to-buffer along the line, though this occurred when the line was much <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> now. Concern was expressed that similar coloured aspects had different interpretations depending on where on the signal they appeared.|$|E
25|$|It attracts {{more and}} more river tourism, sailing on {{chartered}} boats, restaurant-boats, or hotel barges such as the Anjodi. This tourism has grown from the 1960s {{under the leadership of}} the British then exploded in the 1980s. The canal was featured prominently in the BBC television series Rick Stein's French Odyssey (2005), further publicising the canal to a British audience. <b>Busier</b> <b>than</b> the Seine it alone accounts for one fifth of French river tourism and 80% of passengers are foreigners — mainly Germans, Swiss and British. There are approximately 10,000 boat passages per year through the Fonséranes locks, the peak attendance being at the Argens lock with 11,000 boats carrying an average of five passengers. The canal employs directly about 1,900 people. The annual economic impact due to the activity of the canal is about 122 million euros.|$|E
500|$|The police {{received}} {{another letter}} from [...] "Sally" [...] on 7 December. Once again, {{the letter was}} {{traced back to the}} Bradpole road postbox, where the surveillance operation had continued. The operation had captured good-quality footage of all the users of the postbox that day, but, as it was close to Christmas, the postbox was <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> normal, with 172 items posted by 38 people. Royal Mail regulations meant that detectives could not open or delay the letters, so they made enquiries with the recipients to identify the senders. They eventually managed to identify all but a small number of the senders.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 October 1952, {{at around}} 8:17 am, the local train stopped at {{platform}} 4 at Harrow and Wealdstone station, approximately seven minutes late because of fog. Carrying about 800 passengers, it was <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> usual {{because the next}} Tring-Euston service had been cancelled. As scheduled, it had traveled from Tring on the slow line, switching to the up fast line just before Harrow and Wealdstone to keep the slow lines {{to the south of}} the station clear for empty stock movements. [...] At 8:19 am, just as the guard was walking back to his brake van after checking doors on the last two carriages, the Perth express crashed into the rear of the local at a speed of [...] It had passed a colour light signal at caution and two semaphore signals at danger, and had burst through the trailing points of the crossover from the slow lines, which were still set for the local train.|$|E
2500|$|The proposal's {{reception}} {{in the federal}} transport portfolio was in marked contrast. A meeting with the department secretary and senior officers of his department and the Bureau of Transport Economics was to foreshadow an uneasy relationship that was to continue despite the ostensibly cooperative attitude {{of federal and state}} governments. [...] The proposal had been sent to the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, with comments reflecting his officials' opinion: it was not worth considering. Although Sydney–Melbourne was later identified as the fourth-busiest air route in the world (<b>busier</b> <b>than</b> any in North America, or any in Europe apart from Madrid to Barcelona) and the bureau had no firm data on transport markets in south-eastern Australia, its officials judged passenger fares would need to be set at a rate that would not be commercially viable. The bureau would not accept the French experience that the laws of physics (in which momentum is proportional to the square of the velocity) allowed much steeper gradients (hence much fewer cut-and-fill earthworks) than on low-speed railways. The difference in the estimation of earthworks was $2 billion – a significant proportion of the total cost of the project.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the {{kick-off}} to the Christmas {{and holiday}} season for online shopping, the first Monday after US Thanksgiving, was named Cyber Monday. Although {{it was a}} peak, {{that was not the}} busiest on-line shopping day of that year. The busiest on-line shopping days were December 12 and 13, almost two weeks later; the second Monday in December has since become known as Green Monday. Another notable day is Free Shipping Day, a promotional day that serves as the last day in which a person can order a good online and have it arrive via standard shipping (the price of which the sender pays) prior to Christmas Eve; this day is usually on or near December 16. Four of the largest 11 on-line shopping days in 2005 were December 11 to 16, with an increase of 12% over 2004 figures. In 2011, Cyber Monday was slightly <b>busier</b> <b>than</b> Green Monday and Free Shipping Day, although all three days registered sales of over US$1 billion, and all three days registered gains ranging from 14% to 22% over the previous year. Analysts had predicted the peak on December 12, noting that Mondays are the most popular days for on-line shopping during the holiday shopping season, in contrast {{to the middle of the}} week during the rest of the year. They attribute this to people [...] "shopping in stores and malls on the weekends, and [...] extending that shopping experience when they get into work on Monday" [...] by [...] "looking for deals, [...] comparison shopping and [...] finding items that were out of stock in the stores".|$|E

60|$|The {{situation}} in which he found himself, indeed, was particularly favourable {{to the growth of}} these feelings; for, not to mention the lazy influence of a late and lonely breakfast, with the additional sedative of a newspaper, there was an air of repose about his place of residence peculiar to itself, and which hangs about it, even in these times, when it is more bustling and <b>busy</b> <b>than</b> it was in days of yore.|$|R

2500|$|Hex said, [...] "It takes {{a week of}} {{long hours}} and hard work to put {{together}} a review on the show. Gaming, capturing all the game footage, logging all the footage, writing the review, re-writing, editing, filming, re-editing... the finished product is something I'm really proud of." [...] Bajo described the editing process as [...] "a bit like Machinima". Both he and Hex checked edits remotely during the period of the week when they had finished their filming {{and the rest of the}} crew [...] "shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show".

Bajo explained: [...] "Mondays we finish of reviews, log footage, swap games, read scripts and sub everything after a production meeting, Tuesdays we make GG and GG: Pocket, Wednesdays are GGSP and any green screen stuff, then Hex and I are off to review for the rest of the week, while the gang shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show.
