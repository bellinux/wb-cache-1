25|$|The {{biennial}} 2011 Montana {{state legislature}} cut $2.3 {{million from the}} budget for MSU. The budget problem was worsened by an impending decision by the Montana University System Board of Regents {{to spend more money}} on the University of Montana System than the Montana State University System. The MSU <b>Budget</b> <b>Council</b> held campus hearings on the issue, and provided three scenarios: A 3 to 5 percent increase in tuition (equal to $150 to $250 per year for in-state students), tapping reserve funds, or a combination of both. The reserve funds included the university's general reserve fund (which held $5.4 million), and as many as 30 other contingency funds, multi-year spending funds, or funds which ended the previous budget year with leftover money.|$|E
25|$|MSU {{implemented}} a 5 {{percent rise in}} student tuition for the 2012-2013 school year, which generated an extra $11 million revenue. Coupled with an extra $4 million in legislative spending and other revenues, the university's 2012-2013 school year budget grew by 9.1 percent to $168.6 million. Another $2.1 million remained unspent, as the university had not yet determined final enrollment figures by September 2012. About $1.2 million of these funds were spent on 16 projects, ranging from hiring student mental health counselors, creating a doctoral program in the College of Nursing, a master's degree in science and nature filmmaking, a sustainable food and bioenergy degree, an Undergraduate Scholars Program to encourage undergraduate research, new equipment and {{an expansion of the}} Taylor Planetarium at the Museum of the Rockies, and an architect to design a renovation of Romney Gym.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a children’s participatory <b>budget</b> <b>council</b> in the city of Barra Mansa (Brazil), to which 18 boys and 18 girls are elected by their peers to ensure that the municipal council addresses their needs and priorities. This council determines how a proportion of the municipal budget (equivalent to around US $ 125, 000 a year) is spent on addressing children’s priorities, and its child councilors are also involved in other aspects of government. Each year since 1998, more than 6, 000 children have taken part in discussions and assemblies to elect their child councilors and discuss their own priorities. The elected children learn how to represent their peers within democratic structures, to prioritize based on available resources, and then to develop projects within the complex and often slow political and bureaucratic process of city governance. This process has extended to children the concept of participatory budgeting that is now widely used in Brazil for increasing citizen involvement in urban governance. It is encouraging similar innovations in other cities in Latin America, as the example becomes better known and as more people visit Barra Mansa...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{representation}} in Canadian governing structures is currently inadequate. Low voter-turnout {{and the failure}} of pluralism have created an imbalance in James Fishkin’s four dynamic conditions of democracy – political equality, participation, deliberation and nontyranny. In this paper, participatory budgeting (PB), a Latin American innovation, was proposed as one potential mechanism to help remedy this imbalance. This is accomplished by increasing citizen participation in deliberations on issues of local importance (within a structure of political equality and non-tyranny), and empowering citizens to make real decisions on how to address such issues. PB is a co-determinative participatory system that allocates control of a portion of a city’s budget to local citizens. Using these resources, citizens, with the aid of elected representatives and the civil service, decide the type and form of projects and services that will be undertaken by the city to meet identified local needs. At the time of writing there were two known PB models in the world. The first model was developed and implemented in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and is currently being used in many other Brazilian cities. The use of PB in Porto Alegre has been shown to bring numerous benefits to the city and its citizens. Corruption, clientelism and economic inefficiency has been reduced, while local democracy, citizenship values, public works and quality of life have advanced. The second model is a hypothetical PB process designed for the city of Salford, England. A critical analysis of both models found certain common and valuable systems which should be incorporated into a Canadian PB model. However both models utilized native systems that are not compatible with the unique cultural and democratic realities of Canadian cities. Drawing on the strengths, while avoiding the weaknesses, of the two established PB models, a new Canadian PB model was developed, employing a novel citizen decision-making system called the Deliberative <b>Budget</b> <b>Council...</b>|$|E
