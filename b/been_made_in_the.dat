5|$|Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Burma {{probably}} in December 1886, after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885. Much publicity had <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British press {{about the three}} Anglo-Burmese Wars, which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 {{with the fall of}} Mandalay and the capture of King Thibaw Min.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 18 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; 12 {{defendants}} {{were charged with}} breaking into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money. After hearing evidence, the judges held a discussion. Mr Justice Abbott informed the jury that a mistake had <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> indictment, directing the jury to acquit. All 12 defendants were pronounced not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories could not have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complete absence of computer technology.

5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its {{role is to}} regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while {{at a much higher}} cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some progress has <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.|$|E
5|$|Following the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters. Vick, who picked up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in the game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct {{penalties}} in the 2006Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed that he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' defensive end Elvis Dumervil. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology had <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> wake of the incident, Virginia Tech officials announced {{that they would be}} conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.|$|E
5|$|Much {{progress}} has <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes {{due to the}} advancements in components {{as well as the}} Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E

5|$|Other {{attempts}} to modify general relativity have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of cosmology. In the modern cosmological models, most {{energy in the}} universe is in forms {{that have never been}} detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of cosmic expansion, for example modified Newtonian dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation {{of the story}} that might have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} first {{constructed}} in the early 19th century following the path of Nine Mile Creek, which connected several early settlements in Central New York. The northern half of the route, between the villages of Marcellus and Camillus, was later improved as a plank road in 1855 by a private corporation that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over {{the maintenance of the}} road {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. The former plank road and an extension south to Otisco Lake and southwest to Skaneateles Lake was first designated as Route174 in the 1930 state highway renumbering. Since then, several minor realignments have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{northern}} and alpine in distribution, and rarely encountered. Collections have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States (including Maine, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska), Canada (Quebec and British Columbia), China, Japan, and Korea. The disjunct distribution {{of this species}} in North America and East Asia has been noted to occur {{in a number of}} other fungal species as well. Polyozellus multiplex is also found in the Queen Charlotte Islands, where it is commercially harvested.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under {{the central part of the}} Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} is a symmetrical three-storey house built of red brick, with a yellow brick central range which was added later. The building has a cornice and parapet, and a bowed end which projects to the east. On the south side, there is an additional attic storey. The house retains its original sash windows, and {{on the first floor}} some of the windows have wrought-iron balconettes. An addition to the building has <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-west, including an arcade on the ground floor, and a bell tower. Further additions were made to the {{main building}} in the 19th century, including a Gothic chapel of red brick with ashlar dressings to the north. There are later buildings {{on either side of the}} chapel: to the west is a 19th-century building with a two-storey entrance porch, while a Gothic cloister, comprising two walks with scissor-trussed timber roofs, lies to the east. There is a further extension to the south, which is not part of the Grade II* listing.|$|E

5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today.|$|E
