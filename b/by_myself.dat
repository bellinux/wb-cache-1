I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off <b>by</b> <b>myself.</b> I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and I {{consider}} it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long.

25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East <b>by</b> <b>myself.</b> I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E

In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even be as big a record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me <b>by</b> <b>myself,</b> feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my message. We felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E

Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience knew all the lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to smile or nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said Beyoncé was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E

500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there <b>by</b> <b>myself.</b> There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall.

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written <b>by</b> <b>myself</b> so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way." ...|$|E

Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album.

[...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally."
