5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} {{that because of the}} lack of proper facilities in East Anglia, it is likely that he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E

Steyn surpassed the previous (recorded) best of Scotland's Chris Paterson at 36.|$|E
25|$|With these setbacks, Yuan Shao {{missed an}} {{opportunity}} {{to take advantage of the}} situation. His apparent inaction was explained as simple procrastination in the major biographies in the Book of the Later Han and the Records of Three Kingdoms, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> possible that Yu Jin's stiff resistance delayed Yuan Shao's advance and gave Yuan Shao more pause.|$|E
25|$|The Augustan era is {{difficult}} to define chronologically in prose and poetry, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> easy to date its end in drama. The Augustan era's drama ended definitively in 1737, with the Licensing Act. Prior to 1737, however, the English stage was changing rapidly from the Restoration comedy and Restoration drama, and their noble subjects, to the quickly developing melodrama (Munns 97–100).|$|E

25|$|Other {{heavy metals}} have been {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} lead. One example is bismuth which has a similar density (SG=9.78) and a low melting point. It is less toxic, and its salts are highly insoluble which limits absorption by the body. Tungsten (SG=19.25) is another possible replacement for lead, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> expensive by comparison, both as a material and to manufacture in suitable shapes.|$|E
25|$|The Gerald Harbach Round Barn is a round barn near Eleroy, an unincorporated {{community}} in Stephenson County, Illinois, United States. The builder and {{designer of the}} building are unknown <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> similar to round barns designed by the team of Jeremiah Shaffer and the Hass Brothers. It was probably built {{around the same time}} as the James Bruce Round Barn, erected in 1914, in Freeport. The Harbach Round Barn was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} wine labeled as a rosé was {{produced}} {{is not known}} <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely {{that many of the}} earliest red wines made were closer in appearance to today's rosés than they would be to modern red wines. This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today's darker, more tannic red wines (such as extended maceration and harder pressing) were not widely practiced in ancient winemaking. Both red and white wine grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, with very little maceration time, by hand, feet or even sack cloth creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of valve seen for valve {{attachments}} is the rotary valve. Some trombones have piston valves used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer valve or axial-flow Valve, the Hagmann valve, the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.|$|E
25|$|In the DC/Marvel {{crossover}} JLA/Avengers, Pietro first appears being brainwashed by Starro {{when the}} Avengers battle him. Thanks {{to a combination}} of Wanda's magic and Ms. Marvel's powers, they manage to get Starro's probe off of him. When he and the other Avengers go to the DC Universe, he becomes interested in the Speed Force and becomes obsessed with defeating The Flash, but he fails twice. During the final battle in the Savage Land, he finally defeats the Flash, but only does so because there is no Speed Force in the Marvel Universe. He makes an appearance in the final battle with Krona, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> brief. He also appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{however, the}} {{pheromone}} trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more {{time it takes}} for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important in artificial systems.|$|E

25|$|In every lens there is, {{corresponding}} {{to a given}} apertal ratio (that is, {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6 inch focus, with a 1/4 in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a fixed star, for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range' of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms 'apertal ratio' and 'focal range' have not come into general use, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.|$|E
500|$|At Abingdon, {{some time}} between 1120 and 1140, an unknown author wrote a Latin chronicle {{known as the}} Annals of St Neots. [...] This work {{includes}} material from {{a copy of the}} Chronicle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult to tell which version because the annalist was selective about his use of the material. It may have been a northern recension, or a Latin derivative of that recension.|$|E
500|$|Classical Tamil {{also had}} a phoneme called the āytam, written as ‘'. Tamil grammarians of the time {{classified}} it as a dependent phoneme (or restricted phoneme) (...) , <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the Tolkāppiyam, a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the āytam could have glottalised the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the āytam was used to represent the voiced implosive (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word. [...] The Āytam, in modern Tamil, {{is also used to}} convert p to f when writing English words using the Tamil script.|$|E
