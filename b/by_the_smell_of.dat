5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl {{in the house was}} allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

50|$|Paetsch then {{studied the}} cello with the German {{principal}} cellist Wilhelm Hadelich from 1946/7 until 1950. Because almost everything was destroyed, he taught Paetsch while sitting on potato crates {{in the ruins}} of the war, and as Hadelich's children (Sigismund and Valeska) were then babies, they were surrounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> diapers. Everything was done by heart, as there was no printed music to be found at this time of utter poverty and deprivation. Hadelich was as much a genius on the piano as on the cello.|$|R
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

25|$|Bambi is awakened shortly {{afterward}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> smoke, he follows it and discovers {{it leads to}} a hunter camp. Bambi is warned by his father that Man has returned with more hunters. The two flee to safety, although Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil and searches for her along the way. He soon finds her cornered by Man's vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a riverbank. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi's watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.|$|E

50|$|Corsican mint, {{along with}} pennyroyal, {{is thought to}} be one of the best mints to grow as a {{companion}} to brassica plants like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, et cetera.

25|$|The Imperial Family {{were not}} the only {{residents}} of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk. It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.|$|E
25|$|Kiba, {{an injured}} lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City {{following}} {{the scent of}} the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise. There he encounters Tsume, Hige and Toboe, three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by {{the scent of the}} Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degré. She is awakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find her, she is stolen away by Lord Darcia the Third, whose people created Cheza.|$|E
25|$|Ancient DNA {{supports}} {{the hypothesis that}} dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and was initiated close to the Last Glacial Maximum 27,000 YBP when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna, and when proto-dogs might {{have taken advantage of}} carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kill-sites. Wolves were probably attracted to human campfires <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> meat being cooked and discarded refuse in the vicinity, first loosely attaching themselves and then considering these as part of their home territory where their warning growls would alert humans to the approach of outsiders. The wolves most likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication. The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a {{reduction in the number of}} teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.|$|E
2500|$|Johan Hoghusen, a wine trader who immigrated from Westphalia in 1620, {{lived on}} Number 44, just as did {{his son and}} namesake who was raised to peerage and {{appointed}} county governor, and for several centuries the building continued to be leavened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> liquor. [...] <b>The</b> milliner's shop Lamberg, founded in 1877 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> then 21 years old Augusta Lamberg from Gothenburg, was located over the punch manufacture of J G Grönstedt in the basement, and, as the story goes, the vapours from the latter attracted customers to the former. [...] The building was redesigned in the 18th century in the Rococo manners of J W Dinling, the rounded corners of which are still found in the courtyard and on the first floor.|$|R
6000|$|Hence Mr. Gambit {{could go}} {{away from the}} chief grocer's without fear of rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate {{was one of those}} hypocrites who try to {{discredit}} others by advertising their own honesty, and that it might be worth some people's while to show him up. Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments to a balance. And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate up until he knew how. He had not indeed great resources of education, and had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional contempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the breathing apparatus [...] "longs." ...|$|R

500|$|Other {{minerals}} such as topaz contain fluorine. Fluorides, {{unlike other}} halides, are insoluble {{and do not}} occur in commercially favorable concentrations in saline waters. Trace quantities of organofluorines of uncertain origin have been detected in volcanic eruptions and geothermal springs. The existence of gaseous fluorine in crystals, suggested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> crushed antozonite, is contentious; a 2012 study reported the presence of 0.04% [...] by weight in antozonite, attributing these inclusions to radiation from the presence of tiny amounts of uranium.|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Shakira {{released}} her second fragrance S by Shakira Eau Florale, {{which is a}} [...] "floral interpretation" [...] of the original fragrance. The perfume is more influenced by the scent of flowers and Shakira enlisted the aid of perfumer Elisabeth Vidal to create the fragrance. Shakira promoted S by Shakira and S by Shakira Eau Florale at a press release in Paris, France, in March 2013. S by Shakira Aquamarine was released in early 2013 as a limited edition fragrance and is inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the ocean, making use of various ozonic substances in its scent.|$|E
500|$|The {{species can}} be {{differentiated}} from the similar I. praetervisa by its spores; the latter [...] "has irregular, lumpy spores". Inocybe rimosa, the split fibrecap, is also similar in appearance; the rarer I.cookei can be differentiated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> honey and the marginate bulb. The colouration, {{as well as}} the thick stem with a bulb, are features shared by two other species of Inocybe; I.mixtilis and I.cryptocystis. Another fragrant Inocybe is I.pyriodora, which has an odor resembling cinnamon, or ripe pears in mature specimens; unlike I.cookei, it lacks a bulb at the base of its stem, and bruises a reddish colour when handled or with age.|$|E
50|$|It {{is easily}} {{recognizable}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> characteristic <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> bitumen from its leaves. This strong tar-like characteristic aroma {{appears to be}} the result of a combination of several substances such as phenolics, sulphurated compounds, sesquiterpenes and probably short-chain hydrocarbon. Total polyphenols content was < 2% and the condensed tannins was <0.8% in a dry weight basis.|$|R

500|$|Cats have {{an acute}} sense of smell, {{due in part}} to their {{well-developed}} olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about [...] in area, which is about twice that of humans. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion. [...] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.|$|E
500|$|One man and {{one woman}} are chosen for each year the Queen has lived (including the year she is {{currently}} living), and they receive Maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years. Recipients attend a [...] "Maundy Lecture" [...] in the cathedral {{in advance of the}} service to familiarise them with what will happen. [...] The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service, and the Royal Standard flies. The purses are carried into the church by the Yeomen on silver dishes, held above their heads. [...] The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor; some experts believe the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from grabbing at the food prematurely; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> fish.|$|E
500|$|Eddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia {{create an}} army, named [...] "Ironheade" [...] {{to fight against}} General Lionwhyte. They {{successfully}} raid Lionwhyte's [...] "Pleasure Tower" [...] and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus {{is aware of the}} presence of his spy [...] "Succoria" [...] <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth [...] "Drowning Doom". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and finding more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with most}} lurid tales of native {{cannibalism}}, {{these stories are}} treated {{with a great deal}} of scrutiny, as accusations of cannibalism were often used as justifications for the subjugation or destruction of [...] "savages". However, there were several well-documented cultures that engaged in regular eating of the dead, such as New Zealand's Māori. In an 1809 incident known as the Boyd massacre, about 66 passengers and crew of the Boyd were killed and eaten by Māori on the Whangaroa peninsula, Northland. Cannibalism was already a regular practice in Māori wars. In another instance, on July 11, 1821, warriors from the Ngapuhi tribe killed 2,000 enemies and remained on the battlefield [...] "eating the vanquished until they were driven off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> decaying bodies". Māori warriors fighting the New Zealand government in Titokowaru's War in New Zealand's North Island in 1868–69 revived ancient rites of cannibalism as part of the radical Hauhau movement of the Pai Marire religion.|$|E
