5|$|<b>Ballast</b> Point got {{its name}} from the {{practice}} of ships discarding their <b>ballast</b> there on arriving in San Diego Bay and taking on <b>ballast</b> as they left for the open ocean. Fort Guijarros was constructed at <b>Ballast</b> Point in 1797. <b>Ballast</b> Point and La Playa are now on the grounds of Naval Base Point Loma.|$|E
5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and <b>ballast</b> motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and <b>ballast</b> motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while <b>ballast</b> motor cars are used to haul <b>ballast</b> trains and engineering trains.|$|E
5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required <b>ballast</b> {{to be placed in}} the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by <b>ballast.</b> The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{inductive}} {{fluorescent lamp}} <b>ballasts</b> have a power factor {{of less than}} unity. Inductive <b>ballasts</b> include power factor correction capacitors. Simple electronic <b>ballasts</b> may also have low power factor due to their rectifier input stage.|$|R
50|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{conventional}} magnetic <b>ballasts</b> flicker {{at twice}} the supply frequency. Electronic <b>ballasts</b> do not produce light flicker since the phosphor persistence is longer than a half cycle of the higher operation frequency of 20 kHz. The 100-120 Hz flicker produced by magnetic <b>ballasts</b> is associated with headaches and eyestrain.Individuals with high critical flicker fusion threshold are particularly affected by light from fluorescent fixtures that have magnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy. The problems are not observed with electronic <b>ballasts.</b> Ordinary people have better reading performance using high-frequency (20-60 kHz) electronic <b>ballasts</b> than magnetic <b>ballasts,</b> although the effect was small except at high contrast ratio.|$|R
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive <b>ballasts,</b> a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In <b>ballasts</b> that control two or more lamps, line-frequency <b>ballasts</b> commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These <b>ballasts</b> are often called lead-lag <b>ballasts</b> because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|R
5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in <b>ballast</b> tank ventilation, {{the fact that}} <b>ballast</b> tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning <b>ballast</b> tanks is more difficult for double hull ships.|$|E
5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to <b>ballast,</b> {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of <b>ballast.</b> Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have {{inherent}} lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for <b>ballast,</b> but a solution using solid <b>ballast</b> which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E
2500|$|An {{inductor}} is {{very common}} in line-frequency <b>ballasts</b> to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a fluorescent lamp, neon lamp, or high intensity discharge (HID) lamp. (Because {{of the use of}} the inductor, such <b>ballasts</b> are usually called magnetic <b>ballasts.)</b> The inductor has two benefits: ...|$|R
2500|$|Electronic <b>ballasts</b> {{are often}} based on the SMPS topology, first {{rectifying}} the input power and then chopping it at a high frequency. Advanced electronic <b>ballasts</b> may allow dimming via pulse-width modulation or via changing the frequency to a higher value. <b>Ballasts</b> incorporating a microcontroller (digital <b>ballasts)</b> may offer remote control and monitoring via networks such as LonWorks, DALI, DMX512, DSI or simple analog control using a 0-10V DC brightness control signal. Systems with remote control of light level [...] via a wireless mesh network have been introduced.|$|R
50|$|However, {{other types}} of {{lighting}} can also benefit from improved power quality, including systems with resistive or reactive <b>ballasts.</b> Fluorescent & discharge lighting is more efficient than incandescent lighting. Fluorescent lighting with conventional magnetic <b>ballasts</b> will see a reduced power consumption, but also a reduced lumen output from the lamp. Fluorescent lamps on modern electronic <b>ballasts</b> will use approximately the same power and give the same light.|$|R
5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} <b>ballast</b> motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the <b>ballast</b> motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a <b>ballast</b> motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the <b>ballast</b> motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that energy saving is always equivalent to environmental protection. Compared with electromagnetic <b>ballasts,</b> electronic <b>ballasts</b> have a much shorter lifetime and are not recyclable. This prompts new concerns about their environmental impacts due to the accumulation of {{a huge amount of}} toxic and/or nonbiodegradable electronic waste components and materials. In this paper, the combined use of a central dimming system with low-loss electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> is compared with electronic <b>ballasts.</b> Experimental results have confirmed that the use of a central dimming system for large electromagnetic-ballast-driven lighting systems can be as energy efficient as electronic <b>ballasts.</b> Considering the long lifetime (> 30 years) of electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> and the recyclability of their magnetic chokes, this paper shows that such combined technology can provide an improved environmentally friendly and energy-saving solution for large-scale electric-lighting systems, particularly for lighting systems in large public areas. Due to the elimination of many electronic <b>ballasts,</b> this proposed technology has the potential of drastically reducing a huge amount of electronic waste. With the positive results obtained in this paper, it is hoped that international regulatory organizations would reconsider their current policies and promote lighting technology that is both environmentally friendly and energy saving.

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that the bridges and culverts were in a fair condition, but the stations were dirty. Fences were decayed, rails needed replacing, some sleepers were rotten, and the <b>ballast</b> was soft and shaley. The LNWR addressed these problems over the coming years.|$|E
5|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, {{heavy metals}} {{are used for}} <b>ballast</b> in boats, aeroplanes, and motor vehicles; or in balance weights on wheels and crankshafts, gyroscopes, and propellers, and centrifugal clutches, in situations requiring maximum weight in minimum space (for example in watch movements).|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may outweigh cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airshipsâ in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional <b>ballast</b> to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting <b>ballast</b> in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{high-frequency}} electronic <b>ballasts</b> do {{not produce}} visible light flicker, since above about 5kHz, the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle, and light production becomes continuous. Operating frequencies of electronic <b>ballasts</b> are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls. Poor quality (or failing) electronic <b>ballasts</b> may have insufficient reservoir capacitance or have poor regulation, thereby producing considerable 100/120Hz modulation of the light.|$|R
50|$|Conversion kits are {{available}} which {{will work in}} existing fittings containing switch start, mains frequency fluorescent lamp <b>ballasts.</b> The kits convert the fittings to use energy efficient, high frequency <b>ballasts</b> and accommodate the smaller diameter T5 lamp.|$|R

5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers {{found the}} wreck of the USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 when she ran aground on Maro Reef while running at full speed and in <b>ballast.</b> Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water <b>ballast</b> stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. <b>Ballast</b> enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water <b>ballast</b> by opening the dump valves.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} essentially {{covers the}} same material as IEC 60921, but it is considerably more complex due to the high frequency aspect of electronic <b>ballasts.</b> Appendix E of the standard defines the DALI, which specifies how <b>ballasts</b> are controlled.|$|R
50|$|The {{normally}} unnoticeable 50-60 Hz flicker from {{fluorescent tubes}} powered by electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> {{are associated with}} headaches and eyestrain. Individuals with high flicker fusion threshold are particularly affected by electromagnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50Hz - 60 Hz) electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> than electronic <b>ballasts,</b> although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ballasts</b> {{vary greatly}} in complexity. They {{may be as}} simple as a resistor, {{inductor}} or capacitor (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic <b>ballasts</b> used in compact fluorescent lamps and high-intensity discharge lamps.|$|R
5|$|The San Esteban {{findings}} {{included three}} broken anchors and a wrought iron swivel gun {{that was also}} broken and unusable.

5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two <b>ballast</b> tanks or a <b>ballast</b> tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the life of T 5 fluorescent tubes and compact fluorescent lamps with non-integrated <b>ballasts.</b> The lamps were operated on five different cycles with either instant start <b>ballasts</b> or electrode preheating <b>ballasts.</b> The influence of the operation time on the lamp life of every start was examined. During both the start and the operation of the lamps, measurements of particular electrical characteristics were carried out. The investigation focused on the effect of the starting and operating characteristics on the lamp lifetime. Lamps operating with <b>ballasts</b> providing preheat at the start up, showed a systematic change in certain electrical characteristics that can help to predict their failure.
