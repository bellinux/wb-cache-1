5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|Bush used {{a budget}} surplus {{to push through}} Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He {{extended}} government funding for organizations providing education {{of the dangers of}} alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence. Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|E

In the fourth season of the IPL he was signed by the Pune Warriors India, after being unsold in initial bidding process and he made 50runs of four matches and three innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the <b>bottom.</b> <b>In</b> the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E

5|$|Brian Little {{took over}} in 1991 {{and by the end}} of the 1991–92 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for a place in the new FA Premier League, but lost to Blackburn Rovers and a penalty from former Leicester striker Mike Newell.

In 1993–94 City were promoted from the playoffs, beating Derby County 2–1 in the final. Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor Mark McGhee was unable to save Leicester from finishing second from <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> the 1994–95 season.|$|E

5|$|Colin Coates {{participated in}} six Winter Olympics, from 1968 to 1988, and came {{sixth in the}} 10,000m event in 1976, Australia's best result before Lillehammer. His four top-11 {{finishes}} in 1976 made him only the third Australian to place in {{the top half of}} a Winter Olympic event. Before the 1988 Olympics, three other athletes had represented Australia in long track racing, and all had placed near the <b>bottom.</b> <b>In</b> 1988, Danny Kah and Michael Richmond both broke into the top 15 and the top half in two events each, and in 1994, the former recorded Australia's best long track result, finishing fifth in the 5,000m event. However, Australia did not compete in long track again until 2010, when sole representative Sophie Muir became the first woman to compete for the country in the discipline; she came in the bottom fifth of entrants in both her races.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> fast moving current.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October, König was towed by mine {{sweepers}} {{into the}} Kuiwast roadstead. König transferred soldiers {{to the island}} of Schildaum which was then occupied. By that time, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the return voyage, König struck <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> a heavy swell. The ship was repaired in Kiel; the work lasted until 17 November.|$|E
5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, the mask of young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the <b>bottom,</b> <b>in</b> front of the table.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at <b>bottom</b> <b>in</b> order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
