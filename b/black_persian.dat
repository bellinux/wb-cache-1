For a long time we called her endearing names in vain. She seemed resolute to spend her night among the brambles. She had interrupted a conversation, often interrupted before, upon certain thoughts so long habitual that I may be permitted to call them my convictions. When I came back to London my mind ran {{again and again to}} those conversations and I could not rest till I had written out in this little book all that I had said or would have said. Read it some day when [...] "Minoulooshe" [...] is asleep.|$|E

The only unusually coated kitten in the litter was ultimately placed with breeder, Jeri Newman, who named her Miss DePesto (after a curly-haired character in the TV series Moonlighting played by Allyce Beasley). This foundation cat was bred to a <b>black</b> <b>Persian</b> male, producing three Selkirk Rex and three straight-haired kittens. This demonstrated that the gene had an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. All Selkirk Rex trace their ancestry back to the cat Miss DePesto. Jeri Newman named the breed after her stepfather, [...] "Selkirk," [...] making this the first (and currently only) breed of cat to be named after an actual person.|$|E
50|$|Registries {{allocate}} a breed number, acronym or a Code to the breeds they register. Most use {{a two or}} 3 letter acronym e.g. MK (Munchkin), JBT (Japanese Bobtail). This may {{be followed}} by numbers or lower case acronyms that indicate colour and pattern, these being subdivisions of the breed. For historical reasons, the British GCCF allocate numbers to breeds and the <b>Black</b> <b>Persian</b> Longhair is registered under a different breed number, and effectively as a different breed, to the Blue Persian Longhair. These lists may be found on individual registry websites (or in their printed publications where they {{do not yet have}} a website). All FIFe Member cat registries use the EMS (Easy Memory System) breed and variety code which consists of a breed abbreviation followed by pattern and colour letters and digits which are consistent across all breeds.|$|E

40|$|In Colombia {{the sheep}} {{production}} systems are managed under extensive conditions and mainly correspond to peasant production systems so their genetic management {{has led to}} increased homozygosity and hence productivity loss. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the genetic diversity in 549 individuals corresponding to 13 sheep breeds in Colombia, using a panel of 11 microsatellite molecular markers. One hundred and fifty seven alleles were found (average of 14. 27 alleles/locus), with a range of observed and expected heterozygosity from 0. 44 to 0. 84 and 0. 67 to 0. 86, respectively. Thirty-three of 143 Hardy Weinberg tests performed showed significant deviations (p < 0. 05) due to a general lack of heterozygous individuals. The Fis ranged from 0. 01 in Corriedale to 0. 15 for the <b>Persian</b> <b>Black</b> Head breed, suggesting that there are presenting low to moderate levels of inbreeding. Overall, Colombian sheep showed high levels of genetic diversity which is very important for future selection and animal breeding programs...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of inclusion of Lablab meal on growth rate, feed intake and carcass composition of <b>Black</b> Head <b>Persian</b> (BHP) lambs. Twenty-four BHP castrate sheep with average weight of 14. 1 + 2. 7 kg were allotted randomly to four dietary treatments. Lambs were individually maintained in metabolic crates. All animals were offered hay ad libitum. Lambs on control treatment (A) were given in addition 380 g of maize bran per day. Animals on treatments B. C, and D were given daily 380 g of concentrate based on maize bran with 25, 50 and 75 % lablab meal, respectively. Growth rate, dry-matter intake and feed conversion ratio were 34, 66, 68, 71 g/day; 58. 7, 69. 5, 74. 0 g/kgW 0. 75 /day and 15. 2, 11. 3, 9. 3, 9. 1 g/DMI/g gain, respectively, of treatments A, B. C and D. The level of inclusion of lablab meal had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on killing-out characteristics. Hot carcass weight as percentages of slaughter weight and empty body weight were 41. 3, 41. 0, 40. 5, 42. 5 and 52. 0, 52. 3, 53. 5, respectively, for animals on treatments A, B. C and D. Carcass composition expressed as percentage of carcass weight showed no significant treatment effects and value of 60. 91, 61. 29, 61. 11 and 62. 97 % for carcass lean, 19. 06, 20. 24, 18. 42 and 17. 54 % carcass fat and 17. 86, 16. 70, 17. 91 and 16. 67 % for carcass bone were obtained for treatments A, B.
