5|$|From 1747, Brettingham {{operated}} from London {{as well as}} Norwich.

5|$|Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was {{committed}} {{to the belief that}} European colonial rule in Africa must end.

5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the half {{struggled}} to {{get the better of}} Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis {{on the edge of the}} penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E

He averaged a century every fourth innings in which he batted, second again to Bradman, and did not suffer a poor series in his career before the war.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of preserving the Union. He used his position as editor of the Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National Convention that re-nominated Lincoln for president, and his pro-Union speech was hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine {{as one of the most}} inspiring given at the event.|$|E
5|$|Brian Horrocks was {{the only}} son of Colonel Sir William Horrocks, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Born in India, Brian {{returned}} to Britain, where he was educated at Bow School, Durham, later Uppingham School, Rutland, an English public school, and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1913. His score was sixth-lowest of the 167 successful applicants for cadetships—even after the addition of 200 bonus points for an Officer Training Corps (OTC) certificate, which not all the other candidates had. An unpromising student, {{he might not have}} received a commission at all <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.|$|E

5|$|<b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E
5|$|By the All-Star {{break in}} February 2011, the Rockets were 26-31. On February 24, 2011, the Rockets traded Shane Battier to the Memphis Grizzlies for Hasheem Thabeet and a first round pick. They also traded Aaron Brooks to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a first round pick. Afterwards the team won 15 games out of 20, {{reaching}} {{a winning record}} and contending for a playoff spot. The team entered April with chances of qualifying for the postseason, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second straight season the Rockets {{failed to make the}} playoffs after losing to the New Orleans Hornets in Louisiana with three games remaining. The team still finished the year with a 43-39 winning record. Head coach Rick Adelman left the Rockets right after the season.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E
