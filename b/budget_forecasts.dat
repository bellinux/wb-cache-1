On the other hand, <b>budget</b> <b>forecasting</b> is based on the forecast of socio-economic indicators of the country’s development. The main objective of the <b>budget</b> <b>forecast</b> is to determine the scientific assumptions that include: substantiation of the sources and directions of use of the budgetary means; scientific analysis of the economically based income in the relevant budget; provision for future development of income and the directions of utilization of budgetary means; assessment of the possible impact of decisions made in the budget sphere...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{the process}} of {{estimating}} the quantitative predictions of the strategic plan through the budget happens as from the deterministic data, together with analysis of factors of internal and external environments. As from the budget data decisions are made, often before the fact, which creates uncertainty as to the assertiveness of forecasts. Combined with the traditional preparation methods of corporate <b>budget</b> <b>forecasts,</b> this study presents an application of stochastic methods where the probabilism is presented as an alternative for the minimization of uncertainties related to the assertiveness of the estimates. It also demonstrates itself, as from a practical application, {{the use of the}} Monte Carlo method in the sales forecasting; {{at the same time it}} is tested the probability of these sales forecasting be materialized within certain intervals that meet the investors’ expectations, by using the limit central theorem and, finally, by using the absorbing Markov chain, it is demonstrated the overall performance of the system as from the funds input and output.

Our objective is to examine the forecast error based on a simple model in which we attempt to explain deviations between the March <b>budget</b> <b>forecast</b> and the November forecast, and deviations between the outcome and the March <b>budget</b> <b>forecast</b> in the UK. The analysis is based on forecasts made by the general government. We use the forecasts of the variables as alternatives to the outcomes. We also test for political spins in the GDP forecast updates and the GDP forecast errors. We find evidence of partisan and electoral effects in forecast updates and forecast errors.

40|$|Several {{recent efforts}} to improve budget {{forecasting}} techniques have emphasized the uncertainties inherent in projections of economic behavior and demography. Previous attempts to present stochastic budget projections for the U. S. have successfully incorporated sources of long-run uncertainty but have not attempted to model business cycle fluctuations realistically. While perhaps reasonably accurate in the long run, stochastic models that ignore cyclical uncertainty offer relatively few insights into the short-run uncertainties that may be of greater concern to policymakers. This paper develops a new and parsimonious framework for incorporating both cyclical and long-run uncertainty into a single, consistent set of stochastic budget projections, and it presents new long-term <b>budget</b> <b>forecasts</b> for the U. S. federal government and combined {{state and local governments}} that highlight the role of short-term uncertainty...|$|E
