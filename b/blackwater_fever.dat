5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever,</b> where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Tropical disease {{killed or}} {{rendered}} ineffective far more 2RR men than the Germans did; {{at times the}} regiment was reduced to an effective strength of under 100 by the vast myriad of potential ailments, including trench fever, <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever,</b> dysentery, pneumonia, sleeping sickness and many others. The 1,038 personnel who served with 2RR in East Africa collectively went into hospital 2,272 times, and there were 10,626 incidences of illness—in other words, the average 2RR soldier was hospitalised twice and reported sick 10 times. In January 1917, only 91 of the regiment's men were considered fit for duty; {{it was no longer}} an effective fighting force, and the white Southern Rhodesian manpower did not exist to continue reinforcing it. It was therefore withdrawn from East Africa that month. Those men who were healthy enough to return home arrived back in Salisbury on 14 April 1917, receiving a tumultuous welcome, but the majority of 2RR remained in medical care overseas for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever.</b> Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E

25|$|Birtles was {{the third}} child of David Edwin Birtles, an English bootmaker, and Sarah Jane Bartlett. At the age of 15, Birtles joined the {{merchant}} navy as an apprentice, but after {{the outbreak of the}} Second Boer War, he jumped ship at Cape Town, South Africa in 1899, in an attempt to enlist with Australian militia. However, he was attached to the Field Intelligence Department as part of a troop of irregular mounted infantry until May 1902. After a brief period back in Australia, Birtles joined the constabulary in the a mounted police officer in the Transvaal, until his police service ended when he contracted <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the war Chester briefly went to Australia, {{and then}} {{returned}} to North Borneo, sailing on the Dominion Monarch on 18 October 1945. He resigned his commission on 30 March 1946 and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel. He died of <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever</b> (a complication of malaria) at Jesselton (Kota Kinabalu) on 18 August 1946. His gravestone in Kota Kinabalu Anglican Cemetery bears the epitaph [...] "A pioneer of victory in Borneo and a most lovable man."

2500|$|Two {{years after}} Harry Crosby died by suicide, Cartier-Bresson's affair with Caresse Crosby ended in 1931, leaving him broken-hearted. During {{conscription}} he read Conrad's Heart of Darkness. This {{gave him the}} idea of escaping and finding adventure on the Côte d'Ivoire in French colonial Africa. He survived by shooting game and selling it to local villagers. From hunting, he learned methods which he later used in photography. [...] On the Côte d'Ivoire, he contracted <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever,</b> which nearly killed him. While still feverish, he sent instructions to his grandfather for his own funeral, asking {{to be buried in}} Normandy, {{at the edge of the}} Eawy forest while Debussy's String Quartet was played. Although Cartier-Bresson took a portable camera (smaller than a Brownie Box) to Côte d'Ivoire, only seven photographs survived the tropics.|$|E

"Very {{much the}} reverse," [...] he answered; [...] "never was more gloomy in my life, {{not even when}} I thought I had to die within six hours of <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever.</b> Also I have lots that I {{want to talk to}} you about and I can't do it at the end of this confounded wire that your uncle may be tapping." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{the night}} of full moon and of the great feast of the return of Little Bonsa. Alan sat in his chamber waiting to be summoned {{to take part in}} this {{ceremony}} and listening the while to that Wow! Wow! Wow! of the death drums, whereof Jeekie had once spoken in England, which could be clearly heard even above the perpetual boom of the cataract tumbling down its cliff behind the town. By now he had recovered from the fatigue of his journey and his health was good, but the same could not be said of his spirits, for never in his life had he felt more downhearted, not even when he was sickening for <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever,</b> or lay in bondage in the City, expecting every morning to wake up and find his reputation blasted. He was a prisoner in this dreadful, gloomy place where he must live like a second Man in the Iron Mask, without recreation or exercise other than he could find in the walled garden where grew the black cedar trees, and, so far as he could see, a prisoner without hope of escape.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} quite a young man, {{not more than}} thirty-two or three years of age, though he lacked the ultra robust and rubicund {{appearance}} which is typical of so many Englishmen of his class at this period of life. A heavy bout of <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever</b> acquired on service in West Africa, which would have killed anyone of weaker constitution, had robbed his face of its bloom and left it much sallower, if more interesting than once it had been. For in a way there was interest about the face; also a certain charm. It was a good and honest face with a rather eager, rather puzzled look, that {{of a man who}} has imagination and ideas and who searches for the truth but fails to find it. As for the charm, it lay for the most part in the pleasant, open smile and in the frank but rather round brown eyes overhung by a somewhat massive forehead which projected a little, or perhaps the severe illness already alluded to had caused the rest of the face to sink. Though thin, the man was bigly built, with broad shoulders and well-developed limbs, measuring a trifle under six feet in height.|$|E
60|$|To {{navigate}} {{a vessel}} through the reefs and shoals and passages and unlighted coasts of the coral seas is a man's work in itself. I {{was the only}} navigator on board. There {{was no one to}} check me up on the working out of my observations, nor with whom I could advise in the ticklish darkness among uncharted reefs and shoals. And I stood all watches. There was no sea-man on board whom I could trust to stand a mate's watch. I was mate as well as captain. Twenty-four hours a day were the watches I stood at sea, catching cat-naps when I might. Third, I was doctor. And let me say right here that the doctor's job on the Snark at that time was a man's job. All on board suffered from malaria--the real, tropical malaria that can kill in three months. All on board suffered from perforating ulcers and from the maddening itch of ngari-ngari. A Japanese cook went insane from his too numerous afflictions. One of my Polynesian sailors lay at death's door with <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever.</b> Oh, yes, it was a full man's job, and I dosed and doctored, and pulled teeth, and dragged my patients through mild little things like ptomaine poisoning.|$|E
60|$|But {{it seemed}} as if the fates would snatch from him all {{enjoyment}} of the laurels he had won, for on their way towards Nairobi, Alec and Dr. Adamson were attacked by <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever.</b> For weeks Alec lay at the point of death. His fine constitution seemed to break at last, and he himself thought that the end was come. Condamine, one of the company's agents, took command of the party and received Alec's final instructions. Alec lay in his camp bed, with his faithful Swahili boy by his side to brush away the flies, waiting for the end. He would have given much to live till all his designs were accomplished, but that apparently was not to be. There was only one thing that troubled him. Would the government let the splendid gift he offered slip through their fingers? Now was the time to take formal possession of the territories which he had pacified: the prestige of the whites was at its height, and there were no difficulties to be surmounted. He impressed upon Condamine, whom he wished to be appointed sub-commissioner under a chief at Nairobi, the importance of making all this clear to the authorities. The post he suggested would have been pressed upon himself, but he had no taste for official restrictions, and his part of the work was done. So far as this went, his death was of little consequence.|$|E
50|$|The most {{probable}} {{explanation for}} <b>blackwater</b> <b>fever</b> is an autoimmune reaction apparently {{caused by the}} interaction of the malaria parasite and the use of quinine. <b>Blackwater</b> <b>fever</b> is caused by heavy parasitization of red blood cells with Plasmodium falciparum. There has been at least one case, however, attributed to Plasmodium vivax.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackwater</b> <b>fever</b> is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of malaria, but cerebral malaria has a higher mortality rate. <b>Blackwater</b> <b>fever</b> is much less common {{today than it was}} before 1950. It may be that quinine plays a role in triggering the condition, and this drug is no longer commonly used for malaria prophylaxis. Quinine remains important for treatment of malaria.|$|E
