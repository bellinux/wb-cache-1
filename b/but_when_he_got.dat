25|$|After {{finishing}} Los Asesinos (1968), {{produced by}} Luis Enrique Vergara and filmed in Mexico, Adams bought {{a plane ticket}} with his own money and flew to Rome to co-star with Aldo Ray in a science fiction/horror movie called Murder in the Third Dimension, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there, he found the project had been dropped. Susan Strasberg, {{who had worked with}} him 13 years earlier on the hit film Picnic and was living in Italy, encountered a thoroughly demoralized Adams in a Rome bar.|$|E
25|$|Slocum {{intended}} to sail eastward around the world, using the Suez Canal, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to Gibraltar {{he realized that}} sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because of the piracy that still went on there at that time. So he decided to sail westward, in the southern hemisphere. He headed to Brazil, and then the Straits of Magellan. At that point {{he was unable to}} start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually {{he made his way to}} Australia, sailed north along the east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and then headed back to North America.|$|E
500|$|After {{two seasons}} in New England, he {{was traded to}} the Seattle Seahawks for an {{undisclosed}} draft pick. [...] During the 1993 NFL season, his workload was modest in the backfield with Chris Warren and John L. Williams, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the chance to play for the 1993 Seahawks he rose to the occasion with a career best 131yards on 26carries. [...] This was Vaughn's second and last 100-yard rushing game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so--but then I am fantastic. When you've got a dirty coat on, or Frank, I don't find {{fault with}} it; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> a clean coat, I writhe {{at him in}} my disgust. Yet, upon the whole, I like men to have clean coats." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{would not}} go. <b>But</b> often, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into his buggy the Doctor found the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit. Well {{he knew where}} to carry them.|$|R
60|$|They willingly {{consented to}} this, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> the hat, the cloak, and the boots, he said, 'Next time we meet you shall have my decision,' and hereupon he wished himself away.|$|R
2500|$|On 14 November, off Cromer, Carrier {{was under}} the command of Acting Lieutenant William Milne when she {{captured}} a French cutter-rigged privateer. [...] Milne had steered towards what he though was a fishing boat from which he wished to ask about how far they were from land, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> close she hoisted French colours and opened fire. Because of a gale, heavy seas, {{and the fact that she}} had a crew of only 16 men aboard, Carrier could not make use of her four 12-pounder carronades. Once Carrier had shot away the French vessel's colours and halyards she surrendered. She proved to be the Actif, commissioned for eight guns, but with only two on board at the time Carrier captured her. She had a crew 32 men {{under the command of}} Norbat Corcenwinder and had suffered four wounded. Actif had left Dunkirk three weeks earlier and had captured two vessels, a galiot that Sybille recaptured, and the Lord Keith, an English sloop. Milne put a prize crew aboard Actif and sent her to Yarmouth. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Carrier 14 Novr. 1807" [...] to all surviving claimants from this action.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to {{the fork}} between the Huntingdon Road and the Cottenham Road, both roads were clear.|$|E
60|$|Westover hardly {{believed}} him. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{on his own}} things again, Jeff {{joined him}} in his hat and overcoat, and they went out together.|$|E
5000|$|He {{started to}} look for the boy among his sheep, but he put on a sheep's skin and escaped from Tartalo. <b>But,</b> unluckily, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out of the flock of sheep, the accuser ring started to shout: [...] "Here I am, here I am!".|$|R
60|$|Throwing {{down his}} hatchet, he sped away immediately, <b>but</b> stopped <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> a little distance, and looked back; then hurried on again.|$|R
60|$|They {{needed the}} venison, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> down a short {{distance}} {{he knew he was}} rash, for it looked as if the rocks {{on the other side of}} the waterfall were perpendicular. Then, although he might perhaps reach the shelf, to carry the deer back was another thing.|$|R
6000|$|... “No! No!” protested Mr Verloc, busy {{fishing for}} his hat. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> it {{from under the}} sofa he held it {{as if he did}} not know the use of a hat.|$|E
60|$|This was done, {{and after}} {{he had had a}} drink of water, Jack said he felt much better. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up on his feet he was rather shaky in the knees.|$|E
60|$|Rollo began; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up to a hundred, {{he gave up}} the {{undertaking}} in despair. Mr. George {{told him that he}} read in the guide book that there were four thousand wind mills in that region.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> {{over the}} first shock he {{began to think of}} some way out of the difficulty, and seizing the hunchback in his arms he carried him out into the street, and leaning him against the wall of a shop he stole back to his own house, without once looking behind him.|$|R
5000|$|Olive Brucker - Used to be a [...] "perfect" [...] {{couple with}} Jerry Dingleman, <b>but</b> left him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> polio. Later she is hinted to be a drug addict.|$|R
60|$|The man did so, and {{it turned}} into a great high {{mountain}} of stone, which Farmer Weatherbeard had to break his way through before he could follow them. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> {{to the middle of the}} mountain he broke one of his legs, so he had to go home to get it put right.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to {{her great}} airy flat {{overlooking}} Hyde Park, with its Omega Workshop furniture and its arresting decoration, {{he was not}} so sure whether this encounter was so exactly the thing he had desired as he had supposed.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through Mildenhall, {{and well}} into the rabbit-warrens, he gave mare Swallow a kick, and went over the heath so fast northward, that his pots danced such a dance as broke half of them before he got to Brandon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That maiden is strangely like my wife,' thought he; 'I {{must see}} her closer! And he hastened {{down to the}} water. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there, the princess, for she indeed it was, had {{disappeared}} completely, {{and he began to}} wonder if his eyes had deceived him.|$|E
60|$|The king took it, and was {{so pleased}} with the present, that truly he desired our officer to put it upon his own head, which <b>he</b> did; <b>but,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> it so placed, he let our men see he was king over his wife, as well as {{over the rest of}} the country, and that he would wear it himself.|$|R
5000|$|A {{close friend}} of Aoto's and new goalie of the Momoyama Predators. He is half-Arabic and half-japanese. He used to play soccer with Aoto, <b>but</b> quit <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{discouraged}} from his increasing number of goalie errors. However, he begins to miss playing soccer. Aoto and Tagi both join {{at the same time}} and can once again watch over each other on the field.|$|R
60|$|Miles Hendon was picturesque enough before <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{into the}} riot on London Bridge--he was more so <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out of it. He had <b>but</b> little money <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> in, {{none at all}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out. The pickpockets had {{stripped}} him of his last farthing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; we {{must have}} it over," [...] replied Dave, getting up with a brave, effort. Truly, if he carried that {{determined}} front to his lady-love he would look like a masterful lover. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to the door he did not at all resemble a conqueror.|$|E
6000|$|And {{she turned}} away, {{and through a}} gate into the meadow. Grimes stood still a moment, {{like a man who}} had been stunned. Then he rushed after her, shouting, [...] "You come back." [...] <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into the meadow, the woman was not there.|$|E
60|$|Not {{once during}} the {{afternoon}} had Toby said anything to Abner of the good fortune that might come to him through old Ben; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> back from the pasture and met Uncle Daniel in the barn, he told him what the old driver had said about Abner.|$|E
500|$|His early {{interests}} included astronomy. He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned {{a telescope}} {{and wanted to}} be an astronomer but lacked the necessary mathematical skills. He developed an interest in reading science fiction and began attending science fiction conventions from about 1963–1964, <b>but</b> stopped <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his first job a few years later. His early reading included the works of H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and [...] "every book you really ought to read", which he later regarded as [...] "getting an education".|$|R
60|$|It {{was harder}} work for John and, indeed, {{while on the}} march he did not venture to exert himself, fearing that the {{movements}} would be noticed by his guards. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> they halted, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{into the middle of}} the group of captives, and tried his best to loosen the cords. Jonas was close beside him.|$|R
50|$|Baby Blood was {{directed}} by Alain Robak who found that the interest in films of the fantastique genre had increased in France, and desired {{to make a film}} in this style as he was a fan of b-movies. Despite a proposed low-budget film, Robak initially had trouble finding producers to back the film, <b>but</b> received help <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> associated with producer Ariel Zeitoun.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked away}} briskly, {{as he said}} the last words; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{to the end of}} the street, instead of {{proceeding}} northwards towards the country, and the cool night-breeze that was blowing from it, he perversely turned southwards towards the filthiest little lanes and courts in the whole neighborhood.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to {{work with}} {{draftsman}} and stenographers, when a curt kindliness filled his voice, he proved to be concentrated, unafraid of responsibility, able to keep many people busy; trained to something besides family tradition and the collegians' naïve belief that it matters who wins the Next Game.|$|E
60|$|Philip agreed, and it {{happened}} that Mildred knew of a boarding-house at Kemp Town where {{they would not be}} charged more than twenty-five shillings a week each. She arranged with Philip to write about rooms, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> back to Kennington he found that she had done nothing. He was irritated.|$|E
50|$|Ryan Veitch had {{nightmares about}} monsters during his childhood, <b>but</b> these stopped <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the dream-monsters tattooed on himself. During a bank robbery, he was {{compelled}} to shoot Mr. Gallagher, but his brothers allowed him to flee, escaping gaol. Realizing the depth of their sacrifice has {{made him want to}} help those around him. Despite this, he is often derided by his friends.|$|R
