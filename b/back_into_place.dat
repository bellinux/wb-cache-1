5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E

After learning of Jack's situation from Sawyer, Kate goes to help, leaving the job of turning on the signal to Sawyer. Charlie squeezes through an opening at the cave and finds Jack, but while doing so, the opening collapses and traps Charlie and Jack inside. Charlie hesitantly pops Jack's shoulder <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> at Jack's request. Jack correctly guesses that Charlie is suffering from withdrawal, and Charlie assures Jack he's okay. Kate desperately tries to dig them out {{along with the other}} castaways, while the two worry about losing oxygen. Charlie sees a moth which leads him to an opening and the pair dig out of the cave.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez entered spring {{practice}} {{after the}} 2008 {{season as the}} front-runner {{to take over the}} starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, a transfer from Arkansas, where he had been the starting quarterback; Mustain, like Sanchez, was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006. By the end of spring practice, Carroll announced Sanchez would be the starting quarterback heading into the fall. During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm-ups prior to practice; trainers immediately put the kneecap <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia. Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks—Carson Palmer, Leinart and Booty—who wished him well and offered general advice.|$|E

25|$|A {{check of}} the pet's gums and skin can {{indicate}} dehydration; gums become tacky and dry and skin does not snap back quickly when pinched if dehydration is present. When the skin at the back is lifted, a dehydrated animal's does not fall <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> quickly. Serious dehydration (loss of 10ndash&12% of body fluids) means the pulled up skin stays there and does not go <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> At this point, the animal may go into shock; dehydration of 12% or more is an immediate medical emergency. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to the body, due to loss of fluids.|$|E

25|$|The {{revolver}} {{featured a}} counter-clockwise rotating cylinder, {{which could be}} opened for loading and ejection by simply pulling back on a catch mounted {{on the left side}} of the frame behind the recoil shield. It was easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder could be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases were removed by simply pushing back on an ejector rod to activate a star extractor. The six-shooter could then be quickly reloaded and the cylinder clicked <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bone-setting in the 18th {{century was}} often {{carried out by}} men, {{specifically}} farriers and blacksmiths, because it required a lot of strength. Mapp's career started out {{when she was a}} young girl. She served as the announcer at her father's booth during local races and fairs. When Mapp started helping her father's patients when he couldn't see them, she often performed amazing feats and treated them better than her father could. Mapp went on to start her own practice and her fame spread. Around 1735, Mapp's fame for fixing decade-old dislocations and fractures brought her to Epsom. Epsom was home to a large number of wealthy families and horse-racing, which provided Mapp with many patients. Even though Mapp had a limited knowledge of anatomy, she had the strength and innate talent for putting dislocations <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Moriscos of {{southern}} Spain had been forcibly converted to Christianity in 1502, {{but under the}} rule of Charles I they had been able to obtain a degree of tolerance from their Christian rulers. They were allowed to practice their former custom, dress, and language, and religious laws were laxly enforced. (However, Charles also passed the Limpieza de sangre, a law that excluded those not of pure Old Christian, non-Jewish blood from public office.) Philip began to put <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> the restrictive laws of generations before and in 1568 the Moriscos rebelled (see Morisco Revolt). The revolt was only put down by Italian troops under Don John of Austria, and even then the Moriscos retreated to the highlands and were not defeated until 1570. The revolt was followed by a massive resettlement program in which 12,000 Christian peasants replaced the Moriscos. In 1609, on the advice of the Duke of Lerma, Philip III expelled the 300,000 Moriscos of Spain.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December 2007, whilst {{playing against}} Arsenal, while going {{to clear a}} ball Terry's foot was stepped on by Emmanuel Eboué and Terry had {{suffered}} 3 broken bones in his foot. He {{was expected to be}} out for at least three months but made a speedy recovery and managed to captain Chelsea to the 2008 League Cup Final against Tottenham, which Chelsea lost 2–1. On 11 May 2008, whilst playing in the last league match of the season against Bolton, he collided with goalkeeper Petr Čech and suffered a partially dislocated elbow, which was eventually put <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> en route to the hospital. This injury did not prevent him playing in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United. The match went to penalties, and Terry missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball missed the goal. Chelsea lost the shootout 6–5, which Terry reacted to by breaking down in tears. On 28 August 2008, Terry was awarded the Defender of The Year award from UEFA at the Champions League group stage draw in Monaco, together with Frank Lampard and Petr Čech, who received the award for their respective positions.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to blunt trauma, penetrating trauma can cause pulmonary contusion. [...] Contusion resulting from penetration by a rapidly moving projectile usually surrounds the path along which the projectile traveled through the tissue. The pressure wave forces tissue {{out of the}} way, creating a temporary cavity; the tissue readily moves <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place,</b> but it is damaged. [...] Pulmonary contusions that accompany gun and knife wounds are not usually severe {{enough to have a}} major effect on outcome; [...] penetrating trauma causes less widespread lung damage than does blunt trauma. An exception is shotgun wounds, which can seriously damage large areas of lung tissue through a blast injury mechanism.|$|E

500|$|In {{the central}} Highlands, power struggles between the Merina and vazimba principalities and later amongst Merina principalities {{over the centuries}} {{inspired}} {{the development of the}} fortified town in Imerina, the central region of the Highlands of Madagascar. The first of these, the ancient Imerina capital of Alasora, was fortified by 16th-century king Andriamanelo, who surrounded the town with thick cob walls (tamboho, made from the mud and dry rice stalks gathered from nearby paddies) and deep trenches (hadivory) to protect the dwellings inside. The entryway through the town wall was protected by an enormous stone disk (vavahady) – five feet in diameter or more – shaded by fig trees (aviavy) symbolic of royalty. The town gate was opened by laboriously rolling the vavahady away from the entryway each morning and <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> again in the evening, a task that required a team of men to accomplish it. [...] This fortified town model was adopted throughout Imerina and is well represented at the historic village of Ambohimanga.|$|E
500|$|Monument 23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period. It appears {{that it was an}} Olmec-style colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure sculpture. If this was {{originally}} a colossal head then it would be the only example known from outside the Olmec heartland. Monument23 is sculpted from andesite and falls {{in the middle of the}} size range for confirmed Olmec colossal heads. It stands [...] high and measures [...] wide by [...] deep. Like the examples from the Olmec heartland, the monument features a flat back. Lee Parsons contested John Graham's identification of Monument23 as a recarved colossal head; he viewed the side ornaments that Graham identified as ears as instead being the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards. Countering this, James Porter has claimed that the recarving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident. Monument23 was damaged in the mid-20th century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result, the top is fragmented, although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
500|$|On February 5, 2015, Woods {{withdrew from}} the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury. Woods stated on his website that it was {{unrelated}} to his previous surgery and he would {{take a break from}} golf until his back healed. He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root. He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> and finished the round. Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time ever Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing {{near the bottom of the}} leaderboard both times. He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2. In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place. Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery, saying it was [...] "just my hip" [...] but offering no specifics.|$|E
