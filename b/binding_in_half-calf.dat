40|$|Background Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) were {{developed}} to treat schizophrenia in adults; however they have been increasingly prescribed (mostly “off-label”) for children and adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone on the binding of serotonin and dopamine receptors in juvenile rat brain regions {{that are involved in}} antipsychotic efficacy. Methods Male and female rats were treated orally with aripiprazole (1 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg), risperidone (0. 3 mg/kg) or vehicle 3 times/day starting from postnatal day 23 (± 1 day) for 20 days. Quantitative autoradiography was performed to examine the receptor binding densities. Results Olanzapine significantly decreased 5 -HT 2 A (5 -HT 2 AR) and 5 -HT 2 C receptor (5 -HT 2 CR) <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex (Cg) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of both male and female rats. In the caudate putamen (CPu), olanzapine attenuated 5 -HT 2 AR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> both genders, and reduced 5 -HT 2 CR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> male rats. Olanzapine increased D 2 receptor (D 2 R) <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the NAcS of male rats, but decreased it in females. Olanzapine increased D 1 receptor (D 1 R) <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the Cg, while aripiprazole decreased D 1 R <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the PFC of males. Aripiprazole significantly reduced 5 -HT 2 AR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the male PFC. Risperidone decreased 5 -HT 2 AR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the PFC of female rats, while attenuating D 1 R <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the PFC and Cg of males. However, APDs have no effects on the binding of serotonin and dopamine transporters. Conclusion This study revealed that aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone affected 5 -HT 2 AR, 5 -HT 2 CR, 5 -HTT, D 1 R and D 2 R <b>bindings</b> differently <b>in</b> the brains of juvenile male and female rats...|$|R

40|$|Schizophrenia {{is thought}} to arise due to a complex {{interaction}} between genetic and environmental factors during early neurodevelopment. We have recently shown that partial genetic deletion of the schizophrenia susceptibility gene neuregulin 1 (Nrg 1) and adolescent stress interact to disturb sensorimotor gating, neuroendocrine activity and dendritic morphology in mice. Both stress and Nrg 1 may have converging effects upon N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) which are implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, sensorimotor gating and dendritic spine plasticity. Using an identical repeated restraint stress paradigm to our previous study, here we determined NMDAR binding across various brain regions in adolescent Nrg 1 heterozygous (HET) and wild-type (WT) mice using [3 H] MK- 801 autoradiography. Repeated restraint stress increased NMDAR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the ventral part of the lateral septum (LSV) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus irrespective of genotype. Partial genetic deletion of Nrg 1 interacted with adolescent stress to promote an altered pattern of NMDAR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex. In the IL, whilst stress tended to increase NMDAR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> WT mice, it decreased <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> Nrg 1 HET mice. However in the DG, stress selectively increased the expression of NMDAR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> Nrg 1 HET mice but not WT mice. These results demonstrate a Nrg 1 -stress interaction during adolescence on NMDAR <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the medial prefrontal cortex...|$|R

40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of muscarinic receptors {{in human}} brain was studied by comparing [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3 H]QNB) <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> postmortem tissue from infants 1 week to 3 {{months of age}} with <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> adult specimens. Saturation analysis with [3 H]QNB and displacement studies with muscarinic antagonists and agonists in tissue homogenates demonstrated that <b>binding</b> sites <b>in</b> the infants' forebrain regions were present in adult or higher than adult concentrations (Bmax). Binding affinity (Kd) and pharmacological characteristics were nearly identical at the two ages. Quantitative receptor autoradiography demonstrated more [3 H]QNB <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the gray matter of infants than adults and revealed a marked {{difference between the two}} ages in the laminar distribution of <b>binding</b> sites <b>in</b> neocortex. In contrast to the adult pattern with higher <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> superficial layers 1 - 3 than in layers 4 - 6, the distribution in the immature cortex was inverted. These results suggest that muscarinic receptors in infants resemble closely those in mature brain. However, the topography of receptors in the immature neocortex is distinct and they are redistributed in a gradient from inside outward during postnatal development...|$|R

In two separate experiments, {{there was a significant}} decrease in striatal D 2 DA receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> caudal striatum from OVX, but not CAST rats 30 min after a single injection of EB. In CAST rats, there was a significant increase in striatal D 2 DA receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> rostral striatum 4 h after injection of EB. There was no effect of EB plus progesterone treatment in either OVX or CAST rats. In addition, CAST rats had significantly lower D 2 DA receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the lateral region of the rostral striatum than did OVX rats. These results show sexually dimorphic and regionally specific effects of estrogen on striatal D 2 DA receptor binding, and a significant sex difference in striatal D 2 DA receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the absence of circulating gonadal hormones. The present findings are discussed in light of previous reports of sex differences in gonadal hormone influences on striatal DA mediated behaviors...|$|R

We studied {{the effect of}} candesartan, a peripheral and central angiotensin II AT 1 -receptor antagonist, on the hormonal and sympathetic response to acute isolation. We pretreated rats with 1 mg/kg/day candesartan for 13 days via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps, followed by 24 -hour isolation in individual metabolic cages. We measured brain, pituitary and adrenal angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor binding by quantitative autoradiography and adrenal hormones and catecholamines by RIA and HPLC. Isolation increased adrenal catecholamines, aldosterone and corticosterone, AT 1 -receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the zona glomerulosa and AT 2 -receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> the adrenal medulla. Candesartan pretreatment decreased adrenal catecholamines, aldosterone and corticosterone, AT 1 -receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> adrenal zona glomerulosa and medulla, pituitary gland and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and AT 2 -receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> adrenal medulla, but increased AT 2 -receptor <b>binding</b> <b>in</b> zona glomerulosa. We conclude that peripheral and central AT 1 -receptor blockade with candesartan decreases the sympatho-adrenal and hormonal response to acute stress. Our results indicate that Ang II is an important stress hormone and suggest that blockade of the physiologically active AT 1 -receptors could influence stress-related disorders...|$|R
