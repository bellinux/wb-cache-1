5|$|Motifs from Apuleius' {{description}} of the Isiac initiation have <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> and reworked in fiction and in esoteric belief systems in modern times, and they thus form {{an important part of}} the Western perception of ancient Egyptian religion.

5|$|The Orkney Movement, a {{political}} party that supported devolution for Orkney {{from the rest of}} Scotland, contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement (a coalition of the Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland).

5|$|Although {{students}} protested Bonfire's {{environmental impact}} since 1970, no {{changes were made}} for decades. In 1990, student Scott Hantman asked the Bonfire leadership to help him address the problem. The group solicited volunteers, and {{in the spring of}} 1991, they planted 400trees. The tradition, Aggie Replant, has <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.|$|E
5|$|For {{the last}} nine months I have kept silence and treated with disdain the charges of disloyalty and {{suggestions}} of treachery made against me in the Press and elsewhere.

5|$|In January 1764 one barge {{experimentally}} carried one load of coal {{from the}} Thames at Oxford up the River Cherwell to Islip and thence {{up the old}} course of the River Ray to Arncott. The coal was landed at Arncott Bridge and delivered thence by wheelbarrows to Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet at Ambrosden House. However, the experiment {{seems not to have}} <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> and did not establish a regular freight trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender and this has <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> in a number of authoritative texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E

5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as an All Black team was touring South Africa, Australia were touring New Zealand. The two tours coincided because Māori players were not able to go to South Africa at the time, meaning the Australians, played against a New Zealand team made up of the best Māori and the reserve non-Māori players, while the South Africans {{encountered}} the best pākehā (non-Māori) players. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand, captained by Johnny Smith, were beaten 11–6 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand then lost their second test 16–9, which gave Australia a Bledisloe Cup series win in New Zealand for the first time. 1949 was an annus horribilis for the All Blacks as they lost all six of their test matches, and the experience of playing two test series simultaneously has not <b>been</b> <b>repeated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{over the}} {{colouration}} of the Mascarene parrot {{has also been}} furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist François-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, {{and the strength of}} these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.|$|E

5|$|Orme (1889 – 17 September 1915) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He {{was trained}} at Kingsclere by John Porter for the 1st Duke of Westminster. As a two-year-old {{he won the}} Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes. As a three-year-old he was not well enough {{to take part in}} the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby, but came back to win the Eclipse Stakes. Orme stayed in {{training}} as a four-year-old and won another Eclipse Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the race twice, a feat that has only <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> four times since. After he had retired from racing, he became a successful sire and was Champion sire of Great Britain in 1899. His son Flying Fox won the Triple Crown and the Eclipse Stakes. Orme also sired Epsom Derby winner Orby and 1000 Guineas winner Witch Elm. His regular jockeys were George Barrett and Morny Cannon.|$|E
5|$|Other notable honours {{bestowed}} upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which {{was presented to}} Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919–20, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{there were}} 50injuries in the state, {{as well as}} at least three deaths. Two of them– a woman in West Hollywood, Florida and a man in Hallandale– were killed when their houses {{collapsed}} from the strong winds. The third death occurred in Sanford when a boy drowned in a flooded stream. There were also unconfirmed reports of a fourth person drowning when his boat capsized west of Bunnell. The hurricane was one of two major hurricanes– a Category3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale– to hit the state in 1950. It was the first time on record that two storms of such intensity hit Florida in the same year, and has only <b>been</b> <b>repeated</b> since in 2004 with hurricanes Charley and Jeanne, and in 2005 with hurricanes Dennis and Wilma.|$|E
