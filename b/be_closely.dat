5|$|Because of its name, Prosaurolophus {{is often}} {{associated}} with Saurolophus. However, this is contentious; some authors have found the animals to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related, whereas others have not, instead finding it closer to Brachylophosaurus, Edmontosaurus, Gryposaurus, and Maiasaura.|$|E
5|$|Since the pigeye shark so {{strongly}} resembles the bull shark, morphology-based phylogenetic studies {{have considered the}} two species to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related. Neither this nor any other arrangement is strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic research, which to date has been inconclusive regarding this shark's evolutionary relationship to other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Some earwig {{specimen}} fossils {{are in the}} extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, {{the former}} dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic.

5|$|Takahashi {{suggests}} that the species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes, as defined by Dutch Mycena specialist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus. Within the section, the North American species M.subfusca appears to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to M.fuscoaurantiaca. M.subfusca may be distinguished by its spindle- to broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia without a narrow neck, club-shaped to irregularly shaped caulocystidia, and lack of pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized that they may <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. Other studies have suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is {{more closely related to}} the two African species. The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago, or as far back as 25.9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data.|$|E

5|$|A 1940 {{expedition}} by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more {{fossils of}} giant crocodilians, {{this time from}} Big Bend National Park in Texas. These specimens were described by Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T. Bird in 1954, under the name Phobosuchus riograndensis. Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to Deinosuchus, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species that turned out to not <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to Tyrannosaurus rex, {{or even a}} direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E
5|$|During data {{collection}} for The Banksia Atlas project, a single presumed natural hybrid between B.prionotes and B.lindleyana (porcupine banksia), with fruit like B.lindleyana but leaves intermediate {{between the two}} parents, was found north of Kalbarri National Park. At the time this was considered an important discovery, as the parent species were thought not to <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related. Mast's analyses, however, place them both in a clade of eight species, though B.lindleyana remains less closely related to B.prionotes than B.hookeriana. Hybrids of B.prionotes with B.menziesii (firewood banksia) have also been produced by artificial means, and presumed natural hybrids have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
