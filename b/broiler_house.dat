The proportion of broilers colonized with VRE decreased in both the test and the control compartments.

40|$|Gas {{production}} in <b>broiler</b> <b>houses</b> and their emissions {{are closely related}} to the microclimate established inside the house according to air temperature, humidity, and velocity. Therefore, the internal house environment is influenced by building typology and ventilation system. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate ammonia emission rates in <b>broiler</b> <b>houses</b> equipped with different ventilation systems (negative or positive pressure) and litter conditions (new or built-up). The environment of six commercial <b>broiler</b> <b>houses</b> was evaluated internal and external NH 3 concentrations. Ventilation rates were recorded to estimate ammonia emission rates. The efficiency of circulation and exhaust fans was assessed, and higher ventilation rates were determined in negative-pressure houses due to the higher flow of the fans. Houses with new litter increased ammonia emission rates along the rearing period, indicating the relationship between gas emissions, bird age and ventilation rates, and presented a typical curve of NH 3 emission increase. Negative-pressure houses with built-up litter presented higher emission rates during the first rearing week due to the high NH 3 concentration during the brooding period, when the ventilation rates required to maintain chick thermal comfort are low.

The number of bacteria and fungi varied in the 6 <b>broiler</b> <b>houses,</b> ranging from 2. 25 x 105 to 2. 17 x 106 for the total number of mesophilic bacteria, between 3. 5 x 104 – 1. 27 x 106 for staphylococci, 7. 4 x 104 – 5. 01 x 105 for streptococci, 3. 5 x 103 – 1. 53 x 104 for gram-negatives and from 1. 67 x 104 to 8. 13 x 104 for fungi, respectively. The number of bacteria and fungi were significantly lower for the younger chicken (p < 0. 05). The proportions of groups with hygienic significance within the total mesophilic bacteria number were: 15. 7 % - 68. 6 % staphylococci, 6. 7 % - 45. 6 % streptococci and 0. 2 % - 4. 5 % gram-negatives.

40|$|ABSTRACT The thermal {{environment}} inside a <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> {{has a great}} influence on animal welfare and productivity during the production phase. Enthalpy is a thermodynamic property that has been proposed to evaluate the internal <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> environment, for being {{an indicator of the}} amount of energy contained in a mixture of water vapor and dry air. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the spatial variability of enthalpy in a <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> during the heating phase using geostatistics. The experiment was conducted in the spring season, in a commercial <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> with heating system consisting of two furnaces that heat the air indirectly, in the first 14 days of the birds' life. It was possible to characterize enthalpy variability using geostatistical techniques, which allowed observing the spatial dependence through kriging maps. The analyses of the maps allowed observing problems in the heating system in regions inside the <b>broiler</b> <b>house,</b> which may cause a thermal discomfort to the animals besides productive and economic losses...|$|E

40|$|Confinement {{buildings}} {{are one of}} the most likely sources of odor in a broiler operation. The buildings must be ventilated, either mechanically with fans or relying on natural airflow, to prevent animal mortality and enhance animal health. Consequently, odors generated within the building are carried to the surrounding environment by the ventilation system. This review addresses the management of those factors that affect the production and removal of odorants in a broiler production operation. Published literature does not specifically discuss odor generation within <b>broiler</b> <b>houses.</b> Several studies deal with ammonia (an odorant gas) or particulate matter (a pollutant thought to carry odorant gases) emissions in <b>broiler</b> <b>houses.</b> These studies are discussed and inferences are made about the generation of odors under similar conditions. Conditions that lead to higher moisture in the litter tend to increase ammonia release, and by inference, more odorant release. Higher litter moisture is presumed to encourage greater microbial degradation of uric acid excreted by the birds into the litter and release more ammonia. Evaporative coolers may produce excess water droplets that fall to the litter rather than evaporate to cool the incoming air. <b>Broiler</b> <b>houses</b> that use misting systems generally have higher moisture content in the litter at the inlet end of the house.

40|$|Abstract. Chicken {{meat and}} egg {{production}} in the Çukurova region of Southern Turkey shows enormous potential for growth. However, high temperatures in summer pose serious difficulties for these types of production.

The change of air temperature from the entry point to the system through the pads, to the exit point of the <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> was investigated in this study. Experiments were carried out in a tunnel-ventilated <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> in the Çukurova region. The <b>broiler</b> <b>house</b> has the capacity to house 15 000 chicks with a floor area of 70 by 12 m.

40|$|The {{introduction}} and survival of zoonotic bacterial pathogens in poultry farming {{have been linked}} to bacterial association with free-living protozoa. To date, however, no information is available on the persistence of protozoan communities in these environments across consecutive rearing cycles and how it is affected by farm- and habitat-specific characteristics and management strategies. We therefore investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of free-living protozoa in three habitats (pipeline, water, and miscellaneous samples) in three commercial poultry houses across three rearing cycles by using the molecular fingerprinting technique denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Our study provides strong evidence for the long-term (ca. 6 -month) persistence of protozoa in <b>broiler</b> <b>houses</b> across consecutive rearing cycles.
