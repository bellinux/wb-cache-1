40|$|Bergamot (Citrus bergamia, Risso et Poiteau) {{cultivation}} {{started in}} Italy {{at the beginning}} of the 18 th century. Italian bergamot production is limited in a narrow strip of the Calabrian coast, along the Ionian and the Thyrrenian seas. Bergamot is cultivated for the essential oil representing an important raw material for cosmetic and food industry. Among non-volatile fraction components of the <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil</b> there are coumarins, whose fluorescence was widely investigated in the past. Because of their structural diversity and diverse occurrence, these oxygenated heterocyclic compounds have an important role in the identification of the quality and genuineness of the <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil.</b> This review reports spectrofluorometric properties of <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil.</b> From excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis of <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil</b> solutions in ethanol characteristic emissions of citropten, linalyl acetate and that of chlorophills have been detected.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{essential}} oils of ten different plant species, at rates {{of one and}} two ml per kg of plain bait, on bait acceptance and palatability in choice feeding tests for Swiss mice was studied under controlled laboratory conditions.

Also, the use of these oils would be to prolong utility value of baits and reduce the use of antifungal ingredients, which usually reduce bait acceptance. Cinnamon and anise essential oils, commonly used as attractants, and clove oil, showed the best effects, because that they did not negatively affect bait acceptance and palatability, while fenchel and <b>bergamot</b> <b>oils</b> showed repellent action which became more pronounced as the content of oil in baits increased...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} citrus peel <b>oils</b> (orange, lemon, <b>bergamot)</b> as food supplementation in different levels on performance, microflora and morphology in broilers. The trial consisted of 1 -day-old male and female Ross 308 chicks (250 male 250 female). The study consisted of 10 groups in total and each group was replicated five times. Experimental diets were prepared by adding orange, lemon and <b>bergamot</b> peel <b>oil</b> levels (1, 2 and 3 mL/kg) to basal diet. It was observed that the supplementation of citrus peel oils to the diet improved significantly the feed conversion rate. Especially the lowest feed intake and the best feed conversion ratio were received from broilers which were fed 3 mL/kg of orange peel oil. The study shows that the count of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and lactic acid bacteria in the jejunum decreased significantly with the supplementation of <b>bergamot</b> peel <b>oil</b> to broilers diets. Citrus peel oil, in contrast to <b>bergamot</b> peel <b>oil,</b> significantly increased lactic acid bacteria count. The highest lactic acid bacteria count was determined in birds fed 3 mL/kg with orange peel oil. In {{the result of this}} study, both the length and density of villi and the density of blood and lymphatic capillary in the jejunum increased significantly by dietary 3 mL/kg orange peel oil supplementation. Finally, our results indicate that, especially 3 mL/kg orange peel oil has positive effects on performance, jejunum microflora, and jejunum morphology. It could be advised to supply broilers feed with 3 mL/kg orange peel oil as feed additives...|$|R

40|$|People use aromatherapy {{to relieve}} the {{symptoms}} of physical and psychological stress. However, previous studies have not precisely clarified a scientific basis for the beneficial effects of aromatherapy. Therefore, the overall {{purpose of this study}} was to elucidate the beneficial effect of aromatherapy in relieving work-related stress. Twenty-nine elementary school teachers from Taiwan participated in this study. The experimental procedures comprised 2 phases. First, we verified the effect of aromatherapy by conducting 2 blind tests. We used natural <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil</b> extracted from plants and synthesized a chemical essential oil as the placebo to do the aromatherapy. Second, we analyzed the performance of the aromatherapy treatment on the teachers who had various workloads. We measured the teachers’ heart rate variability to evaluate their autonomic nervous system activity. The results show that only the natural <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil</b> had an effect and that the aromatherapy treatment relieved work-related stress of teachers with various workloads. However, the aromatherapy treatment had a weak effect on young teachers who had a heavy workload. Moreover, the aromatherapy treatment exhibited no effect on teachers who belong to the abnormal body mass index subgroup having a heavy workload...|$|R
40|$|Citrus extracts, {{particularly}} <b>bergamot</b> essential <b>oil</b> (BEO) and its fractions, {{have been}} found to exhibit anticancer efficacy. However, the poor water solubility, low stability and limited bioavailability have prevented the use of BEO in cancer therapy. To overcome such drawbacks, we formulated BEO liposomes that improved the water solubility of the phytocomponents and increased their anticancer activity in vitro against human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. The results warrant further investigation of BEO liposomes for in vivo applications. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
