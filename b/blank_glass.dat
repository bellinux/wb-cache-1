On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments.

50|$|During the Roman period, moulds {{consisting}} {{of two or more}} interlocking parts were used to create <b>blank</b> <b>glass</b> dishes. Glass could be added to the mould either by frit casting, where the mould was filled with chips of glass (called frit) and then heated to melt the glass, or by pouring molten glass into the mould. Evidence from Pompeii suggests that molten hot glass may have been introduced as early as the mid-1st century CE. Blank vessels were then annealed, fixed to lathes and cut and polished on all surfaces to achieve their final shape. Pliny the Elder indicates in his Natural History (36.193) that lathes were used in the production of most glass of the mid-1st century.|$|E

40|$|Antireflective sub-wavelength {{structures}} {{with high}} laser-induced damage threshold on fused silica are fabricated using a self-assembly technique, {{in which a}} porous yttrium oxide film is deposited as a mask followed by alkaline etching. By controlling the etching time, several sub-wavelength structures with different height, density and diameter have been made. The best reflectance is less than 2. 87 % for wavelengths from 300 to 1000 nm after 1. 5 h etching. The laser-induced damage threshold of the etched glass measured by a 10 ns Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 532 nm was as high as 30 J/cm(2) compared to 16 J/cm(2) of <b>blank</b> <b>glass.</b> The specular reflectance of structures matches the theoretical simulation using a thin-film multilayer model, and the results reveal that {{the shape of the}} structures is similar to the calculated parabolic shape.

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{system has been}} designed to survive spaceflight and to function autonomously on the Martian surface. It manipulates microscopic quantities of liquid water and performs chemical analyses on these samples to assay for the presence of molecules associated with past or present living processes. This technology lies {{at the core of the}} Urey Instrument, which is scheduled for inclusion on the Pasteur Payload of the ESA ExoMars rover mission in 2013. Fabrication processes have been developed to make the microfabricated Teflon-AF microfluidic diaphragm pumps capable of surviving extreme temperature excursions before and after exposure to liquid water. Two glass wafers are etched with features and a continuous Teflon membrane is sandwiched between them (see figure). Single valves are constructed using this geometry. The microfabricated devices are then post processed by heating the assembled device while applying pneumatic pressure to force the Teflon diaphragm against the valve seat while it is softened. After cooling the device, the embossed membrane retains this new shape. This solves previous problems with bubble introduction into the fluid flow where deformations of the membrane at the valve seat occurred during device bonding at elevated temperatures (100 - 150 C). The use of laminated membranes containing commercial Teflon AF 2400 sheet sandwiched between spun Teflon AF 1600 layers performed best, and were less gas permeable than Teflon AF 1600 membranes on their own. Spinning Teflon AF 1600 solution (6 percent in FLOURINERT(Registered TradeMark) FC 40 solvent, 3 M Company) at 500 rpm for 1. 5 seconds, followed by 1, 000 rpm for 3 seconds onto Borofloat glass wafers, results in a 10 -micron-thick film of extremely smooth Teflon AF. This spinning process is repeated several times on flat, <b>blank,</b> <b>glass</b> wafers in order to gradually build a thick, smooth membrane. After running this process at least five times, the wafer and Teflon coating are heated under vacuum at 220 C for one hour in order to drive off any residual solvent present in the composite film.

This paper presents an integrated microfluidic planar reactor for visible-light photocatalysis with the merits of fine flow control, short reaction time, small sample volume, and long photocatalyst durability. One additional feature is that it enables one to use both {{the light and the}} heat energy of the light source simultaneously. The reactor consists of a BiVO 4 -coated glass as the substrate, a <b>blank</b> <b>glass</b> slide as the cover, and a UV-curable adhesive layer as the spacer and sealant. A blue light emitting diode panel (footprint 10 [*]mm[*]×[*] 10 [*]mm) is mounted on the microreactor to provide uniform irradiation over the whole reactor chamber, ensuring optimal utilization of the photons and easy adjustments of the light intensity and the reaction temperature.

40|$|Abstract. Titanium {{in normal}} melting {{conditions}} in air atmosphere present as Ti 4 + ion in basic silicate glasses exhibited an ultra-violet cut-off in silicate glasses, viz. soda–magnesia–silica, soda–magnesia–lime– silica and soda–lime–silica glasses. This indicates that Ti 4 + ion {{can be a}} good replacement for Ce 4 + ion in pro-ducing UV-absorbing silicate glasses for commercial applications. The wavelength maxima at which the infi-nite absorption takes place in glasses was found to be around 310 nm against Ti-free <b>blank</b> <b>glass</b> in UV-region. The mechanism of electronic transition from O 2 – ligands to Ti 4 + ion was suggested as L ® M charge transfer. The low energy tails of the ultra-violet cut-off were found to obey Urbach’s rule in the optical range 360 – 500 nm. The fluorescence spectra of these glasses were also studied and based on the radiative fluorescent properties it was suggested that the soda–lime–silica glass containing Ti 4 + ion with greater emission cross-section would emit a better fluorescence than the corresponding oda–ma nesia–lime–silica and soda– magnesia–silica glasses. The shift of emission wavelengths maxima towards longer wavelength in titania introduced silicate glasses was observed on replacement of MgO by CaO which may be attributed due to an increase in basicity of the glass system...|$|E

40|$|Sulfur-containing {{compounds}} are well-known catalyst poisons. To {{evaluate the}} feasibility of photocatalytic technology for indoor air purification, a typical atmospheric SO 2 concentration of 200 parts per billion (ppb) was selected. In order to further evaluate the impact of SO 2 on the photocatalytic activity of other typical indoor air pollutants, SO 2 was co-injected with 200 ppb NO and 20 ppb benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene (BTEX) using TiO 2 (P- 25) as photocatalyst coated on a glass fiber filter. A concurrent photodegradation of SO 2 with NO, SO 2 with BTEX, and SO 2 with NO and BTEX was also conducted. Results showed that no photodegradation of SO 2 was found. However, the <b>blank</b> <b>glass</b> fiber filter adsorbed more than 75 % of the SO 2. The conversion of NO decreased by 8 % and the generation of NO 2 increased by 10 % {{with the presence of}} SO 2. A similar inhibition effect was found on the photodegradation of BTEX with the presence of SO 2. The presence of SO 2 decreased the conversion of BTEX by more than 10 %. Ion chromatography analysis on the TiO 2 glass fiber filter showed that sulfate ion was formed from the adsorption of SO 2. The formation of sulfate ion inhibited the formation of nitrate ion, which increased the generation of NO 2. It is suggested that the inhibition effect of SO 2 is due to the sulfate ion competing with the pollutant for adsorption sites on TiO 2. The promotion effect of NO on BTEX was also reduced by the presence of SO 2. Department of Applied PhysicsDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a self-cleaning catalytic coating for application on domestic oven windows. The thin, optically transparent coating should be able to remove food stains on the window pane by catalytic oxidation at temperatures as low as 250 &# 176;C. The purpose is to increase the visibility through the window in order to monitor the cooking progress, as well as to reduce the effort to clean the window manually. Previous research in this area yielded catalytic coatings that are very active at low temperature, but these could only be applied on the walls of domestic oven because of their thickness and non-transparency. On the other hand, research on thin, transparent coatings for windows focused mainly on heating devices that operate at temperatures far above the normal cooking temperatures in ovens. In this thesis, a protocol is established to screen a broad range of catalytic compositions for application on oven windows. Based on a modified citric acid complexation method, thin, optically transparent oxide coatings are synthesized on commercial glass substrates. Their performance is evaluated in the oxidation of a thin layer of pre-oxidized lipid at 250 &# 176;C, as followed by FTIR and visual/UV-Vis spectroscopic inspection. Based on both evaluation methods, manganese and mixed manganese-ceria oxide coatings with a thickness of around 35 nm are selected as the most promising ones: they combine an excellent activity for oxidative removal of the contaminant with the desired optical characteristics. Optimization of the manganese based oxide reveals that the introduction of mesopores increases the catalytic activity of the coating and that 10 to maximally 20 mol% of ceria intimately mixed with MnOx shows a synergistic catalytic effect. The mixed Mn-Ce oxide is studied {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms involved in the oxidative removal of the organic contaminants. Surface analysis revealed that during reaction with the contaminant the valence of the manganese oxide decreased from its initial value between + 3 and + 4. A less pronounced reduction in the presence of ceria suggests the transfer of lattice oxygen from ceria to Mn oxide which would explain the higher activity of the mixed oxide. Nevertheless, the reoxidation of the oxide by gas phase oxygen at 250 &# 176;C seems to be the rate limiting step. Gas analysis indicates that ca. 3 times as much CO 2 is produced on the catalyst-coated glass than on a <b>blank</b> <b>glass</b> slide in oxygen atmosphere. The liquid phase products resemble those of a catalyzed liquid phase autoxidation, with too high catalyst concentrations inhibiting the conversion of the lipid. Therefore, an oxidation mechanism involving elements of a Mars  van Krevelen mechanism and a metal ion catalyzed liquid phase mechanism is proposed. The performance of the selected catalyst is further tested with more severe contamination. From a certain loading on, the catalytic oxidation is too slow to remove the organic contaminants totally. Heat-induced and transition metal ion catalysed radical polymerisation reactions occur in the oil, leading to unwanted browning of the oily contaminant. Several approaches are investigated to reduce the darkening of a thick oil drop when applied on the catalytic coating. The creation of an oleophilic catalytic surface and the addition of an oxygen-diffusing underlayer were examined. Since the browning of the oil is correlated with the direct contact of the oil with the catalyst, the addition of an inert, porous oleophilic top layer and the addition of a permeable oleophobic top layer were tested. The browning of oil on the oleophobic surface is dependent on which wetting regime applies (Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter). Overall, in case of overloading of the catalyst, it seems difficult to achieve good catalytic activity without browning of the oil contaminant. nrpages: 240 status: publishe...|$|E

With this the conventional process step "pressing" should be replaced in terms of cost and time savings and as part of small series. The selected additive process was powder bed 3 D printing (3 DP). The 3 DP of glass powders in technical applications was a novelty, so that experiences in the field of ceramics allowed the introduction to the problem and their development for glass. The challenge was to maintain comparable properties of the <b>blanks</b> for sintered <b>glass</b> bodies despite {{the differences between the two}} shaping processes pressing and 3 DP. The shaping- pressure used in pressing is not available in 3 DP. Required density and porosity have to be achieved by a suitable particle size distribution of the starting materials. Development of a processing method for glass powder and a binder system of liquid and solid components were important contributions to that. Glasspowder with particle size distributions from < 165 µm with 20 % to 30 % fines (2 - 3 µm) made the best results. The shrinkage of the <b>blanks</b> of sintered <b>glass</b> bodies during the binding and sintering process was 18 % to 20 %. It depends on geometry and allowed the accurate setting of the required CAD data (*. stl).

50|$|After {{completing}} his studies Per B. Sundberg {{established himself as}} glass and ceramic artist. He creates mostly unique art objects or public art, since 2005 full-time in his own studio in Gustavsberg. After training at Konstfack, he and some fellow students established a glass studio on the islets Fjäderholmarna, at the inlet to Stockholm. Here Sundberg blew glass, inter alia together with his colleagues Gunilla Kihlgren and Mårten Medbo. During the years 1994-2005, Per B. Sundberg was an employee at Orrefors glassworks. His glass art also attracted international attention and purchases, including by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. During his time at Orrefors glassworks, Sundberg developed new glass techniques. The Fabula technique is based on Orrefors classic graal technique. Heat-resistant decals are pasted on a cylindrical <b>glass</b> <b>blank.</b> The <b>glass</b> <b>blank</b> is heated, overlaid with clear glass and blown to the desired basic shape. Still hot, the object is then formed using metal tools. Artistic themes are flora and fauna, as well as celebrities. The Litograal technique is similar, in which the decals are replaced with black and white copies from comic books, often of a sexual nature. Sometimes Sundberg makes the glass surface opaque and polishes windows into the subject. In connection with the transfer of ownership of the Orrefors Kosta Boda glassworks in 2005, Sundberg left Orrefors and {{was hired as a}} professor at the Konstfack Department of Design, Crafts and Arts.In parallel with the work at Konstfack, Sundberg has worked in his own studio at the old premises of the Gustavsberg porcelain factory. When operations ceased at the factory, a number of independent artists moved into the premises, including Sundberg. An important element in Sundberg’s artistic process is to use materials that others have left: clays, glazes, decals and figurines. These then form the palette of his creativity.Sundberg is constantly looking for new expressions and to test the limits of materials. In the studio, he has developed new ceramic materials, including clays and glazes from the old factory. Sundberg combines figurines, found at flea markets, with a self-constructed foundation.
