500|$|The album {{features}} a five song-medley, which {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, McCartney said that it was previously [...] "something I wanted to revisit" [...] as [...] "nobody had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> for a while." [...] The medley was a set of intentionally written material, whereas the medley that McCartney had worked on on the Beatles' Abbey Road was actually made up of [...] "bits we had knocking around." [...] The medley starts off with [...] "Vintage Clothes", which McCartney [...] "sat down one day" [...] to write, that was [...] "looking back, [...] looking back.", about life. It was followed by the bass-led [...] "That Was Me", which is about his [...] "school days and teachers", the medley, as McCartney stated, then [...] "progressed from there." [...] The next songs are [...] "Feet in the Clouds", about the inactivity while one is growing up, and [...] "House of Wax", about the life of being a celebrity. The final song in medley, [...] "The End of the End", was written at McCartney's Cavendish Avenue home while playing on his father, Jim's, piano.|$|E
500|$|On May 2, 2013, Jeff Hanneman died {{of liver}} failure in a Los Angeles hospital. A week later, the {{official}} {{cause of death}} was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of condition until shortly before his death. King has announced his desire for the band to continue, but Araya was more uncertain, stating, [...] "After 30 years, it would literally be like starting over," [...] and expressing doubts that Slayer's fanbase would approve of such a change. In March 2015, Araya revealed that the band had recorded one song prior to Hanneman's passing, and that the song would appear on the album. The result was the song [...] "Piano Wire". Araya explained that Hanneman would be a part on the album when King later dismissed the claim saying, [...] "Jeff Hanneman isn't physically playing on this record. Somebody reported some bullshit. People say shit when they don't know what's actually going on. Even though Jeff's song, [...] "Piano Wire", was recorded during the last album cycle, I played all the guitar. I've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> for years. Since he has no lead on that song, he's not on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronstadt has {{remarked that}} in the {{beginning}} of her career she [...] "was so focused on folk, rock and country" [...] that she [...] "got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ... <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> ever since." [...] By 1983, her estimated worth was over $40 million mostly from records, concerts and merchandising.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{returns to}} the office and chats to his co-worker, Charlotte, with whom they share a very fond friendship, albeit a totally platonic one. Charlotte, openly a devout Christian {{frequently}} reading her Bible, lends Stewart a video of a programme she recorded, Songs That Changed My Life. Stewart agrees to please Charlotte, and returns home to the flat he shares with his sister, Imogen. After Imogen goes out for the evening, Stewart puts the video on. The programme is a religious one consisting exclusively of Christian songs that various obscure Christian figures find uplifting, and Stewart is barely interested – until the programme ends. Then the video returns to what was partly recorded over – a pornographic video – [...] and Stewart watches in amazement. Imogen, in the meantime, spends the whole evening waiting for a date from a dating agency who fails to turn up. When Imogen returns home, both she and Stewart lie about what they have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> evening.|$|E

In the morning, however, all this is changed. As they take their places at their desks and open their books, a dull, heavy feeling takes possession of the boys, and the full consciousness that they are at the beginning of another half year's work weighs heavily on their minds.|$|E
