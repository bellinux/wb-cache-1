5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} plume of {{condensing}} steam was observed, leading some media people to assume there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume. The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.|$|E
5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{number of}} {{attempts}} to resurrect the Restoration spectacular as a background to modern cinema: Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen features at its start perhaps the most accurate reconstruction, with painted scenery, mechanisms and lighting effects typical of the period.|$|E

5|$|Although Ferugliotherium {{teeth are}} much lower-crowned {{than those of}} the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} similar pattern on the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E
5|$|Colpoys {{immediately}} {{ordered his}} squadron to give chase and at 12:00 the strange ships {{were identified as}} a squadron of French frigates. The French ships were the 36-gun Gloire, Gentille and Fraternité, led by Captain Beens of Gloire and on a three-month raiding cruise from Brest in the Bay of Biscay that had so-far been uneventful: the only prize taken had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> Spanish merchant brig. Beens quickly discovered the danger his squadron was in, and gave orders for them to sail westwards away from the British squadron. However, the wind favoured Colpoys and his vastly superior squadron rapidly gained on the French frigates. The first British ship to come within range was the 74-gun HMS Colossus under Captain John Monkton, which managed to exchange distant gunfire with the rearmost French ship before the gap widened once more.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of microgrants; one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{sum of money}} (~US$50-500) granted to an {{individual}} to start an income-generating project, another <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> grant (~$2,000-$10,000) to a community for an impact-oriented projects and <b>a</b> third <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> grant to <b>an</b> individual for any cause they see fit.|$|R
5|$|The {{open cup}} nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against {{potential}} predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically {{of three to}} five eggs, is incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, although there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

25|$|The {{submarine}} {{force has}} always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{fraction of the}} active Navy. During World War II all submariners (including the rear echelon) accounted for less than two percent of Navy personnel, but accounted for 55 percent of Japan's merchant marine losses. In 1998 only about seven percent of the Navy's people were submariners, though they operated one-third of the Navy's warships.|$|E
25|$|Rubashkin brought modern {{industrial}} {{methods to}} what has historically <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> almost boutique craft, developing retail-ready glatt kosher products being sold both in supermarkets and in small, local grocery stores and meat markets around the United States. Agriprocessors was the largest (glatt) kosher meat producer in the United States {{and the only one}} authorized by Israel's Orthodox rabbinate to export beef to Israel.|$|E
25|$|Historically city-dwellers have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{proportion}} of humanity overall, but today, following {{two centuries of}} unprecedented and rapid urbanization, {{half of the world}} population is said to live in cities. This has profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas - creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centers for employment, entertainment, and edification. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions.|$|E

25|$|Scales Mound {{has always}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> {{agricultural}} community {{and development of}} the village and the buildings in the historic district was closely tied to the arrival of the railroad. Most of the few commercial businesses in Scales Mound were concentrated around the railroad right-of-way. The Scales Mound Historic District is roughly bounded by the corporate limits of the village itself. The district includes the original 1854 limits of the village plus three additions to the village that were platted later.|$|E
25|$|Laumer {{also made}} several {{controversial}} changes to Oz. He married off {{several of the}} major characters, often to unlikely prospects. For example, the intelligent and mature sorceress Glinda was married to Button Bright, who had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> and dim-witted child throughout Baum's books. He also aged Dorothy to a teenager to make her a romantic prospect for several characters, made Ozma a lesbian based on her upbringing as a boy, and made the Shaggy Man an ephebophile based on his frequent travels with young girls.|$|E
25|$|The new dynasty {{moved the}} capital of Thonburi to Rattanakosin, today's Bangkok. Bangkok had {{previously}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> settlement with a fort, but it was strategically located on the eastern shores of the Chao Phraya river and was known among the foreign traders as the 'key to Siam'. New palaces and temples were built. The Emerald Buddha and Wat Phra Kaeo were founded. The king's goal was to transfer the old splendor of Ayutthaya to the new capital. In his new capital, Rama I crowned himself in 1785 in a splendid ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> inner court in {{this corner of}} the Enderûn Courtyard. This court led through the Kuşhane Gate into the harem. Today this is the gate from which the {{visitors}} exit from the Harem. Birds were raised for the sultan's table in the buildings around the gate. On the inscription over the Kuşhane door one reads that Mahmud I had {{the kitchen of the}} Kuşhane repaired. The balcony of the aviary facing the Harem Gate was constructed during repair work in 1916. The building's facade resembles traditional aviaries.|$|E
25|$|Cornwall's {{population}} was 537,400 {{at the last}} census, with a population density of 144 people per square kilometre, ranking it 40th and 41st respectively among the 47 counties of England. Cornwall's {{population was}} 95.7% White British and has a relatively high level of population growth. At 11.2% in the 1980s and 5.3% in the 1990s, it had the fifth-highest population growth rate of the counties of England. The natural change has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> population decline, and the population increase is due to inward migration into Cornwall. According to the 1991 census, the population was 469,800.|$|E
25|$|In {{the delta}} itself, Caesar makes a passing {{comment about the}} Insula Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi") in the Rhine river, without {{discussing}} who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region. Much later Tacitus wrote that they had originally been a tribe of the Chatti, a tribe in Germany never mentioned by Caesar. However, archaeologists find evidence of continuity, and suggest that the Chattic group may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> group, moving into a pre-existing (and possibly non-Germanic) people, who could even {{have been part of}} a known group such as the Eburones.|$|E
