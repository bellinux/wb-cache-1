40|$|Most people opt to use {{natural and}} {{traditional}} methods instead of chemical drugs and intrusive methods {{of modern medicine}} to treat minor illnesses and disorders of children or newborns. Since gastrointestinal, infectious, and respiratory diseases are the most significant diseases in children, this review article sought to identify and report the native medicinal plants of Iran which {{have been used to}} treat gastrointestinal disorders in children. For this study, the key words consisting of digestion, children, medicinal plants, traditional medicine, and Iran were used to search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Islamic Science Citation Center, and Magiran and relevant articles were selected. The findings indicated that in Iran, nine medicinal plants, Foeniculum vulgaris, Pimpinella anisum, Acorus calamus, Anethum graveolens, Zingiber officinalis, Lavandula officinalis, Capiscum minimum, Mentha piperita, and Carum carvi are used to treat gastrointestinal disorders in children. These plants contain phenolic and antioxidant compounds, which could be used to prevent and treat <b>bloat,</b> <b>colic,</b> and anorexia...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the gastrointestinal responses {{of children and}} adults following consumption of sucrose, isomalt and lycasin HBC and to compare these at two different dose levels in adults. Design: Both studies were randomised, double-blind, cross-over designs. Subjects: Fifty-one children aged 6 - 9 y were recruited from primary schools in the Salford area of Greater Manchester. Forty-eight children completed the study. Fifty healthy adult volunteers aged 18 - 24 y were recruited from the student population of the University of Salford. All subjects completed the study. Interventions: Children consumed either 25 g of sucrose, isomalt or lycasin HBC and adults 25 and 40 g in hard boiled sweets per day for two consecutive test days. Test periods of 2 days were separated by 7 day washout periods. Children consumed sweets throughout test days and adults in no less than 30 min {{but no more than}} 90 min. Subjects reported the prevalence and magnitude of flatulence, borborygmi, <b>bloating,</b> <b>colic,</b> bowel movements and watery faeces. Results: Consumption of 25 g isomalt provoked a mild laxative effect in children but not in adults. Consumption of 25 g isomalt significantly increased the prevalence and magnitude of gastrointestinal responses in both children and adults. Consumption of 25 g lycasin HBC significantly increased borborygml in children and adults but no other gastrointestinal responses. Consumption of 40 g lycasin HBC or isomalt by adults significantly increased the mean frequency of bowel movements and the number of subjects passing watery faeces. In adults, 40 g isomalt and lycasin HBC provoked significantly more gastrointestinal responses compared to 25 g of either product. Conclusions: Consumption of 25 g lycasin HBC does not provoke an unacceptable laxative effect or gastrointestinal response in children or adults compared to 25 g isomalt, which is associated with a mild laxative effect and increase in gastrointestinal responses. In adults gastrointestinal responses following consumption of products were found to be dose dependent...|$|R
50|$|For {{over forty}} years Darwin {{suffered}} intermittently from various combinations of symptoms such as: malaise, vertigo, dizziness, muscle spasms and tremors, vomiting, cramps and <b>colics,</b> <b>bloating</b> and nocturnal intestinal gas, headaches, alterations of vision, severe tiredness, nervous exhaustion, dyspnea, skin {{problems such as}} blisters all over the scalp and eczema, crying, anxiety, sensation of impending death and loss of consciousness, fainting, tachycardia, insomnia, tinnitus, and depression. These symptoms displayed by Darwin may have been diagnosed today {{as a form of}} dysautonomia known as hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or orthostatic intolerance.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the gastrointestinal (GI) responses of young adults following consumption of 45 g sucrose, 20, 35 and 50 g xylitol or erythritol given as a single oral, bolus dose in a liquid. Design: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects: Seventy healthy adult volunteers aged 18 – 24 years were recruited from the student population of the University of Salford. Sixty-four subjects completed the study. Interventions: Subjects consumed at home without supervision and in random order, either 45 g sucrose or 20, 35 and 50 g erythritol or xylitol in water on individual test days, while maintaining their normal diet. Test days were separated by 7 -day washout periods. Subjects reported the prevalence and magnitude of flatulence, borborygmi, <b>bloating,</b> <b>colic,</b> bowel movements and the passage of faeces of an abnormally watery consistency. Results: Compared with 45 g sucrose, consumption of a single oral, bolus dose of 50 g xylitol in water significantly {{increased the number of}} subjects reporting nausea (P< 0. 01), bloating (P< 0. 05), borborygmi (P< 0. 005), colic (P< 0. 05), watery faeces (P< 0. 05) and total bowel movement frequency (P< 0. 01). Also 35 g of xylitol increased significantly bowel movement frequency to pass watery faeces (P< 0. 05). In contrast, 50 g erythritol only significantly increased the number of subjects reporting nausea (P< 0. 01) and borborygmi (P< 0. 05). Lower doses of 20 and 35 g erythritol did not provoke a significant increase in GI symptoms. At all levels of intake, xylitol produced significantly more watery faeces than erythritol: resp. 50 g xylitol vs 35 g erythritol (P< 0. 001), 50 g xylitol vs 20 g erythritol (P< 0. 001) and 35 g xylitol vs 20 g erythritol (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: When consumed in water, 35 and 50 g xylitol was associated with significant intestinal symptom scores and watery faeces, compared to the sucrose control, whereas at all levels studied erythritol scored significantly less symptoms. Consumption of 20 and 35 g erythritol by healthy volunteers, in a liquid, is tolerated well, without any symptoms. At the highest level of erythritol intake (50 g), only a significant increase in borborygmi and nausea was observed, whereas xylitol intake at this level induced a significant increase in watery faeces...|$|R
40|$|Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} common mental {{disorders}} which is classified in temper mood disorders. In traditional medicine, ginger is used to increase memory and cure vomiting, <b>bloating,</b> indigestion, <b>colic,</b> and abdominal pain. Current study was carried to compare ginger extract and imipramine effects on reducing depression symptoms. Sixty mature mice in the weight range of 25 to 30 g were divided into six groups: control, depression, imipramine, and 50, 100, 200 mg/ml of ginger’s hydro alcoholic extract which was injected intraperitoneal. In the morning of experiment, desired drug was injected and after 55 minutes, suspension test was carried out. Forced swimming and tail suspension test was done One hour after suspension test. Immobility and mobility time was measured as depression index. Obtained data were analyzed using SPSS program. In both tests, results showed that ginger extract in 200 mg/kg doses increased mobility time and movement activity of animal significantly in proportion to control and imipramine groups (p< 0. 05) which shows depression reduction. According to results, ginger’s extract in 200 mg/kg dose can be a good replacement for imipramine. Keywords: ginger, depression, imipramine, laboratory mic...|$|R
