5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and <b>broadcast</b> <b>technology,</b> have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E

40|$|The {{convergence}} {{of services and}} technologies {{has been driven by}} service and network providers with the aim to develop a unified infrastructure. From the services side, we have multimedia through unicast, multicast and broadcast services. From the technologies side, we have wired and wireless technologies, including unidirectional technologies such as Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB). These trends allied to the increasing mobility and QoS demands, introduce strong requirements to future telecommunication networks. This paper presents an innovative approach to handle multicast services in a heterogeneous networks environment, including <b>broadcast</b> <b>technologies.</b> The presented architecture aims at guaranteeing end-to-end QoS in mobile scenarios, efficiently handling the underlying network resources and integrating the emerging <b>broadcast</b> <b>technologies.</b> This architecture was developed in a real environment with mobility of multicast sessions through heterogeneous technologies, W i-Fi and DVB, using also Wi-Fi as a return channel. The results show that the architecture is able to support the seamless mobility of users receiving multicast sessions, with low degradation on the running communications...|$|R

40|$|Although mass {{entertainment}} markets, such {{as entertainment}} TV, were previously {{on the control}} of broadcast operators, the increased interest in supporting these multimedia services "anywhere and anyhow" is driving the interest of wireless operators. Therefore, the integration of <b>broadcast</b> <b>technologies</b> {{in the next generation}} networks is now a reality. However, since <b>broadcast</b> <b>technologies</b> are unidirectional, their use in mobile interactive communications requires the support of other technologies to enable the upstream communication through a return channel. This paper presents an experimental setup of the architecture developed in the framework of the IST-Daidalos project that is able to provide multimedia and interactive services through a heterogeneous network integrating DVB technology, and enabling seamless and media independent handovers with QoS support. The experimental testbed contains DVB, UMTS, Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi with WiMAX as backhaul technology, and supports se amless handovers with QoS between these technologies, integrating also handover of different return channels. The results show that the handover impact is more noticeable in handovers to DVB and UMTS technologies, when compared to Wi-Fi and WiMAX ones. Nevertheless, when the network is not overloaded, the handover timings do not exceed 200 msec. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
