50|$|Returning to the Dundee and Newtyle line, an Act was {{obtained}} on 21 July 1859 to build <b>by-pass</b> <b>lines.</b> The Balbeuchly incline was avoided by {{the construction of}} a line from Rosemill to Auchterhouse; it had a new station at Dronley and Auchterhouse station was relocated. It opened on 1 November 1860. The Lochee deviation ran from Ninewells Junction to Fairmuir Junction, opening on 10 June 1861. This long westward sweep avoided the Law tunnel and incline, and gave better access to the harbour through the Dundee and Perth station in Union Street. Crossroads and Ward stations were closed, and new stations were opened on the deviation at Lochee, Lochee West, Liff.|$|R
5000|$|... 1889 A {{bypass line}} opened on 1 June 1889 between Hindley and Pemberton, passing {{to the south}} of Wigan. This allowed a faster journey for the L&YR's Manchester - Liverpool expresses by {{avoiding}} Wigan station. Express trains from Liverpool continued to serve Wigan on the route to Bury, Rochdale and West Yorkshire. The <b>by-pass</b> <b>line</b> was also used by freight trains to and from Liverpool Docks, which benefited by avoiding the Wigan L&YR station area.|$|E
50|$|The current passing loop {{is still}} {{controlled}} by the former Tondu junction signal box, which manually controls the line using semaphore signals. As well as the former Maesteg Line, the former Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company line exists as a freight-only <b>by-pass</b> <b>line</b> to Margam. Passenger trains would sometimes be diverted through this branch-line whenever the main-line between Bridgend and Port Talbot was closed for engineering work. Trains were diverted to travel via and reverse at Tondu. Nowadays, when the main-line is closed, bus services will replace train services as the old branch has speed restrictions of 5-15 mph in force.|$|E
5000|$|The Lewisham rail crash {{occurred}} on the Lewisham <b>by-pass</b> <b>line</b> in London at about 6:20 pm on 4 December 1957. In dense fog, an electric train to [...] stopped at a signal under a bridge and the following steam train to [...] crashed into it, the collision causing the bridge to collapse onto the steam train. There were 90 fatalities and 109 people were detained in hospital. The bridge had to be cleared away and it was over {{a week before the}} lines under the bridge were reopened, and another month before the bridge had been rebuilt and traffic allowed over it.|$|E
50|$|The new goods {{lines were}} {{primarily}} through routes, and thought now turned to joint goods terminal facilities. In 1866 the NBR had established its Dentonholme goods depot {{and opened it}} to the Midland Railway, although the Settle and Carlisle Line was not yet nearing readiness. On 13 July 1876 the NBR obtained an Act of Parliament authorising both the Midland Railway and the G&SWR to use the site, {{which was to be}} enlarged; the new goods <b>by-pass</b> <b>lines</b> now passed alongside. The much enlarged joint goods depot at Dentonholme was opened on 1 October 1883. In fact the NBR continued to use Canal as its primary goods depot, and the G&SWR was the chief beneficiary of the new facility. The multiple goods depot locations in the city resulted in a huge volume of inefficient transfer trip working traffic.|$|R

50|$|Growing {{freight traffic}} in the Toronto area necessitated the {{creation}} of an amalgamated facility and a by-pass of the congested Toronto Terminal downtown. In 1965, a new rail freight facility, first named Toronto Yard and then MacMillan Yard, was opened north of Metro Toronto. The local Mimico Railway Yard was downgraded considerably, resulting in the dislocation of much railway employment. At the same time the Toronto <b>By-Pass</b> <b>line</b> allowed for the creation of GO Transit commuter service between Oakville and Pickering. GO named its facility Willowbrook, after the nearby Willowbrook Road. Old CNR facilities in Mimico Yard were used for the startup of this trial train service. Its subsequent growth has resulted in new facilities being built for GO. In 1985, Via Rail facilities at Spadina Avenue were relocated from downtown Toronto to New Toronto's underused former Mimico Yards at the newly completed Toronto Maintenance Centre (which would have its major operations moved to Quebec just a few years later).|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 December 1957 there was dense fog in the London area and trains were running late. The 5:18 pm Charing Cross to Hayes, {{comprising}} electric multiple units totalling 10 cars and carrying nearly 1,500 passengers, stopped at a danger signal at Parks Bridge Junction on the Lewisham <b>by-pass</b> <b>line,</b> under a bridge carrying rail tracks over the line. Trains were running out of order because of the fog and the Parks Bridge Junction signalman wished {{to speak to the}} driver by the telephone at the signal to confirm the train's identity and destination. At approximately 6:20 pm it was struck from behind by a train from Cannon Street to Ramsgate via Folkestone, consisting of a steam locomotive hauling 11 coaches carrying about 700 passengers and travelling at about 30 mph. The collision threw the tender and leading coach off the track, dislodging a pier of the bridge, causing it to fall and crush two coaches. Two minutes later a train due to pass over the bridge stopped short, although its leading coach was tilted.|$|E
40|$|Superconducting magnets in the SIS 100 {{particle}} accelerator require {{the supply of}} liquid helium and electric current. Both are transported with <b>by-pass</b> <b>lines</b> designed at Wrocław University of Technology. Bus-bars used to transfer an electric current between the sections of the accelerator will be encased in a steel shell. Eddy currents are expected {{to appear in the}} shell during fast-ramp operation of magnets. Heat generation, which should be limited in any cryogenic system, will appear in the shell. In this work the amount of heat generated is assessed depending on the geometry of an assembly of the bus-bars and the shell. Numerical and analytical calculations are described. It was found that heat generation in the shell is relatively small when compared to other sources present in the accelerator and its value strongly depends on the geometry of the shell. The distribution of eddy currents and generated heat for different geometrical options are presented. Based on the results of the calculations the optimal design is proposed...|$|R

40|$|The large primary-secondary {{chilled water}} systems often {{suffer from the}} excess flow demand and low chilled water {{temperature}} difference, which {{is known as the}} low ΔT central plant syndrome, during operation. This paper presents an approach for experimental validation of the possible utility of a check valve (i. e., putting a one-direction check valve in the chilled water <b>by-pass</b> <b>line)</b> to solve this operational problem and enhance the overall system performance, prior to a check valve is really installed. The experimental tests were carried out on the complex central chiller plant in a super high-rise building using a simulated check valve through fully closing one of the butterfly valves in the <b>by-pass</b> <b>line</b> when the system operated with a significant excess flow demand and experienced the low ΔT syndrome. The results from the tests showed that the system operational performance can be improved when the simulated check valve was used. Compared to that without using the check valve, about 9. 2 % of the total energy of the chillers and secondary water pumps was saved in the test period when the simulated check valve was used.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} current issues of Zagreb {{suburban}} traffic. A {{number of problems}} have been identified: obsolete infrastructure facilities, congested traffic routes, deficiency of transportation means and low level of transportation service. All this reflects upon energy and space utilization, deterioration of environmental balance, increased noise pollution, stress situations and inconveniences a person, i. e. a passenger experiences in traffic. The author discusses the need for radical changes in suburban traffic planning. These changes are seen in the introduction of railways becoming a major aspect of suburban transport, because the railways can provide transport {{of large numbers of}} passengers in short periods of time, while the identified negative aspects are being eliminated or reduced to the minimum. It is therefore necessary to conceive the new system of suburban transport. This could be materialized through the elaboration of the projects of complete suburban transport segment. This in the first place refers to the infrastructure contents as <b>by-pass</b> <b>lines,</b> Medvednica Tunnel, Samobor line, airport links, passenger terminals, stations with platforms at an elevation parallel with the floor of the cars and special train cars for mass transport of passengers with broad seiding doors for quick getting of and off the trains.

40|$|During {{the past}} fifteen years there has been a steady {{increase}} in the demand for radioisotopes in nuclear medicine and a corresponding {{decline in the number of}} reactors within the U. S. capable of producing them. The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is the largest operating test reactor in the U. S., but its isotope production capabilities have been limited by the lack of an installed isotope shuttle irradiation system. A concept for a simple "low cost" shuttle irradiation facility for ATR has been developed. Cost were reduced (in comparison to previous ATR designs) by using a shielded trough of water installed in an occupiable cubicle as a shielding and contamination control barrier for the send and receive station. This shielding concept also allows all control valves to be operated by hand and thus the need for an automatic control system was eliminated. It was determined that 4 - 5 ft of water would be adequate to shield the isotopes of interest while shuttles are transferred to a small carrier. An additional feature of the current design is a non-isolatable <b>by-pass</b> <b>line,</b> which provides a minimum coolant flow to the test region regardless of which control valves are opened or closed. This <b>by-pass</b> <b>line</b> allows the shuttle facility to be operated without bringing reactor coolant water into the cubicle except for send and receive operations...|$|E
40|$|Regeneration of S-poisoned Pd/Al 2 O 3 {{catalysts}} for the abatement {{of methane}} emissions from natural gas vehicles was {{addressed in this}} work. Investigations were devoted to determine the temperature threshold allowing for catalyst reactivation under different CH 4 containing atmospheres. Under lean combustion conditions {{in the presence of}} excess O- 2, partial regeneration took place only above 750 degrees C after decomposition of stable sulphate species adsorbed on the support. Short CH 4 -reducing, O- 2 -free pulses led to partial catalyst reactivation already at 550 degrees C and to practically complete regeneration at 600 degrees C. Also in this case reactivation was associated with SO 2 release due to the decomposition of stable support sulphates likely promoted by CH 4 activation onto the reduced metallic Pd surface. Rich combustion pulses with CH 4 /O- 2 = 2 were equally effective to CH 4 -reducing pulses in catalyst regeneration. These results suggest that a regeneration strategy based on periodical natural gas pulses fed to the catalyst by a <b>by-pass</b> <b>line</b> might be efficient in limiting the effects of S-poisoning of palladium catalysts for the abatement of CH 4 emissions from natural gas engine...|$|E
40|$|The RCS {{is one of}} {{the major}} IXV {{functional}} subsystems and its main function is to perform attitude control for the vehicle during the orbital arc and to support the flap control during the autonomous re-entry. Due to the stringent ground safety requirements, three barriers are necessary before the flight to avoid unintended firing of the thrusters during pre-launch operations and ascent flight, with potential catastrophic consequences. For this reason, after the IXV separation from the VEGA AVUM, the IXV RCS has to be prepared for operation through a priming sequence in orbit. This operation may turn out to be critical if the corresponding overpressures are not correctly taken into consideration; moreover, with the utilization of hydrazine, the priming sequence may be even more critical in relation with the phenomenon of adiabatic compression and the low threshold of the propellant thermal decomposition. The objective of this work is to numerically investigate the priming sequences (Nominal and Off-Nominal) through the realisation of suitable models with the software EcosimPro. The analysis has been performed both for a Mock-Up (for which experimental evidences are available) and for the Flight-Hardware. Once the procedure has been validated through the comparison between the Mock-Up EcosimPro-Results and the results of the experimental campaign, the analysis has been extended to the Flight-Hardware. Both the Nominal Priming Sequence and the Off-Nominal Priming Sequence (i. e. priming via LV in case of <b>By-Pass</b> <b>Line</b> failure) have been investigated at different initial conditions (initial tank pressure and initial non-condensable gas pressure) and the criticality has been assessed...|$|E
