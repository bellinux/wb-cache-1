5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E

25|$|Interactions {{with other}} dogs, {{especially}} first meetings, should be managed carefully. One {{of the tasks}} of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> signs of tension, and intervene before a dangerous situation develops. However, a well socialized, well trained Kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{case study}} of a woman with ulcers {{on the back of her}} leg {{reported}} as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic pemphigus. This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of PNP. The article warned clinicians to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the possibility that paraneoplastic pemphigus in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood pathogenesis of PNP.|$|E
25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} the report was {{emphasized}} prior to its executive summary with quotations from President of the United States Barack Obama, FBI director James Comey and former United States Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama warned that with globalization came {{an increased risk of}} terrorists passing through the borders of the United States in order to cause harm to U.S. citizens. Comey wrote that terrorists who had garnered battlefield experience in Iraq and Syria posed a threat if they were able to travel to the U.S. Holder said the Syrian Civil War created a fertile bed for Islamic extremism and the U.S. needed to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> prevent U.S. citizens from traveling there and returning to their country of origin to commit attacks. During the course of their research for the report, members of the bipartisan task force traveled to foreign countries in order to speak with government workers and intelligence community leaders about the subject matter to gain more expertise in the area. Work for the report's publication was completed in 2015. The book was first published in paperback format by Skyhorse Publishing in 2016. An e-book edition was released the same year.|$|E
500|$|Falconers {{using the}} American kestrel should <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> protect the falcon from larger predators that may attack the kestrel, {{particularly}} if it is distracted {{on the ground with}} captured prey. [...] Domestic cats and dogs are the greatest threat to attack the falcon on the ground, but the Cooper's hawk is well known to boldly attack kestrels. [...] This mid-sized American accipiter has sufficient size and strength to carry the kestrel away, though falconers have reported often being successful in recovering the kestrel unharmed by acting quickly to intimidate the larger hawk into releasing the kestrel.|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{suggested the}} case will have broad-ranging impacts for other self-replicating technologies. Tabetha Marie Peavey suggested that the Court [...] "appeared to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the consequences of its ruling, {{not just for the}} value of Monsantoâ€™s soybean patents, but also for technologies like cell lines, software, and vaccines". Likewise, Christopher M. Holman wrote that the case [...] "should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self-replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively". William J. Simmons also wrote that [...] "more cases like this will probably be appealed to [...] as these technologies become more prevalent in society".|$|E

2500|$|Because {{causation}} {{in the law}} is {{a complex}} amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk. [...] Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.|$|E
2500|$|The Bahujan Samaj Party {{questioned}} {{intelligence agencies}} failure to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> the blast conspiracy, and urged the state Congress {{to ask the}} UPA to approve GUJCOCAas. The Vishva Hindu Parishad announced it planned a nationwide anti-jehadi movement from 28 July, and urged the government to act against terrorism [...] "before it is late." [...] AIADMK general secretary J. Jayalalithaa called for the revival of special act like POTA to [...] "effectively counter terrorists and extremist outfits".|$|E

2500|$|The {{prostitutes in}} illegal massage parlors {{may be forced}} to work out of {{apartment}} complexes for many hours a day. Many clients may not realize that some of the women who work in these massage sex parlors are actually forced in prostitution. The women may initially be lured into the US under false pretenses. In huge debt to their 'owners', they are forced to earn enough to eventually [...] "buy" [...] their freedom. In some cases women who have been sex trafficked {{may be forced to}} undergo plastic surgery or abortions. A chapter in The Slave Next Door (2009) reports that human trafficking and sexual enslavement are not limited to any specific location or social class. It concludes that individuals in society need to <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> report suspicious behavior, because the psychological and physical abuse occurs which can often leave a victim unable to escape on their own.|$|E

60|$|He cannot openly complain, and if {{he could}} the critic cannot help being what he is. If the critic were older and more versed in the veteran author, he might not like him so well, and he could not, at any rate, bring the fresh {{interest}} to his work which the young reviewer brings. What Eugenio would really wish {{would be to have}} each successive book of his given for review to some lifelong admirer, some dear and faithful friend, all the better for not being an acquaintance, who had liked him from the beginning and was intimately versed in all his work. Such a critic would know that Eugenio was always breaking new ground, and that he was never more true to this inherent tendency than when he seemed to be ploughing the same old furrows in the same old fields. Such a critic would <b>be</b> <b>alert</b> <b>to</b> detect those fine differences of situation which distinguish a later from an earlier predicament. He would note with unfailing perspicacity the shades of variance which constitute Florindo an essentially novel character when presented under the name of Lindoro, or Floribella a fresh delight when she reappears as Doralinda. Even when he could not deny that these persons were in themselves one and the same, {{he would be able to}} make the reader observe that the new light thrown upon them by the author's ever-renascent art revealed in familiar creations traits of mind and charms of spirit unimagined before. He would insist that, if not new, they were newer, because being more fully ascertained they were truer. He would boldly recur to the personages in Eugenio's former books whom they reminded one of, and, studying them in contrast, would convince the reader that the increasing purpose of the author in the treatment of the well-known types had been to reveal the infinite variety of character which lay hid in each and every human type.|$|E
