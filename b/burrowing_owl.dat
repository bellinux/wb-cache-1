40|$|The first {{observations}} of Florida <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> (Athene cunicularia floridana) {{occurred in the}} 19 th century on historical dry prairie habitat in south central Florida. These early observations documented the ecology of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in rural environments. Since then {{the vast majority of}} research on this subspecies has been undertaken in suburban and urban environments during the breeding period. The research undertaken on <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in suburban and urban environments includes determining natal dispersal distance, assessing female fecundity, mate fidelity, territory fidelity, date of juvenile and adult dispersal from breeding habitat, date of clutch initiation, nesting success, density of breeding pairs, causes of mortality, prey preference, and minimum annual survival of fledglings, juveniles, and adults. Very little research has been undertaken on <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in rural environments. The purpose of this thesis was to elucidate the behavior and ecology of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in a rural environment. The topics researched in this thesis include home range in breeding habitat, dispersal distance to post-breeding habitat, location of post-breeding habitat, behavior during the breeding period, diet of rural versus urban owls, and the evaluation of three methods to trap <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls.</b> The results of this thesis indicate that, during the daytime, juvenile <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> utilized habitat very close to the main and satellite burrows during the breeding period. At night juvenile owls foraged in an extensive saw palmetto patch surrounding the breeding habitat. The predominant prey of both rural and urban <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> during the breeding period was insects. Dispersal of juvenile <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> from breeding habitat coincided with the flooding of the breeding habitat during the rainy season...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters presenting results of my investigations of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> (Athene cuniculariai) and their association with agriculture, their food habits, and their territorial defense behaviors.

40|$|Western <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Owls</b> (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) are small, ground-dwelling owls {{of western}} North America that {{frequent}} prairie dog (CynomysI spp.) towns and other grasslands. Because {{they rely on}} rodent prey and occupy burrows once or concurrently inhabited for fossorial mammals, the owls often harbor fleas. We examined the potential role of fleas found on <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in plague dynamics by evaluating prevalence of Yersinia pestis in fleas collected from <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> and in owl blood. During 2012 - 2013, fleas and blood were collected from <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in portions of five states with endemic plague-Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and South Dakota. Fleas were enumerated, taxonomically identified, pooled by nest, and assayed for Y. pestis using culturing and molecular (PCR) approaches. Owl blood underwent serological analysis for plague anitbodies and nested PCR for detection of Y. pestis. Of more than 4750 fleas collected from owls, Pulex irritans, a known plague vector in portions of its range, comprised more than 99. 4 %. However, diagnostic tests for Y. pestis of flea pools (culturing and PCR) and owl blood (PCR and serology) were negative. Thus, even though fleas were prevalent on <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> {{and the potential for}} a relationship with <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> as a phoretic host of infected fleas exists, we found no evidence of Y. pestis in sampled fleas or in owls that harbored them. We suggest that studies similar to those reported here during plague epizootics will be especially useful for confirming these results...|$|R

25|$|When hunting, {{they wait}} on a perch until they spot prey. Then, they swoop down on prey or fly up to catch insects in flight. Sometimes, they chase prey on foot across the ground.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential expression of territorial behavior of <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Owls</b> (Athene cunicularia) in southwestern Idaho, {{we used a}} playback protocol to determine if <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Owls</b> actively defended their nesting site from conspecifics, and if so, {{to determine the extent}} of their territorial boundaries. Eighty-eight percent of male <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Owls</b> responded to the broadcast of conspecific primary calls. All responsive males uttered primary calls, and many owls approached the broadcast speaker, exhibited white-and-tall stances, and bobbed. Females responded less frequently than males, but one female whose mate was presumably dead exhibited an intense response to the playback trial. There were no differences in number of primary calls uttered, number of white-and-tall stances performed, or number of bobs of focal males among three broadcast distances: (0 m, 50 m, and 100 m) from the active nest <b>burrows.</b> However, focal <b>owls</b> approached the broadcast speaker more closely at broadcast distances of 0 m and 50 m than at 100 m. These findings suggest that owls actively defended their nesting site from conspecifics and that they defended an area larger than that immediately surrounding the nest burrow. Although they continued to vocalize at distances of at least 100 m, they did not physically approach an intruder at this distance as frequently as at shorter distances. Therefore, <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Owls</b> appear to defend a territory that encompasses some, but not all, of the foraging area used during nesting...|$|R

40|$|Western <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) are {{endangered}} in Canada {{and several}} western U. S. states. Population declines {{have been linked}} with control measures aimed at burrowing mammals and loss of nesting habitat. The owls frequently associate with irrigated agriculture throughout portions of their western U. S. range. To determine potential factors driving the association of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> with agriculture, we examined availability of suitable nest burrows (burrow availability hypothesis), abundance of potential prey (prey availability hypothesis), and predation of nest burrows (predation hypothesis) for owls nesting in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwestern Idaho during 2001 - 2002. Nest burrow availability did not differ between agricultural and nonagricultural habitats, and occupancy rates of <b>owls</b> in artificial <b>burrows</b> were greater near agriculture. More rodent prey species were live-trapped in agricultural habitat compared with nonagricultural habitat, {{and there was no}} difference in relative abundance of prey between habitat types. Pellet remains indicated greater abundance and biomass of prey being consumed in agricultural habitat compared with nonagricultural habitat. Finally, predation rates of dummy nests in agricultural and nonagricultural habitat did not differ. These findings allow us to reject the burrow availability and predation hypotheses, while the prey availability hypothesis remains tenable. Thus, <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> may nest near irrigated agriculture in southwestern Idaho because of increased diversity or availability of prey. We suggest that research is needed to determine how widespread this prey availability relationship may be and how management of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> in agricultural landscapes may take advantage of this apparent rich prey resource...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{have evolved}} an {{impressive}} array of behavioural traits to avoid depredation. Olfactory camouflage of conspicuous odours is a strategy to avoid depredation that has been implicated only in a few species of birds. <b>Burrowing</b> <b>owls,</b> Athene cunicularia, routinely collect dried manure from mammals and scatter it in their nest chamber, in the tunnel leading to their nest and at the entrance to their nesting burrow. This unusual behaviour was thought to reduce nest depredation by concealing the scent of adults and juveniles, but a recent study suggests that manure functions to attract arthropod prey. However, <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> routinely scatter other materials {{in the same way that}} they scatter manure, and this fact seems to be at odds with both of these hypotheses. Thus, we examined the function of this behaviour by testing four alternative hypotheses. We found no support for the widely cited olfactory-camouflage hypothesis (manure did not lower the probability of depredation), or for the mate-attraction hypothesis (males collected manure after, not before, pair formation). Predictions of the burrow-occupied hypothesis (manure indicates occupancy to conspecifics and thereby reduces agonistic interactions) were supported, but results were not statistically significant. Our results also supported several predictions of the prey-attraction hypothesis. Pitfall traps at sampling sites with manure collected more arthropod biomass (of taxa common in the diet of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls)</b> than pitfall traps at sampling sites without manure. Scattering behaviour of <b>burrowing</b> <b>owls</b> appears to function to attract arthropod prey, but may also signal occupancy of a burrow to conspecifics...|$|R
