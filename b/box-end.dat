50|$|In North American English, wrench is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-end wrench and <b>box-end</b> wrench. In American English, spanner refers to a specialised wrench {{with a series of}} pins or tabs around the circumference. (These pins or tabs fit into the holes or notches cut into the object to be turned.) In American commerce, such a wrench may be called a spanner wrench to distinguish it from the British sense of spanner.|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section E of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This method of test is an indication of the amount of elasticity that a latex has imparted to an asphalt. This elasticity is an indicator of the percent of latex that has been added to the asphalt. B. APPARATUS 1. Container: The sample container shall be a flat-bottom, cylindrical seamless tin box, 55 mm in diameter and 35 mm in depth. The container is commonly known as a 3 -ounce ointment can. 2. Disc Assembly: See Figure 1. The disc shall be made of aluminum. The spider, pointer, and nut shall be made of steel. 3. Wrench: An 8 mm open-end or <b>box-end</b> wrench. 4. Timer: A stop watch, clock, or other timing device having a precision of 1 s or less. 5. A flexible plastic scale graduated to the nearest 1 mm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBad {{reinforcement}} {{concrete works}} could generate building failures after earthquake. Concrete pouring and compacting on structural element with dense reinforcement and beam column joint are difficult. Suitable solution {{on this problem}} {{is the use of}} self-compacting concrete that has flow-ability, filling-ability, and passing-ability. Traditional roof tile waste is available in Indonesian villages. The use of traditional roof tile powder in self-compacting concrete is an effort to recycle waste and new development in environmental friendly concrete material technology. This research tends to understanding contribution of traditional roof tile powder in development of workability and strength of self-compacting concrete. On this research, self compacting concretes are designed as follows: 1) water-powder ratio (w/p) is designed with 0. 35, 0. 32, and 0. 29; 2) maximum dimension of coarse aggregate is limited by 15 and 20 mm; 3) dosages of traditional roof tile powder are 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % from powder weight; 4) dosage of silica fume sets to be 5 % for all trial mixes; 5) super-plasticizer is added with dosage of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 2 % and 1. 5 % from powder weight to achieve flow characteristic of self compacting concrete; 5) aggregates are washed before mixing. Indonesian standard (SNI 03 - 2834 - 2000) combined with simple mix design Okamura are used to calculate the compositions of self-compacting concrete. Test on fresh concrete is slump spread for all trial mixes. The mix that has the largest slump spread is tested with V-funnel and L-shaped box. Specimens of cylinder with diameter of 10 cm and height of 20 cm are used in this research to determine the compressive strength and split-tensile strength. Maximum diameter of slump spread could achieve 65 cm. Duration in V-funnel test is 14. 6 second. In L-shaped box, duration to reach 40 cm and to reach <b>box-end</b> are 45 and 65 second, respectively. Blocking/passing ratio (H 2 /H 1) is 4. 5 / 32. Optimum dosage of traditional roof tile powder is 20 % at w/p of 0. 35 and dosage of super-plasticizer of 1 % that has compressive strength of 44. 11 MPa and split-tensile strength of 3. 25 MPa. Washing aggregate before mixing could increase workability performance and increase compressive and split-tensile strength of 17. 06 % and 42. 37 %. Coarse aggregate with maximum dimension of 20 mm has compressive strength of 51. 05 MPa. Optimum w/p is 0. 32 and optimum dosage of super-plasticizer is 1. 5 % at dosage of traditional roof tile powder of 20 %, dosage of silica fume of 5 %, and proportion of coarse aggregate of 45 % that has the largest compressive strength of 67. 72 MPa...|$|E
40|$|In 1877, a {{year after}} the {{railroad}} reached Southern California, the first shipment of California oranges left the Los Angeles groves of William Wolfskill, bound for St. Louis, Missouri. The <b>box-ends</b> were branded ‘Wolfskill California Oranges’, ensuring that the geographical origins of the fruit were emphasised {{from the very beginning of}} their exportation to the Midwest and East. During the 1880 s, the innovations of irrigation and refrigerated cars combined with new railroads, massive in-migration and land development to turn California into, in Douglas Sackman’s words, an ‘orange empire’. By 1900, this empire had surpassed Florida as the United States’ leading producer of fruit, while, as one historian explains, ‘the orange crop had passed the cash returns from gold’ found in California. From virtually none a few decades earlier, the average American in 1914 ate over 40 oranges per year, and orange juice had become part of the standard American breakfast. By then some thirty thousand railroad carloads—approximately twelve million orange crates—valued at $ 20 million, were steaming east from the Golden State each year. Adorning these crates were, in the words of Kevin Starr, ‘the inventive labels’ whose ‘selling of California along with oranges as an image in the national imagination’ are the focus of this article...|$|R
