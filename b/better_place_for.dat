50|$|As {{with the}} view of {{responsible}} tourism, responsible hospitality is essentially about creating <b>better</b> <b>places</b> <b>for</b> people to live in, and <b>better</b> <b>places</b> <b>for</b> people to visit. This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry. As such {{we should not be}} surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism. In the instance where place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed, if for example a meal is consumed in a local restaurant, this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence. As such, the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality.|$|R

25|$|Almost {{two hours}} elapsed {{between the time}} the ships got under way until the opening shots were fired. In that time, they found that New Ironsides had severe {{handling}} problems in the strong current and shallow water. She was forced to stop and anchor to avoid going aground, {{just about the time}} that the lead monitors were coming under fire. She dropped out of the line, and the four ships following her passed around, with some difficulty. The waiting Rebels could not have chosen a <b>better</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> New Ironsides to anchor, as she was directly over a 3000-pound (1360kg) electrically-triggered torpedo that would be activated by closing a switch on shore. Their high hopes were dashed, however, when the switch was closed and nothing happened. Two explanations for the failure have been offered. According to the one, an ordnance wagon had broken the wires by being driven over them. The other holds that the wires were simply too long, so the electric current would not be great enough to create a spark and detonate the charge.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{civil rights}} activist Rosa Parks {{filed a lawsuit against}} OutKast for the song [...] "Rosa Parks", {{claiming}} that the song used her name without her permission, constituting false advertising and an infringement on her right to publicity, in addition to defamation of character. The lawsuit was dismissed on first amendment grounds that year by a federal judge, but the appeals court partially reinstated the suit in 2003, stating that the group must have an artistic reason for titling the song with her name. The case was settled in 2005 with OutKast and LaFace Records agreeing to create educational programs to [...] "enlighten today's youth about the significant role Rosa Parks played in making America a <b>better</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> all races." ...|$|E

[...] At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence {{to the idea of}} running for Governor of Alabama, stating: I'm serious.

Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration...

Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said [...] "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's – then Puff Daddy – first solo video, [...] "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down," [...] which featured him and Mase introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert." [...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed with the number of videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E

2500|$|After {{three years}} out of the limelight, the band {{returned}} with Life on Other Planets (September 2002), recorded at Heliocentric, Rockfield and Mayfair Studios and produced by Beck collaborator Tony Hoffer. The album was released in the UK on Parlophone, but in the US on the Island Def Jam imprint. The record was not as commercially successful as Supergrass's first three albums, failing to make the Top Three in the UK albums chart. However, the critical response to the album was generally very positive, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic claiming [...] "The world is a <b>better</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> having Supergrass in it.". It has since gone gold in the UK. Life on Other Planets was also notable {{as it was the}} first Supergrass album to recognise Rob Coombes as an official member. For the band's first three albums, Supergrass officially consisted of Gaz Coombes, Goffey and Quinn although Rob Coombes contributed to many of the band's songs and videos, and toured with them. Tracks recorded before this were often credited to [...] "Supergrass and Rob Coombes". The band followed Life on Other Planets with another extended three-year hiatus, devoted to touring and personal engagements.|$|E

In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: [...] "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ...

2500|$|Modern humanists, such as Corliss Lamont or Carl Sagan, {{hold that}} {{humanity}} must seek for truth through reason {{and the best}} observable evidence and endorse scientific skepticism and the scientific method. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong {{must be based on}} the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human. The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole. [...] The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a <b>better</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned: [...] "The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature.

2500|$|How {{is money}} an abstraction? Money gives the {{illusion}} {{that it has a}} direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a <b>better</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that [...] "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right." [...] But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery.|$|E
