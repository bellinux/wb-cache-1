Hart believes the method of deciding <b>cases</b> <b>through</b> <b>logic</b> or deduction is not necessarily wrong, {{just as it is}} not necessarily right to decide cases according to social or moral aims. Hart uses the problem of [...] "the core and the penumbra" [...] to illustrate the idea that laws must be related to the meaning of the words, not any natural or moral belief. A [...] "core" [...] case would be one that the statute is intended to cover. In the classic example, a statute that bans vehicles from a park is obviously intended to cover cars. A [...] "penumbra" [...] case would be one not considered by the creators of the law, such as a skateboard in the example above. A judge interpreting such a law from a positivist viewpoint would look to a definition of the words in the statute. The natural law view believes that the creation of law should be based on natural laws or common morals.|$|R

40|$|The thesis reports {{research}} {{aimed at}} developing better ways of analysing managerial jobs in order subsequently to design them. The {{main body of}} the thesis consists of 13 chapters split into four parts; in the Appendix are presented the questionnaires used in the studies and some further data bearing on the studies. In Part 1 the author presents the reasons for his own interest in, and <b>builds</b> a <b>case</b> <b>through</b> literature evidence for the desirability of {{research in the area of}} managerial job design. The author proceeds to define the thesis research boundary and provides a brief introduction to the contents of the other 12 chapters. Part 2 consists of 4 chapters, based on literature review, covering concepts of basic interest to the theory and practice of managerial job design. The four subject areas selectively dealt with are: Motivation (theories and models of man); the nature of the managerial job; organisational components; and theories of job design. Two approaches are taken with this material: (a) For the first three subject areas, the approach is inferential, i. e. given certain theoretical standpoints, where are the implications for managerial job design. (b) For the fourth subject area, theories of job design, the author offers a critical review. Part 3, consists of 6 chapters. Four are reports of the studies conducted by the author and two consolidate the results of these studies with theoretical standpoints. In this part the author develops three standpoints on managerial job design and one on the connectivity of job design constructs. The three standpoints on managerial job design are: lo The measures on the quality of the design of a job. ...|$|R
