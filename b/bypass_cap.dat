40|$|Proteinbiosynthesis (translation) is {{a complex}} process, {{necessary}} for gene expression in all living cells. Translation involves four sequential phases, namely initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. As {{the first step of}} translation initiation is the phase which is most frequently subjected to specific regulation mechanisms. The standard mechanism in eucaryotes, canonical initiation, is a very complex pathway including a plethora of regulatory factors (initiation factors, eIFs). In addition recruitment, positioning and activation of the translation machinery needs the 5 ´-terminal cap structure of the mRNA and an ATP-dependent scanning mechanism. However, an alternative way of translation initiation exists, called internal initiation. Some mRNAs are able to <b>bypass</b> <b>cap</b> binding, scanning and the necessity of some or even all eIFs by special structured sequences in their 5 ’-UTR, the internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). While cellular IRES containing mRNAs often code for important regulatory proteins, IRES elements of viruses are efficient tools to hijack the translational apparatus of their host cells. They are still functional, even if canonical translation initiation is impaired. The IRES element of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and related viruses from the Flaviviridae family, such as the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), adopts a functionally important tertiary structure, that actively manipulates the eucaryotic ribosome. In this study we make use of the finding that in the presence of elevated Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + concentrations the HCV IRES allows total initiation factor-independent translation. This allows us to reconstitute and isolate eIF-free stable 80 S • IRES complexes in vitro, suitable for cryo-EM. The cryo-EM map of a mammalian 80 S ribosome in complex with the HCV IRES at significantly improved resolution of 7, 8 Å is presented, enabling us {{for the first time to}} present a complete molecular tertiary structure model of the HCV IRES in its ribosome bound form. This model reveals a complex tertiary fold of the IRES RNA and molecular details of its interaction with the ribosome. The proteins rpS 1 e, rpS 5 e, rpS 14 e, rpS 25, rpS 26 e, rpS 27, rpS 28 e as well as Helices h 23 and h 26 of the 18 S rRNA could be clearly identified as interaction partners in the head and platform region of the ribosomal 40 S subunit. A structural Shine Dalgarno - anti Shine Dalgarno mimicry by the IRES is proposed. Aditionally, for the first time a cryo-EM map of a mammalian 80 S ribosome in complex with the related CSFV IRES at a resolution of 10 Å is presented. Comparison with the HCV IRES complexes unterlines the high stuctural conservation of these mRNA signal structures...|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of 22/23 June, still {{under the cover of}} fog, the Cosseria Division <b>{{bypassed}}</b> <b>Cap</b> Martin and then entered the Garavan quarter of Menton. The bypassed French troops continued to fight, firing the fort's armament at Italian coastal shipping, until the armistice. The fighting in the streets of Menton was fierce. The Italians pushed through the Baousset quarter and took the hilltop Capuchin monastery of Notre-Dame de l'Annonciade on 23 June. A planned naval landing at Garavan by the Blackshirts (Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, MVSN) on 24 June had to be called off because of high waves and a full moon. The French—except for the garrison of the advanced fort of Pont Saint-Louis—gradually withdrew from Menton.|$|R
50|$|Rell {{supported}} the state's constitutional spending cap resisting pressure from groups favoring expanded state government spending which would <b>bypass</b> the <b>cap.</b> As a result, in late June 2006 the state reported a $910 million surplus for the prior {{year and the}} state's Rainy Day Fund exceeded $1 billion in deposits for the first time. In 2007 she shocked many of her supporters by proposing additional spending for education that would cause the state budget to significantly exceed the spending cap. Paying for the increased spending would require raising the state income tax. Republican legislators and a few Democrats, including (at least initially) House Speaker James Amann, {{as well as many}} others, were skeptical when Rell claimed her plan would reduce property taxes. And as public opinion polls showed steadfast opposition to an income tax hike, she changed her mind and withdrew her support for increased educational spending. Rell originally had the support of the Connecticut Education Association for her proposal, but they later switched to the Democratic plan favoring even higher state taxes and no limits on property tax increases. On May 9, 2007 Rell announced increased state revenues might make a tax hike unnecessary in 2007. On June 1, 2007 Rell vetoed a Democratic plan that increased the income tax. A compromise education plan passed both houses of the legislature in late June that did not increase the income tax, but raised the cigarette tax and did not limit property taxes. It nonetheless exceeded the state spending cap.|$|R
40|$|Travertines are {{freshwater}} carbonates that precipitate from carbonic groundwater {{due to the}} degassing of CO 2. Travertine deposits {{are often}} situated along faults that serve as conduits for CO 2 -charged groundwater and their geochemistry often records mixing of deeply-derived fluids and volatiles with shallow meteoric water. Travertines are surface expressions of dynamic mantle processes related to the tectonic setting. This dissertation includes four chapters that focus on different aspects of travertine formation and their scientific value. They are excellent, although underestimated, diagnostic tools for climatology, hydrology, tectonics, geochemistry, geomicrobiology, and they can inform carbon sequestration models. Quaternary Large-volume travertine deposits in New Mexico and Arizona occur in an extensional tectonic stress regime on the southeastern Colorado Plateau and along the Rio Grande rift. They accumulated above fault systems during episodes of high hydraulic head in confined aquifers, increased regional volcanic activity, and high input of mantle-derived volatiles such as CO 2 and He. Stable isotope and trace element geochemistry of travertines is controlled by groundwater geochemistry {{as well as the}} degassing of CO 2. The geochemical composition allows for distinguishing different travertine facies and evaluating past groundwater flow. The travertine deposits in New Mexico are interpreted to be extinct CO 2 fields due to the large volumes that accumulated and in analogy to the travertine deposits in Arizona that are associated with an active CO 2 -gas field. Travertines are natural analogues for CO 2 leakage along fault systems that <b>bypassed</b> regional <b>cap</b> rocks and they provide important insight into the migration of CO 2 from a reservoir to the surface. The volume of travertine can be used to infer the integrated CO 2 leakage along a fault system over geologic time. This leakage is estimated as: (1) CO 2 that becomes fixed in CaCO 3 /travertine (tons of carbon converted into tons of carbonate), (2) the amount of CO 2 that degassed into the atmosphere (twice the amount of (1), based on reaction stoichiometry), (3) dissolved CO 2 that is carried away with the water discharging from a spring (based on modern spring discharge and dissolved carbon content), and (4) CO 2 that escapes through the soil (based on modern soil flux measurements). Better understanding of integrated CO 2 leakage and fault-related seal bypass is needed to design CO 2 sequestration sites to effectively store anthropogenic CO 2 in the subsurface.  National Science Foundation, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, New Mexico Geologic Society, Graduate and Professional Student Association of the University of New Mexico, Department of Earth and Planetary ScienceEarth and Planetary SciencesDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.
