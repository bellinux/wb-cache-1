[...] "Never mind, they have been shut up in a darker place than I for months, and had no fun at all; I won't fret, <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> July and the {{seashore}} while I work." ...|$|E

And {{tell me if you}} could put up with me, as well as the garret." [...] He beamed and put his head a little on one side--rather like Mr. May, for one second. But he was much more {{dangerous}} than Mr. May. He was overbearing, and had the devil's own temper if he was thwarted. This she knew. He was a big man in a navy blue suit, with very white teeth.|$|E

6000|$|Take an instance. A {{writer with}} neither {{imagination}} nor fancy, describing a fair lip, {{does not see}} it, <b>but</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it, and about what is said of it, and calls it well-turned, or rosy, or delicate, or lovely, or afflicts us with some other quenching and chilling epithet. Now hear fancy speak,-- ...|$|R

Poor Patty Richards looked so happy {{when she was in}} a decline. She didn't seem to care any more about her lover that she was engaged to be married to, and she liked the smell of the flowers so, that I used to take her. O, if I could but like {{anything}}--if I could <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> anything else! If these dreadful feelings would go away, I wouldn't mind about not being happy. I wouldn't want anything--and I could do what would please Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel. But when that rage and anger comes into me, I don't know what to do. I don't feel the ground under me; I only feel my head and heart beating, and it seems as if I must do something dreadful. O! I wonder if any one ever felt like me before. I must be very wicked. But God will have pity on me; He knows all I have to bear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|These are the bad ways {{which make}} people ashamed {{when they meet}} a good and a respectable person, make them afraid of being overheard, afraid of being found out, fond of {{haunting}} low and out-of-the-way places where {{they will not be}} seen; fond of prowling and lurching out at night after their own sinful pleasures, because the darkness hides them from their neighbours, and seems to hide them from themselves, though it cannot hide them from God. These are the sins which make men silent, cunning, dark, sour, double-tongued, afraid to look anyone full in the face, unwilling to make friends, afraid of opening their minds to anyone, because they have something on their minds which they dare not tell their neighbours, which they dare not even tell themselves, <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> as little as they can help. Do you not know what I mean? Do you not often see it in others? Have you never felt it in yourselves when you have done wrong, that dark feeling within which shows itself in dark looks? You talk of a [...] "dark-looking man," [...] or a [...] "dark sort of person;" [...] and you mean, do you not, a man whom you cannot make out, who does not wish you to make him out; who keeps his thoughts and his feelings to himself, and is never frank or free, except with bad companions, when the world cannot see him; who goes about hanging down his head, and looking out of the corners of his eyes, as if he were afraid of the very sunshine--afraid of the light. We know that such a man has something dark on his mind. We call him a [...] "dark sort of man." [...] And we are right. We say of him what St. Paul says of him in this very epistle, when he says, that sin is darkness, and sinful works the deeds of darkness; and that goodness, and righteousness, and truth, are light, the very light of God and the Spirit of God. Our reason, our common sense, which is given us by God's Spirit, the Spirit of light, makes us use the right words, the same words as St. Paul does, and call sin darkness.|$|E

"So we can; <b>but</b> do <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the furniture, {{because you}} ought to be {{interested}} in helping me make an artistic home," [...] said Dolly, knowing that the word [...] "artistic" [...] would arrest his attention, and keep him to the subject in hand; for as yet the other idea was too new to bear much discussion.|$|R
5000|$|According to David Ferriero, then Andrew Mellon Director of the Library, Greenberg {{was hired}} to [...] "not only shape the digital library <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> where our users are and ways of getting NYPL in their faces." [...] Among the more easily noticed {{innovations}} was the merging of NYPL's catalog systems. Formerly, there were two distinct catalogs, one for the research libraries (CATNYP) and another for the branch libraries (LEO). [...] Now there is one, unified, online NYPL catalog.|$|E
50|$|To me, {{there are}} three things we all should do every day. We should do this every day of our lives. Number one is laugh. You should laugh every day. Number two is think. You should spend some time in thought. And number three is, you should have your {{emotions}} moved to tears, could be happiness or joy. <b>But</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. If you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full day. That's {{a heck of a}} day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to have something special.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{opens with}} a first-person narrator, a nameless, middle-aged, gay man. He has {{decided to take a}} {{teaching}} position in Washington D.C. He starts his journey waiting for his flight during a layover in Atlanta. Sitting in the departure lounge, he can’t help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his late mother. He reminisces how his life used to revolve around her when she was terminally ill. He remembers how he lacked any serious social life because he would spend every weekend with her after picking her up from the nursing home. After she passed, he realized a change in scenery was in order. His life in Florida had become hollow and depressing.|$|E

5000|$|Constantin has renounced all theorizing <b>but</b> still <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the Young Man and the girl. As far as he's {{concerned}} the Young Man is a poet. He says, [...] "A poet {{seems to be}} born to be a fool for the girls. If a girl made a fool of him to his face, he would think of it generous of her." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the song, {{the narrator}} {{describes}} {{how he is}} driving around in circles, {{having nothing to do}} <b>but</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the one who left him. He notes that he heard she has just married another man, and it has affected him more than he thought. The radio's continual playing of [...] "songs about rain" [...] is not helping the situation.|$|R
5000|$|Admiral Jay L. Johnson, then Chief of Naval Operations, {{testified that}} [...] "Even {{if the number}} is only 30 percent, {{that is a good}} number. <b>But</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what we get out of the other 70 percent. They have {{exposure}} to us. They have exposure to the military. And the challenge of the education mandate that we all share in principals and school counselors and school districts that won't let us in, that is a powerful tool I think to educate whether or not they end up in the service. So it is a long way around saying it is well worth the investment for lots of different reasons." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aers {{taught at}} the University of East Anglia before going to Duke in the mid-1990s. In 1998 {{he was awarded the}} Trinity College Distinguished Teaching Award. In an {{interview}} that shortly followed the award, he is quoted as saying, [...] "My work moves between literature, theology, politics and history. The academic parceling up of these subjects can become an impediment to studying what I want to study, so that's the motive for interdisciplinarity. When I think about ethics, I can't help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> politics. When I think about my Christianity, I'm also thinking about social justice. The questions I'm asking go directly across what have grown up as disciplinary boundaries within the modern academy." ...|$|E
5000|$|For his part, Dr. Fischer, in {{the notes}} {{accompanying}} ... And Sometimes Instruments, {{one of the}} last of his albums to be released during his lifetime, expressed satisfaction with this effort, attesting as well to the symbiosis previously alluded to by his son:When I reflect back on all the music in my life, I can't help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the pieces I wrote that have yet to be released. There is much material and several years ago I asked my son Brent to see that it all gets done. He has worked tirelessly and, having absorbed my style over the decades, is uniquely qualified to direct these recordings, in some cases finishing works for me so, at my age, I can just listen and enjoy.|$|E

5000|$|Montreal-based {{saxophone}} {{player and}} composer Colin Stetsons 2013 album New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light included a song entitled [...] "Part of Me Apart From You". Though not explicitly {{written about the}} 52-hertz whale, when first performing the song live, he remarked on at least several occasions {{that the story of}} the [...] "loneliest whale" [...] resonated deeply with his composition. [...] "This whale is alone in a large body of water, swimming, singing its song, calling for a likeness it will never find," [...] he said by way of introducing the song at a performance at Torontos Great Hall on 19 May 2013. [...] "When I play this song, I cant help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> this whale, who right at this very minute is singing alone." ...|$|E
50|$|A year later, their {{daughter}} Laurel (played by Anne Shirley {{as a young}} woman) is born. To Stella's great surprise, she discovers she has a strong maternal instinct. Even when she is out dancing and partying, she cannot help <b>but</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her child. As Laurel grows up, Stella's ambition and scheming to rise socially is redirected to her daughter. Stephen dotes on Laurel as well, but {{she is the only}} bond between husband and wife. He tries to help Stella become more refined, but without success. He also strongly disapproves of her continuing friendship with the vulgar Ed Munn (Alan Hale). Finally, when Stephen receives a promotion that requires him to move to New York, Stella tells him he can go without her or Laurel; they separate, but remain married. Laurel stays with her mother, but visits her father periodically.|$|E
50|$|People from {{different}} traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, {{so he can}} follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. <b>But</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it carefully. Don’t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.In the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something… That is not healthy.For individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.I am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, Islam is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.|$|E

5000|$|The 2013 AFOI ran in {{conjunction}} with the Adelaide Film Festival. Clearly, there was an appetite for deep and civil discussion of ideas and issues that was slaked by media and political debates that run on the rocket fuel of polling and instant communication.
