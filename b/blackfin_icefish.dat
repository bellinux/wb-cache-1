50|$|The <b>blackfin</b> <b>icefish</b> is {{apparently}} unique among vertebrates {{in that it}} lacks both red blood cells and hemoglobin. Its only form of oxygen transport is dissolved oxygen in its blood plasma.|$|E
50|$|Chaenocephalus aceratus, the <b>blackfin</b> <b>icefish,</b> is {{a species}} of {{crocodile}} icefish known from around Bouvet Island and the northern Antarctic Peninsula where it occurs at depths of 5 to 770 m. This species grows to a length of 72 cm TL. It is of minor importance to commercial fisheries. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
50|$|An area of {{relatively}} shallow marine waters of about 1021 km2, off {{the western and}} southern coasts of Low Island, has been designated an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 152) because {{it is one of}} only two known sites near the United States’s Palmer Station suitable for bottom trawling for fish and other benthic organisms. Fish have been collected from the site by scientists from Palmer Station since the early 1970s, and it is recognised as an important spawning ground for several species, including Black Rockcod and <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Icefish.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Eastern Dallmann Bay Antarctic Specially Protected Area is {{a marine}} Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 153) lying {{at the eastern}} end of Dallmann Bay, {{adjacent}} to the north-western and northern coasts of Brabant Island in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica. With an area of about 676 km2 it covers shallow marine waters that are suitable for bottom trawling for demersal fish and other benthic organisms for scientific research. The area contains important habitat for juvenile fish, especially Black Rockcod and <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Icefish.</b> The fish collected from the site are used in studies of their physiological and biochemical adaptations to low temperatures.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} in situ observations on nesting by the Scotia Sea (or <b>blackfin)</b> <b>icefish</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus (Lönnberg) {{that constitute the}} first substantive evidence of egg brooding and parental care by species of the family Channichthyidae. At Boutetoya Island six fish, all apparently male, were observed guarding egg nests at depths of 141 – 148 m during an ROV deployment. Eggs were laid as aggregated, round masses (~ 20 – 25 cm diameter) in shallow, circular depressions (~ 1 -m diameter, ~ 20 -cm depth) that were probably excavated by the parent(s) to protect the nests. The fish guardians remained tenaciously {{in contact with the}} eggs despite disturbances caused by the ROV, reacting to this threat with stress and defense behaviors. Because brooding fishes are more susceptible to the population impacts from trawl fisheries, we argue that this life history should be kept in mind in designing management schemes...|$|E
40|$|The anisakid {{nematodes}} morphologically corresponding with Pseudoterranova decipiens {{sensu lato}} (s. l.) (Krabbe, 1878) from different seal or sea lion hosts and geographical origins, previously identified as Pseudoterranova krabbei, P. decipiens (s. s.), P. bulbosa, P. azarasi and P. cattani by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, were characterized using a DNA approach. Also {{a population of}} P. decipiens (s. l.) from Chaenocephalus aceratus, the <b>blackfin</b> <b>icefish,</b> from Antarctica and another from Osmerus eperlanus, the European smelt, from Germany {{were included in the}} study. The first (ITS- 1) and second (ITS- 2) internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were amplified by PCR from individual nematodes and analysed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), followed by selective sequencing. While no variation in single-stranded ITS- 1 and ITS- 2 profiles was detected among samples representing each of the species or populations (with the exception of slight microheterogeneity), SSCP analysis of the ITS- 2 amplicons allowed the unequivocal differentiation of all of the 5 sibling species of P. decipiens (s. l.) examined, which was supported by sequence differences in ITS rDNA. Samples representing the P. decipiens (s. l.) population from O. eperlanus had the same SSCP profile as those of P. decipiens (s. s.), which was supported by a lack of nucleotide difference in the ITS between them, suggesting that the former represented P. decipiens (s. s.). Based on SSCP results and ITS sequence data, P. decipiens (s. l.) from C. aceratus was genetically most distinct with respect to all other members of Pseudoterranova examined, which indicated that it may represent P. decipiens E (based on geographical origin) or a distinct species. These findings and the molecular approach taken should have important implications for studying the life-cycles, transmission patterns, epidemiology and population genetics of these anisakid nematodes, and the diagnosis of their infections...|$|E
