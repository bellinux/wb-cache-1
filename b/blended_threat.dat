It includes analysis of network-based attacks, {{a review of}} known vulnerabilities, and highlights of malicious code. This summary of that report can alert executives to impending threats and current trends. With over 20, 000 sensors monitoring network activity in over 180 countries, Symantec has established {{one of the most}} comprehensive sources of Internet threat data in the world, giving Symantec's analysts a superior source of attack data from which to spot important trends. These trends educate executives about potential threats and exposures, and using the data can help them identify weaknesses in their own security architecture or policies. In August 2003, the Win 32.

40|$|Exploits, vulnerabilities, and buffer-overflow {{techniques}} {{have been used}} by malicious hackers and virus writers for a long time. However, until recently, these techniques were not common place in computer viruses. The CodeRed worm was a major shock to the antivirus industry since it was the first worm that spread not as a file, but solely in memory by utilizing a buffer overflow in Microsoft IIS. Many antivirus companies were unable to provide protection against CodeRed, while other companies with a wider focus on security were able to provide solutions to the relief of end users. Usually new techniques are picked up and used by copy cat virus writers. Thus, many other similarly successful worms followed CodeRed, such as Nimda and Badtrans. In this paper, the authors will not only cover such techniques as buffer overflows and input validation exploits, but also how computer viruses are using them to their advantage.

40|$|In the past, {{physical}} security and cyber security {{were seen as}} two distinctly different disciplines. Physical protection systems were not vulnerable to cyber-attacks because they were analogue, and physical damage to an organisation could be caused realistically only via physical means. Today, however, cameras, sensor alarms, physical access and industrial process controls all rely on software and electronics and are often connected on an IP network. This renders them vulnerable to cyber-attacks {{in the same way}} as corporate networks. As a result, IT/cyber security staff have a responsibility towards their facility’s {{physical security}} and safety. Similarly, breaching the physical security of a facility invariably puts its cyber security at risk, as data can be stolen, equipment can be damaged to disrupt network connections and malicious USB sticks can be inserted into the facility’s computers. As a result, physical security staff have a responsibility towards their facility’s cyber security, too. Ensuring that this takes place requires the integration of both systems. The on-going integration of the cyber and physical domain should not be seen only as a risk and a source of new threats, but also as an opportunity. It reduces costs, increases operational efficiencies, streamlines the management of security breaches in both domains, allows for more effective forensic investigations, and, crucially, puts the organisation in a stronger position for protecting against current and future <b>blended</b> <b>threats.</b> This WINS Best Practice Guide presents a practical overview of how to effectively integrate physical and cyber security in a nuclear installation. It discusses a variety of cyber-physical threats and suggests a variety of ways to protect against them by integrating physical and cyber security. Special attention is also placed on insider threat, including its relevance to cyber-physical security, its behavioural indicators, and measures that can be taken to protect against unwitting insiders...|$|R
40|$|For many years, {{security}} on the Internet has been a rapidly escalating arms race between automated malware (worms, viruses, and web) and commercial security product updates that detect and block attacks.

40|$|With the Internet's {{rapid growth}} {{has come a}} {{proportional}} increase in exposure to attacks, misuse and abuse. Modern viruses and worms are causing damage {{much more quickly than}} those created in the past. The fast replication and epidemic nature of the spreads limits the time security experts have to respond and be able to protect and fortify their systems. A pathogen might infect thousands of machines and cascade across the network producing consequences that could overwhelm the internet very quickly. Such attacks have the potential of making a human response to them all but ineffective. While pathogens are becoming much more aggressive, there is also a significant delay between the identification of a new threat and the generation of a cure for it. Worms and viruses have been able to cause significant damage in this 'submission to cure generation' window of vulnerability. Having timely and credible security information is thus becoming critical to network and security management. The main hypothesis behind our research is that sharing threat information and forensic evidence among cooperating domains yields important benefits for dealing with modern day pathogens in a timely fashion. The idea is that each host might have an incomplete, approximate or inexact information about a particular threat or attack. We can get a more comprehensive view of the extent and nature of developing threats by observing suspect behavior and combining information gathered from different vantage points. A better understanding of the pathogen allows for effective and timely immunization in order to thwart epidemic cascading of threats. We also propose cooperative policing mechanisms as an effective approach to trace large scale distributed threats like Ddos attacks. Increased cooperation amongst domains helps to mitigate such attacks nearer to the sources so that their effects on the overall network are minimized. This thesis leverages experiences and ideas from fields of cryptography, machine learning, security and multi-agent systems to build Foresight: an internet scale threat analysis, indication, early warning and response architecture. Foresight allows cooperating domains to share a global threat view in order to detect zero-day pathogens and isolate them using cooperative policing mechanisms. - We describe a novel behavioral signature scheme to extract a generalized footprint for multi-modal <b>threats.</b> <b>Blended</b> or multi-modal <b>threats</b> combine the characteristics of viruses, worms, trojan horses and malicious code to initiate, transmit and spread attacks. By using multiple methods and techniques, <b>blended</b> <b>threats</b> can quickly spread and surpass defenses that address only a single type of malicious activity and hence are much more difficult to defend against. System performance analysis, through trace-based simulations, shows significant benefits for sharing forensics data between cooperating domains. - We present Mail-trap, an anomaly based system that catches zero-day email borne pathogens and retards their growth through effective behavior monitoring of mail traffic and active forensics sharing between cooperating domains. Mail-trap relies on Foresight's cooperative policing model to identify and pre-empt email-borne threats. Our results show that behavior monitoring alone can be an effective tool for malware detection. Cooperation amongst domains greatly increases the effectiveness of our approach. Domains are able to pre-empt attacks and respond to malware behavior that they have not seen before. We also analyze various immunization/prevention and containment techniques. - We present AMP, a service architecture for countering distributed denial of service attacks using alert sharing and cooperative policing mechanisms. Our simulation architecture enables us to test the system with actual, benign and worm traffic traces, and realistic network topologies. AMP does not require universal deployment and is complementary to other schemes for countering Ddos attacks, however with the use of collaborative policing techniques, the performance of the scheme can be improved greatly. - We also present a prototype implementation for Paranoid, a novel global secure file sharing mechanism which can be used to allow secure resource access across administrative domains. We describe the design of a trust-based cooperation scheme to create a global community which is more accountable and hence less vulnerable to attacks and abuse. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Previously {{reported}} {{methods of}} forecasting lightning threat using fields of graupel flux from WRF simulations are extended {{to include the}} simulated field of vertically integrated ice within storms. Although the ice integral shows less temporal variability than graupel flux, it provides more areal coverage, and can thus {{be used to create}} a lightning forecast that better matches the areal coverage of the lightning threat found in observations of flash extent density. A <b>blended</b> lightning forecast <b>threat</b> can be constructed that retains much of the desirable temporal sensitivity of the graupel flux method, while also incorporating the coverage benefits of the ice integral method. The graupel flux and ice integral fields contributing to the blended forecast are calibrated against observed lightning flash origin density data, based on Lightning Mapping Array observations from a series of case studies chosen to cover a wide range of flash rate conditions. Linear curve fits that pass through the origin are found to be statistically robust for the calibration procedures...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{advances}} {{the idea}} that the modern organization can become immune to a full spectrum of risks by re-engineering its organizational capability and culture. Given the accepted role of people in causing or escalating technical risk – the requirement to achieve ‘always on' socio-technical protection poses a significant challenge. However, an enterprise's human resources offer a massive potential to detect and report risk and there is also substantial competitive advantage available to the organization which develops, integrates, leverages and acts on intelligence gained from a suite of socio-technical sensors and sense-making processes. The human resources and culture of an organization, properly configured, could comprise a powerful innate (constant) and adaptive (active) immune system. The chapter will provide the reader with a framework for how such an immune capability could be integrated into an organization that takes seriously the requirement to be ‘always on' – protected from any form or <b>blend</b> of socio-technical <b>threat...</b>|$|R
40|$|More {{than four}} {{years after the end of}} major combat {{operations}} in the 2003 Iraq War, the United States military continues to sustain casualties at rates higher than those during the ground campaign. Combat service support soldiers conducting daily convoy operations on the Iraqi road network account for a large number of these casualties. One reason for this is the threat's affinity to targeting soft, vulnerable, high-payoff targets through the use of roadside bombs, otherwise known as improvised explosive devices. This enemy tactic is characteristic of asymmetric warfare, in which a lesser opponent opposes a force far superior in numbers, equipment, and technology. In an asymmetric operating environment, <b>threats</b> <b>blend</b> in with the local populace making them hard to detect and are easily capable of multi-directional attacks; absent are the linear battlefields of past wars where logistical soldiers operated in the relative safety of the rear battlefield. This thesis explores a mathematical approach to decide how to use available resources to best protect logistical convoys. To achieve this we first model the threat using probabilistic models and identify input data requirements associated with the operating environment and other relevant factors. (cont.) Second, we identify a set of force protection resources and model their counter-effects on the threat. Next, we develop a binary integer program to optimally allocate the force protection resources to a set of planned logistical convoys. Our model uses an algorithm that assigns resources to either fixed areas or individual convoys in a way that minimizes overall threat effects to the convoys. The algorithm provides lower-risk plans yielding a lower expected number of casualties. We propose integrating this force protection algorithm in conjunction with convoy planning software that optimally builds and routes convoys based on minimizing exposure to the threat to achieve even better plans. We test the performance of a system that accomplishes this by comparing its resulting plans to human-generated plans in a controlled experiment. Additionally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations to statistically analyze the system's performance. We find that the system produces lower-risk plans in less time than human planners. We describe future development of this methodology to reducing soldier casualties, and a proposed approach for its integration into existing Army systems and processes. by Keith W. DeGregory.
