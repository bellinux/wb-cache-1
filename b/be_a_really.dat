500|$|The {{comedy is}} black, {{with the most}} overt humour coming from Stuart, a {{flamboyant}} character played by Shearsmith. The humour is also extremely British. Tropes of Britishness identified by PopMatters critic David Upton include the dated clothing, and interaction between Katherine and Tim {{at the start of}} the episode. Despite not knowing each other, they converse courteously, which [...] "smacks of more refined days"; the conversation is a [...] "portrayal of social awkwardness". With the introduction of the noticeably younger Lee, there is a clash of customs, illustrating the differing norms of the respective generations. This [...] "1940s aesthetic" [...] and the fact the story took place in a single location tied the episode to [...] "a golden age of plays on British television".

The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky.

The Atlantic's Jessica Levine wrote that the image was [...] "representative of a growing resentment toward alleged abuses by the People's Armed Police," [...] noting that such memes can serve as a barometer of culture in an environment where freedom of speech is limited.

Generally our stories are a little lighter. Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was a moment where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular.

As an inside joke, George Eads, who plays crime scene investigator Nick Stokes on CSI made a cameo as a guest at the wedding reception. Three days after the initial airing of [...] "Fish in a Drawer", [...] "Two And a Half Deaths", the corresponding CSI episode, aired on CBS.

500|$|Uematsu's {{approach}} to composing the game's music was {{to treat it}} like a film soundtrack and compose songs that reflected {{the mood of the}} scenes rather than trying to make strong melodies to [...] "define the game", as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game's new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be [...] "sad but beautiful", rather than more overtly emotional, creating what he feels is a more understated feeling. Uematsu has additionally said that the soundtrack has a feel of [...] "realism", which also prevented him from using [...] "exorbitant, crazy music". The first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic to the game and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu [...] "a sense {{that it was going to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good project".

Mike Doyle, the actor who played O'Halloran, was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call {{a few weeks before the}} episode was filmed in May 2009. Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because, in his words, [...] "I think everybody knew that somebody was going, so they weren't shocked."

500|$|Halo Wars {{garnered}} generally positive reviews. The {{game has}} {{an average of}} 82/100 on aggregate web site Metacritic. Critics were split on whether Halo Wars was a successful console translation of the RTS genre. GameSpy's Allen Rausch argued that, as [...] showed that first-person shooters could work on consoles, Halo Wars [...] "is an RTS ... on a console ... and it works". Tom Price of TeamXbox said that gamers have been waiting {{a long time for}} a console RTS [...] "to get it right", and Halo Wars did so; reviewers for Official Xbox Magazine credited Ensemble with creating a strategy game that felt [...] "absolutely at home on the console", rather than a [...] "poorly shoehorned ... port" [...] of a PC game with clumsy controls. 1UP's Thierry Nguyen was neutral about whether it was a good RTS game or Halo title, but called it a [...] "solid beginning towards what could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good console RTS". Digital Trends' Scott Steinberg said that, while not perfect, Halo Wars made a strong case for the viability of RTS on consoles; [...] "There's certainly the potential to have PC holdouts seriously reconsidering hoisting the controller." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle offered a dismissive summation of the game as [...] "a remedial game—real-time strategy for dummies", and stated that the game offered relatively little innovation when compared to other Halo titles.|$|E

[...] It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series Hollyoaks Later. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them.

500|$|She {{appeared}} as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer (Sean Combs), in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball. Her performance {{was awarded the}} National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress; in an interesting coincidence {{she became the first}} woman of color to win the Academy Award for Best Actress (earlier in her career, she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge, the first African American to be nominated for Best Actress, and who was born at the same hospital as Berry, in Cleveland, Ohio). The NAACP issued the statement: [...] "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing." [...] This role generated controversy. Her graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part. Berry responded: [...] "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie.

To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
