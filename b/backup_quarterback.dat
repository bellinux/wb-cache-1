5|$|In Week 3 of the 2005 season, both Pennington and <b>backup</b> <b>quarterback</b> Jay Fiedler {{were injured}} against the Jaguars. With both quarterbacks {{out for the}} season, third-string quarterback Brooks Bollinger started; the 41-year-old Testaverde was brought out of {{retirement}} to serve as his backup. Bollinger played badly in a loss in week four, and Testaverde became the starter. Testaverde had little success, and Bollinger did not fare better when he was re-inserted.

5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores.

5|$|The Eagles re-signed Sanchez to a two-year, $16 million {{contract}} on March 8, 2015, but despite his {{play in the}} 2014 season, he remained the <b>backup</b> <b>quarterback</b> as Nick Foles was traded for Sam Bradford. In Bradford's first several games, he had thrown more interceptions than touchdowns and often had a low completion percentage, but head coach Chip Kelly refused to bench Bradford in favor of Sanchez. Ironically, Sanchez would get his first playing time when Bradford was playing his best football of the season.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>quarterbacks</b> were {{commonly}} used to punt well into the 1970s. Steve Spurrier, who was stuck behind John Brodie at quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, served as the team's primary punter {{for the first four}} years of his career. Bob Lee took on the same role for the Minnesota Vikings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, punting for the club in Super Bowl IV.|$|R
50|$|Dan Crowley was the team's first {{starting}} <b>quarterback.</b> Throughout 2002, <b>backup</b> <b>quarterbacks,</b> Chuck Clements and Oteman Sampson, {{also saw}} some starting time.

50|$|Doug Williams' {{original}} {{five-year contract}} expired {{at the beginning}} of the year. A published report of player salaries revealed that Williams, who had led the team to playoff appearances three out of the preceding four seasons, was the sixth-lowest-paid starting quarterback in the NFL. Eighteen NFL <b>backup</b> <b>quarterbacks</b> also had salaries higher than Williams'. His $120,000 salary was the same as that of Atlanta Falcons backup Mike Moroski, and behind that of both Dallas <b>backup</b> <b>quarterbacks</b> and some teams' punters and kickers. Buccaneer spokesman Rick Odioso responded that Williams had refused several offers to increase his salary and extend his contract, instead preferring to play the contract through to the end. Odioso also pointed out that the reported base salaries did not reflect performance and signing bonuses, on which the Buccaneers depended more heavily than most NFL teams. Believing his worth to have been around $400,000, which was in line with what most top NFL quarterbacks were being paid, Williams had rejected the team's contract offers in previous years in an attempt to force the team to pay him fairly or trade him.|$|R
5|$|The New York Jets signed Gault as a {{free agent}} in 1973, and he was slated to compete with Al Woodall for the <b>backup</b> <b>quarterback</b> spot behind Joe Namath. At the end of preseason, he lost the backup spot to Woodall, and was released. The {{following}} year, Gault signed with the New York Stars of the new World Football League in April. After practicing with the team throughout the offseason, he was released in August, ending his professional career.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense, though {{far less}} {{successful}} than Tennessee's, {{also had some}} high performers. Running Back Dwayne Thomas finished the game with 19 carries for 102 yards and a touchdown, becoming the game's leading rusher in terms of yardage, if not points scored. The Hokies' leading receiver, Bryan Still, caught five passes for 79 yards and a touchdown. The touchdown pass came from Tech <b>backup</b> <b>quarterback</b> Jim Druckenmiller, who finished the game having completed six of his eight pass attempts for 97 yards and the touchdown.|$|E
5|$|After the Chiefs {{acquired}} quarterback Matt Cassel {{from the}} New England Patriots, Croyle entered training camp competing against Tyler Thigpen for a roster spot as <b>backup</b> <b>quarterback.</b> The first depth chart {{in training camp}} listed Croyle as the second quarterback ahead of Thigpen. Croyle entered the Chiefs' first preseason game of 2009 (against the Houston Texans) as the second quarterback and finished as the team's leading passer (12-of-18 for 145 yards) and looked poised throughout the evening to post a 91.2 quarterback rating. The Chiefs {{would go on to}} lose the game 16–10. After quarterback Matt Cassel was injured on August 29 against the Seattle Seahawks, Croyle started the final game of the preseason against the St. Louis Rams.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} regular season game at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, a late {{touchdown}} by the 49ers caused a tie and dropped Green Bay into a tie with the Colts. Although the Packers defeated Baltimore twice {{during the regular}} season, the rules at the time required a tiebreaker playoff, played in Green Bay on December 26. With <b>backup</b> <b>quarterbacks</b> playing for both teams, the Packers tied the Colts late and won in overtime, 13-10.|$|R
50|$|Keenum {{threw for}} 1,760 yards and 9 {{touchdowns in the}} 8 games he started for the Texans, before being waived on August 31, 2014. Keenum {{was picked up by}} the St. Louis Rams the next day and was on their {{practice}} squad. He re-signed with the Houston Texans on December 15, 2014 after their starting and <b>backup</b> <b>quarterbacks</b> were injured. On March 10, 2015, the Rams traded a draft pick to the Texans for Keenum.|$|R
5000|$|As a rookie, Mitchell {{started off}} his career by {{returning}} the opening kickoff of the Redskins first pre-season {{game for a}} touchdown. During a Monday Night Football game {{that came to be}} known as [...] "The Body Bag Game" [...] on November 12, 1990, Mitchell had to be subbed in as quarterback after the Philadelphia Eagles knocked the Redskins' starting and <b>backup</b> <b>quarterbacks</b> out of the game. Mitchell went 3-for-6 for 40 yards passing and ran for a touchdown.|$|R
