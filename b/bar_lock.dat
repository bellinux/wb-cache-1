50|$|The Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened between Birmingham and Selly Oak on 30 October 1795 {{but took}} until 1815 to {{complete}} to Worcester, at which time, after much lobbying by iron and coal masters and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company, an Act of Parliament was passed {{to open up}} the bar and the <b>bar</b> <b>lock</b> was built. There were toll offices either side of the <b>bar</b> <b>lock</b> and tolls were collected by each company from boats using the canals. The Worcester Bar still exists, with boats moored to both sides of it. It is connected to Gas Street via a footbridge reconstructed to a design by Horseley Ironworks of the 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|Widows <b>Bar</b> <b>Lock</b> and Dam was a dam once {{located along}} the Tennessee River in Jackson County, Alabama, USA. It was {{situated}} 407 mi above {{the mouth of}} the Tennessee River, near the river's confluence with Widows Creek. The dam was completed 8 September 1924, and was designed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It was serviced by a 60 ft by 265 ft navigation lock. [...] When the Tennessee Valley Authority took control of flood control and navigation improvement operations in the Tennessee Valley in the 1930s, Widows Bar was considered too high maintenance, and it was dismantled as part of the construction of Guntersville Dam.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1950, the Soviets {{produced}} the Pegmantit 3 (also {{known as the}} P-3), an acquisition radar based on foreign technology. The P-3 was referred to by the NATO reporting name [...] "Dumbo" [...] in the west). Dumbo was soon joined in 1949 by the Перископ НИИ-244 (Periscope RI-244), a purely Soviet-designed First Soviet microwave EW radar called Token and later <b>Bar</b> <b>Lock</b> by NATO. These radar sets were quickly produced and installed across the country. A number of other early warning radar systems were under development by 1950, {{and there was a}} significant increase in improving existing radar system designs between 1952 and 1955. Over time, Soviet research assimilated foreign technology, integrating these new concepts to their own designs.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, TVA began {{expanding}} {{the size of}} its dam locks to accommodate the increase in river traffic the Tennessee Valley had experienced since the end of World War II. A study in 1963 suggested that {{expanding the}} size of the Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>lock</b> would be extremely expensive, and considering the continued expenses involved with leak repair, TVA decided that would be more practical to replace the dam altogether. Nickajack Dam was authorized in January 1963 and construction was completed December 14, 1967. Operations were halted at Hales Bar Dam the following day, and by September 1968, Hales Bar Dam had been dismantled {{to the extent that it}} no longer threatened navigation on the new Nickajack Lake. Two of Hales Bar's generators and parts of Hales Bar's switchyard were installed at Nickajack.|$|E

Rather than spend the necessary expenses to upgrade Hales Bar, a decision was made in 1963 to build a new dam altogether on a more solid bedrock a few miles downstream.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} project, {{which was}} {{presented}} to the team by Kevin Maher (President of Advanced Therapeutic devices), was to develop a product prototype for safe, vestibular stimulation for children with developmental disabilities. Vestibular stimulation is a form of therapy that increases muscle coordination. It works by stimulating the canals and sacs within the inner ear that detect accelerations. The project targeted children from ages two to seven years old, under 48 inches tall, and less than 100 lbs. The production device also sought to differ from stimulation devices found in hospitals in a few respects: it would cost under $ 5000, reside in a patient’s home, be hand-powered, and be controlled by an average person. The final device needed to support a 200 lb. load {{at the edge of the}} structure and adjust for the center of gravities for the range of children. After sessions of brainstorming, the team produced three workable layouts, only one was adequate. The final setup had a structure of ¼ in. aluminum structural pipe similar to a football field goal. This structure mounted on a single bearing housing and steel shaft. The final design had two bars to mount weights in order to adjust the center of gravity. The prototype, however, used a swinging <b>bar,</b> <b>lock,</b> and a sliding weight. The final prototype had an adjustable footrest and a five-point restraint harness. The final cost and weight was $ 1700 and no more than 500 lb. The design met all of the requirements and had adequate safety for any child’s needs, but the team thought the design needed significant changes before it became a final product...|$|E
