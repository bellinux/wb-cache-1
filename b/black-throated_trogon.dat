50|$|Carara National Park {{contains}} more primary rainforest than the relatively close Manuel Antonio National Park. As such, it is wetter {{than the more}} popular Manuel Antonio National Park, and has denser tree growth and more mosquitoes and other insects. This environment makes Carara a haven for many bird species making the park a popular birdwatching destination. In addition to scarlet macaws, birds found in Carara include orange-chinned parakeets and other parrots, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, motmots, jacamars, manakins, antbirds, and several species of trogon, including the <b>black-throated</b> <b>trogon.</b> Several species of water birds inhabit the park as well. These include the anhinga, several species of heron, egret and kingfishers.|$|E
50|$|Like most trogons, it has {{distinctive}} {{male and}} female plumages and with soft colourful feathers. This relatively small species is 23-24 cm long and weighs 54-57 g, with a white undertail with black barring, a yellow bill and wing coverts which are vermiculated with black and white, but appear grey at any distance. The male <b>black-throated</b> <b>trogon</b> has a green head, upper breast and back, black face and throat, and golden yellow belly. The female has a brown head, upper breast and back, rufous upper tail and yellow belly. Immatures resemble the adults but are duller, and young males have a brown throat, breast and wing coverts.|$|E
