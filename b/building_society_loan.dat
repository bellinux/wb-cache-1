5000|$|Fingleton had a {{reputation}} as an autocrat and effectively ran a one-man lending department with loans of over €500,000 being personally approved by him. In 2002 it emerged that he had an affair with a subordinate who was provided with a £200,000 settlement after she took her case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. When Irish Nationwides home loans manager Brian Fitzgibbon sued to stop the <b>building</b> <b>society</b> from sacking him in 2007, it reinforced the impression that Fingleton totally dominated the instituition. In his evidence, Fitzgibbon alleged that Fingleton over-ruled his decision not to lend money to rogue solicitors Micheal Lynn and Thomas Byrne to whom the <b>building</b> <b>society</b> <b>loaned</b> over €10m each. Fitzgibbon went on to allege that the Nationwide's lending decisions [...] "were entirely informal and controlled by Michael Fingleton". Fitzgibbon also stated that many loans issued by the Irish Nationwide had not been approved by its credit committee, which existed only to satisfy the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland. Fingleton said the society took [...] "adequate provisions" [...] in 2007 for loans to the rogue solicitors as it booked a total loan loss charge of €48.8m.|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s {{a wave of}} demutualisations have {{occurred}} {{across a range of}} industries from stock exchanges to <b>building</b> <b>societies,</b> savings and <b>loans</b> associations and insurers. In both Australia and South Africa this has had a marked effect on the life insurance markets which had been dominated by mutual life insurers for 150 years. This paper adopts a case study approach to analyse the key drivers of organisational change. It examines the experiences of the Australian Mutual Provident (Australia’s oldest and largest life insurance mutual) and Sanlam (the second largest mutual life office in South Africa) as they proceeded down the path to demutualisation. It suggests a complex array of factors combined to place pressure on the existing mutual structures. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|An eight-roomed semi in Thornton Heath {{could be}} rented for £33 per annum in 1871, {{about half the}} average yearly wage. A {{prospective}} middle-class resident might try to buy such a house for £800. Raising such money usually meant applying to the bank or <b>building</b> <b>society,</b> but private <b>loans</b> were an option, too. Richard Gowlland wrote: [...] "I propose to buy a house: Cooper's eldest brother offered to lend me {{the money for the}} purpose at four per cent. This is really an offer not to be refused. It is cheaper than borrowing money from a <b>building</b> <b>society.</b> Their terms are really a little over five per cent." [...] Rents and prices fell towards the final years of the period, reflecting the higher density development and a recession. An eight-roomed house in 1907 could be rented for less than £22 per annum. The same houses were for sale at £650 on an eighty-nine year lease. Flats were not in proportion price-wise. Rent of a three-room flat cost 7s per week in 1908, or a four-room flat 8s per week.|$|R
50|$|Heatherside was {{put into}} the hands of an {{administrative}} receiver, Vivian Bairstow of Begbies Traynor. In 2002 Bairstow instructed FPDSavills and Knight Frank, to sell Updown Court to recover the company's assets and pay back creditors, who included an overseas lender. The guide price for the sale was £15 million and bids closed on 10 July 2002. A developer, Leslie Allen-Vercoe completed the purchase of the unfinished shell for £13 million (the approximate 2009 equivalent of £20 million) in January 2003. A planned further £30 million was to be spent finishing and redeveloping the property and the project was mainly funded by loans from the Irish Nationwide <b>Building</b> <b>Society,</b> who had <b>loaned</b> money to the previous developers; Heatherside Property Holdings. Allen-Vercoe engaged British architects Eades Hotwani, to replace John Scholz, and hired Italian craftsmen to lay the marble tiles and mosaics which adorned the interior of the property.|$|R

2500|$|In Australia, <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> evolved along British lines. Following end of World War II, the {{terminating}} {{model was}} revived to fund returning serviceman's {{need for new}} houses. Hundreds were created with government seed capital whereby the capital was returned {{to the government and}} the terminating societies retained the interest accumulated. Once all the seed funds were <b>loaned</b> each terminating <b>society</b> could reapply for more seed capital {{to the point where they}} could re-lend their own funds and thus became a [...] permanent <b>society.</b> Terminating <b>loans</b> were still available and used inside the permanent businesses by staff up until the 1980s because their existence was not widely known after the early 1960s. Because of strict regulations on banks, <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the 1980s. Eventually many of the smaller <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> disappeared, while some of the largest (such as St. George) officially attained the status of banks. Recent conversions have included Heritage Bank which converted from <b>building</b> <b>society</b> to bank in 2011, Hume in 2014, while Wide Bay <b>Building</b> <b>Society</b> became Auswide Bank and IMB followed suit in 2015 Greater <b>Building</b> <b>Society</b> became Greater Bank in 2016. <b>Building</b> <b>societies</b> converting to banks are no longer required to demutualise.|$|R
