Depending on the condition and importance of the item this can include gluing the media onto more stable media, or protective enclosing of the media.

500|$|... "Damien" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} was viewed by 3.2 million households {{when it was}} first broadcast, making it the highest rated cable program the week it aired. The episode marked the first appearance of Satan, who would become a recurring South Park character, as well as the character of Damien himself, who was inspired by the antagonist of the 1976 horror film The Omen. Parker and Stone also said the episode introduced several key characteristics of the Cartman character that have endured {{throughout the rest of the}} series. Michael <b>Buffer,</b> the <b>boxing</b> ring announcer best known for the catchphrase [...] "Let's get ready to rumble!", makes a guest appearance in [...] "Damien" [...] as himself.|$|R

This paper presents a feasibility study to investigate a new packaging concept where the product and box conveyors are uncoupled by introducing <b>buffer</b> positions for <b>boxes</b> with each packaging robot.

500|$|Michael <b>Buffer,</b> the <b>boxing</b> ring {{announcer}} {{best known}} for his catchphrase, [...] "Let's get ready to rumble!", made a guest appearance as himself in [...] "Damien". Parker and Stone originally planned to use the catchphrase without Buffer, but when they learned that Buffer had legally trademarked the phrase, they included him in the episode since getting the rights for the catchphrase cost nearly as much as hiring Buffer for a guest appearance. Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him. Voice actor Mike Judge, star of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character, and even recorded several lines for the part.

40|$|Broadcasting {{protocols}} {{reduce the}} cost of video-ondemand services by distributing more efficiently videos that are likely to be simultaneously watched by several viewers. Unfortunately, they do not allow the customer to pause, move fast forward or backward while watching a video. We present an interactive pagoda broadcasting protocol that provides these functions at a very reasonable cost. Our protocol is based on the pagoda broadcasting protocol and requires a set-top <b>box</b> <b>buffer</b> large enough to keep in storage all video data until the customer has watched the entire video. As a result, rewind and pause interactions do not require any server intervention. To minimize the bandwidth requirements of fast forward interactions, the server only transmits the segments that are not available on any of the server broadcasting channels. We evaluate the overhead of these fast forward operations through a probabilistic model. Our data indicate that the most costly fast forward operations are those starting {{at the beginning of the}} video and jumping to the beginning of the second half of the video while most fast-forward operation taking place during the second half of the video require little or no additional data. 1...|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to Michael <b>Buffer,</b> the American <b>boxing</b> promoter Don King is featured prominently in [...] "Damien" [...] as Satan's promoter. Parker {{said he and}} Stone decided to spoof King only because [...] "it's just sort of who annoyed us that week. It's so random ... {{there is no point}} to who we're ripping on. It's definitely nothing personal." [...] Nancy Kerrigan, the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater Tonya Harding at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the gold medal until Kyle reminds him she won the silver; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place. During that same pep talk, Stan tells Jesus, [...] "You know, someone once said, 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man.'" [...] Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself, it was actually a line from the 1996 film, [...] [...] "Damien" [...] also includes a reference to singer Nancy Sinatra, the daughter of legendary crooner Frank Sinatra. Mr. Garrison, while discussing great singers of the baroque period, {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass".|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of management initiatives {{implemented in the}} context of the European Common Fisheries Policy has been questioned, especially with regard to the Mediterranean. Some of the analyses made to compare the fishing activity and management measures carried out in the North East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean do not take into account some of the differentiating peculiarities of each of these regions. At the same time, they resort to traditional fisheries management measures and do not discuss the role of marine protected areas as a complementary management tool. In this respect, the apparent failure of marine protected areas in the North-East Atlantic compared with the same in the Mediterranean is challenging European fishery scientists. Application of the classical holistic view of ecological succession to the functioning of fishery closures and no-use areas highlights the importance of combining both management regimes to fully satisfy both fishery- and biodiversity-oriented goals. We advocate that an optimal management strategy for designing an MPA to protect biodiversity and sustain fishing yields consists of combining a network of no-use areas (close to their mature state) with fish <b>boxes</b> (<b>buffer</b> zones maintained by fishing disturbance in a relatively early successional stage, where productivity is higher), under a multi-zoning scheme. In this framework, the importance of no-use areas for fisheries is based on several observations: (1) They preserve biological diversity at regional scale, at all levels—specific, habitat/seascape, and also genetic diversity and the structure of populations, allowing natural selection to operate. (2) They permit the natural variability of the system to be differentiated from the effects of regulation and to be integrated in appropriate sampling schemes as controls. (3) They maintain the natural size and age structure of the populations, hence maximizing potential fecundity, allowing biomass export to occur from core to regulated areas, dampening the fluctuations derived from deviations from the theoretical optimal effort in the fishing zone...|$|R
