5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to <b>be</b> <b>throwing</b> away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues {{that she was not}} looking forward to spending the weekend alone as it would be her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would <b>be</b> <b>throwing</b> the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-licence, Bargain Booze.|$|E

25|$|After the Tigers had {{clinched}} the 1968 American League pennant, McLain {{added to his}} penchant for notoriety while pitching his 31st and final regular season victory {{in a game against}} the Yankees on September 19. McLain had grown up idolizing New York Yankee center fielder Mickey Mantle, who entered the game tied with Jimmie Foxx for third place in the major-league career home runs list. When Mantle—who was nine days away from his last major league appearance—came to bat in the eighth inning with the Tigers holding a 6-1 lead, McLain intentionally threw a soft pitch directly over home plate. Other accounts said that he called catcher Jim Price to the mound and had him tell Mantle that he would <b>be</b> <b>throwing</b> only fastballs. Mantle hit the pitch for his 535th career home run, putting him in sole possession of third place on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. As Mantle ran around the bases, McLain stood on the pitcher's mound and applauded. Mantle tipped his hat to McLain as he rounded the bases. The next batter, Joe Pepitone, waved his bat over the plate, as if asking for an easy pitch of his own. McLain responded by throwing the next pitch over Pepitone's head. After the game, McLain smilingly denied that he had served up an easy pitch for Mantle to hit; however, he was later reprimanded by Major League Baseball Commissioner William Eckert.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2006 tour of New Zealand another Muralitharan critic, former New Zealand {{captain and}} cricket {{commentator}} Martin Crowe, called for Muralitharan's doosra {{to be monitored}} more closely, asserting that his action seemed to deteriorate during a match. Earlier that year when delivering the Cowdrey lecture at Lords Martin Crowe had demanded zero tolerance instead of 15 degrees for throwing and specifically branded Muttiah Muralitharan a chucker. In response to Crowe's criticism ICC general manager Dave Richardson stated that the scientific evidence presented by biomechanists Professor Bruce Elliot, Dr Paul Hurrion and Mr Marc Portuswith was overwhelming and clarified that [...] "Some bowlers, even those not suspected of having flawed actions, were found likely to be straightening their arms by 11 or 12 degrees. And at the same time, some bowlers that may appear to <b>be</b> <b>throwing</b> may be hyper-extending or bowl with permanently bent elbows. Under a strict interpretation of the law, they were breaking the rules – but if we ruled out every bowler that did that {{then there would be}} no bowlers left." ...|$|E

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick.

5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744".
