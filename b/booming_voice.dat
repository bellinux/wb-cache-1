25|$|He was a {{large man}} with quite a <b>booming</b> <b>voice,</b> and {{according}} to James Byam Shaw possessed something of a dual character, being business-like and intellectual with his male friends, but with {{women of all ages}} had all the charm and manners of an aristocrat from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood {{get lost}} in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant. The Witch arrives as well, {{bringing}} news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house. Suddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears. To the shock of all, this Giant is a woman who has come from the second beanstalk and is the widow of the Giant that Jack killed by chopping down the beanstalk. Her <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge. To satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize that the Narrator is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines. Everyone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him. Nevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed upon being dropped. Jack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her. As the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to the horror of the Witch and her Prince ("Witch's Lament").|$|E

5000|$|Producers and {{agencies}} {{are on the}} look out for many styles of <b>voices</b> such as <b>booming</b> <b>voices,</b> which maybe perfect for more dramatic productions or cute, young sounding voices that are perfect for trendier markets. Some just sound like regular, natural, everyday people {{and all of these}} voices have their place in the Voiceover world, providing they are used correctly and in the right context.|$|R

25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, <b>booming</b> <b>voice,</b> he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E
500|$|From then on Reines {{dedicated}} {{the major}} part of his career {{to the study of}} the neutrino’s properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for future researchers to come. Cowan left Los Alamos [...] in 1957 to teach at George Washington University, ending their collaboration. On the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino, Reines [...] became the head of the physics department of Case Western Reserve University from 1959 to 1966. [...] At Case, he led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Reines had a <b>booming</b> <b>voice,</b> and had been a singer since childhood. During this time, besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department, Reines sang in the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus under the direction of Robert Shaw in performances with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|The USS Enterprise arrives for shore {{leave at}} the paradisiacal, newly {{discovered}} planet of Rubicun III. A small advance party {{from the ship}} are sent down {{to meet with the}} Edo, the native people of the planet. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) sends Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) as part of the away team to evaluate the planet on behalf of the young people on board the Enterprise. Upon their arrival, they are greeted by Rivan (Brenda Bakke) and Liator (Jay Louden) in a very comfortable way, triggering Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) [...] to determine it a [...] "nice planet", while Wesley leaves the adults to socialize with native teenagers. On the Enterprise, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) reports something unusual orbiting the planet, but nothing appears on the viewscreen. He sends out a communications signal which reveals another vessel in orbit. A small ball of light enters the bridge and communicates with Picard through Data in a <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> warning him not to interfere with the Edo, calling them his [...] "children". The intruder then incapacitates Data.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} breeds have deep, <b>booming</b> <b>voices</b> {{and use them}} {{actively}} when running, and especially when following a scent trail. Although {{this can be a}} nuisance in settled areas, it is a valuable trait that allows the dog's handler to follow the dog or pack of dogs during a hunt even when they are out of sight, such as when following a fox or raccoon through woodland.|$|R

500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was {{included}} in the setlist of her Breakaway World Tour (2005). During her concert tour at Germain Arena, Clarkson performed the song wearing the same wedding dress she wore in the song's music video. Clarkson also performed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] on her All I Ever Wanted Tour (2009). While touring at Hammerstein Ballroom, New York City, Clarkson sang the stripped down version of the song, accompanied by guitars and vocal. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone felt that Alanis' influence was evident on the chorus of [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] which was performed acoustically in the event. Clarkson explained that the arrangement was intended to maximize audience sing-along potential in which Jim Cantiello of MTV thought was effective. On December 2011, Clarkson also performed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] on Chicago Theatre as part of the Miracle on State Street benefit concert. Bob Gendron of the Chicago Tribune reviewed Clarkson's performance, writing [...] "the Texas native could've impressed simply by projecting her <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> and relishing its prodigious range. Yet she seemed determined to reinforce female empowerment themes often missing from her mainstream-pop contemporaries' hits." ...|$|E
500|$|He voiced Audrey II, the [...] "street-smart, funky, conniving" [...] talking killer plant {{which is}} an [...] "anthropomorphic cross between a Venus flytrap and an avocado", in the {{original}} off-Broadway production of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's [...] "black-comedy musical" [...] Little Shop of Horrors from 1982. Audrey II was played by four increasingly large puppets, operated by Martin P. Robinson, while Taylor sat in a box {{at the back of}} the stage to voice the role, standing to perform his musical numbers. The two kept in close proximity to ensure [...] "that voice and action are always synchronized" [...] and [...] "developed a rapport" [...] which was [...] "the only thing that allow the character to really bloom." [...] Taylor disliked sitting in the box as it left him feeling disconnected from the audience. The part was his break and was described by Jesse McKinley of The New York Times as [...] "a role Mr. Taylor's <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> was made for... soon put his stamp on Audrey's signature line: 'Feed me, feed me!'" [...] Members of the public often used the line when they saw Taylor. Little Shop of Horrors was performed over 2000 times before it closed in 1987. At the 1983 Drama Desk Awards, Taylor won the award for Outstanding Special Effects for his performance, which he shared with Robinson.|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that {{what he had to say}} was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cheerleading {{is one of}} the few {{fields that}} still uses {{acoustic}} megaphones. Cheerleaders at the University of Minnesota are credited with first using acoustic megaphones in routines in 1898. Since then, cheerleaders have relied heavily on acoustic megaphones during performances at sporting events. Generally, female cheerleaders would use pom pons while male cheerleaders, with loud <b>booming</b> <b>voices,</b> would project cheers through megaphones. [...] Vocal projection is an important aspect for cheerleading, so experts recommend the use of acoustic megaphones not only to increase the volume of sound, but also to protect performers’ voices in the process.|$|R
50|$|For a bird of {{such great}} size, the great slaty {{woodpecker}} has a weak, quiet voice, especially {{compared to other}} large woodpeckers, which tend to have loud, <b>booming</b> <b>voices.</b> The species call is a whinnying cackle of 2 to 5, usually 4 notes, woikwoikwoikwoik, the initial being higher in pitched and the middle note being distinctly lower. Single dwot calls, variable in sound, strength and duration, are sometimes given while perched or in flight. Breeding pairs of these woodpeckers have been heard to softly mew at each other. In more antagonistic situations, sharp taw-whit or dew-it calls are uttered while the birds swing their heads back and forth.|$|R

2500|$|The South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, {{secretly}} {{written by}} Calhoun, asserted that their state {{had the right}} to [...] "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. One incident was at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. Robert Hayne began by toasting to [...] "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States". Jackson then rose, and in a <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> added [...] "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!"– a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding [...] "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Watkins {{was born}} in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1938. He was of African, Indian and Spanish heritage. When his mother {{gave birth to}} him, she was only {{fourteen}} years old and Watkins was raised by his grandmother. He studied microbiology at Rutgers University and also trained as a boxer. His operatically trained and signature <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> took him to Europe where he became so popular that {{he was invited to}} entertain at the Royal Command Performance for the Queen of the United Kingdom. The Times called him “the best entertainer on earth.” In South Africa he received two gold albums and was so celebrated that a public parade was held in his honor – an unprecedented reception for a black entertainer at the height of Apartheid. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1961 while promoting his album [...] "The Big, Big Voice of Lovelace Watkins", music arranged and conducted by Ray Ellis. In addition to appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show, Lovelace also appeared on the Johnny Carson and Mike Douglasshows.|$|E

McMahon and Carson left {{the show to}} join The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. He describes what happened when the pair first met, the whole meeting being [...] "... about as exciting as watching a traffic light change". For almost 30 years, McMahon introduced The Tonight Show with a drawn-out [...] "Heeere's Johnny!" [...] His <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> and constant laughter alongside the [...] "King of Late Night" [...] earned McMahon the nickname the [...] "Human Laugh Track" [...] and [...] "Toymaker to the King".

2500|$|Kingston was Attorney-General of South Australia 1884-85 in the {{government}} of John Colton and again in 1887-89 in {{the government}} of Tom Playford. In 1893 he succeeded Playford as leader of the South Australian liberals and defeated conservative Premier John Downer to become Premier 1893-99, a record at the time of six and a half years, not to be broken until Thomas Playford IV, as well as Chief Secretary and Attorney-General, and also Minister for Industry 1895-99. Kingston came to office with the support of a new third party, the South Australian division of the Labor Party led by John McPherson, which held the balance of power. A big, imposing man with a full beard, a <b>booming</b> <b>voice</b> and a violent, cutting debating style, Kingston dominated the small world of South Australian colonial politics in the 1890s. He was a great hero to liberals and working class voters, and much hated by conservatives. [...] In 1892, Richard Baker called him a [...] "coward, a bully and a disgrace to the legal profession" [...] in the Legislative Council and Kingston replied by calling Baker [...] "false as a friend, treacherous as a colleague, mendacious as a man, and utterly untrustworthy in every relationship of public life". [...] Kingston arranged for a duel but Baker had him arrested and as a result Kingston was bound over to keep the peace for a year.|$|E
