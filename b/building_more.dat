5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue <b>building</b> <b>more</b> locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E

5|$|The Masonic Hall {{sits at the}} {{southern}} end of a terrace. It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with a decorative dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large doorway, and are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building.

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{people moved}} out of the {{surrounding}} Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted more families and made the <b>building</b> <b>more</b> luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire <b>building</b> <b>more</b> even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E

In a later interview with the Daily Telegraph he said that an increase of more than 30 per cent in the fleet's day-to-day budget was necessary to pay for better sailors' wages, the running of ships and improved accommodation. He threatened to resign as head of the navy if the Government failed to agree to pay for two new aircraft carriers – the Royal Navy CVF programme, which it had previously promised.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of <b>building</b> <b>more</b> ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be {{more powerful than the}} two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from <b>building</b> <b>more</b> battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{strategic}} threat changed dramatically during the period that Zeus was being developed. Originally expected to face only a few dozen ICBMs, a nationwide defense was feasible, although expensive. In 1957, growing fears of a Soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned {{as a way to}} protect Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, ensuring a retaliatory strike force would survive. But when the Soviets claimed to be building hundreds of missiles, the US faced the problem of building enough Zeus missiles to match them. The Air Force suggested they close this missile gap by <b>building</b> <b>more</b> ICBMs of their own instead. Adding to the debate, a number of technical problems emerged that suggested Zeus would have little capability against any sort of sophisticated attack.|$|E

5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by <b>building</b> <b>more</b> of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{dreadnought}} race {{stepped up}} in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships {{each year and}} the United Kingdom five. Tension {{came to a head}} following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice of <b>building</b> <b>more</b> battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when social welfare provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean and shaking the stability of the British Empire. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, was to break with the policies of the past and make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.|$|E
