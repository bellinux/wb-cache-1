50|$|The Old Bakery is a stone-built and {{partially}} rendered thatched building. It {{was the last}} traditional working bakery in the county when it closed its doors in 1987. The old baking equipment has been preserved in the <b>baking</b> <b>room</b> {{and the rest of}} the building now serves as a tea room.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an archaeological}} site {{situated}} in Ranhat East Side near Padma Beel. A small bricked structure {{is placed in}} the entire wall. There is an entrance towards the west side. The height is of 6 feet taller from its top to bottom. Also there is a pond near its back. It is uttered that the dome was once used for a cake <b>baking</b> <b>room</b> in ancient times. Trace of this little bricked archive gives a clear understanding about the age.|$|E
50|$|Soroka {{was born}} in Pokrovskoye village (Tver Guberniya), in the family of {{landowner}} Milyukov. In 1842-1847 he studied art from Alexey Venetsianov then he was returned to his owner. In the 1850s-1860s he resided in his home village. He {{fell in love with}} his owners's daughter Lydia but was forcibly married to a serf woman. After the emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia, Soroka remained under the serfdom system. He made a formal complaint but it was rejected and he was flogged. Soroka's body was found in the <b>baking</b> <b>room</b> where he had hanged himself. His beloved Lydia poisoned herself soon after.|$|E
50|$|The acid in {{a baking}} powder can be either {{fast-acting}} or slow-acting. A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with <b>baking</b> soda at <b>room</b> temperature, and a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an oven. Baking powders that contain both fast- and slow-acting acids are double-acting; those that contain only one acid are single-acting. By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical, {{and this is the}} type most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot. Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate, sodium aluminum phosphate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. Despite very low acute toxicity, exposure to aluminum salts has raised concerns regarding potential neurotoxicity.|$|R
5000|$|The Bakery Building was a one story, two-room {{building}} {{constructed in}} 1909 {{to perform the}} function of <b>baking</b> in one <b>room</b> and a second room, called the [...] "milk room" [...] for the handling and storage of meat and dairy products. These functions were relocated to {{the basement of the}} 1913 Schoolhouse about 1932. The old Bakery Building was converted to employee quarters by the mid 1930s. It was vacated {{before the turn of the}} 21st Century. This is a quarry-faced Ashlar stone building that has a hipped roof with gabled dormers at the ends of the roofline. The back of the building has a wood frame extension with a gabled roof, which is covered with gray colored composition shingles. The extension is attached to the northwest corner of the stone structure, causing the floor plan to be L-shaped. The extension has kitchen and bathroom plumbing features that indicate it was probably added when the building was converted to a residence.|$|R
5000|$|Carroll County Almshouse and Farm, {{also known}} as the Carroll County Farm Museum, is a {{historic}} farm complex located at Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland. It consists of a complex of 15 buildings including the main house and dependencies. The 30-room brick main house was originally designed and constructed for use as the county almshouse. It is a long, three-story, rectangular structure, nine bays wide at the first- and second-floor levels of both front and rear façades. It features a simple frame cupola sheltering a farm bell. A separate two-story brick building with 14 rooms houses the original summer kitchen, wash room, and <b>baking</b> <b>room,</b> and may have once housed farm and domestic help. Also on the property is a brick, one-story dairy with a pyramidal roof dominated by a pointed finial of exaggerated height with Victorian Gothic [...] "icing" [...] decorating the eaves; a large frame and dressed stone bank barn; and a blacksmith's shop, spring house, smokehouse, ice house, and numerous other sheds and dependencies all used {{as a part of the}} working farm museum activities. The original Carroll County Almshouse was founded in 1852 and the Farm Museum was established in 1965.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the municipality’s {{financial}} situation worsened dramatically after building {{work on the}} old schoolhouse to convert it into a village community centre. The municipal budget in the years {{around the turn of}} the millennium was wholly unsatisfactory, marked as it was by deficits and other financial problems. Council, headed by mayor Helmut Höning, saw a solution to the problem in raising the municipality’s population figures, but this would only be possible if more building land became available. Given the bad {{financial situation}}, this was not going to be easy. Nonetheless, a plan to do such a thing was developed. The landowners received a basic price for the land in advance, while the municipality took on the job of selling the lots. In 2006, the lots on the market were being offered for sale at a price of €99.50/m². After the 18 building lots had been sold and the appropriate measures had been undertaken, the accounting was done and the additional proceeds were paid out to the former landowners. On 9 July 2006, Roth’s oldest inhabitant died at the age of 102. Mrs. Eva Hoch née Steyer (mayor Johann Steyer’s sister) was born on 25 January 1904 and was married to Hans Hoch, whom she outlived by 35 years. They had two sons and one daughter. There is no record of anyone else in Roth ever having lived to such a great age. In 2009, the old bakehouse and former parish hall in the village centre was renovated from the ground up. A heating system was built in, the <b>baking</b> <b>room</b> was made state-of-the-art and on the upper floor, a mayor’s room and an counselling room were made.|$|E
5000|$|The {{foremost}} {{provisions are}} those {{relating to the}} sanitary condition of the workplaces and the general security of every class of worker. Every factory must be kept in a cleanly condition, free from noxious effluvia, ventilated {{in such a manner}} as to render harmless, so far as practicable, gases, vapours, dust or other impurities generated in the manufacture; must be provided with sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences separate for the sexes; must not be overcrowded (not less than [...] during the day, 400 during overtime, for each worker). In these matters the law of public health takes in workshops the place of the Factory Act, the requirements being substantially the same. Although, however, primarily the officers of the district council enforce the sanitary provisions in workshops, the government factory inspectors may give notice of any defect in them to the district council in whose district they are situate; and if proceedings are not taken within one month by the latter, the factory inspector may act in default and recover expenses from the district council. This power does not extend to domestic workshops which are under the law relating to public health so far as general sanitation is concerned. General powers are reserved to the secretary of state, where he is satisfied that the Factory Act or law relating to public health as regards workplaces has not been carried out by any district council, to authorize a factory inspector during a period named in his order to act instead of the district council. Other general sanitary provisions administered by the government inspectors are the requirement in factories and workshops of washing conveniences where poisonous substances are used; adequate measures for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature of such a kind as will not interfere with the purity of the air in each room in which any person is employed; maintenance of sufficient means of ventilation in every room in a factory or workshop (in conformity with such standard as may be prescribed by order of the secretary of state); provision of a fan to carry off injurious dust, gas or other impurity, and prevent their inhalation in any factory or workshop; drainage of floors where wet processes are carried on. For laundries and bakehouses there are further sanitary regulations; e.g. in laundries all stoves for heating irons shall be sufficiently separated from any ironing-room or ironing-table, and the floors shall be [...] " [...] drained in such a manner as will allow the water to flow off freely [...] "; and in bakehouses a cistern supplying water to a bakehouse must be quite separate from that supplying water to a water-closet, and the latter may not communicate directly with the bakehouse. Use of underground bakehouses (i.e. a <b>baking</b> <b>room</b> with floor more than 3 ft. below the ground adjoining) is prohibited, except where already used at the passing of the act; further, in these cases, after 1 January 1904, a certificate as to suitability in light, ventilation, &c., must be obtained from the district council. In other trades certified by the secretary of state further sanitary regulations may be made to increase security for health by special rules to be presently touched on. The secretary of state may also make sanitary requirements a condition of granting such exceptions to the general law as he is empowered to grant. In factories, as distinct from workshops, a periodical lime washing (or washing with hot water and soap where paint and varnish have been used) of all inside walls and ceilings once at least in every fourteen months is generally required (in bakehouses once in six months). As regards sufficiency and suitability of sanitary accommodation, the standards determined by order of the secretary of state shall be observed in the districts to which it is made applicable. An order was made called the Sanitary Accommodation Order, on 4 February 1903, the definitions and standards in which have also been widely adopted by local sanitary authorities in districts where the Order itself has no legal force, the local authority having parallel power under the Public Health Act of 1890.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} study aims {{to investigate}} the gaseous fluoride and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) pollution level in the kitchen, traditional flue-curing barn and outdoor environment and to find economically feasible method to reduce fluorine and sulfur release. The gaseous fluoride and SO 2 concentrations in air of outdoor environment, kitchen and traditional flue-curing barn were determined in 56 households in coal-burning endemic fluorosis areas of Zhaotong. Among these, 21 households in Yujiawan Village, Zhenxiong County, Zhaotong City were chosen for this experiment to reduce gaseous fluoride and SO 2 concentration in traditional flue-curing barn air by using calcined dolomitic siliceous limestone (CDSL) instead of clay mixed with coal. The result showed that: (1) gaseous fluoride and SO 2 concentration in the outdoor air in Mangbu Township area was 0. 51 gdm- 2 {dot operator}day and < 0. 05 mgm- 3, respectively and in Xiaolongdong Township was 2. 7 gdm- 2 day and < 0. 05 mgm- 3, respectively while in Zhaotong City these concentration were lower than the ambient air standard (3 gdm- 2 {dot operator}day and 0. 5 mgm- 3, respectively). (2) The indoor gaseous fluoride concentration (3. 7 gm- 3) in air of kitchen with the improved coal stove was within the reference value (10 gm- 3); SO 2 concentration (0. 94 mgm- 3) in kitchen air had decline, but its concentration was still higher than indoor air quality standard (0. 5 mgm- 3). (3) Average concentration of gaseous fluoride and SO 2 in air of traditional flue-curing barn of Xiaolongdong Township was 7. 2 gm- 3 and 6. 8 mgm- 3 respectively, and in Yujiawan village were 10. 1 gm- 3 and 14. 4 mgm- 3, respectively. (4) After using the calcined dolomitic siliceous limestone instead of clay mixed with coal, gaseous fluoride and SO 2 concentration in the traditional flue-curing barn air decreased of 45 % and 91 %, respectively. The gaseous fluoride and SO 2 pollution in the traditional flue-curing barn is very serious. The corn and chili baked by open stoves in traditional flue-curing barn (<b>baking</b> <b>room)</b> was also seriously polluted by fluoride and sulfur. After using the calcined dolomitic siliceous limestone instead of clay mixed with coal, gaseous fluoride and SO 2 concentration in the traditional flue-curing barn air have declined markedly.
