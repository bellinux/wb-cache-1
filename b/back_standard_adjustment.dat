If {{the number of}} pre-treatment variables is large, and their distribution varies substantially with treatment status, <b>standard</b> <b>adjustment</b> methods such as covariance adjustment are often inadequate. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) propose an alternative method for adjusting for pre-treatment variables based on the propensity score conditional probability of receiving the treatment given pre-treatment variables. They demonstrate that adjusting solely for the propensity score removes all the bias associated with differences in pre-treatment variables between treatment and control groups. The Rosenbaum-Rubin proposals deal exclusively with the case where treatment takes on only two values. In this paper an extension of this methodology is proposed that allows for estimation of average causal effects with multi-valued treatments while maintaining {{the advantages of the}} propensity score approach. ...|$|R

Initially, when the International Amateur Athletic Association (now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations) started to ratify world records in 1912, only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration.

Consequently the rate of return or present value comparisons based on cross sections are likely to be misleading even if the <b>standard</b> <b>adjustment</b> for growth is made. (2) For purposes of estimating mean profiles and mean effects of variables estimates based on pooled independent cross sections are quite close to those based on the more expensive longitudinal data. (3) There are important persistent unmeasured individual effects on both the level and growth of earnings. Consequently, individuals with the same observed characteristics will still have a wide variance in their permanent income. ...|$|R
40|$|Four growing {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the use of dry rolled corn (DRC) and either dry (DDGS) or wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) as energy sources in high forage diets. In Exp. 1, steers were fed a blend of sorghum silage and alfalfa hay and supplemented 1 of 4 inclusions of WDGS, DDGS or a MIX (67 % WDGS: 33 % Straw). In Exp. 2, Exp. 3 and Exp. 4, steers were fed diets including WDGS, DDGS or DRC at different inclusions, replacing sorghum silage and grass hay. In Exp. 1, WDGS, DDGS and MIX produced greater ending BW, ADG and G:F compared to the basal diet. Increasing distillers grains improved ADG and G:F in forage based diets. Data from Exp. 2 - 4 were pooled and ADG was regressed against inclusion thereby allowing the energy value of WDGS to be calculated relative to that of DRC. The energy value of WDGS was 137 % and 136 % of DRC when fed at 15 and 30 % of the diet DM, respectively. In vitro digestibility and in vivo digestibility estimates are highly correlated but absolute values differ. Therefore, our objective was to determine in vivo digestibilities of 5 forages and use these forages as standards for in vitro digestibility procedures when in vivo estimates are needed for unknown forage samples. Eight in vitro runs were conducted using 5 hay standards and 6 forage samples with unknown in vivo digestibilities in order to predict actual in vivo values from in vitro estimates. Runs were evaluated using either regression equations or <b>standard</b> mean <b>adjustment.</b> Using regression equations increase forage*run variation.
