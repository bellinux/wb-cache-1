500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "The Amazing Maleeni" [...] started with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz. When pitching {{ideas for the}} seventh-season episodes, Spotnitz wanted an episode to deal solely on [...] "magic and illusion" [...] and {{have nothing to do}} with the paranormal. Spotnitz had been petitioning the writers of The X-Files for a magic-based episode since season two, but nothing ever came to light. Eventually, during the seventh season, Vince Gilligan was assigned to write the episode, something he described as [...] "agony". Gilligan explained, [...] "The episode started with Frank, because he—for several years—had wanted to write an episode about magicians. Frank was a fan of the TV show The Magician with Bill Bixby so I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> part of it, but Frank was interested in the idea of magic and the idea of fooling people who wished to be fooled." ...|$|E

Rivers stated that she was {{impressed}} by Washington's civility: [...] "The people are lots better up here than they are down South. [...] They treat you much nicer. Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, [...] "Excuse me," [...] and I said [...] "Certainly!"

5000|$|Mele formulates {{an example}} of the [...] "static" [...] paradox as the following:If ever a person A deceives a person B into <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> something, p, <b>is</b> true, A knows or truly <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> false while causing B to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true. So when A deceives A (i.e., himself) into <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true, he knows or truly <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> false while causing himself to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true. Thus, A must {{simultaneously}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> false and <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true. But how is this possible? ...|$|R

2500|$|Most years, PMC {{packaged}} its {{cars and}} trucks in fairly bright, colorful boxes - often with accurate illustrations of the vehicles adorning their sides. [...] Often boxes would say [...] "A Tru-Miniature" [...] on the sides in large letters - possibly making some <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{the name of the}} company. [...] Most PMC models throughout the years did not have interiors, exceptions being convertibles like the 1953 Chevrolets, the Corvettes, and the 1959 Ford Ranchero and Country Sedan station wagon. Of course, early Chevy cars were banks, so a detailed interior was not offered. On the bank models, a coin trap was made in the chassis so money could be removed.|$|E
2500|$|Gravelings are mischievous gremlin-like {{creatures that}} cause the {{accidents}} and mishaps (in the form of Rube Goldberg machine scenarios) that kill people. The living generally cannot see them, though in the episode [...] "Reaper Madness", a schizophrenic was able to, although Rube refused to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> possible. Reapers can see and interact with them to some extent: Daisy once shushed a graveling; Rube yelled [...] "Get outta here!" [...] once when seeing gravelings desecrating a cemetery statue; and George once chased several angry gravelings around her apartment. Although gravelings seem to be self-aware and recognize the reapers, they do not communicate verbally with them, and {{talk to each other}} in a hushed and unintelligible babble; other times they growl or hiss.|$|E
