40|$|International audienceThis article {{show how}} Lamarckism was {{essential}} {{in the birth}} of the French school of molecular biology. We argue that the concept of inheritance of acquired characters positively shaped debates surrounding <b>bacteriophagy</b> and lysogeny in the Pasteurian tradition during the interwar period. During this period the typical Lamarckian account of heredity treated it as the continuation of protoplasmic physiology in daughter cells. Félix d'Hérelle applied this conception to argue that there was only one species of bacteriophage and Jules Bordet applied it to develop an account of <b>bacteriophagy</b> as a transmissible form of autolysis and to analyse the new phenomenon of lysogeny. In a long-standing controversy with Bordet, Eugène Wollman deployed a more morphological understanding of the inheritance of acquired characters, yielding a particulate, but still Lamarckian, account of lysogeny. We then turn to André Lwoff who, with several colleagues, completed Wollman's research program from 1949 to 1953. We examine how he gradually set aside the Lamarckian background, finally removing inheritance of acquired characters from the resulting account of <b>bacteriophagy</b> and lysogeny. In the conclusion, we emphasize the complex dual role of Lamarckism as it moved from an assumed explanatory framework to a challenge that the nascent molecular biology had to overcome...|$|E

40|$|Several {{investigators}} have reported {{studies on the}} mechanism of phage production. Among these Kmeger and Northrop (1), Clifton and Morrow (2), Lin (3), Northrop (4), and Fischer (5) have employed in the original or modified form an activity method of phage assay developed by Krueger (6). Their results with several different phages and bacteria have agreed on the following points: (a) Phage production proceeds logarithmically with time. (b) Massive lysis occurs only when a definite critical ratio of phage to bacteria is attained. D'Herelle (7), Bumet (8), Gratia (9), Ellis and Delbri~ck (10), and others have utilized the plaque count method for determining phage in analyzing the phenomenon of <b>bacteriophagy.</b> Delbrtick (11) in particular has worked extensively with this procedure and has secured much information of interest from its application to one-step growth experiments. Delbrtick's data and the observations of others who have used the plaque count procedure lead to the conclusion that: (a) Cellular lysis takes place at intervals throughout the reaction instead of being merely a terminal event. (b) Phage formation occurs in steps; each step-like increment in [phage] corresponds to the liberation of newly formed phage as the cells {{in which it has}} been formed undergo lysis. We have reinvestigated the reaction between an antistaphylococcal phage and the homologous bacterium utilizing both the activity and the plaque methods of analysis with the hope of securing a more complete picture of <b>bacteriophagy</b> than the use of either method alone will permit. Employing reduced temperature and lower pH to slow down the process it was observed that: (a) There is an initial phase of rapid logarithmic sorption of phage to susceptible cells during which the total phage activity and the loci of phage action (plaque numbers) in the mixtures remain constant. (b) When 90 per cent of the phage has been bound there is a sudden very rapid increase in phage activity not paralleled by an increase in plaques; i. e., phage is being *The experimental work reported here was completed over 5 years ago but was not prepared for publication {{due to the fact that}} the senior author has been in the Nava...|$|E
40|$|Felix d'Herelle and the controversey on the Twort-d'Herelle {{phenomenon}} in the 1920 's: ultrafilterable virus or lytic ferment This paper deals with a controversy on the Twort-d'Herelle phenomenon — also called <b>bacteriophagy</b> — which continued during the 1920 's and 19. 30 's. This phenomenon is characterised by the marked lysis of bacteria by a so-called 'lytic principle'. The article is focused {{on one of the}} important persons in this controversy: Felix d'Herelle. The idea that the 'lytic principle' is a living ultrafilterable virus (F. d'Herelle) was opposed to that which describes it as a ferment (J. Bordet). In the beginning of the scientific dispute the criteria between living and dead were playing a preponderant role. Later on, the discussion moved to the question whether the 'lytic principle' {{is a product of the}} bacterium or that it is exogenous. Both positions were able to explain most of the experimental findings. The phenomenon attracted a lot of bacteriologists and pathologists because of its supposed potentialities with regard to immunity against bacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{dealing with}} the effects of salts on {{bacteriophage}} have been rather limited in scope and predominantly qualitative or roughly quantitative in character. For the most part efforts have been restricted to pointing out analogies between the balanced salf solutions required for the growth of common living organisms and those requisite for phage production. While the former data are essentially accurate and subject to adequate control the corresponding experiments with phage suffer from a lack of controlled experimental conditions and also from the use of inaccurate methods for determining phage qfiantitatively. Consequently {{it is not surprising that}} there is no general agreement in the literature about salt effects. For example Brutsaert (1 - 2) concludes that phage may develop and bacterial lysis take place in peptone water without salt. Ciuca (3), Lisbonne and Carrere (4), and da Costa Cruz (5 - 7) on the contrary hold that electrolytes are essential for both phage production and bacterial lysis. Arloing and Chavanne (8) and Bordet and Renaux (9) stress not only the necessity for electrolytes in <b>bacteriophagy</b> but also the importance of the particular electrolyte used. The observations of Bordet (10), Stassano and de Beaufort (11), Planteureux (12), and Ancianx (13) indicate that the calcium ion is necessary for the lytic action of phage on bacteria. Burnet and McKie (14) report experimental evidence for the protective action of divalent ions against inactivation of phage by heat and dyes. In Bronfenbrenner's work (15 - 16) it appears that the greater the concentration of electrolytes, the greater the percentage inactivation of phage by alcohol and acetone...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in the process of <b>bacteriophagy,</b> or lysis of {{bacteria}} by bacteriophage, is the combination of phage with susceptible organisms. D'Herelle in his early work (1, 2) noted a rapid and specific attachment of phage to susceptible bacteria under suitable conditions, and yon Angerer (3), working with dead organisms, found that the process could be expressed {{in the form of the}} usual adsorption isotherm equation with 1 /n = 0. 75 [...] 0. 80. Prausnitz and Firle (4) further observed that heating susceptible bacteria to temperatures above ll 0 °C, resulted in destruction of the ability to bind phage. It is also known that as a general rule homologous or heterologous resistant bacteria fail to combine with phage to any appreciable extent (4, 5, 6); although Flu (7) and Gobs and Jacobsohn (8) have reported cases which are definite exceptions to the rule. The general trend of the above work has led to the assumption that live bacteria take up phage by adsorption, although there exists no adequate quantitative data in support of this idea. Obviously the question of how phage and bacteria combine is a fundamental one and the writer has felt that a closer study of the process would be in order, particularly since the observation of Krueger and Northrop (9) that extracellular phage per milliliter constitutes a constant low percentage of total phage per milliliter during the logarithmic phase of phage production in a phage-bacteria mixture, suggests the possibility of phage distribution being of a simple type. The present paper deals with observations on the distribution of phage between bacteria (both living and dead) and the broth in which 49...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigations}} of Asheshov 2 concerning {{the separation of}} bacteriophages into their individual types have proven of great value to workers {{in the field of}} <b>bacteriophagy.</b> By applying his methods it has been possible to prove that bacteriophages from divergent sources (Asheshov, 2 Morison, 9 Sertic") often contain one or more types in common. Since it is possible to maintain "pure line " bacteriophages without significant observable changes over a period of years, the use of such phages in investigative work should be encouraged. The fact that bacteriophages, particularly those lysing organisms of the enteric group, are practically always mixtures of several types has made it difficult to duplicate the results of many published reports. Merely stating that "a coli phage was used " means but little, since there are undoubtedly hundreds of coli phages, each differing from the others by the combination of types that they contain. Such an objection can be disregarded when identical phages are employed. A "pure line " or single type bacteriophage generally manifests itself by a fairly constant morphology (the appearance of the plaque) providing the same strain of bacteria is employed {{for the development of the}} phage and the same medium is used. A single type phage rarely produces complete lysis of a culture in broth (this statement does not apply to staphylococcus phages, since most of them are single type). The secondary culture appearing after contact of a susceptible strain with a single type phage remains resistant to that type. A "pure line " phage is antigenically homogeneous, producing, when injected into laboratory animals, an anti-bacteriophagic serum specifically neutralizing the homologous type phage. "Pure line " phages have been shown to possess a definite virulence, based on the rate of multiplication against a specific host (Asheshov, 2 Sertic 11). Finally, these one-type phages may or may not be polyvalent. In the isolation of "pure line " phages precautions with regard to filtering should be taken, especially in laboratories where phages are handled frequently...|$|E
40|$|Soluble antigens {{separable}} {{from the}} etiological agents {{have been found}} in a number of virus infections, e. g., <b>bacteriophagy</b> (1), yellow fever (2), vaccinia (3), psittacosis (4), influenza (5), and myxomatosis (6). On the other hand, in certain virus diseases, e. g., papillomatosis of rabbits (7) and tobacco mosaic of plants (8), all the in vitro serological phenomena appear {{to be the result of}} reactions between immune sera and the viruses. The occurrerlce of a complement-fixing substance in extracts prepared from brains of guinea pigs and mice infected with the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis has been reported by Howitt (9). However, she did not mention any attempts to determine whether complement fixation was due to the presence of virus or to a soluble material separable from the virus. Separation of a complement-fixing antigen from the virus has been reported by us in a preliminary publication (10). The purpose of this paper is to present in detail the evidence for the existence of a specific soluble antigen associated with the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and to record its distribution in organs of infected animals. For experiments of this type, it is essential to have materials rich both in virus and in complement-fixing antigen. The virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis is not only neurotropic, but is also highly viscerotropic, since it is found in relatively large amounts in organs other than the brain and occurs even in the blood of acutely ill animals (11, 12). Preliminary experiments indicated that spleens from infected guinea pigs were suitable for our needs; hence, material from this source has been extensively used.

40|$|The above data {{relating}} to the reaction between 16 hour cultures of S. aureus and antistaphylococcus bacteriophage in nutrient broth of pH 7. 6 at 36 °C. and with mechanical shaking to maintain a uniform B suspension, bring out the following points: (a) B growth in P-B mixtures does not differ from growth in controls without P except {{in the case of}} a very high initial P/B ratio as noted below. There is no evidence that lytic destruction of B begins shortly after mixing P and B nor that B growth is stimulated by P, for the B growth curves in the presence of ordinary [P]'s and in controls are identical. Only at the sudden onset of the rapid lytic process does the B curve of a P-B mixture deviate from the control curve. (b) B growth is an essential conditioning factor for P formation. (c) Both B growth and P production exhibit short lags. During this time P diffuses into or becomes adsorbed to B so rapidly that by the end of the lag period only 10 to 30 per cent of the total P present is extracellular, the remainder being associated with the B. (d) During the logarithmic B growth phase, P formation is also logarithmic but proceeds at a much faster rate. That is, d P/d t is proportional to a power of d B/d t. Consequently the statement that each time a B divides a certain amount of P is formed is not correct. (e) As B growth enters the phase of positive acceleration equilibrium between the extracellular and intracellular P fractions becomes established and is maintained up to the onset of lysis, extracellular [P] representing a small constant percentage of total [P]. The distribution of P on a constant percentage basis suggests the manner in which a relatively simple chemical compound would be distributed and is not at all typical of the distribution one would expect if P were a complex organized parasite. (f) When the value of log P/B = 2. 1 lysis begins. Obviously, this limiting value for any initial [B] is reached sooner the higher the initial [P]. When log P/B at the time of mixing P and B is already 2. 1 or greater, there is no growth of B and lysis soon occurs. (g) While there is good evidence that lysis is brought about by the attainment of a particular [P] per B and not by a certain [P] per ml., it is not clear at this time which of the ratios intracellular P/B, extracellular P/B or total P/B is the major conditioning factor for B lysis. (h) Experimentally the maximal [P]'s of lysates made by mixing a constant initial [B] with widely varying Po's fall within a relatively narrow range. This fact is explained by the large value of d log P/d t as compared to d log B/d t. That is, the loci of points at which log P = 2. 1 + log B (maxima-lysis begins) on the curves of log P against t originating in various [Po]'s will lie at a nearly constant level above the abscissa. Because of this same relationship the maximal [P]'s of such a series will be in the reverse order of magnitude of the Po's, i. e., the larger the Po the smaller will be the maximal [P] attained during the reaction (cf. Fig, 16). (i) The lytic destruction of B is logarithmic with time, in this respect being similar to most death rate processes. The value -d log B/d t for a particular initial [B] is constant for various initial values of [P]. There is good evidence that cells need not be growing in order to undergo lysis. (j) During B lysis a considerable percentage of the total maximal P formed is destroyed, the chief loss probably occurring in the intracellular fraction. The major portion (70 to 90 per cent) of the final P present after the completion of <b>bacteriophagy</b> is set free during the brief phase of bacterial dissolution. (k) When the entire process of <b>bacteriophagy</b> is completed the lysates are left with certain [P]'s determined by the foregone P-B reaction. The destruction of P during lysis is sufficiently regular to maintain the relationship established at the maximal [P]'s. Therefore the final [P]'s have the same points in common that were noted in "h" as applying to the maximal [P]'s. That is, they all are grouped within a narrow range of [P] values, those having been made with high Po's being of lower titre than those made with low initial [P]'s. (1) There is a significant difference in the temperature coefficients of P and B formation. Further, the temperature coefficients of P and B destruction during lysis differ in almost the same ratio. Consequently, while all experimental evidence postulates B growth as an essential conditioning factor for P formation, the temperature coefficient data suggest that the two processes are basically separate reactions. A similar interpretation holds in the case of B dissolution and P inactivation. (m) The major events in the complete process of "bacteriophagy" are mathematically predictable. The [B] at which lysis occurs under certain standard conditions for given values of Bo and Po may be calculated from the equation: See PDF for Equation Substitution of this value for log B in the equation: See PDF for Equation gives satisfactory agreement with observed values for t(lysis). (n) The kinetic analysis of the P-B reaction predicts that the values of log Po plotted against t(lysis) for a constant Bo will give a straight line. This plot is employed in a method for the quantitative estimation of P described in an earlier paper on the basis of experimental observation alone. Its use is made more rational by the facts given above...|$|E
