5000|$|The DMN {{standard}} is complementary to the BPMN standard.

50|$|The {{most basic}} {{element of a}} <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> is the {{language}} used to express it. The very definition of a term is itself a <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> that describes how people think and talk about things. Thus, defining a term is establishing a category of <b>business</b> <b>rule.</b> Terms have traditionally been documented in a Glossary or as entities in a conceptual model.|$|R
40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>rule</b> {{models are}} widely applied, {{standalone}} and embedded in smart objects. They have become segregated from {{information technology and}} they are now a valuable asset in their own right. As more <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> models are becoming assets, business models to monetize these assets are designed. The goal of this work is to present a step towards business model classification for organizations for which its value position is characterized by <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> models. Based on a survey we propose a business model categorization that is aligned to different types of assets and business model archetypes. The results show five main categories of business models: The value adding <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> model, the ‘create me a <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> model’ <b>business</b> model, the KAAS business model, the bait and hook business model and the market place business model...|$|R

25|$|In 2014, Schmidt co-authored the New York Times {{best-selling book}} How Google Works with Jonathan Rosenberg, former Senior Vice President of Products at Google and current advisor to Google CEO Larry Page, and Alan Eagle. The {{book is a}} {{collection}} of the business management lessons learned over the course of Schmidt and Rosenberg's time leading Google. In his book, Eric Schmidt argues that successful companies in the technology-driven internet age, should attract smart and creative employees and then create an environment where they can thrive. He argues that the traditional <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> that make a company successful have changed. The book states that companies should maximize freedom and speed, and decision-making should not lie {{in the hands of the}} few. It also emphasizes that individuals and small teams can have a massive impact on innovation.|$|E

2500|$|As sub-routines {{functions}} can {{be integrated}} and used {{in a variety of}} ways, and {{in a wide variety of}} larger, more complicated applications. [...] Within large enterprise applications they may, for example, play an important role in defining <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> or risk management parameters, while remaining virtually undetected by end users. [...] Within database management systems and spreadsheets, however, these kinds of functions also represent discrete sets of tools; they can be accessed directly and utilized on a stand-alone basis, or in more complex, user-defined configurations. In this context, functions can be used for business intelligence and ad hoc analysis of data in fields such as finance, statistics, engineering, math, etc.|$|E

2500|$|In {{programming}} languages, a type {{system is}} a set of rules that assigns a property called type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. [...] These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for data structures and components (e.g. [...] "string", [...] "array of float", [...] "function returning boolean"). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing <b>business</b> <b>rules,</b> enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.|$|E
60|$|The American is {{too busy}} to have {{business}} habits. He is also too much in earnest to have <b>business</b> <b>rules.</b> If we wish to understand him, we must compare him not with the French shopkeeper when he plays dominoes, but with the same French shopkeeper when he works the guns or mans the trenches as a conscript soldier. Everybody used to the punctilious Prussian standard of uniform and parade has noticed the roughness and apparent laxity of the French soldier, the looseness of his clothes, the unsightliness of his heavy knapsack, in short his inferiority in {{every detail of the}} business of war except fighting. There he is much too swift to be smart. He is much too practical to be precise. By a strange illusion which can lift pork-packing almost to the level of patriotism, the American has the same free rhythm in his romance of business. He varies his conduct not to suit the clock but to suit the case. He gives more time to more important and less time to less important things; and he makes up his time-table as he goes along. Suppose he has three appointments; the first, let us say, is some mere trifle of erecting a tower twenty storeys high and exhibiting a sky-sign on the top of it; the second is a business discussion about the possibility of printing advertisements of soft drinks on the table-napkins at a restaurant; the third is attending a conference to decide how the populace can be prevented from using chewing-gum and the manufacturers can still manage to sell it. He will be content merely to glance at the sky-sign as he goes by in a trolley-car or an automobile; he will then settle down to the discussion with his partner about the table-napkins, each speaker indulging in long monologues in turn; a peculiarity of much American conversation. Now if in the middle of one of these monologues, he suddenly thinks that the vacant space of the waiter's shirt-front might also be utilised to advertise the Gee Whiz Ginger Champagne, he will instantly follow up the new idea in all its aspects and possibilities, in an even longer monologue; and will never think of looking at his watch while he is rapturously looking at his waiter. The consequence is that he will come late into the great social movement against chewing-gum, where an Englishman would probably have arrived at the proper hour. But though the Englishman's conduct is more proper, it need not be in all respects more practical. The Englishman's rules are better for the business of life, but not necessarily for the life of business. And it is true that for many of these Americans business is the business of life. It is really also, as I have said, the romance of life. We shall admire or deplore this spirit, accordingly as we are glad to see trade irradiated with so much poetry, or sorry to see so much poetry wasted on trade. But it does make many people happy, like any other hobby; and one is disposed to add that it does fill their imaginations like any other delusion. For the true criticism of all this commercial romance would involve a criticism of this historic phase of commerce. These people are building on the sand, though it shines like gold, and for them like fairy gold; but the world will remember the legend about fairy gold. Half the financial operations they follow deal with things that do not even exist; for in that sense all finance is a fairy tale. Many of them are buying and selling things that do nothing but harm; but it does them good to buy and sell them. The claim of the romantic salesman is better justified than he realises. Business really is romance; for it is not reality.|$|E
