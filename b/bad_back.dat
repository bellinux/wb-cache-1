500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950.

However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back."
