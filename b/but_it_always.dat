5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E

An oyster's mature shape often depends {{on the type of}} bottom to which it is originally attached, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> orients itself with its outer, flared shell tilted upward. One valve is cupped and the other is flat.|$|E
25|$|This world, {{which is}} the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> was and will be: an ever-living fire, with {{measures}} of it kindling, and measures going out. This latter phraseology is further elucidated:All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.|$|E

25|$|The Olaf was {{attacked}} and damaged by German aircraft several times, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> {{managed to get}} back to Shetland. The worst damage occurred on 12 May 1942. Three crew from the wrecked Frøya, along with some others, went out with the Olaf to search for a raft with four of the Frøya crew. They were attacked five times by a German Dornier bomber. The vessel was severely damaged, and some of the crew wounded. One of the three men from the Frøya, Hans Johansen, later died of his wounds. The Olaf made no more journeys and after the war it was returned to the owners who sold it in 1948.|$|E
500|$|Some {{evidence}} shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute. Hillenburg indicated that children's television series such as [...] (19871988) and Pee-wee's Playhouse (19861991) [...] "sparked something in [...]" [...] He continued, [...] "I don't {{know if this is}} true for everybody else, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> seems like, for me, I'll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it...

500|$|... "Hairography" [...] was {{watched by}} 6.1 million US viewers and {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal deemed the mash-up performance {{one of the}} worst of the season, with Zap2it's Liz Pardue agreeing that it was [...] "hideous". Flandez, Pardue and Mike Hale of The New York Times all felt that it was inappropriate for New Directions to interrupt the deaf choir's performance of [...] "Imagine", however Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle opined that reviewers needed to [...] "realize that this show takes its jabs at everyone, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has a wink and a hug and lots and lots of love behind it".|$|E

500|$|... "Say It Right" [...] is {{performed}} with a moderate techno groove and {{is written in}} F minor. It is set in common time; in 4/4 count. The chord progression is Fm–E♭–D♭–B♭m. Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5. Furtado has cited the [...] "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" [...] of the band Eurythmics, particularly their 1983 song [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again", as an influence on [...] "Say It Right" [...] and other tracks on Loose. [...] "I'm not 100 percent sure what [...] about, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said. In fact the song deals with mystic or transcendental experiences as she explains {{in an interview in}} 2007. [...] "It {{is a kind of a}} magical song. It has a mystery to it, that I have not quite figured out. It has a haunting twist to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gerrick D. Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times was {{generally}} more positive regarding the episode's musical performances, however {{was critical of}} the ongoing pregnancy plot, noting that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, writing: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". He countered criticism of the portrayal of New Directions' rival choirs, suggesting: [...] "at this point, everyone needs {{to realize that this}} show takes its jabs at everyone, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has a wink and a hug and lots and lots of love behind it." [...] Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson reviewed the episode positively, calling the [...] "Imagine" [...] performance [...] "a classic feel-good Glee moment, teeming with sappy but undeniable heart", while Aly Semigran of MTV deemed it her favorite musical moment from the show, feeling that it: [...] "honored the classic song in such a respectful way." ...|$|E
500|$|Müller {{retired from}} {{wheelchair}} basketball after the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, at which she won silver.

500|$|During the Bishops' Wars {{the king}} {{attempted}} to blockade Scotland, disrupting {{trade and the}} transport of returning troops from the continent. The king planned amphibious assaults from England {{on the east coast}} and from Ireland to the west, but they failed to materialise. Scottish privateers took English prizes and the Covenanters planned to fit out Dutch ships with Scottish and Dutch crews to join the naval war effort. After the Covenanters allied with the English Parliament they established two patrol squadrons for the Atlantic and North Sea coasts, known collectively as the [...] "Scotch Guard". These patrols guarded against Royalist attempts to move men, money and munitions and raids on Scottish shipping, particularly from ships based in Wexford and Dunkirk. They consisted mainly of small English warships, controlled by the Commissioners of the Navy based in London, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> relied heavily on Scottish officers and revenues, and after 1646, the West Coast squadron became much more a Scottish force. The Scottish navy was unable to withstand the English fleet that accompanied the army led by Cromwell that conquered Scotland in 1649–51.

2500|$|First Sergeant William L. Umbles was demoted on that day. The exact {{reasons are}} uncertain. Some said Nolan was displeased with him. It {{might have been}} that Umbles tried to {{convince}} Nolan to turn back. It {{may have been the}} last straw in Nolan's trust in the First Sergeant after the alcohol incident. The two men would be silent on the exact reason later. But many agreed Umbles was angry and his behavior would show [...] during [...] "The Thirsting Time" [...] to come. The buffalo hunters came back to camp excited at finding a large trail of sign and Tafoya estimated 40 Comanche in the band near Rich Lake. Boots and saddles were called and the men made haste to get under way. Nolan had not immediately appointed another acting First Sergeant and in his excitement to be underway failed {{to make sure that all}} canteens were full.

2500|$|Drowned in Sound observed, [...] "Fans of {{her earlier}} work will {{delight in the}} more direct, piano-driven melodies and orchestral {{arrangements}} that dominate the album, {{as well as the}} welcomed return of the long neglected harpsichord on several tracks," [...] A mixed review by The Skinny called the album [...] "moderately successful," [...] awarding it 3/5 stars. [...] Slant Magazine gave the album 3/5 stars, citing Winter's Carol, a song from and preview of Amos' upcoming musical adaptation of George MacDonald's The Light Princess, as the standout track: [...] "The song's strong melody and arrangement are reminiscent of something from Under the Pink, bolstering a pagan yarn about the passing of the seasons." [...] On the album as a whole, Slant concluded, [...] "it's an ironic, pleasantly competent oddity." [...] Consequence of Sound gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "a pleasant and often gorgeous effort," [...] and Internet magazine, PopMatters, cited the album as [...] "Amos’ best work in years." [...] AllMusic was not impressed, however, giving it two-and-a-half stars out of five and stating, [...] "Thanks to some familiar melodies, it can sometimes seem seasonally appropriate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> seems purely Tori, who has somehow managed to deliver an easy listening version of all her signatures in one tidy, not so-Christmasy, package." ...|$|E
