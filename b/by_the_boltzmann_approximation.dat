40|$|In {{the organic}} superconducting κ-(BEDT-TTF) compounds, various {{transport}} phenomena exhibit striking non-Fermi liquid behaviors, {{which should be}} the important clues to understanding the electronic state of this system. Especially, the Hall coefficient (R_H) shows Curie-Weiss type temperature dependence, {{which is similar to}} that of high-Tc cuprates. In this paper, we study a Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice at half filling, which is an effective model of κ-(BEDT-TTF) compounds. Based on the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, we calculate the resistivity (ρ) and R_H by taking account of the vertex corrections for the current, which is necessary for satisfying the conservation laws. Our theoretical results of R_H and cot(θ_H) explain the experimental behaviors well, which are unable to be reproduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>Boltzmann</b> transport <b>approximation.</b> Moreover, we extend the standard Eliashberg's transport theory and derive the more precise formula for the conductivity, which becomes important at higher temperatures.

40|$|A lattice gas {{model for}} Schloegl's second {{chemical}} reaction is described and analyzed. Because the lattice gas does not obey a semi-detailed-balance condition, the equilibria are non-Gibbsian.

These equations are solved in the two-particle BBGKY approximation, {{and the results}} are compared to numerical experiment.

The observed baryon asymmetry can be realised for a breaking of the mass degeneracy as small as O(10 ^- 8). The origin of such a small mass splitting is explained by considering supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in supergravity, which requires a constant in the superpotential {{of the order of}} the gravitino mass m_ 3 / 2 to cancel the cosmological constant. This yields additional terms in the (s) neutrino mass matrices, lifting the degeneracy and linking η_B to the SUSY breaking scale.

40|$|The surface {{impedance}} approach {{is discussed in}} connection with the precise calculation of the Casimir force between metallic plates.

In general, a material has to be described by two impedances Z_s(ω,q) and Z_p(ω,q) corresponding to two different polarization states. In contrast with the approximate Leontovich impedance they depend not only on frequency ω but also on the wave vector along the plate q.
