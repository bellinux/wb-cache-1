40|$|Peylong {{is a kind}} of boat racing ordinally {{introduced}} to Nagasaki from China in 1655. Based on construction-diagrams, the hull types of 16 peylong boats in Nagasaki City and adjacent villages were studied and compared with those of 89 boats of analogous types, i. e., one dragon-boat in Hongkong, eight so called inkoro (meaning dog-killer) which are a kind of fishing boats in the western area of Kyushu, two old whaling boats built in early 19 th century from north-western Kyushu, five sabanis of Okinawa, and 57 commercial fishing boats in the surrounding areas of Nagasaki City. Some results obtained are; i) While peylong boats have many common features in construction with commercial fishing boats in Japan, they are much finer in hull type than the commercial fishing boats. The hull types of inkoro craft which is used both for commercial purpose and for racing on festive occasions, is essentially {{the same as that of}} peylong boat exept for the stern part.

40|$|Students {{work with}} World Health Organization (WHO) {{researchers}} contributing to their biostatistics knowledge and WHO’s mission. Two projects involving undergraduates and WHO collaborators are described briefly. A primary charge of WHO is {{to evaluate the}} global burden of disease (GBD). Students on this first project explored theoretical scenarios to learn about potential variability in GBD estimates. Students on the second project analyzed a massive dataset from the World Health Survey to describe global trends in tobacco use. Each project explored important issues {{that may not have}} been considered without the extra assistance of the students. Every other year for the past six years, this program has demonstrated that undergraduates can contribute to the analysis of global health data. BACKGROUND This paper describes a service-learning program that integrates statistics education into the workplace where the workplace is the world, the World Health Organization (WHO). We begin by providing some background on the notion of service-learning, what it is and what it isn’t. Some of the benefits of this approach are described. These ideas are in turn connected to the specific program involving the WHO. Following the program description, two different research projects performed by students are described in some detail. <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different,</b> yet both represent much of what we hope to have happen in a service-learning project in the workplace.

40|$|Today, tourism as {{a global}} and social {{phenomenon}} has special implication of its own. The mechanism behind the phenomenon intertwines and takes different forms in different times and places and completely different effects on the human beings (de freitas, 2003 : 47). There are many types of tourism. One {{of the most important}} tourism forms is religious tourism. Religious tourism is a combination of travel and religion. Most writers are taking into account religious tourism as a part of cultural tourism. Of course, <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different,</b> but these two are tied together, and religion is a part of culture. Religious Cultural Festival is an event that causes tourism to travel to a foreign country for looking for religion and heritage experience. Hence the Muharram ceremonies (Ashura and Tasua) as a religious event can be raised as an event that can familiarize domestic and foreign tourists with part of Iranian religious and culture society. Iran is an old and historical country and its present religious is Islam, most of the people are Shia? The ceremonies of Tasua and Ashura in most part of this country with different showings are done. One of those is in Taft city located in Yazd province. This research is with aims to optimize utilization of the Ashura and Tasua religious festival in order to develop Taft city and to remove barriers on the way of Taft religious tourism using the SWOT model. This evaluation model (that evaluated strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) {{is considered one of the}} best strategies for tourism planning. Methods of data collection and analysis of required data is more documentaries, analytical and Survey research. The results indicate that proximity to population centers and urban centers, such as the city of Yazd and distinctive funeral's style from other parts of Province, are the best strengths for this city's religious tourism. Short duration of tourists stay in the cities and Lack of tourists' economic outputs in the city are the weaknesses. Finally, considering to strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities were presented competitive - aggressive, variation, revision and defensive strategies...|$|E

In this work, it is shown that this difference is justified and a consequence of emergent effects. Previously, an expression for the macroscopic dislocation flux was derived by systematic coarse graining (Kooiman, 2015). This expression has been evaluated numerically in this paper.

It <b>was</b> found that <b>both</b> distributions <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different,</b> i. e. deuterium retention was higher at the deposited area, whereas tritium retention was higher at the erosion dominated area. This is because tritium produced by the D-D reaction, initially having 1 MeV, did not fully lose its energy in the TEXTOR plasma and implanted into the plasma facing materials nearly homogeneously, whereas deuterium was codeposited with carbon and boron, the main impurities in the TEXTOR plasma. This is also confirmed by the finding that high level of tritium was detected beneath the deposited layer. Tritium distribution, however, was modified by the temperature increase due to plasma heat load. Thus the comparison of tritium profiles with the deuterium profile gives a large amount of important and new information on PMI, and may be used as a new diagnostic technique for PMI...|$|R
