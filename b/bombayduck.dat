40|$|Harpadon nehereus (Ham.) {{commonly}} known as 'Bombay duck' and locally called "Bombil" exercise a direct influence upon the livelihood of artisanal fishermen along the northwest coast of India. The major portion of the catch is landed in Satpati-Dahanu area of Maharashtra and Jaffrabad-Nawabunder area of Gujarat. The season for <b>Bombayduck</b> lasts from September to May, with the bulk of landings taking place during October December. <b>Bombayduck</b> is exploited by indigenous dol net, operated up to 40 m depth. In Maharashtra the catch of <b>Bombayduck</b> over {{the last ten years}} has shown a declining trend. New Ferry Wharf is the only landing centre in Maharashtra where the catch of <b>Bombayduck</b> has gradually increased over the last five years. <b>Bombayduck</b> is not a target species for trawl, while returning after completing fishing activity, the trawlers fish in the dol net fishing grounds...|$|E
40|$|The fishery for <b>Bombayduck</b> in the Gulf of Kutch is well {{organised}} and {{is conducted}} on the pattern of that of Bombay and Saurashtra coasts. The total <b>Bombayduck</b> landings from the gulf are estimated between 8, 000 to 10, 000 tonnes; the major landing centres being Modhwa, Navinar, Bhadreshwar and Takkara. The boats engaged are Machchwa type and nonmechanised. The bag net, locally known as 'Gunja,' is used, {{which is similar to}} the 'dol' net. Raciation studies on samples from Kutch and Jaifrabad revealed that the fish from these places differ significantly in 6 morphometric characters...|$|E

The Natural 	 mortality coefficient (M) was at 1. 575 for the unexploited phase and 1. 462 for 	 the exploited phase. Exploitation rate (u) was at 0. 422. The MSY and the average 	 yield were {{close to each other}} as the estimated values were 3918. 4 t and 3561. 0 t, 	 respectively...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic factor {{analysis}} (DFA) {{was used to}} identify common trends to explain the variability for a historical time series data (1980 - 2010) on all India annual marine fish landings for 16 resource groups. In this study, three common trends were identified for classifying the resource groups. Trend- 1 increases gradually and reaches a peak in 1997, decreases sharply until 2001 and then increases further. Landings of carangids were clearly related to trend- 1 with positive factor loading magnitude. Trend- 1 is important for <b>Bombayduck</b> as well but with negative factor loading. In the case of trend- 2, it is declining until 1993 and remains steady with slight fluctuations till 2003 and increases further. Both, silverbellies and pomfrets landings were determined by trend- 2 with similar positive factor loadings. All other resources were associated {{with more than one}} trend. Trend- 3 shows an increasing trend throughout the period with slight fluctuations. Perches, seerfishes, tunnies, flatfishes, crustaceans and molluscs formed a homogenous group associated with both trend- 1 and trend- 3. These trends were important for elasmobranchs too as they had similar loadings on both trends but with opposite signs. Resource-wise explanations based on the different trends are discussed citing the examples of clupeids, carangids, <b>Bombayduck,</b> pomfrets and silverbellies...|$|E
40|$|Annual average fish {{landings}} {{along the}} east coast of Indian increased from 0. 15 million tonnes during 1950 - 59 to 0. 85 m t during 2006 - 06. The contribution of the northeast coast to the total landings {{along the east}} coast of India increased from 5. 5 % to 30. 7 % in the last five decades. There were remarkable differences in the catch composition between the NE and southeast (SE) coasts. Among the small pelagics, for instance, the hilsa shad Tenualosa ilisha and <b>bombayduck</b> Harpadon nehereus were dominant along the NE coast...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} management and conservation of ecosystems rely greatly on {{the understanding of}} spatial and temporal distributions of the fish community, ecological variables and fishing activity. The information on landings for all species by commercial fisheries can facilitate analysis of species diversity and distribution patterns. This paper attempts to assess the marine fishery in West Bengal, with emphasis on the diversity with special regard to the variation in quantity of fish caught during different seasons. During this period, a total of 154 different species of fish and shellfishes were landed along the West Bengal coast among which, demersal species were highest in number (65), followed by pelagic species (59). Only two or three groups were dominant in different seasons. During the first (January – March) and fourth (October – December) season, the dominant groups were <b>Bombayduck,</b> croakers and prawns. While, in the third (July – September) season, the dominant species were hilsa shad followed by <b>Bombayduck</b> and croakers. For assessing the diversity of fisheries in West Bengal, Simpson’s index and Shannon’s index were calculated from the season-wise estimated marine fish landings for the period 2007 - 2010. The values of Simpson’s index varied from 0. 06 to 0. 37, the lowest recorded in first season of 2009 and highest in third season of 2007. The highest value was {{mainly because of the}} landings of a single species, the hilsa shad...|$|E
40|$|Mesh {{selectivity}} {{studies on}} commercially important species {{are essential to}} identify the fishable segment of the stock. This is required for assessing the effect of fishing effort on the exploited stocks and suggesting effective management measures for maximum sustainable yield. The present paper attempts to give a general review of the work done in this sphere. At centres like Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh) change in the cod - end mesh size in trawls {{over the years has}} resulted in considerable variations in production, catch composition and size distribution of commercially important species of shrimps. Instances of heavy landings of undersized prawns (penaeids less than 65 mm TL) have been noticed during the peak landing period along the coast of Kerala particularly at Sakthikulangara and it is partly attributed to the smaller mesh size of the trawls operated there. Considerable quantities of juvenile prawns of the marine species are caught from the estuaries and backwaters using stake nets having cod - end mesh sizes as low as 5 mm which in turn will adversely affect the recruitment of the species in the marine sector. Experimental studies on mesh selectivity of gill nets for oil sardine, and of trawls for shrimps in Kerala and of dol nets for <b>Bombayduck</b> in Maharashtra and Gujarat clearly indicate the necessity of mesh regulation for the judicious exploitation of these resources. Stock assessment studies carried out on shrimps along the southwest coast of India also emphasise the urgent need for an upward revision of the existing cod - end mesh size of 20 - 25 mm to atleast 30 mm in order to save the fishery from the danger of depletion...|$|E
