People {{in the study were}} able to articulate the imbalance of their news diet as a problem. They spoke of having trouble keeping up or finding resolution in the news. The study illustrates a contemporary news consumption model where the foundational elements for news and journalism  background and next steps  were mostly out of range. Stories "below the fold" seem in danger of becoming vestigial news organs. The logical explanation for much of the current news consumption behavior is connected to the Internet-driven, 24 / 7 news world.
