5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

The founder of the dynasty, Taejong made several {{attempts}} to bring upon improvements in the prevailing monetary system but they were not a success initially. The attempts include issuing Korean paper currency and issuing coins instead of importing them from China. The coins issued in Korean being unsuccessful led to the issuance of a standardized note made of <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> bark called Jeohwa (저화/楮貨), that was used in place of coins. Bronze coins were not cast again until the year 1423 during the reign of King Sejong. These coins had the inscription 朝鮮通寶 (Chosun Tongbo [...] "Chosun currency").

2500|$|Incendiary and flaming {{weapons were}} used in warfare for centuries prior to the {{invention}} of Greek fire. They included a number of sulfur-, petroleum-, and bitumen-based mixtures. Incendiary arrows and pots containing combustible substances were used {{as early as the}} 9th century BC by the Assyrians and were extensively used in the Greco-Roman world as well. Furthermore, Thucydides mentions that in the siege of Delium in 424 BC a long tube on wheels was used which blew flames forward using a large bellows. The Roman author Julius Africanus, writing in the 3rd Century AD, records a mixture that ignited from adequate heat and intense sunlight, used in grenades or night attacks:Automatic fire also by the following formula. This is the recipe: take equal amounts of sulphur, rock salt, ashes , thunder stone, and pyrite and pound fine in a black mortar at midday sun. Also in equal amounts of each ingredient mix together <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> resin and Zakynthian asphault, the latter in a liquid form and free-flowing, resulting in a product that is sooty colored. Then add to the asphalt the tiniest amount of quicklime. But because the sun is at its zenith, one must pound it carefully and protect the face, for it will ignite suddenly. When it catches fire, one should seal it in some sort of copper receptacle; in this way you will have it available in a box, without exposing it to the sun. If you should wish to ignite enemy armaments, you will smear it on in the evening, either on the armaments or some other object, but in secret; when the sun comes up, everything will be burnt up.In naval warfare, the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) is recorded by chronicler John Malalas to have been advised by a philosopher from Athens called Proclus to use sulfur to burn the ships of Vitalianus. Greek fire proper, however, was developed in c. 672 and is ascribed by the chronicler Theophanes to Kallinikos (Latinized Callinicus), an architect from Heliopolis in the former province of Phoenice, by then overrun by the Muslim conquests: ...|$|E

The nuances of the Sicilian ingredients are important to the flavor of the finished granita: Sicilian lemons are a less acidic, more floral variety similar to Meyer lemons, while the almonds used contain some number of bitter almonds, crucial to the signature almond flavor. Another popular flavor used in granita is pistachio, also an agricultural product of Sicily.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the anthocyanins, ascorbic acid content and the antiradical activity in less common fruit species native in the territory of Slovakia (<b>black</b> <b>mulberries,</b> cornelian cherries, blackberries, blackthorn, rowanberries) and honeyberries (Lonicera kamtschatica) originated from Kamtschatka. Anthocyanins were evaluated after extraction from solid materials with acidified ethanol or after direct solution of liquid samples with HCl in ethanol solution by spectrophotometer measurement. To evaluate the antiradical activity, a spectrophotometer method based on the reaction of antioxidants with a stable radical 2, 2 - diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyle (DPPH•) in methanol solution was used. The reduction properties of ascorbic acid are used in the measurement. The highest value of anthocyanin pigments was found out in honeyberries (Lonicera kamtschatica) of all analyzed clones. <b>Black</b> <b>mulberries</b> of the genotype M 104 and cornelian cherries of the genotypes 55 a 44 are the most significant sources of ascorbic acid among analysed less common fruit species. It is an interesting fact that blackthorns (Prunus spinosa) contenting the lowest value of ascorbic acid (10. 31 ± 1. 016 mg. 100 g- 1) and medium value of anthocyanins (1. 71 ± 0. 08 g. kg- 1) shows the highest level of antiradical activity (461. 25 ± 3. 69 % ≈ EC 50 = 0. 1084 ± 0. 0101). A similar phenomenon was observed in honeysuckles, too. According to these results we can suppose that another flavonoids (flavonols, flavons and flavanols) can also significantly contributed to antiradical activity of the blackthorns and edible honeysuckles. In summary, analysed less known fruit species are important sources of nutritive compounds, particularly anthocyanins, ascorbic acid and show significant free radical scavenging ability...|$|R

My boy, though he had hold of his brother's hand, did not expect to get out; he expected to perish in that labyrinth, and he had some notion that his end would be hastened by the tame crow.

40|$|Mulberry {{belongs to}} the Morus genus of the Moraceae family. There are 24 species of Morus, with at least 100 known varieties. Mulberry leaves, bark and {{branches}} have long been used in Chinese medicine. In most European countries mulberries are grown for fruit production. Mulberry are {{a good source of}} polyphenols, especially anthocyanins and micronutrients. In epidemiological and clinical studies, these constituents have been associated with improved cardiovascular risk profiles. Human intervention studies using (either fresh, or as juice, or freeze-dried), or purified anthocyanin extracts have demonstrated significant improvements in LDL oxidation, lipid peroxidation, total plasma antioxidant capacity, dyslipidemia and glucose metabolism. Benefits were seen in healthy subjects and in those with existing metabolic risk factors. The present study was performed to determine the natural antioxidants content of <b>black</b> and white <b>mulberry</b> fruits (Morus nigra and Morus alba L.) in Egypt and study the effects of different levels different levels of <b>black</b> and white <b>mulberry</b> fruits on lipid profile and oxidative stress in hypercholestrolemic rats. Forty adult male albino rats Sprague Dawley strain with an average weight of (100 ± 120 g) randomly divided into 8 groups (each of 5 rats), Group 1 : Control negative, rats fed on basal diet, Group 2 : Control positive, rats fed on hypercholesterolemic diet composed of basal diet + 2 % cholesterol. Others groups (3 - 8), rats fed on hypercholestrolemic diet supplemented by different levels of <b>black</b> or white <b>mulberry</b> dry fruits (2. 5, 5 and 10 %) for four weeks. Results observed that rats fed on hypercholestrolemic diet without supplementation (control positive) had significant increase in malonaldhyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), total cholesterol, triglycerides (T. G), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) while it had significant decrease in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) comparing with rats fed on basal diet (control negative). Moreover, The group administrated with Morus nigra L. 10 % had lowest value in malonaldhyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) followed by the group administrated with Morus alba L. 10 %. In addition, all hypercholestrolemic groups administrated with different levels (2. 5, 5 and 10 %) of <b>black</b> and white <b>mulberry</b> fruits (Morus nigra and Morus alba L.) had significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The group administrated with Morus nigra L. 10 % had highest value in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) followed by the group administrated with Morus alba L. 10 %. In addition, all hypercholestrolemic groups administrated with different levels (2. 5, 5 and 10 %) of <b>black</b> and white <b>mulberry</b> fruits (Morus nigra and Morus alba L.) had significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides (T.

It concluded that, consumption of <b>black</b> and white <b>mulberry</b> fruits (Morus nigra and Morus alba L.) my modify the risk of hypercholesterolemia and it have more potential as a health supplement rich in natural antioxidants. Moreover, mulberries are emerging as a dietary source of multiple compounds and nutrients, including anthocyanins, flavonoids, vitamins and fiber, that reduce CVD risk. While limited epidemiological data inversely associate consumption of berries with inflammation and CVD, these conclusions need to be strengthened in future case-control or cohort studies investigating the long-term health benefits of berries in specific populations...|$|R
