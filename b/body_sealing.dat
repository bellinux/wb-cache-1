40|$|Pressure-energized {{seal rings}} {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized seal rings have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to seal rings used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized seal ring generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} seal ring tighter against the gland and <b>body</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the seal ring is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the seal ring so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative seal rings according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional seal ring to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the seal ring directly against the both gland and <b>body</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the seal ring against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the seal ring into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and <b>body</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the seal ring more tightly against the <b>body</b> <b>sealing</b> surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the seal ring, the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the <b>body</b> <b>sealing</b> surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the seal ring against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the sealing ring in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the seal ring when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal seal rings may be preferred. The bottom part of Figure 2 shows one example of an alternative gland configuration with an all-metal seal ring...|$|E
30|$|CORK fluids were {{collected}} for both chemical characterization and analyses of microbial biomass/function during four cruises of the R/V Natsushima with ROV Hyper-Dolphin in January 2009 (NT 09 - 01, HPD# 941 - 947), May–June 2009 (NT 09 - 07, HPD# 1007 - 1010), February 2012 (NT 12 - 04, HPD# 1349 - 1350), and September 2012 (NT 12 - 23, HPD# 1433 - 1434). On 20 January 2009 (HPD# 941), the valve on the original-type CORK was opened. The discharging fluid (# 941) appeared blackish in coloration, {{probably due to}} suspension of sulfide minerals that had accumulated during the past 6  years. The likely source for this blackish fluid is the discharging fluid that occupied the pipe casing when the valve was closed in 2003. After initial samples {{were collected}}, the steel plug was replaced with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube and a ball valve. This PVC tube was inserted past the latch holes in the CORK <b>body,</b> <b>sealing</b> the borehole from the bottom seawater. Thus, fluids collected {{from the top of}} the CORK can be considered pristine CORK fluids with minimal or no entrainment of the bottom seawater (Wheat et al. 2008). Fluid collected during subsequent dives appeared to be colorless and clear at the mouth of the CORK but the coloration changed to whitish after venting, most likely due to the precipitation of brucite from seawater-derived Mg 2 + and CORK fluid-derived OH−.|$|E

Unique performance properties {{in the areas of}} weather resistance, high physical properties and processability are attributed to the seals which are mostly a combination of solid and foamed materials.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the closure of the LILW-Repository Morsleben (ERAM) 26 drift seals must be erected. Being {{situated}} in the access drifts to the disposal areas these drift seals are of relevance to long-term repository safety. Their adequate hydraulic resistance has to be proved. The hydraulic resistance of drift seals depends on three main elements, the excavation disturbed zone (EDZ) of the drift, the <b>sealing</b> <b>body</b> and the contact zone between <b>sealing</b> <b>body</b> and the surrounding salt. To assess the hydraulic resistance of the EDZ and the <b>sealing</b> <b>body</b> a reliable data basis is already available. The data are given in this paper. An adequate data basis is not available yet to rate the contact zone, however. To overcome this problem in situ tests are planned investigating the contact zone of the ten-year-old Asse seal. Additionally, laboratory tests will be performed using core samples from the Asse seal. The test program is described in this paper...|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the disc seat and <b>body</b> <b>seal</b> (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|R
