30|$|The mulch {{film and}} {{standard}} pellet samples of PBS (Bionolle 1020), PBSA (Bionolle 3020), and PBAT (Ecoflex F blend C 1200, <b>BASF</b> <b>AG,</b> <b>Germany)</b> were dissolved in chloroform-d (CDCl 3), and 1 [*]H and 13 [*]C NMR signals were determined at 600 and 151 [*]MHz {{by using a}} NMR spectrometer (Alpha 600, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Chemical shifts were quoted with respect to tetramethylsilane but were determined by referring to the residual 1 [*]H and 13 [*]C signals of the solvent (chloroform). The 13 [*]C NMR spectrum was used for assignment of the signals, and the 1 [*]H NMR spectrum was used for determining the molar ratio of the monomers and the ratio of PBS, PBSA, and PBAT in the mulch film.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Neopolen P is a {{two-phase}} cellular {{composite foam}} material produced by <b>BASF</b> <b>AG,</b> <b>Germany.</b> In {{most of the}} practical applications, Neopolen P works under a range of small and compressive deformations. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} determine the moduli in compression and compres-sive strength in the most effective way {{for a wide range of}} foam densities: 22 84 kg/m 3. Several experimental methods of different precision for deformation properties of Neopolen P were compared. The direct measure-ments performed by a universal testing machine were used for the main part of the experiments. They were compared with results obtained by a more precise and time-consuming method, using an inductive extensiometer HBW 5 K. Experimental data were obtained for structural, elastic, and strength proper-ties. It was proved that the foam exhibited a slight monotropy for the highest density of the investigated range. The observed anisotropy of mechanical properties was correlated to the structure and the manufacturing technology of the foam. Influence of the interaction of the two main factors: the electrostatic forces and the Earth gravity on the final anisotropy mode of the foam was analyzed. KEY WORDS: composite materials, polypropylene foam, Neopolen P, experi-ments, inductive extensiometer, structure, pre-expansion, polypropylene beads, electrostatic forces, the Earth gravity, compression, stress–strain curve, compression strength, elastic moduli, anisotropy...|$|E

In the same year, {{he began his}} studies of applied mathematics at the Gubkin University of Oil and Gas in Moscow, Russia. Five years later, he graduated with honours. Subsequently, {{he worked as a}} research assistant at the Russian Academy of Sciences at the Kurnakow Institute for General and Inorganic Chemistry in Moscow from 1979 to 1994. In 1985, he earned his doctorate with his work on heat and mass transfer in rectification and absorption processes of two- and multi-component mixtures. After 1994, Kenig received an Alexander von Humboldt scholarship for one year and worked as a guest scientist at the Chair of Thermal Process Engineering at the University of Dortmund. He stayed employed at the chair as a research associate for three more years until 1998. In 1998, Eugeny Kenig worked as a development engineer at <b>BASF</b> <b>AG</b> in Ludwigshafen, <b>Germany.</b> Afterwards, he was a research associate at the University of Essen until 2000. Eugeny Kenig habilitated at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Dortmund with his work entitled [...] "Modelling of Multicomponent Mass Transfer in Separation of Fluid Mixtures" [...] and attained the licence to teach “Fluid Process Engineering”. From 2000 to 2006 he worked as a lecturer for thermal processing technology at the University of Dortmund. In 2006 he was awarded the title “adjunct Professor”. On July 1, 2008, he became the head of the Chair of Fluid Process Engineering at Paderborn University, where he is still working today.. Since 2010 he also is adjunct Professor at the Gubkin University of Oil and Gas.|$|R
