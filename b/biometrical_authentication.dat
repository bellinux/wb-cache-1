40|$|Abstract: Biometrics is {{the process}} of {{automated}} recognition of individuals based on their behavioral and physiological characteristics. <b>Biometrical</b> <b>authentication</b> {{is the process}} of making sure that the person is who he claims to be. Physiological biometric traits include face and retina structures, fingerprint (whorls minutia), hand geometry, iris (pattern), ear (structure of the cartilaginous tissue of the pinna), palm vein and DNA structures etc where as Behavioral biometric traits include gait patterns, signatures, keystroke and odor etc. Biometric is a very accurate and reliable method as compared to traditional knowledge based (e. g., passwords) and token based (e. g., ID cards) mechanisms. Various biometrics are used {{on the basis of the}} scope of the testing medium, the accuracy required and speed required. Every medium of authentication has its own advantages and shortcomings...|$|E
40|$|Biometrics {{refers to}} methods for uniquely {{recognising}} humans based upon {{one or more}} intrinsic physical or behavioural traits. In information technology in particular, biometrics {{is used as a}} form of identity access management and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance. Biometric characteristics can be divided in two main classes: physiological and behavioural. Physiological examples include fingerprints, face recognition, DNA, hand and palm geometry, iris recognition, which has largely replaced retina, and odour/scent. Behavioural examples include typing rhythm, gait, and voice. This book gathers the latest research in the field of biometrics and focuses on topics such as on-line signature verification, improving the performance of colour spaces in face recognition, block coding schemes designed for <b>biometrical</b> <b>authentication,</b> large scale palm print identification and distributional properties of count outcomes and limitations of relying on more traditional analytic methods to analyse low base rate occurrences...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to process available variations of biometric methods which are used for an automatic identification or verification of people based on their anatomical-physiological or behavioural characteristics {{that are supposed to}} be unique, stable over time, practically measurable and technologically processable. These methods have already been used for hundreds of years for the identification of people and for various solutions of security. Today, these biometric methods are improved and connected with the modern information technology. The advantage of biometric methods is based on the identification of the basic essence of a man. Therefore, they are characterized by a high degree of protection against misuse and to following misuse of identity in comparison to a simple function of identification chip or another identification medium. The theoretical part consists of a description of a professional terminology primarily of a description of the <b>biometrical</b> <b>authentication</b> methods. Further on, there is an implementation of analysis of available solutions of biometrical systems in the environment of the Czech market. The choice of the biometrical system for the application in the practical part of this project has been made based on this information. Own project of authentication people at primary school with a help of used biometrical methods is proposed in practical part. And this method will be tested on available devices...|$|E
