40|$|The local dairy commodity, {{from farm}} to retail point, is {{informal}} and often escapes safety surveillance {{and results in}} high contamination of local milk by pathogens. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the biodiversity of <b>Bifidobacterium</b> species in the informal dairy production chain in Abidjan and evaluate their potential antibacterial activity against pathogens. <b>Bifidobacterium</b> species were identified after sequencing of hsp 60 genes. Results showed that <b>Bifidobacterium</b> were present in 9 % of samples. Milkers' hands (14 %) and cows’s udders (14 %) were the most contaminated with <b>Bifidobacterium.</b> These isolates belong to five different species. Most <b>Bifidobacterium</b> isolated are <b>Bifidobacterium</b> minimum (53 %) and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> pseudolongum subsp. Globosum (24. 4 %). The other strains are composed of one strain of <b>Bifidobacterium</b> thermophilum, <b>Bifidobacterium</b> thermacidophilum subsp. suis and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> magnum. The isolated <b>Bifidobacterium</b> species have antibacterial activities that are not related to bacteriocins production, but to organic acids production (65 %), which exert in vitro inhibitory action against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella hadar and Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O 27 and Escherichia coli O 157 H 7. However, ensuring milk safety along the local milk production chain requires implementation of good hygiene practices together with adapted technology, such as fermentation.

40|$|Abstract – There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} {{for the use of}} microorganisms as probiotics, but often with a lack of careful microbiological analysis of products used for this purpose, which raises serious questions about safety and efficacy. A microbiological investigation has been conducted on a commercialised Italian pharmaceutical preparation to assess the presence of the species of <b>Bifidobacterium</b> claimed on the label. <b>Bifidobacterium</b> longum was isolated whereas <b>Bifidobacterium</b> breve and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> infantis were not, despite being claimed on the product label. In addition, <b>Bifidobacterium</b> animalis was detected although not declared. Key words: <b>Bifidobacterium,</b> probiotic, taxonomy, pharmaceutical preparation...|$|R

25|$|The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found {{evidence}} to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased {{in the number of}} <b>bifidobacteria.</b> Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no {{evidence to support}} major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.|$|E

40|$|Frozen dairy {{products}} have characteristics of both yogurt {{and ice cream}} and could be the persuasive carriers of probiotics. Functions of the frozen yogurt containing viable bifidobacterial cells are recognized and favored {{by the people of}} all ages. We developed a kind of yogurt supplemented by <b>Bifidobacterium</b> species. Firstly, five strains of <b>Bifidobacterium</b> spp. (<b>Bifidobacterium</b> bifidum ATCC 11547, <b>Bifidobacterium</b> longum ATCC 11549, <b>Bifidobacterium</b> infantis ATCC 11551, <b>Bifidobacterium</b> adolescentis ATCC 11550, and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> breve ATCC 11548) were evaluated based on the feasibility criteria of probiotics, comprising acid production, bile tolerance, and adhesion to epithelial cells. Formerly, we combined the optimum strains with yogurt culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus EMCC 11102 and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus EMCC 11044) for producing frozen yogurt. Finally, physiochemical properties and sensory evaluation of the frozen yogurt were investigated during storage of 60 days at − 18 °C. Results directed that <b>Bifidobacterium</b> adolescentis ATCC 11550 and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> infantis ATCC 11551 could be utilized with yogurt culture for producing frozen yogurt. Moreover, the frozen yogurt fermented by two bifidobacterial strains and yogurt culture gained the high evaluation in the physiochemical properties and sensory evaluation. In summary, our results revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} between frozen yogurt fermented by <b>Bifidobacterium</b> spp. and yogurt culture and that fermented by yogurt culture only...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To develop {{real-time}} quantitative PCR methods, {{based on}} the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of different human faecal bifidobacterial populations.

The detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 · 105 and 9 · 103 cells g) 1 of faeces. The applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. Bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. Conclusions: The real-time PCR procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of <b>Bifidobacterium</b> groups or species in human faecal samples. Significance and Impact of the Study: The developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health and disease.

The faecal <b>Bifidobacterium</b> microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific PCR. Serum levels of the cytokines IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. The most frequently detected species were B. longum, <b>Bifidobacterium</b> adolescentis and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> bifidum. Depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain <b>Bifidobacterium</b> species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. Negative correlations were observed between the levels of <b>Bifidobacterium</b> species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and the regulatory cytokine IL- 10. The presence of faecal B. longum and <b>Bifidobacterium</b> animalis correlated with reduced serum IL- 10.

40|$|Zonulin {{protein is}} a newly {{discovered}} modulator which modulates the permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier by disassembling intercellular tight junctions (TJ).

The present study aims to investigate the effects of <b>bifidobacterium</b> on intestinal barrier function, zonulin regulation, and TJ integrity both in LPS-induced enterocyte barrier injury of Caco- 2 monolayers and in a rat NEC model. Our results showed <b>bifidobacterium</b> markedly attenuated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in paracellular permeability in the Caco- 2 monolayers treated with LPS (P < 0. 01). Compared with the LPS group, <b>bifidobacterium</b> significantly decreased the production of IL- 6 and TNF-α (P < 0. 01) and suppressed zonulin release (P < 0. 05). In addition, <b>bifidobacterium</b> pretreatment up-regulated occludin, claudin- 3 and ZO- 1 expression (P < 0. 01) and also preserved these proteins localization at TJ compared with the LPS group. In the in vivo study, <b>bifidobacterium</b> decreased the incidence of NEC from 88 to 47 % (P < 0. 05) and reduced the severity in the NEC model.
