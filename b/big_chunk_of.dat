500|$|In {{terms of}} visuals, Tanner {{stated that the}} {{graphics}} are [...] "better than a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> PS2 games" [...] {{and that it is}} the [...] "best-looking game on the PSP thus far." [...] Pereira said that it looks as good if not better than other handheld games available. Nelson said the graphics are [...] "the best you've ever seen on a handheld." [...] He also said that it makes the first two God of War games on the PlayStation 2 look dated. GameTrailers said [...] "you'll be treated to the very best visuals the PSP has to offer". Parkin described the set-pieces as [...] "incredible" [...] for a handheld platform, however, he stated they [...] "seem tired" [...] in comparison to the opening scenes of God of War III.|$|E
500|$|Brudvig {{praised the}} {{campaign}} for avoiding the [...] "repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots" [...] of past Halo titles. GameSpot's Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non-player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for The Guardian that Reachs story made previous entries feel [...] "amateurish"; Nguyen felt that whereas previous Halo titles had become mired in inconsistencies and Star Trek-like technobabble, Reach told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time: [...] "I almost forgot that Noble Four (Emile) even existed for a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, as I rarely saw him." [...] Wireds Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of Aliens, writing {{that most of the}} characters were unmemorable and one-dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as [...] "minor quibbles" [...] compared to the improvements. In contrast, GamesRadar's Charlie Baratt opined that Reachs campaign was better than ODSTs, but lacked the [...] "franchise-changing potential" [...] it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, [...] " [...] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the shootings of Castile and Alton Sterling, President Barack Obama did {{not comment on the}} {{specific}} incidents, but called on the U.S. to [...] "do better" [...] and said that controversial incidents arising from the police use of force were [...] "not isolated incidents" [...] but rather were [...] "symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system". Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about." [...] Obama telephoned Castile's mother to offer his condolences.|$|E

60|$|It was giddy work, but {{not nearly}} so giddy as a rather overnourished reader sitting in a warm room might imagine. Bert found it quite {{possible}} to look down and contemplate the wild sub-arctic landscape below, now devoid of any sign of habitation, a land of rocky cliffs and cascades and broad swirling desolate rivers, and of trees and thickets that grew more stunted and scrubby as the day wore on. Here and there on the hills were patches and pockets of snow. And over all this he worked, hacking away at the tough and slippery oiled silk and clinging stoutly to the netting. Presently they cleared and dropped a tangle of bent steel rods and wires from the frame, and a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> silk bladder. That was trying. The airship flew up at once as this loose hamper parted. It seemed almost {{as though they were}} dropping all Canada. The stuff spread out in the air and floated down and hit and twisted up in a nasty fashion on the lip of a gorge. Bert clung like a frozen monkey to his ropes and did not move a muscle for five minutes.|$|E

It is also possible to aggregate the inputs into two broad categories-operational expenditure and capital expenditure and use these as the two inputs in the proposed cost model. Operational expenditures include the recurring costs like power/cooling, server management etc; whereas capital expenditure includes initial investment such as new server cost, infrastructure costs etc.|$|R
