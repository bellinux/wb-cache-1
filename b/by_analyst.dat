Barack Obama began to attack former President Bill Clinton for his comments which were taken as racist.

500|$|However, Near {{also noted}} an exception, {{allowing}} prior restraint in {{cases such as}} [...] "publication of sailing dates of transports or the number or location of troops". This exception was a key point in another landmark case four decades later: New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), in which the administration of President Richard Nixon sought to ban {{the publication of the}} Pentagon Papers, classified government documents about the Vietnam War secretly copied <b>by</b> <b>analyst</b> Daniel Ellsberg. The Court found, 6–3, that the Nixon administration had not met the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint. Justice Brennan, drawing on Near in a concurrent opinion, wrote that [...] "only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an evil kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order." [...] Justices Black and Douglas went still further, writing that prior restraints were never justified.|$|E

500|$|The Phillies' first offseason {{acquisition}} was Shawn Camp, a right-handed middle reliever {{coming off}} an [...] "awful" [...] {{season with the}} Chicago Cubs who was signed on November 11, 2013 to a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training. The next day, they signed the right-handed-hitting corner outfielder for whom they were looking: Marlon Byrd, {{a member of the}} team from his debut in 2002 to 2005, signed a two-year contract for $16million. Soon after the agreement was announced, Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. was criticized <b>by</b> <b>analyst</b> Keith Law for overpaying Byrd; according to Law, Byrd's 2013 season was a [...] "fluke" [...] and an [...] "outlier". Near the end of that week, the Phillies signed two players to minor-league contracts with invitations to spring training: outfielder Clete Thomas, who led Minnesota Twins outfielders in games played in their 2013 season (with a [...]214 batting average), and Cesar Jimenez, a left-handed specialist who pitched 17 innings with the Phillies in 2013. The following week the team signed infielder Reid Brignac, a well-regarded prospect for the Tampa Bay Rays who had struggled in the major leagues, to a minor-league contract with a spring-training invitation. Shortly afterwards the Phillies addressed their catching needs, re-signing Carlos Ruiz to a three-year contract (with an option for a fourth year) worth $26million. Similar to the Byrd deal, Amaro was criticized for signing a 35-year-old catcher to a three-year contract. Cliff Corcoran wrote for Sports Illustrated, [...] "While Ruiz may have been an underrated player in the past, heading into his age-35 season, he doesn’t have far to fall before he's little more than a replacement-level catcher." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} sell-side financial analysts (analysts hereafter) "doing" corporate governance. The term "doing" {{is used in the}} current study to designate the various ways in which some analysts in the US and the UK, across the past decade or so, have made corporate governance visible. The thesis examines how this has occurred, and the mechanisms and devices that have made it possible. Analysts, it is suggested, can be viewed as "agents of transparency", in so far as they have taken the evaluation of companies beyond the financials, to include corporate governance issues. The thesis focuses primarily on the corporate governance reports produced <b>by</b> <b>analysts,</b> the official documents issued by various organisations and institutions, selected financial and business newspapers and magazines, together with other documents such as textbooks of corporate governance, as well as academic and practioner publications on corporate governance. Through an examination of these materials, the thesis investigates the pre-conditions that made possible the appearance and development of the corporate governance work pursued <b>by</b> <b>analysts</b> in the early twenty-first century. It {{examines the}} evaluations performed <b>by</b> <b>analysts</b> of the corporate governance procedures adopted by companies. In particular, it focuses on the ways in which analysts benchmarked the corporate governance procedures of companies against formal regulations, and how comparisons of the governance procedures adopted by different companies were undertaken and facilitated <b>by</b> <b>analysts.</b> Benchmarking, and the making of comparisons of corporate governance practices through a range of devices, are examined. The thesis also examines the linking of corporate governance to the financials (such as profitability, stock price performance, and equity valuation) in the investment analyses performed <b>by</b> <b>analysts.</b> It concentrates on the way in which analysts integrated corporate governance issues in the investment decision making process. Attention is paid to the ideas that shaped and articulated the integration, {{as well as to the}} tools and devices deployed <b>by</b> <b>analysts.</b> This thesis argues that greater attention is needed to the "doing" of corporate governance <b>by</b> <b>analysts,</b> and its implications for these "agents of transparency" that have broadened the parameters through which transparency is assessed...|$|R
