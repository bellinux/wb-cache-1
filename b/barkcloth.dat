5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten <b>barkcloth)</b> was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
25|$|In pre-contact Tonga, {{women did}} not do the cooking (cooking in an earth oven was hard, hot work, the {{province}} of men) or work in the fields. They raised children, gathered shellfish on the reef, and made koloa, <b>barkcloth</b> and mats, which were a traditional form of wealth exchanged at marriages and other ceremonial occasions. An industrious woman thus raised the social status of her household. Her family also slept soundly, on the piles of mats and <b>barkcloth</b> that were the traditional bedding. On sunny days, these were spread on the grass to air, which prolonged their life.|$|E

50|$|The {{inner bark}} of Lagetta species—the phloem layer that carries {{nutrients}} from the leaves to the roots—consists of twenty to thirty tough, thin, dense layers of interlacing bast fibers. Whereas in most economically important fibrous plants the bast fibers are formed in straight, parallel lines, in the Lagetta species they separate and rejoin {{to form a}} fine natural net or mesh of tiny rhomboids. The lacebark tree's layers of inner bark can be carefully pulled apart to produce multiple sheets of white netting known eponymously as lacebark. Lacebark is thus unique among other tropical <b>barkcloths</b> in being produced without having to be beaten into shape.|$|R
50|$|Another early {{culture with}} an artistic {{tradition}} are the Lapita, dating from about 1500 BC to 500 BC, who {{are thought to}} be the ancestors of the modern day cultures of Polynesia, Micronesia, and some parts of Melanesia. The culture was formed by the second wave of Oceanic settlers. The name comes from the site of Lapita in New Caledonia, which was among the first places its distinctive sculpture would be found. It is debated exactly where the culture developed, but the people themselves originally came from Southeast Asia. Their art is best known by its ceramics, which include elaborate geometric motifs and sometimes anthropomorphic imagery. It is thought some of the designs may be related to modern Polynesian tattoos and <b>barkcloths.</b> They were created by firing a comblike tool that stamped the designs on to wet clay. Each stamp would have one design and would be layered until an elaborate pattern was created. Their usage was primarily, in cooking, serving, and storing food.|$|R

25|$|Women {{who attend}} the Wesleyan Methodist girls' school, Queen Sālote College, are taught several Western handicrafts, such as {{embroidery}} and crochet. They {{learn to make}} embroidered pillowcases and bed coverings or crocheted lace tablecloths, bedcovers, and lace trim. However, Western-style handicrafts such as these have not become widely popular outside the school setting. They require expensive imported materials {{that can only be}} purchased in major towns. Village women {{are much more likely to}} turn their efforts to weaving mats or beating <b>barkcloth,</b> which can be done with free local material.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was less}} {{tolerance}} of sexual mistakes {{on the part}} of high-born women, who were expected to [...] "demonstrate" [...] their virginity by bleeding heavily on their wedding night. The groom's aunts would display the stained <b>barkcloth</b> (or later, sheet), after bathing the bride to inspect her for cuts that might have been inflicted to draw blood. It is said that grooms might show their love and concern for non-bleeding brides by cutting themselves and smearing their own blood on the <b>barkcloth</b> or sheet.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1820s {{the newly}} arrived missionaries from New England {{described}} {{the women of}} Hawaii as [...] "lazy women", because [...] "they were shocked by what they perceived as the idleness of women". During that time, the native women of Hawaii were at an advantageous position because of the [...] "usual division of labor", wherein men were described to have been undertaking the [...] "bulk of heavy labor in building, fishing and agriculture". Hawaiian men also cooked the meals; while Hawaiian women handcrafted [...] "highly-valued" [...] mats and <b>barkcloth.</b> The female members of Hawaiian society also collected shellfish, and they were more closely involved {{in the care of}} infants. Women, as well as men, did not wear much clothing. Young Hawaiian women at the time had little duties. For the 1820s missionaries, Hawaiians - women and men alike - did not appear to [...] "have enough work to do. Their free time was spent in swimming and surfing, in cardplaying, boxing matches, games, cockfights, hulas and other traditional games of skill or chance. In a missionary school, surfboards were used as tables for women to study." ...|$|E

5000|$|Today, what is {{commonly}} called <b>barkcloth</b> is a soft, thick, slightly textured fabric, {{so named because}} it has a rough surface like that of tree bark. This <b>barkcloth</b> is usually made of densely woven cotton fibers. Historically, the fabric has been used in home furnishings, such as curtains, drapery, upholstery, and slipcovers. It is often associated with 1940s through 1960s home fashions, particularly in tropical, abstract, [...] "atomic" [...] and [...] "boomerang" [...] prints, the last two themes being expressed by images of atoms with electrons whirling, and by the boomerang shape which was very popular in mid-century cocktail tables and fabrics. Waverly, a famed design house for textiles and wall coverings between 1923 and 2007, called their version of this fabric rhino cloth, possibly for the rough, nubbly surface. [...] American <b>barkcloth</b> shot through with gold Lurex threads was called Las Vegas cloth, and contained as much as 65% rayon as well, making it a softer, more flowing fabric than the stiffer all-cotton rhino cloth or standard <b>barkcloth.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Barkcloth</b> or bark cloth is a {{versatile}} material {{that was once}} common in Asia, Africa, Indonesia, and the Pacific. <b>Barkcloth</b> comes primarily from trees of the Moraceae family, including Broussonetia papyrifera, Artocarpus altilis, and Ficus natalensis. It is made by beating sodden strips of the fibrous inner bark of these trees into sheets, which are then finished {{into a variety of}} items. Many texts that mention [...] "paper" [...] clothing are actually referring to barkcloth.Barkcloth has been manufactured in Uganda for centuries and is Uganda's sole representative on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E

50|$|Tapa cloth (or simply tapa) is a <b>barkcloth</b> made in {{the islands}} of the Pacific Ocean, {{primarily}} in Tonga, Samoa and Fiji, but as far afield as Niue, Cook Islands, Futuna, Solomon Islands, Java, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea (particularly in Oro Province around Tufi) and Hawaii (where it is called kapa). In French Polynesia it has nearly disappeared, except for some villages in the Marquesas.|$|E
50|$|The items {{collected}} {{cannot be}} identified {{to a particular}} island or voyage, and before Cook arrived {{there had been a}} flourishing exchange of artefacts and ideas between the islands. Banks enjoyed the opportunities to witness and sometimes participate in Tahitian life. He took part in a HEIVA public dance ceremony, accompanied by drums and nose flute (seeH000143). He was also allowed {{to take part in a}} mourning ceremony and was fascinated by the costume worn by the chief mourner. According to Forster none of these were collected until the 2nd voyage, when parts of at least 10 were taken to England. Tha Australian Museum's collection has an example of the shell breast ornament component (see H000149). Semicircular breast ornaments, or gorgets, were commonly worn, and many were collected by the crew and valued as a special type of artificial curiosity (see H000105 and H000145). <b>Barkcloth</b> was presented in large pieces on several occasions to the visitors. Much of the cloth collected was cut into pieces and placed in books of <b>barkcloth</b> samples.|$|E
50|$|The Endeavour spent 3 months {{altogether}} in the Society Islands, and Cook's {{ships were}} to return 3 more times during later voyages (Aug-Sep1773, April-May1774,and Aug-Sep1777).

A large number of objects were therefore collected, and many detailed drawings and maps of the islands were produced.|$|E
50|$|Mariel and her companions {{follow the}} path and enter a dense forest. In this forest, they detect a strange, cloying smell that causes heavy drowsiness.
