5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to <b>bathe</b> together; they would either be in separate baths, or <b>bathe</b> at different times of the day.|$|E

40|$|In the tropics, bathing full-term newborn {{babies are}} {{routinely}} done immediately after birth, {{although it is}} usually not recommended until 2 – 6 hours of age. Yet, there is no study in Indonesia about hypothermia in newborns <b>bathed</b> immediately after birth. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the influence of bathing the newborn immediately after birth to the body temperature and hypothermia. One hundred and twenty five healthy full-term newborn babies delivered on March 1999 were included and separated into two groups, 59 newborns were <b>bathed</b> immediately after birth and 66 newborns were <b>bathed</b> later. There was no statistical difference between both groups in the mean of birth weight, gestational age, room temperatures, gender, delivery method, and risk of infection. Mean body temperature between both groups were not statistically different on the 0 and the 30 th minute after birth. On the other hand, on the 15 th minute after birth, the mean body temperature of the immediately <b>bathed</b> group was statistically lower than not immediately <b>bathed</b> group [36. 84 (SD 0. 25) °C vs 37. 02 (SD 0. 27) °C, p= 0. 0001]. On the 15 th minute after birth, there were four (6. 8 %) hypothermic babies (rectal temperature < 36. 5 °C) in the immediately <b>bathed</b> group and one (1. 5 %) hypothermic baby in the not immediately <b>bathed</b> group (p= 0. 134). Conclusion, bathing healthy full-term newborn babies immediately after birth will decrease the body temperature, but hypothermia occurred only in very small numbers which are not statistically significant.

50|$|Dogs can be <b>bathed</b> {{by being}} sprayed with a {{hand-held}} shower head, or doused {{with water from}} a bucket. Often, one bath will not make a dog truly clean. A second bath is excellent to ensure the entire body has been cleaned. Dogs should be <b>bathed</b> with warm, not hot water, {{in order to make}} it a more enjoyable experience. Dogs with a heavy or matted coat should never be <b>bathed</b> without first being completely brushed out or clipped of any mats.|$|R

5|$|Two {{or three}} oval white eggs, laid {{two to three}} days apart, are most {{commonly}} laid in a clutch, though there can be anywhere from one to five. They average 41.6mm long by 35.5mm wide, and are finely pitted. The female alone incubates the eggs, during which time she is fed by the male. She does leave the nest at dusk for around half an hour, sometimes to <b>bathe.</b> Incubation takes 30–31 days.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He {{eventually}} {{fell in love}} with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to <b>bathe</b> in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.|$|E

5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb <b>bathe,</b> but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors <b>bathe</b> frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E

5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen.

After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to <b>bathe</b> in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} {{stages of}} the history of England are represented within the city, from the Roman Baths (including their significant Celtic presence), to Bath Abbey and the Royal Crescent, to the more recent Thermae Bath Spa. The size of the tourist industry is reflected in the almost 300 places of accommodation– including more than 80 hotels, two of which have 'five-star' ratings, over 180 bed and breakfasts– many of which are located in Georgian buildings, and two campsites located on {{the western edge of the}} city. The city also has about 100 restaurants and a similar number of pubs and bars. Several companies offer open top bus tours around the city, as well as tours on foot and on the river. Since the opening of Thermae Bath Spa in 2006, the city has attempted to recapture its historical position as the only town or city in the United Kingdom offering visitors the opportunity to <b>bathe</b> in naturally heated spring waters.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, {{the upper}} class {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This meant that wives had to be subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them <b>bathe,</b> arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E
