5|$|According to the Augustan History, Zenobia's {{descendants}} were Roman nobility {{during the}} reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work could have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> their growing social status, and they may have needed more room for a greater number of servants.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the storm}} quickly downgraded, and by August 19 {{it was once}} again at minimal {{hurricane}} force. At roughly the same time, it turned more to the west, although it maintained a general northwesterly path. The abrupt weakening may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a seeding experiment carried out on the storm {{in an attempt to}} deteriorate it. By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during the day. At this point, the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120mph (195km/h); shortly thereafter, its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 millibars.|$|E

5|$|In 975, {{not long}} after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was banished from England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles report of his expulsion. Version C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{describes}} the events thus:The valiant Oslac was driven from the country, over the tossing waves, the gannet's bath, the tumult of the waters, the homeland of the whale; a grey-haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his lands The historian Richard Fletcher guesses that Oslac's downfall may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E
5|$|In July 1794 he {{and several}} other activists were exiled from Leipzig, and Piattoli was soon arrested by the Austrian authorities. After {{the failure of the}} Kościuszko Insurrection later in 1794, many prisoners were set free, but Piattoli was kept imprisoned, {{together}} with Kołłątaj, as the Russian authorities insisted that the two were “extremely dangerous”. Hence, even after the final Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Piattoli was kept interned in Prague by the Austrian Empire authorities until 1800, despite requests for his release from Poniatowski and even Napoleon Bonaparte. His release in 1800 seems to have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> efforts of the Czartoryski family and Duchess Dorothea.|$|E

5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a desire to retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{publicly}} about Biko's death, the country's police minister Jimmy Kruger initially implied {{that it had}} <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a hunger strike, a statement he later denied. His account was challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them {{that he would never}} kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated that no one would be prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct and may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, {{it is clear that}} Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E

5|$|Thored's {{governorship}} as ealdorman, {{based on}} charter attestations, cannot be securely dated before 979. He did attest royal charters {{during the reign}} of Æthelred II, the first in 979, six in 983, one in 984, three in 985, one in 988, appearing in such attestations for the last time in 989. It is possible that such appearances represent more than one Thored, though that is not a generally accepted theory. His definite predecessor, Oslac, was expelled from England in 975. The historian Richard Fletcher thought that Oslac's downfall may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> opposing the succession of Edward the Martyr, enemy and brother of Æthelred II.|$|E
5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of the bones may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of design work, KnAAPO constructed the first prototype, which was finished in mid-2007. The prototype, Su-35-1, was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield, in preparation for its maiden flight. On 19 February 2008, Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its 55-minute first flight from Zhukovsky, accompanied by an Su-30MK2 acting as a chase plane. Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its maiden flight on 2 October from KnAAPO's Dzyomgi Airport. The flight-test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes, but on 26 April 2009, a day before its scheduled maiden flight, the fourth Su-35 (there's a static test aircraft) crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport. The aircraft struck a barrier {{at the end of}} the runway and was destroyed by fire; the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries. A commission was opened to investigate the crash, but several sources initially speculated that the incident had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a brake failure or a faulty fuel pump.|$|E
