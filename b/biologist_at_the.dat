25|$|While dolphin attacks occur {{far less}} {{frequently}} than attacks by other sea animals, such as sharks, some scientists {{are worried about}} the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. Dr. Andrew J. Read, a <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{the project}} contend {{that there are many}} {{environmental}} issues to be considered, such as the link between El Niño (ENSO) and the threat to water supplies posed by El Niño. The ACP has commissioned studies by several consultants about water supply and quality problems. Some of the most prominent critics of the canal expansion plan {{from the point of view}} of water quality issues are Eric Jackson (editor of the online Panama News), Gonzalo Menendez (former head of Panama's National Environmental Authority), and Ariel Rodriguez (a <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Panama), and former Vice Minister of Public Works Grettel Villalaz de Allen.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the rest}} of Europe was cooling, the area around Gibraltar back then resembled a European Serengeti. Leopards, hyenas, lynxes, wolves and bears lived among wild cattle, horses, deer, ibexes, oryxes and rhinos – all {{surrounded}} by olive trees and stone pines, with partridges and ducks overhead, tortoises in the underbrush and mussels, limpets and other shellfish in the waters. Clive Finlayson, evolutionary <b>biologist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gibraltar Museum said [...] "this natural richness of wildlife and plants in the nearby sandy plains, woodlands, shrublands, wetlands, cliffs and coastline probably helped the Neanderthals to persist." [...] Evidence at the cave shows the Neanderthals of Gibraltar likely {{used it as a}} shelter [...] "for 100,000 years." [...] Cro-Magnon man took over Gibraltar around 24,000 BCE.|$|E

50|$|Palm Creek virus (PCV) is {{an insect}} virus {{belonging}} to the genus Flavivirus, of the family Flaviviridae. It was discovered in 2013 from the mosquito Coquillettidia xanthogaster.
