5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer to}} the complete <b>biological</b> <b>molecule</b> in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.|$|E

This formula holds true for monosaccharides. Some exceptions exist; for example, deoxyribose, a sugar component of DNA, has the empirical formula C5H10O4.

40|$|This review gives a {{brief summary}} {{of the field of}} gold {{nanoparticle}} interactions with <b>biological</b> <b>molecules,</b> particularly those with possible catalytic relevance. Gold nanoparticles are well known as catalysts in organic chemistry but much is unknown regarding their potential as catalysts of reactions involving <b>biological</b> <b>molecules</b> such as protein and nucleic acids. <b>Biological</b> <b>molecules</b> may be the substrate for catalysis or, if they are the ligand coating the gold particle, may be the catalyst itself. In other cases <b>biological</b> <b>molecules</b> may form a template upon which gold nanoparticles can be precisely arrayed. As relatively little is currently known about the catalytic capabilities of gold nanoparticles in this area, this review will consider templating in general (including, but not restricted to, those which result in structures having potential as catalysts) before going on to consider firstly catalysis by the gold nanoparticle itself followed by catalysis by ligands attached to gold nanoparticles, all considered with a focus on <b>biological</b> <b>molecules...</b>|$|R
