"We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me.

Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

60|$|It is true {{that all}} these notions of mine in trade are founded upon the {{principle}} of frugality and good husbandry; {{and this is a}} principle so disagreeable to the times, and so contrary to the general practice, that we shall find very few people to whom it is agreeable. <b>But</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> my young tradesmen, that if they must banish frugality and good husbandry, they must at the same time banish all expectation of growing rich by their trade. It is a maxim in commerce, that money gets money, and they that will not frugally lay up their gain, in order to increase their gain, must not expect to gain as they might otherwise do; frugality may be out of fashion among the gentry, but if it comes to be so among tradesmen, we shall soon see that wealthy tradesmen will be hard to find; for they who will not save as well as gain, must expect to go out of trade as lean as they began.|$|R
