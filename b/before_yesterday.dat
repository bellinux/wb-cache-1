25|$|In his ninetieth year Travers had the {{uncommon}} {{distinction of}} having {{three of his}} plays running simultaneously in London; as well as The Bed <b>Before</b> <b>Yesterday</b> at the Lyric, there were revivals of Plunder at the National with Frank Finlay and Dinsdale Landen, and Banana Ridge at the Savoy with Robert Morley and George Cole. He wrote two further plays, After You with the Milk and Malacca Linda, in which he revisited the colonial Malaya of his youth. At 2013 neither has been staged in the West End.|$|E
25|$|After the {{abolition}} in 1968 of theatre censorship in Britain, Travers {{was for the}} first time able to write about sexual matters without discreet allusion or innuendo. The Bed <b>Before</b> <b>Yesterday</b> (1975) depicts a middle-aged woman discovering the pleasure of sex, to the consternation of some who know her and the delight of others. Joan Plowright played the central character with John Moffatt, Helen Mirren and Royce Mills in the main supporting roles. It received enthusiastic notices and ran for more than 500 performances, far outstripping the original runs of any of Travers's Aldwych farces.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in November 1975, Mirren {{played in}} West End {{repertory}} with the Lyric Theatre Company as Nina in The Seagull and Ella in Ben Travers' new farce The Bed <b>Before</b> <b>Yesterday</b> ("Mirren is stirringly voluptuous as the Harlowesque good-time girl": Michael Billington, The Guardian, 10 December 1975). At the RSC in Stratford in 1977, {{and at the}} Aldwych the following year, she played a steely Queen Margaret in Terry Hands' production of the three parts of Henry VI, while 1979 saw her 'bursting with grace', and winning acclaim for her performance as Isabella in Peter Gill's production of Measure for Measure at Riverside Studios.|$|E

25|$|The day <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> I {{was present}} at an {{operation}} performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
500|$|A May 1, 1917 {{review by}} The New York Times praised her natural talent, with some {{reservations}} about the unpolished quality of her voice.

500|$|The {{day that}} Edgar Allan Poe was buried, a long {{obituary}} {{appeared in the}} New York Tribune signed [...] "Ludwig". It was soon published throughout the country. The piece began, [...] "Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day <b>before</b> <b>yesterday.</b> This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it." [...] "Ludwig" [...] was soon identified as Rufus Wilmot Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.|$|E

On a nearer approach, and by a practised eye, these might have been identified as the forms of the Pirate-Colonel with his Bride, and of the day <b>before</b> <b>yesterday's</b> gallant prisoner with his Bride.|$|R

And she has fasted ever since the day <b>before</b> <b>yesterday's</b> walk, from sorrow and rage that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable.' ...|$|R
500|$|The gradual {{nature of}} the {{disaster}} was also more comforting, in some respects, compared {{with the nature of}} modern technological failures such as air crashes. Times reviewer made this point explicitly: [...] "This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn with wonder to an age <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the world must suffer." [...] It was, as Steven Biel comments, [...] "a quainter kind of disaster" [...] in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.|$|E
500|$|The {{witty and}} playful side of Creangă's personality, which became notorious {{during his time}} at Junimea and {{constituted}} {{a significant part of}} his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow Junimists in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself [...] "for against" [...] during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle {{and the two of them}} on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: [...] "not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> and last week and last week and throughout life". His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink. Overall, Eduard Gruber's report contended, Creangă's writing relied on him being [...] "a strong sensual and auditive type", and a [...] "very emotional" [...] person.|$|E

2500|$|After the war Travers's output declined; {{he had a}} long fallow {{period after}} the death of his wife in 1951, {{although}} he collaborated on a few revivals and adaptations of his earlier work. He returned to playwriting in 1968. [...] He was inspired to write a new comedy in the early 1970s after the abolition of theatre censorship in Britain permitted him to write without evasion about sexual activities, one of his favourite topics. The resulting play, The Bed <b>Before</b> <b>Yesterday</b> (1975), presented when he was 89, was the longest-running of all his stage works, easily outplaying any of his Aldwych farces.|$|E
2500|$|Tenses that refer {{specifically}} to [...] "today" [...] are called hodiernal tenses; {{these can be}} either past or future. Apart from Kalaw Lagaw Ya, another language which features such tenses is Mwera, a Bantu language of Tanzania. It is also suggested that in 17th-century French, the passé composé served as a hodiernal past. Tenses which contrast with hodiernals, by referring to the past before today or the future after today, are called pre-hodiernal and post-hodiernal respectively. Some languages also have a crastinal tense, a future tense referring {{specifically to}} tomorrow (found in some Bantu languages); or a hesternal tense, a past tense referring specifically to yesterday (although this name is also sometimes used to mean pre-hodiernal). A tense for after tomorrow is thus called post-crastinal, and one for <b>before</b> <b>yesterday</b> is called pre-hesternal.|$|E
