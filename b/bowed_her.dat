500|$|A {{committed}} Freemason, Joseph Terry's successful {{local political}} career {{stemmed from a}} philanthropic and active approach to {{the issues of the}} citizens of Victorian York, often using his influential status {{for the benefit of the}} city's populace. On 23 June 1887, just two days after receiving his knighthood in that years Golden Jubilee Honours, Terry led a deputation to present an album of all documented issues encountered by York residents to Buckingham Palace for Queen Victoria's inspection. In response, [...] "The Queen turned over a few of the leaves to look at the contents, and <b>bowed</b> <b>her</b> acceptance with stately courtesy and affection".

500|$|The {{figure of}} a cloaked young woman stands on top and at {{the centre of the}} front wall and overlooks the Douai Plains. She has her head <b>bowed,</b> <b>her</b> eyes cast down, and her chin resting in one hand. Below her at ground level is a sarcophagus, bearing a Brodie helmet and a sword, and draped in laurel branches. The saddened figure of Canada Bereft, also known as Mother Canada, is a {{national}} personification of the young nation of Canada, mourning her dead. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the [...] and presented in a similar style to that of Michelangelo's Pietà, faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved Canada Bereft from a single 30tonne block of stone. The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The area in front of the memorial was turned into a grassed space, which Allward referred to as the amphitheatre, that fanned out from the monument's front wall for a distance of [...] while the battle-damaged landscape around the sides and back of the monument were left untouched.|$|E
