25|$|Modern {{archaeology}} in formerly Punic areas {{has discovered}} {{a number of}} large cemeteries for children and infants, representing a civic and religious institution for worship and sacrifice called the Tophet by archaeologists. These cemeteries {{may have been used}} as graves for stillborn infants or children who died very early. Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted by many archeologists as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice. An estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC in the tophet discovered in the Salammbô neighbourhood of present-day Carthage with the practice continuing until {{the early years of the}} Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and two-year-olds. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In <b>bad</b> <b>times</b> (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known why. One explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention via child sacrifice; however, <b>bad</b> <b>times</b> would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the time}} of the Hamburgs {{delivery}} German Atlantic was faced with <b>bad</b> <b>times</b> financially. 75% of their income was made in US dollars, but during the late 60s and early 70s the Deutsche Mark gained value heavily compared to the Dollar. At the same time both crew expenses and fuel prices rose dramatically. Due to the raising expenses the company was forced to seek out a joint venture with Hapag-Lloyd, but nothing came of this. By September 1973 the company's debts were estimated at 50-70 million DM, so when Home Lines lost their SS Homeric and expressed interest in buying the Hanseatic as a replacement, German Atlantic {{had no choice but to}} sell the ship or face bankruptcy. On 25 September 1973 the Hanseatic was sold and renamed SS Doric. On the same date the Hamburg was in turn renamed Hanseatic, but at the same time plans were being drawn to sell her to Hapag-Lloyd.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in <b>bad</b> <b>times,</b> such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E

25|$|However, the 'Bandić problem' {{escalated}} in {{the coming}} months as the media continued to speculate about his potential candidacy. Bandić started to travel throughout Croatia without a stated common agenda, and the press followed his every step and constantly asked him if he would run for the presidency. He consistently refused to comment, drawing more and more media attention with his indecisiveness. Finally, the drama was concluded when he officially announced his candidacy for president in a speech on 5 November at 7am on Sljeme criticizing Zoran Milanović and his former party for turning against him saying {{that he was one of}} the founders of SDP emphasizing that he stood with the party through the good and the <b>bad</b> <b>times.</b> Bandić was automatically expelled from SDP, losing his position as a member of party's presidency and leader of the Zagreb branch of SDP. Despite that, he declared on Croatian national television HRT that he still finds himself as true Social Democrat and that he'll proudly keep his SDP membership card nr. 2. SDP later made a statement that Bandić's membership card number was 38159.|$|E

500|$|Due to his busy {{schedule}} at that time, Nagesh had a call sheet {{of one and}} a half days to finish his portions. When he learned that Ganesan's arrival was delayed because his make-up had not been completed, he asked Nagarajan whether they could film any solo sequences, which included a scene where Dharumi rants about his misfortune in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. While filming, Nagesh spontaneously came up with the dialogue, [...] "Varamaattan. Varamaattan. Avan nichchaiyam varamaattan. Enakku nalla theriyum. Varamaattan" [...] (...) [...] According to Nagesh, he was inspired by two incidents: one that involved two assistant directors discussing whether Ganesan would be ready before or after lunch— one said he would be ready while the other said he would not. The other was when Nagesh happened to notice a passerby talking to himself about how the world had fallen on <b>bad</b> <b>times.</b> The dubbing for the scenes featuring Nagesh and Ganesan was completed after the footage was shot. After viewing the sequences twice, Ganesan requested Nagarajan not to remove a single frame of Nagesh's portions from {{the final version of the}} film as he felt that they, along with Balaiah's scenes, would become a major highlight of the film.|$|E
