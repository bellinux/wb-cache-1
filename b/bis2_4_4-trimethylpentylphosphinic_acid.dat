40|$|A magnetically {{assisted}} {{chemical separation}} (MACS) process was developed earlier at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). This compact process {{was designed for}} the separation of transuranics (TRU) and radionuclides from the liquid waste streams that exist at many DOE sites, with an overall reduction in waste volume requiring disposal. The MACS process combines the selectivity afforded by solvent extractant/ion exchange materials with magnetic separation to provide an efficient chemical separation. Recently, the MACS process has been evaluated with acidic organophosphorus extractants for hazardous metal recovery from waste solutions. Moreover, process scale-up design issues have been addressed with respect to particle filtration and recovery. Two acidic organophosphorus compounds have been investigated for hazardous metal recovery, <b>bis(2,</b> <b>4,</b> 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex{reg_sign} 272) and <b>bis(2,</b> <b>4,</b> 4 -trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid (Cyanex{reg_sign} 301).

In this research, different extractants were investigated in order to extract scandium from a sulfate medium by a using a solvent extraction method.

However, in solvent extraction of scandium, the acidic and neutral organophosphorus compounds are preferred due to their higher extraction efficiencies.

The novel <b>bis(2,</b> <b>4</b> -dihydro- 2 H- 3 -(4 -N-maleimido) phenyl- 1, 3 -benzoxazine) isopropane (BMIPBI) was synthesized from maleic anhydride, p-nitroaniline, formaldehyde and 2, 2 -bis (4 -hydroxyphenyl) propane {{by a few}} steps reactions via the N-(4 -nitrophenyl) maleimide(NPMI), N-(4 -aminophenyl) maleimide(APMI), 1, 3, 5 -three (4 -(maleimido) phenyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine (TMIPT) intermediate production. The chemical structures of BMIPBI were confirmed by 1 H-NMR, FT-IR and EA. The {{results show that the}} production was the target object BMIPBI. The synthesized condition had been studied too. The BMIPBI was a loosened yellow solid and the yield of product was 58. 8 %...|$|R
