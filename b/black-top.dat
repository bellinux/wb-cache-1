50|$|Instead of {{restoring}} the grounds, in 1949 the city removed the remaining grave stones and headstones from the cemetery. Newspapers {{at the time}} reported {{that some of the}} remains in the cemetery were disturbed. The workmen buried some of the headstones to provide a smooth surface for laying <b>black-top.</b> The city then covered the grounds in <b>black-top,</b> added recreational equipment (such as swings and a basketball court) and converted the grounds into a whites-only park which they named Chapel Park. During the construction, a list of the names of those interned at the site began to be compiled, but was stopped after reaching only 161 names.|$|E
5000|$|A middle-market {{newspaper}} {{is one that}} attempts to cater to readers who want some entertainment from their newspaper {{as well as the}} coverage of important news events. Middle-market status is the halfway point of a three-level continuum of journalistic seriousness; uppermarket or [...] "quality" [...] newspapers generally cover hard news and down-market newspapers favour sensationalist stories. In the United Kingdom, since the demise of Today (1986-1995), the only national middle-market papers are the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, distinguishable by their <b>black-top</b> masthead (both use the easy-to-carry tabloid paper size), as opposed to the red-top mastheads of down-market tabloids.|$|E

[...] Robert Christgau gave the same album an A- grade, describing it as [...] "A song cycle about a Lubbock girl who seeks Jesus on the two-lane <b>black-top</b> of carnal knowledge and ultimately enjoys the just desert of giving birth to Her". He also wrote that on the album, Pierce is [...] "aided handsomely {{by a bunch of}} musicians who are there for her every time she commits suicide." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave Bad Girls Upset by the Truth a perfect four out of four stars, describing Pierce as [...] "one of the most gifted songwriters ever to emerge out of Texas" [...] and the album as [...] "triumphant". Jeff McCord of Texas Monthly wrote that on Dog of Love, [...] "Pierce's drawl and off-key singing might be initially jarring, and her loud rock edge is sometimes surprising ('Rock in My Shoe' sounds like a Neil Young song), but her wit shines through." ...|$|E

The maturing of bituminous binders {{is one of the key}} variables deciding the lifetime of <b>black-top</b> asphalt and ordinarily came about because of oxidation. The procedure of maturing includes synthetic and/or physical property changes that as a rule make bituminous materials harder and more weak with time because of slow loss of visco-versatile properties of bitumen in this manner increasing execution failure of pavement, which is encouraged because of continually changing atmosphere and recurrence of substantial traffic loaded activity developments. In the present study Sasobit, a warm mix added substance in different rates (1 to 3 %) is utilized as a part of VG 30 evaluation bitumen for deciding short term transient aging. The changing impacts on designing properties as far as the bituminous binders with and without Sasobit were measured before maturing and after transient maturing. The outcomes demonstrate that subsequent to maturing softening point builds, penetration reductions and elastic recovery increments with increasing rate of Sasobit. The misfortunes of unstable volatile portions recorded are inside admissible limits of codal procurement. Usage of such modifier can be gainful to highway ventures...|$|E
