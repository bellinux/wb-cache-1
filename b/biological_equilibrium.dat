5000|$|DiCarlo (...) has {{developed}} {{the idea of}} 'memetic equilibrium' to describe a cultural compatible state with <b>biological</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> In [...] "Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic" [...] (in press), diCarlo argues that as human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to consider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated ways. Understood in this way, problem solving amongst a particular group, when considered satisfactory, often produces a feeling of environmental control, stability, in short—memetic equilibrium. But the pay-off is not merely practical, providing purely functional utility—it is biochemical and it {{comes in the form}} of neurotransmitters. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious awareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined with the desire to maintain <b>biological</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> generated the necessity for memetic equilibrium to fill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper Paleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality.

Certain types of dry, closed, or semi-closed forests are very prone to fire damage. They deteriorate and become open forests or wooded savannahs but they survive somehow and, should the threat of fire be removed, could again become high forests. Other forest communities, on the contrary, may disappear altogether with great rapidity. This is the case, for instance, with the forests of western Madagascar that are almost nonexistent today, with the forests of the lower Congo and the Mayomba in south Africa, with Futa-Jalon in French Guinea, and probably with a great many others.

As these new types of chips become more integrated and parallel, the amount of sensors required for them increases. As more sensors are added, off chip components such as photodetectors, LEDs, and fibers also begin to scale linearly. In an effort to simplify and integrate the detection side of these systems, a platform is being developed which utilizes the same polymer materials used for biochips to create optical components. By combining elements such as waveguides and mirror couplers, arrays of small devices capable of out-of-plane detection are possible, decoupling the biochip design from the transducer design while still maintaining compact integrated functionality. by Kevin Shao-Kwan Lee.

40|$|Linker {{length and}} {{composition}} were varied in libraries of single-chain Arc repressor, resulting in proteins with effective concentrations ranging over six {{orders of magnitude}} (10 μM– 10 M). Linkers of 11 residues or more were required for <b>biological</b> activity. <b>Equilibrium</b> stability varied substantially with linker length, reaching a maximum for glycine-rich linkers containing 19 residues. The effects of linker length on equilibrium stability arise from significant and sometimes opposing changes in folding and unfolding kinetics. By fixing the linker length at 19 residues and varying the ratio of Ala/Gly or Ser/Gly in a 16 -residue-randomized region, the effects of linker flexibility were examined. In these libraries, composition rather than sequence appears to determine stability. Maximum stability in the Ala/Gly library was observed for a protein containing 11 alanines and five glycines in the randomized region of the linker. In the Ser/Gly library, the most stable protein had seven serines and nine glycines in this region. Analysis of folding and unfolding rates suggests that alanine acts largely by accelerating folding, whereas serine acts predominantly to slow unfolding. These results demonstrate an important role for linker design in determining the stability and folding kinetics of single-chain proteins and suggest strategies for optimizing these parameters...|$|R
