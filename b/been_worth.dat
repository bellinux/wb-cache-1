5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the chances that he will finish his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In another study, Gregory S. Paul {{pointed out}} that the flexed kneed and digitigrade adult Tyrannosaurus were much better adapted for running than {{elephants}} or humans, pointing out that Tyrannosaurus had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running. He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also {{pointed out that}} the lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E
5|$|Pacifism slowly {{began to}} emerge after the war, but very few war {{memorials}} communicated a pacifist message, largely because in the 1920s, most in the victorious countries felt that the war, while costly in human life, had <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> fighting. Anti-war protests in the inter-war years did use war memorials, however, as locations to communicate their messages; the Communist party in France, for example, held rallies at them. In Britain, political views about the war influenced attitudes towards memorial design and the ceremonies that surrounded them. Those who supported the war were keen to see the ideals of justice and freedom embodied in the designs; those who opposed the conflict sought memorials that would convince people to avoid future slaughter. The opening of {{the tomb of the}} Unknown Soldier was criticised for what anti-war campaigners felt was its pro-war pomp and ceremony, and the burial of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster raised controversy between those who liked the ceremony, and those who thought that the pageantry was designed to distract from the poor living conditions faced by the survivors of the war.|$|E

5|$|Siward died {{more than}} a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor, but despite this the Domesday Book {{recorded}} 4 manors, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066, all of them subsequently held by Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. This land was stated to have <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> £212, while his son Waltheof was said to have held £136 worth of land across 9 counties. Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward's holdings. In total it recorded property worth £348 for Siward and his son, which on its own would compare poorly with the £2493 in value recorded to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia. Of the latter, however, Morcar of Mercia, Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward's death, possessed land worth £968, while Tostig, exiled earl at the time, had land worth £491; both may have come into possession of some of Siward's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria. Moreover, the counties that would become Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were largely omitted from the survey, while, besides being only very poorly documented, the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the Harrying of the North.|$|E

25|$|Points are scored {{based on}} the tricks won in the hand. There {{are several ways to}} count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick <b>is</b> always <b>worth</b> an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 11, tens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 10, kings <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four, queens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> three, jacks <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> two, and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of the pieces also makes a significant difference, e.g. pawns near the edges <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less than those near the centre, pawns close to promotion <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> far more, pieces controlling the centre <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> more than average, trapped pieces (such as bad bishops) <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less, etc.|$|R

25|$|By 1915, a penny {{was worth}} around one-sixth {{what it had}} <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> during the Middle Ages. British {{government}} sources suggest that prices have risen over 61-fold since 1914, so a medieval sterling silver penny might have had purchasing power equivalent to £4.50 today, and a farthing (a quarter penny) would have the value of slightly more than today's pound (about £1.125).|$|E
25|$|When the Fox Network {{gained the}} rights in 1994, the pair shifted to that network. However, Fox was {{reportedly}} losing an estimated $4.4 billion on its NFL {{contract for the}} eight-year deal it signed in 1998, {{and it had been}} trying to cut programming costs as a result. Madden's Fox contract would have <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> $8 million for 2003. Following his appearance during Super Bowl XXXVI in February 2002, Madden left Fox.|$|E
25|$|As {{measured}} by the total prize payout, the Spanish Christmas Lottery is considered the biggest lottery worldwide. In 2012, {{if all of the}} tickets had been sold, the total amount payout of prizes would have <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> €2.52 billion (70% of ticket sales).

50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the pieces depends on many parameters.

50|$|Grey nobles, {{typically}} martyrs {{that have}} public sympathy, <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> negative points so the player's {{goal is to}} avoid collecting them if possible.

Thus one guard <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> one point, two guards <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four points, three guards <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> nine points and so forth.

50|$|The Spanish Paralympic Committee had €600,000 to {{allocate}} to Spanish Paralympic medalists.

25|$|With {{their high}} copper content (97%), the {{intrinsic}} value of pre-1992 1p and 2p coins increased with {{the surge in}} metal prices of the mid-2000s, until by 2006 the coins, would, if melted down, have <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> about 50% more than their face value.

In subsequent years the price of copper fell considerably from these peaks.|$|E
