5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Losartan {{should not}} be taken <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{diabetic}} and taking aliskiren.|$|E

50|$|Liu Zhang {{would be}} succeeded {{by his son}} Liu Xi(劉喜); Liu Penzi, a {{descendant}} of Liu Zhang, would <b>be</b> crowned emperor <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> against Wang Mang.|$|R
5000|$|Many abbeys in {{southern}} Bavaria such as Benediktbeuern, Ilmmünster, Scharnitz, Schlehdorf and Tegernsee were {{founded in the}} 8th century <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> reportedly members of the Huosi.|$|R

25|$|These pronunciations {{are still}} used in synagogue ritual and {{religious}} study, in Israel and elsewhere, mostly <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not native speakers of Hebrew, though some traditionalist Israelis are bi-dialectal.|$|E
25|$|The {{thriving}} tertiary {{student population}} {{has led to}} a vibrant youth culture (students are referred to as 'Scarfies' <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not students), consisting of the previously mentioned music scene, and more recently a burgeoning boutique fashion industry. A strong visual arts community also exists in Dunedin, notably in Port Chalmers and the other settlements which dot the coast of the Otago Harbour, and also in communities such as Waitati.|$|E
5000|$|Other famous works <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not {{themselves}} victims, such as Kazimierz Moczarski who wrote Conversations with an Executioner about the stories {{he was told}} by the SS perpetrator Jürgen Stroop.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{efficacy}} of Australian public transfersin alleviating poverty, particularly chronic poverty. The larger the proportion of transfers received <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would <b>be</b> poor in their absence, the better targeted the transfers. From 2001 to 2007, 64 per cent of all public transfers <b>were</b> received <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would have <b>been</b> in chronic poverty according to their pre-transfer incomes. Another 22 per cent went to people in pre-transfer temporary poverty, whereas 14 per cent <b>were</b> received <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not poor based on their pre-transfer incomes. Family payments were less well-targeted than other public transfers...|$|R
50|$|Robert Goulet {{forgot the}} lyrics when invited {{to sing the}} anthem before one of Muhammad Ali's {{championship}} bouts in the 1960s. He was often chided for this, usually <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not {{aware that he was}} Canadian by birth.|$|R
25|$|Malaria antigen {{detection}} {{tests are}} {{a group of}} commercially available rapid diagnostic tests of the rapid antigen test type that allow quick diagnosis of malaria <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not otherwise skilled in traditional laboratory techniques for diagnosing malaria or in situations where such equipment is not available. There are currently over 20 such tests commercially available (WHO product testing 2008). The first malaria antigen suitable as target for such a test was a soluble glycolytic enzyme Glutamate dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} {{exercised}} <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> also taking protease inhibitors {{for the treatment}} of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels.|$|E
25|$|Immigration to {{the town}} and {{surrounding}} areas began in the 1970s - in particular from the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. Immigration from these countries is still going on, including <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> attracted to the relaxed pace of life in West Cork. Into the 2000s, immigration to Dunmanway took on a greater pace as the Celtic Tiger economy began to take hold. Today in Dunmanway there are Polish, Latvians and British inhabitants. In addition to these there are small groups of Czechs, Hungarians, Estonians, Germans, Austrian, Dutch and Chinese.|$|E
50|$|Besides the narration, {{there would}} be accounts, live where possible, <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> close to any {{historical}} events, recordings of radio broadcasts and newsreels, recordings from popular shows, singers and musicians, all related to the key events and happenings of the year.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} CEDU is largely {{the history of}} the {{development}} of parent-choice, private-pay residential programs. A significant number of the schools in the Emotional Growth/Therapeutic schools industry were developed or strongly influenced <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> originally inspired <b>by</b> their CEDU experience.|$|R
25|$|The Social Suicide Bomber (Raskopoulos) is an awkward-looking {{man in a}} {{burgundy}} {{blazer and}} salmon-pink shirt who is summoned <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> stuck in unpleasant social situations - such as an unattractive man flirting {{with a woman who}} doesn't want that kind of attention - by pressing a large red button. He drives away the unwanted person with banal comments or bizarre actions, like demonstrating his pterodactyl impersonation. Unfortunately, with that person gone, the Social Suicide Bomber then often turns his sights to the person who called him, creating a situation that was more awkward than the one to begin with.|$|E

25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. It acts upon gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid by G-protein coupled receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels and decreased proton pump activity at the apical surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of gastric ulceration (e.g. with diclofenac in Arthrotec).|$|E
50|$|The {{measuring}} of {{a distance}} in a hill <b>was</b> traditionally done <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> positioned along the hill, who would signal where the skier landed. Today this is instead measured by an advanced video system, which allows measurements in 0.5-meter increments.|$|R
50|$|According {{to local}} sceptics, {{most of the}} {{accidents}} <b>were</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> unfamiliar with the area driving too fast down narrow country roads with high walled sides, resulting in them either losing control or misjudging the road and running off its edges.|$|R
2500|$|... b) The Janiculum {{may have}} <b>been</b> {{inhabited}} <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not Latin but had close alliances with Rome.

25|$|The use {{of mobile}} phones <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> driving has become {{increasingly}} common, for example {{as part of their}} job, {{as in the case of}} delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.|$|E
500|$|Black Hebrew {{organizations}} have certain common characteristics. Anthropologist James E. Landing, author of Black Judaism, distinguishes the Black Hebrew movement, which {{he refers to}} as Black Judaism, from normative Judaism practiced <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> Black ("black Judaism"). Significantly, it does not depend on a documented lineage to Jewish ancestors nor does it require recognized Orthodox or Conservative conversions: ...|$|E
500|$|QED is {{organised}} by skeptics {{volunteers and}} any proceeds {{go back into}} the event or a charity. On the [...] "Token Skeptic" [...] podcast Michael Marshall said, [...] "How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> just part of that community who are doing this because we really love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK skepticism and also international skepticism".|$|E
50|$|Springstein is {{a village}} in the Canadian {{province}} of Manitoba, located in the Rural Municipality of Cartier, about 20 kilometres west of Winnipeg.

500|$|Former world {{champion}} Niki Lauda {{said that he}} did [...] "not understand this completely wrong decision", adding [...] "It's unbelievable how the best driver in yesterday's race makes no mistakes and only gets sixpoints". He called for the formation of permanent race stewards, instead of the temporary steward system currently in place. He called it [...] "the worst judgement in the history of F1", saying, [...] "It's absolutely unacceptable when three influence the championship like this". Three-time {{world champion}} Jackie Stewart said that [...] "F1 attracts the largest capital investment in sport, but it's being overseen <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not doing it full-time and we get inconsistent decisions".|$|E
500|$|The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, in vivo testing, and {{vivisection}} {{have similar}} denotations but different connotations. Literally, [...] "vivisection" [...] means the [...] "cutting up" [...] {{of a living}} animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica defines [...] "vivisection" [...] as: [...] "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals", although dictionaries {{point out that the}} broader definition is [...] "used only <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> opposed to such work". The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death. The word [...] "vivisection" [...] is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term [...] "animal experimentation".|$|E
2500|$|Braille ( [...] ; [...] ) is a tactile {{writing system}} used <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{visually}} impaired. It is traditionally written with embossed paper. Braille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports thanks to refreshable braille displays. They can write braille {{with the original}} slate and stylus or type it on a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer that prints with a braille embosser.|$|E
5000|$|Although in the 20th century, {{some people}} claim {{individual}} descent from the historical Coree, no {{revival of the}} tribe has been accomplished. Some observers believe that current attempts to claim Coree descent <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> among what anthropologists called [...] "tri-racial isolates", often of majority European and African descent.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} cases, both in Portugal and Brazil, {{in which the}} title of Dom (or Dona) was conceded to, and even bought <b>by,</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not from the royalty.
