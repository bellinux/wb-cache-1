40|$|From {{experiments}} {{the following}} conclusions could be drawn: The increase in {{diameter of the}} stems of free growing tea plants is practically proportional to time if the growing conditions of the shrubs do not change. However, tea plants in gardens producing tea leaf are planted so closely, that full development of the <b>bushes</b> is hampered. <b>Pruning</b> and plucking further influences the trees physiologically. Tea shoots have an alternation of periods in which leaves are formed, and periods in which the development of leaves completely stops. Every shoot has its own rhythm not necessarily coinciding with that of other shoots of the same bush. This rhythm is not autonomic but is determined by outward circumstances. The effect of plucking green leaves {{for the production of}} dried tea can be divided into influences of the kind of leaves plucked, the length of the plucking round and the kind of leaves left on the bush on the production, quality of the leaves, and physiological condition of the plant. So nine different influences can be distinguished. Over a long period tea bushes cannot stand such severe plucking that would prevent the plucking level rising. Consequently pruning periodically is essential to keep the tea plantation productive. Pruning of tea gardens is also necessary to keep the plants in a good physiological condition. <p/...|$|R
60|$|Elaine de Frey sat at ease--at bodily ease--at any rate--in a low wicker chair {{placed under}} the shade of a group of cedars in the heart of a stately spacious garden that had almost made up its mind to be a park. The shallow stone basin of an old fountain, on whose wide ledge a leaden-moulded otter for ever preyed on a leaden salmon, filled a {{conspicuous}} place in the immediate foreground. Around its rim ran an inscription in Latin, warning mortal man that time flows as swiftly as water and exhorting him {{to make the most of}} his hours; after which piece of Jacobean moralising it set itself shamelessly to beguile all who might pass that way into an abandonment of contemplative repose. On all sides of it a stretch of smooth turf spread away, broken up here and there by groups of dwarfish chestnut and mulberry trees, whose leaves and branches cast a laced pattern of shade beneath them. On one side the lawn sloped gently down to a small lake, whereon floated a quartette of swans, their movements suggestive of a certain mournful listlessness, as though a weary dignity of caste held them back from the joyous bustling life of the lesser waterfowl. Elaine liked to imagine that they re-embodied the souls of unhappy boys who had been forced by family interests to become high ecclesiastical dignitaries and had grown prematurely Right Reverend. A low stone balustrade fenced part of the shore of the lake, making a miniature terrace above its level, and here roses grew in a rich multitude. Other rose <b>bushes,</b> carefully <b>pruned</b> and tended, formed little oases of colour and perfume amid the restful green of the sward, and in the distance the eye caught the variegated blaze of a many-hued hedge of rhododendron. With these favoured exceptions flowers were hard to find in this well-ordered garden; the misguided tyranny of staring geranium beds and beflowered archways leading to nowhere, so dear to the suburban gardener, found no expression here. Magnificent Amherst pheasants, whose plumage challenged and almost shamed the peacock on his own ground, stepped to and fro over the emerald turf with the assured self-conscious pride of reigning sultans. It was a garden where summer seemed a part-proprietor rather than a hurried visitor.|$|R
40|$|The study {{covered the}} period August 1971 to February 1975 and was {{conducted}} in three blackcurrant plots. One plot comprised mature <b>bushes</b> that were <b>pruned</b> but not sprayed {{during the course of}} the study; the other two plots were subject to full normal managerial practices including spraying. Information on various aspects of the biology was revealed and this clarified some of the areas about which little was known previously especially for the Southern Hemisphere. Fecundity is 100 eggs per female, fertility in the field is at least 97 % and predation of eggs is always less than 5 %. There are six larval instars. Fungi of the genera Beauveria and Cordyceps cause up to 10 % mortality of the larvae. This is the first record of the latter genus infecting S. tipuliformis. A sampling plan was developed to enable estimates of the population of S. tipuliformis at various stages to be obtained. This gave information on the distribution of stages of the life cycle within the canes according to the age of the wood. These samples also permitted the construction of life tables for three generations of S. tipuliformis in one plot and one generation in the others. Replication both in space and time was therefore achieved and the results were further replicated by considering each plot as nine separate blocks. The dispersion of the egg and larval stages was tested and found to fit the negative binomial model. A common k, kc, was calculated for the egg stage and the larval c stage. Though not vital to this present study various transformations of the raw data were investigated to see which were most appropriate in order to stabilise the variance for analyses in which such suitability is vital. The logarithmic transformation based on the k parameter of the k negative model [log (x + k/ 2)) was the most successful. The mortality of the eggs was quite low but a significant proportion of the emerging larvae fail to colonise the pith of a cane. This mortality is density dependent. Other mortalities including winter pruning are density independent or random. The key stage of the life cycle revealed by the life tables is the adult survival. This survival and the consequent population trend index determined from the number of eggs laid was found to be affected by the prevailing weather during the flight period especially during the last week of November and the first two weeks of December...|$|R

Rapid {{advances}} are currently being made in the field of coffee research though certain branches, notably physiology and agronomic practices, are lagging behind. However, the application of research in the field in Africa is often hampered by a lack of political determination to modernize traditional production systems. In recent years agronomic research has made considerable progress and coffee has benefited from this, though there is still a long way to go in some areas. The most spectacular advances have been seen in the use of genetics to improve planting material. The campaign against disease and pests is constantly gaining ground, reinforced by recent knowledge of the insects themselves. But at the same time work on physiology and agronomic practice is insufficient, if not totally non-existent. It seems to me totally unjustifiable, that while genetics is revolutionizing coffee production, we still use the same methods of field trials which have been used for a century and a half in order to find the most appropriate application rates for NPK fertilizer. Likewise, there has been little technological progress in coffee processing (wet or dry methods). However, there have been technical improvements in reprocessing, mainly by the use of electronic grading machines. But I find it strange that there has been such a dearth of research on the use and value-enhancement of the by-products of coffee processing. It has to be said that the effect of research on development is most disappointing. What has happened in Côte d`Ivoire exemplifies this: at the highest level there is a resistance to anything which can be seen as an attack on so-called traditional methods, and this has proved an insurmountable and immovable barrier to applying the results of research. How can we expect any results when selected seedlings are interplanted haphazardly with foods crops in a disorganized field where the tending is insufficient. It is well known that in conditions like these any fertilizer application will be useless. Coffee <b>bushes</b> need <b>pruning,</b> they don't like too much shade and if they don't get the right conditions they will grow out of control and lose their lower and middle branches. Official yield figures are in the order of 1 50 - 200 kg of coffee per hectare, but potentially a field station can produce ten times that amount, and perhaps even more on industrial-scale plantations. Harvesting, preparation and processing are even more problematic. For at least ten years now Robusta beans have been picked while they are still unripe in order to avoid the ripe fruits being stolen from the bushes, but this is a practice which goes against repeated warnings from scientists who have scientifically registered a loss of quality (reduced aroma) and taste when this is done. The growers dry the berries by laying them out in the sun, preferably on racks but usually on hard-packed ground, and rarely on cement strips. The coffee is often subjected to a regime of alternating sun and rain, which does not do it any good at all. Collection for the factories is so poorly organized that growers are often forced to keep the crop for long periods whereas they have no proper storage facilities. Finally they arrive at the dehusking plant. When a factory was built at Timbroko in Côte d'lvoire, research scientists, with the agreement of the management, installed five small computerized sampling units, with the objective of grading the growers according to the quality of coffee they delivered. These units have never worked, and have now been dismantled because, in the absence of a quality-based pricing policy, there was no point in grading the deliveries. We all know only too well what happens: large quantities of trash which is not legally exportable are bought cheap on the black-market. Research is pointless when the situation is so hopeless and the product is debased in this way, and not that relevant authorities have not been warned time and time again. It would be unreasonable to expect Robusta producing West African farmers to improve their production systems if they are not supported by a policy which recognizes the value and potential of high-quality coffees. There is no point in imposing the stringent controls applied to Arabica beans for Robusta, which is sought after for its aroma and its neutral, non-bitter taste. However, simpler regulations could be adopted. It is important that, if Robusta is ever to be valued at its worth, substandard batches and waste are strictly prohibited from export, and destroyed. I have written this because I am committed to African coffee-growing, and to safeguarding and improving the future of the small-scale growers.

40|$|Organic matter transformations and {{nutrient}} cycling in soils {{depend on the}} activity of soil organisms. Deterioration of soil fertility lowers the biological activity and results in lower productivity. In the absence of adequate organic matter, the processes of conversion of nutrients to plant-available forms and their retention are very low. To enhance the activity of soil organisms especially that of beneficial microbial populations, the addition of high quality organic amendments is very important. Even though {{there are plenty of}} organic materials available in tea lands, there is inadequate information on their suitability and influence on the biological properties of soils. The present research has attempted {{to determine the extent to}} which the microbial activity and productivity of tea soils in Australia and Sri Lanka can be manipulated by use of readily available soil amendments. Trials were conducted using grass and leguminous mulching materials with different C/N ratios, in combination with two pH amendments (dolomite and ‘MinplusTM’ – a finely ground volcanic rock dust - both applied at rates of 2500 kg ha- 1 only for the pot trials and 1000 kg ha- 1 for the other trials) and an inoculum of biologically active rain forest soil. The nursery stage of tea (Camellia sinensis) propagation was studied in a shadehouse at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia, and young tea (unpruned, 1 year after planting) and mature tea (<b>pruned</b> <b>bushes,</b> 5 years since planting) were studied in a field in Sri Lanka. In the nursery trial, mulching materials consisting of finely chopped Brachiaria decumbens (a grass), Calliandra calothyrsus (a legume), and tea prunings were applied at a rate of 35 tonnes fresh weight ha- 1 year- 1 to pots with or without tea seedlings. The grass mulch with Minplus improved soil organic carbon, CEC, soil pH, microbial biomass carbon, plant available phosphorus, and total nitrogen contents of the soil and enhanced the growth of plants when compared to the effects of Calliandra legume and tea mulch. All the combinations of mulches with dolomite reduced plant growth even though they enhanced some soil properties. Application of grass and legume mulches increased the beneficial population of gram positive bacteria, fungi, and mycorrhiza. Grass mulch also improved the growth of tea as measured by shoot weight and total biomass. The addition of a rainforest inoculum to the soils of the nursery tea plants increased the soil microbial biomass carbon and growth of tea plants even in the absence of any mulch. The field trials in Sri Lanka demonstrated the extent of the changes induced by mulches and soil pH modifiers in soil microbial properties, including the abundances of functional groups of microbes (bacteria, fungi, mycorrhizae), soil microbial biomass carbon, and microbial respiration. In addition organic carbon, soil pH, nitrogen and mulch decomposition rate were measured. The mulching materials tested were: refuse tea (25 tonnes ha- 1 year- 1), Mana grass (Cymbopogon confertiflora), and branches of Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma), a leguminous tree (35 tonnes fresh weight ha- 1 year- 1). In addition to these treatments, lemon grass (Cymbopogan nardus) 20, 000 plants ha- 1 as live mulch in young tea and a Trichoderma fungal culture in the mature tea were used. For young tea and mature tea, Mana and Dadap were applied four times and Refuse tea three times per study period and the lemon grass was planted at the start of the trial on a 15 x 15 cm spacing in the young tea; Trichoderma was applied once to the mature tea trial at a rate of 500 g of spore culture / plant.
