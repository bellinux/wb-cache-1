25|$|Fries tend to {{be served}} {{with a variety of}} accompaniments, such as salt and vinegar (malt, balsamic or white), pepper, Cajun seasoning, grated cheese, melted cheese, mushy peas, heated curry sauce, curry ketchup (mildly spiced mix of the former), hot sauce, relish, mustard, mayonnaise, <b>bearnaise</b> <b>sauce,</b> tartar sauce, chili, tzatziki, feta cheese, garlic sauce, fry sauce, butter, sour cream, ranch dressing, {{barbecue}} sauce, gravy, honey, aioli, brown sauce, ketchup, lemon juice, piccalilli, pickled cucumber, pickled gherkins, pickled onions or pickled eggs.|$|E
25|$|As a {{means to}} balance the fat white wine is {{involved}} in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, <b>béarnaise</b> <b>sauce,</b> marinara sauce, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a role that white wine can be used in; made with a sweet white wine and giving a sour-sweet or sweet-salt sauce. In cheese fondue the liveliness of dry white wine is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, sauces {{had been}} {{classified}} into four distinct categories by Chef Marie-Antoine Carême. One of Carême's family of sauces was allemande, {{which was a}} stock-based sauce using egg and lemon juice. Auguste Escoffier updated that list in the early 20th century by replacing allemande with Hollandaise sauce {{as part of his}} family of five mother sauces of Haute cuisine. While many believe that a true Hollandaise sauce should only contain the basic ingredients of eggs, butter and lemon, Prosper Montagne suggested using either a white wine or vinegar reduction, similar to a <b>Béarnaise</b> <b>sauce,</b> to help improve the taste.|$|E
2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and <b>béarnaise</b> <b>sauces</b> are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and <b>béarnaise</b> <b>sauces</b> are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|R
2500|$|Sauce Choron or <b>Sauce</b> <b>Béarnaise</b> Tomatée is a {{variation}} of béarnaise without tarragon or chervil, plus added tomato purée. [...] It is named after Alexandre Étienne Choron.|$|R
50|$|As {{chef de cuisine}} of {{the celebrated}} {{restaurant}} Voisin on the rue Saint Honoré, Choron {{is best known for}} his invention of Choron <b>sauce,</b> a <b>sauce</b> <b>béarnaise</b> enriched with tomato concentrate before reduction.|$|R
2500|$|Friteries {{and other}} fast food establishments tend {{to offer a}} number of {{different}} sauces for the fries and meats. In addition to ketchup and mayonnaise, popular options include: aioli, sauce andalouse, sauce Americaine, Bicky Dressing (Gele Bicky-sauce), curry mayonnaise, mammoet-sauce, peanut sauce, samurai-sauce, sauce [...] "Pickles", pepper-sauce, tartar sauce, zigeuner sauce, and À la zingara. These sauces are generally also available in supermarkets. In addition to this, hot sauces are sometimes offered by friteries, including hollandaise sauce, sauce provençale, <b>Béarnaise</b> <b>sauce,</b> or a splash of carbonade flamande stew from a constantly simmering pot, in the spirit of British chips and gravy.|$|E
2500|$|Like Hollandaise sauce, {{there are}} several methods for the {{preparation}} of <b>Béarnaise</b> <b>sauce.</b> The most common preparation is a bain-marie method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidulate the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. [...] Others are similar. [...] Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (sans lemon juice). Joy of Cooking describes a blender preparation with the same ingredients. [...] A faux Béarnaise can be produced by adding capers and tarragon to a Hollandaise.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Béarnaise</b> <b>sauce</b> ( [...] ; [...] ) is a sauce made of {{clarified}} butter emulsified in egg yolks and {{white wine vinegar}} and flavored with herbs. [...] It {{is considered to be}} a [...] "child" [...] of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in the French haute cuisine repertoire. The difference is only in the flavoring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorns, gherkin and tarragon in a reduction of vinegar and wine, while Hollandaise is more stripped down, using a reduction of lemon juice or white wine and peppercorns. (One means of preparing Béarnaise, see below, is to start with Hollandaise and add the other ingredients.) Its name is related to the province of Béarn, France.|$|E
5000|$|... "Fondue vigneronne" [...] or [...] "Fondue Bacchus" [...] is like fondue bourguignonne, {{with wine}} rather than oil. Red wine fondue {{consists}} {{of red wine}} boiled, and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, onions and herbs; the white wine version is spiced with cinnamon, chilis, coriander, white pepper and enriched with chicken broth. The guests then dip meat, fish or vegetables in the caquelon and top them with <b>bearnaise,</b> tartare <b>sauce</b> or simply French mustard.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{derivative}} is <b>Sauce</b> <b>Béarnaise.</b> [...] It {{can be produced}} by replacing the acidifying agent (vinegar reduction or lemon juice) in a preparation with a strained reduction of vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and (if to taste) crushed peppercorns. Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a standard hollandaise. Béarnaise and its children are often used on steak or other [...] "assertive" [...] grilled meats and fish.|$|R
25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and <b>Béarnaise.</b> For hollandaise <b>sauce,</b> {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are emulsified. Unlike custard, the egg does not coagulate. An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water and lemon juice once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining with the oil and water, holding it together.|$|R
60|$|The midday {{meal was}} excellent. There was a ripe melon, a {{fish from the}} river in a memorable <b>Bearnaise</b> <b>sauce,</b> a fat fowl in a fricassee, and a dish of asparagus, {{followed}} by some fruit. The Doctor drank half a bottle plus one glass, the wife half a bottle minus the same quantity, which was a marital privilege, of an excellent Cote-Rotie, seven years old. Then the coffee was brought, and a flask of Chartreuse for madame, for the Doctor despised and distrusted such decoctions; and then Aline left the wedded pair to the pleasures of memory and digestion.|$|E

50|$|Pommes soufflées are {{a variety}} of French fried potato. Slices of potato are fried twice, once at 150 °C (300 °F) and a second time after being cooled, at 190 °C (375 °F). The potato slices puff up into little {{balloons}} during the second frying and turn golden brown. Pommes soufflées were, according to a famous legend, discovered by chance on 24 August 1837, when Queen Marie-Amélie and other notables were delayed in their arrival for a meal at the Pavillon Henri IV in Yvelines after inaugurating the first passenger steam-powered railway in France. The chef Collinet, reputedly also the inventor of <b>sauce</b> <b>béarnaise,</b> removed the already frying potatoes from the oil and observed them expand when, after the royal party had arrived, they were returned to the oil. This story has been disputed on a number of grounds.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{with the}} {{availability}} of deep frozen goods, the concept of fast food arrived together {{with an interest in}} Mediterranean dishes as Danes travelled more widely. By the 1990s, ingredients were being imported from the south while new products were farmed at home, providing a basis for a developing interest in gourmet dishes. Much of the inspiration came from France, as Danish chefs went on television explaining how to prepare dishes such as canard à l'orange or authentic <b>sauce</b> <b>Béarnaise.</b> A younger generation of chefs soon started to travel abroad themselves, learning how to adapt the expertise of French and Spanish chefs to the use of local ingredients as a basis for creating beautifully presented, finely flavoured Nordic dishes. As a result, in recent years Danish chefs have helped to put Denmark on the world gastronomic map, with several Michelin-starred restaurants in Copenhagen and the provinces.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNineteen {{samples of}} food in glass jars with twist {{closures}} were collected by the national food inspectors at Danish food producers and a few importers, focusing on fatty food, such as vegetables in oil, herring in dressing or pickle, soft spreadable cheese, cream, dressings, peanut butter, sauces and infant food. The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. ESBO and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in 5 of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg/kg. The highest levels (91 – 100 mg/kg) were in oily foods like garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i. e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6 to 173 mg/kg. The highest concentrations (99 – 173 mg/kg) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products like <b>sauce</b> <b>béarnaise</b> and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared to the legal limit of 60 mg/kg. The results ranged from 76 to 519 mg/kg {{and as a consequence}} the products were withdrawn from the market...|$|R
