50|$|<b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> is used {{to perform}} {{processes}} involving metals, for example, microbial mining, oil recovery, bioleaching, water-treatment and others. <b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> is mainly used to recover certain metals from sulfide ores. It is usually utilized when conventional mining procedures are too expensive or ineffective in recovering a metal such as copper, gold, lead, nickel and zinc.|$|E
50|$|Both {{of these}} species {{are used in the}} <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> {{industry}} in methods called bioleaching and biomining, whereby metals are extracted from their ores through bacterial oxidation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> is an {{emerging}} trend in biomining in which commercial mining plants operate continuously stirred tank reactor (STR) and the airlift reactor (ALR) or pneumatic reactor (PR) of the Pachuca type {{to extract the}} low concentration mineral resources efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Bioleaching is the {{extraction}} of metals from their ores {{through the use of}} living organisms. This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide. Bioleaching is one of several applications within <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> and several methods are used to recover copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt.|$|E
50|$|Gold is {{frequently}} {{found in nature}} associated with minerals containing arsenic and pyrite. In the microbial leaching process A. ferrooxidans is able to solubilize the arsenopyrite minerals, {{and in the process}} releases an atom of gold: 2FeAsSAu + 7O2 + 2H2O + H2SO4 → Fe(SO4)3 + 2H3AsO4 + Au. <b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> is an emerging trend in biomining in which commercial mining plants operate continuously stirred bioreactors to efficiently separate and mine these metals from water systems.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{bacteria}} use metal ions {{as their}} energy source. They convert (or chemically reduce) the dissolved metal ions from one electrical state to another. This reduction releases {{energy for the}} bacteria's use, and, as a side product, serves to concentrate the metals into what ultimately become ore deposits. <b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> or in situ mining is where low-grade ores may be attacked by well-studied microbial processes under controlled conditions to extract metals. Certain iron, copper, uranium and even gold ores {{are thought to have}} formed as the result of microbe action.|$|E
50|$|Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans {{has emerged}} as an {{economically}} significant bacterium {{in the field of}} <b>biohydrometallurgy,</b> in the leaching of sulfide ores since its discovery in 1950 by Colmer, Temple and Hinkle. The discovery of A. ferrooxidans {{led to the development of}} “biohydrometallurgy”, which deals with all aspects of microbial mediated extraction of metals from minerals or solid wastes and acid mine drainage. A. ferrooxidans has been proven as a potent leaching organism, for dissolution of metals from low-grade sulfide ores. Recently, the attention has been focused upon the treatment of mineral concentrates, as well as complex sulfide ores using batch or continuous-flow reactors.|$|E
50|$|The {{provision}} of $7.2 {{million in grants}} from the NSF during {{the first five years}} enabled the expansion of center research into new areas, notably bioremediation and <b>biohydrometallurgy.</b> The center's industrial focus expanded from biofilm control and mitigation to include positive use of biofilm processes to break up soil and water contaminants as well as extracting minerals from low-grade ores. Center projects were designed to span scales of inquiry from fundamental bench-scale to applied field-scale experiments. These projects enabled the continued development of microsensors to measure gradients of gases and pH within biofilm communities, microscopy to elucidate physiological activity of community organisms and modeling to predict biofilm behavior.|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} {{recognized}} biomining system {{was published in}} 1951 when Kenneth Temple Ph.D. discovered that Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans thrives in iron, copper and magnesium rich environments. In Temple's experiment, A. ferrooxidans was was inoculated into media containing between 2,000 and 26,000 ppm ferrous iron. He discovered that the bacteria grew faster and were more motile in high iron concentrations. The byproducts of the bacterial growth caused the media to turn very acidic, in which the microorganisms still thrived. Kenneth Temples experiment proved that microorganisms have mechanisms for sensing and taking up metals {{for use in the}} cell. This discovery lead to the development of complex modern biomining systems. Biomining is the use of microorganisms to leach metals from their growth medium. These systems can be used for bioremediation, <b>biohydrometallurgy,</b> or even extracting metals from ores for commercial use. It was later discovered that some fungi also leach metals from their environment. It has been shown that some microorganisms have a mechanism for taking up radioactive metals such as uranium and thorium.|$|E

My {{perceptions}} of the biohydrometallurgical field span four decades and stem from being a professional microbiologist conducting academic research and research for process development and applications. My experiences have given me an appreciation for knowledge gained through fundamental research and the transfer of this knowledge to development of commercial scale applications of microbial processes. The symposia series for international activities in <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> {{has been a major}} factor in advancing knowledge and applications for microbial bioleach systems. The first international <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> meeting was held in Braunschweig, Germany in 1977. This was the predecessor for the International <b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> Symposia. As evident from the Symposia, advances in development and applications of <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> technologies follow an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary progression from demonstration of knowledge at the laboratory scale to engineering commercial plants...|$|E
40|$|The most {{exciting}} advances in <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> are {{occurring in the}} field of microbiology. The two main technologies employed in <b>biohydrometallurgy,</b> agitated tanks for the processing of refractory concentrates and heaps and dumps for the processing of low-grade ores, are technologically sound and widely practised at commercial scale, but their development began at a time when very little was known of the microorganisms that assisted metals extraction from sulfide ores. During and subsequent to those developments {{it has been shown that}} microbial communities in metals extraction are more diverse than originally thought, and extremely robust and adaptable to different and variable environments. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics, exploiting hugely increased computing power and speed, have made it possible to describe not only which microorganisms are present in bioleaching systems, but also what physiological functions are being exercised. The body of knowledge being acquired through the application of molecular biology methods will be used increasingly to monitor microbial behaviour, optimise conditions for more appropriate microbiological activity and/or infer the “microbiological health” of bioreactors (tanks and heaps) ...|$|E

Bioleaching of the mineral {{may be used}} as pretreatment. Further mineral bioleaching may be used to liberate base metals such as copper from refractory sulphidic ores. The microorganisms used in the high intensity tank-based commercial <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> processes are mainly mesophiles, although moderate thermophiles are currently used at Youanmi Mine in Australia (Brierley, 1997). Extreme thermophiles have been found to exhibit enhanced oxidation kinetics in terms of rate of reaction and extent of solubilisation (Duarte et al, 1993; Norris and Barr, 1988; Konishi et al., 1995). However, these thermophiles appear to be sensitive to hydrodynamic conditions (Clark and Norris, 1996) and the presence of solids (Le Roux and Wakerley, 1988; Nemati and Harrison, 2000). An understanding of this sensitivity would be useful in developing systems to utilise extreme thermophiles in commercial <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> processes. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of the solid particulate phase on the bioleaching performance of the extreme thermophile Sulfolobus metallicus.

40|$|This thesis explores three {{routes to}} {{alleviating}} the economic barriers to proton exchange membrane fuel cells through reducing, recycling and removing platinum group metals (PGMs). The reduction of PGM content is explored using electrochemistry {{to assess the}} novel materials produced when combining fullerene based compounds with electron beam lithography. This technique yields the potential to precisely control the distance between platinum (or other metal) atoms embedded within carbon materials. It is shown that the material alters the onset potential of proton reduction compared to glassy carbon and the methodology for study is developed. The recycling of PGMs is demonstrated by testing the electrochemical behaviour and particle structure of deposited palladium within biomass produced through <b>biohydrometallurgy.</b> Electron microscopy and electrochemistry is used to investigate the <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> process and how the substrate, leachate and reducing agent effect both the particles produced and the electrochemistry observed. Concluding that the un-processed materials may function as future electrocatalysts without further processing steps.

NMP 2 -CT- 2005 - 500329). It {{is dedicated to the}} evaluation of <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> to improve the exploitation of the European non-ferrous metal resources in a sustainable way. At the end of 2007, the Consortium of BioMinE comprised 37 partners from industry (13 including 6 Small or Medium Enterprises), research organisations (8), universities (15), and government (1). The participants are from 13 EU member states and from Serbia and South Africa (INCO Countries). For more details see [URL] The three main kinds of resources considered for bioleaching studies are: * - Copper polymetallics (concentrates and tailings), * - Zinc polymetallics (zinc and zinc polymetallic concentrates) * - Secondary wastes (tailings, rock and metallurgical wastes, etc.) For each of these resources, amenability studies of application of bioleaching technologies by various approaches have been undertaken or still ongoing. Further processing assessment will be conducted up to the demonstration scale. Technological improvements have been made to apply bioleaching {{in the context of the}} European resources in terms of complexity and sustainability requirements. The relevant fundamental studies covering bio-prospecting, molecular ecology, biochemistry, and genetics areas aimed at improving the understanding and the control of the selected technologies have given original results. Much progress has also been obtained in the use of the microbial sulfate-reducing process to polish effluents and to recover metals from leachates containing low concentrations of metals. The finding of micro-organisms thriving at low and high temperature, respectively 8 and 65 °C, leads to an extension of the application range of the process. It has been also observed that this process could be pushed down to pH 4. 5 and 4 creating opportunities of selective metal recovery as metal sulphides. It has also been demonstrated that sulphate can be removed at high concentrations, as well as arsenic or selenium. The next step in this work is pilot testing. This will allow to determine scale-up criteria and to assess the residual metal concentration under actual conditions. The pilot-scale demonstration operations, as well as the techno-economic and comparative sustainability assessments will be achieved during 2008, the last year of the project. The prototypes of the learning objects for training about <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> accessible by internet have been elaborated. A public output of this work is accessible at [URL] The basic knowledge thus delivered is aimed at disseminating the understanding of the origins and use of <b>biohydrometallurgy.</b> Contacts with mining operators in Europe have been taken and collaboration schemes have been established in various ways according to the respective contexts. When a high potential of technical involvement could be foreseen, a direct participation of the mining operators in the project was favoured, this led to integrate KGHM (Pol), Boliden (Sw) and Copper Institute of Bor (Serbia) into the consortium of partners.

3000|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to treat lead-free solders to recover their valuable metals. The existing processes for recycling spent solders include pyrometallurgy (Lee et al. 2007), hydrometallurgy (Yoo et al. 2012), and <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> (Hocheng et al. 2014). For pyrometallurgical processes, high energy consumption is unavoidable. Also, it emits toxic gases. The biohydrometallurgical processes have been gradually replacing the hydrometallurgical ones due to their higher efficiency, lower costs, and fewer industrial requirements (Li et al. 2010; Hocheng et al. 2014). But the treatment period for biohydrometallurgical process is long. Hydrometallurgy is a well-established process for the separation and recovery of metal from industrial wastes. Using hydrometallurgical processes, a complete recovery of metals with high purity is possible. It requires low energy (Huang et al. 2009). The leaching of solders has been investigated using sodium hydroxide and sodium persulfate (Rhee et al. 1994), organic solvents (Takahashi et al. 2009), and nitric acid (HNO 3) (Yoo et al. 2012) as leaching agents.

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have focused on DNA and RNA extraction, only a few have focused on the {{simultaneous}} extraction of high quality DNA and RNA from environmental samples, especially for acidic habitat samples. In this study, a widely used DNA extraction method (Zhou, J. Z., M. A. Bruns, and J. M. Tiedje 1996) was optimised for the simultaneous extraction of crude nucleic acid (including DNA and RNA), and a LiCl salt-based step-by-step precipitation method was also optimised for the separation of DNA and RNA. The results showed that nucleic acid extraction buffer (pH 7. 0) containing piperazine- 1, 4 -bis(2 -ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) salt could effectively extract crude nucleic acid from acidic habitat samples, and the optimised LiCl salt-based step-by-step precipitation method could separate the nucleic acid into high quality DNA and RNA. The results also showed that the obtained DNA and RNA could be used for downstream molecular analysis. This study developed a useful method for the simultaneous extraction and separation of DNA and RNA from acidic habitat samples.

40|$|The {{current cost}} and finite nature of Platinum Group Metals (PGM) is {{a barrier to}} the {{successful}} commercialisation of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Successful mass production of fuel cell components combined with the recovery of PGMs from waste, more efficient PGM use or the replacement of PGMs catalyst is necessary to reduce costs per unit. Current hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy techniques do not provide a ‘clean’ or economically viable solution to PGM recovery when compared to bio-hydrometallurgy. Bio-catalysts can be manufactured by coupling the oxidation of hydrogen to the reduction of soluble metallic species [e. g. Pd(II), Pt(IV) ] via Hydrogenase enzymes. The work presented in this thesis aims to evaluate the incorporation of <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> in producing Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) for PEM Fuel cell applications. The biomineralisation and subsequent catalytic activity of spin coated engineered biofilms is investigated, as {{is the use of}} planktonic cell generated bio-catalysts in traditional GDE fabrication via screen printing. Although biofilms were found to produce layers containing active PGM particles, the films proved to be nonconductive. As such, it was concluded that although biofilms provide huge potential in the recovery and subsequent use of PGM catalysts, at present, they are unsuitable for Fuel Cell use...|$|E
40|$|<b>Biohydrometallurgy,</b> an {{interdisciplinary}} field involving geomicrobiology, microbial ecology, microbial biochemistry, and hydrometallurgy, is a promising novel technology for recovering valuable minerals from traditionally difficult-to-process ores. In this study, {{the possibility to}} treat nickel laterites biohydrometallurgically using chemolithotrophic microorganisms was investigated. Nickel laterite contains metal values but is not capable of participating in the primary chemolithotrophic bacterial oxidation because it contains neither ferrous iron nor substantial amount of reduced sulphur. Its metal value can, however, be recovered by allowing the primary oxidation of pyrite, or similar iron/sulphur minerals to provide sulphuric acid solutions, which solubilise the metal content. In order to have an insight {{on the use of}} chemolithotrophic bacteria in this process, it was important to first understand the role and effects of sulphuric acid. Its effect was compared to citric acid and ferric sulphate. Results showed that sulphuric acid performed better, in terms of nickel recovery, than citric acid or ferric sulphate of the same initial concentration. However, citric acid performed better at the same initial pH. A synergic effect was observed in a mixture of sulphuric and citric acids. In the bacterial leaching test works, sulphur substrate exhibited better effects in terms of acidification and nickel recovery than pyrite substrate.

40|$|This review {{has as its}} {{underlying}} premise the need to become proficient in delivering a suite of element or metal products from polymetallic ores to avoid the predicted exhaustion of key metals in demand in technological societies. Many technologies, proven or still to be developed, will assist in meeting {{the demands of the}} next generation for trace and rare metals, potentially including the broader application of <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> for the extraction of multiple metals from low-grade and complex ores. Developed biotechnologies that could be applied are briefly reviewed and some of the difficulties to be overcome highlighted. Examples of the bioleaching of polymetallic mineral resources using different combinations of those technologies are described for polymetallic sulfide concentrates, low-grade sulfide and oxidised ores. Three areas for further research are: (i) the development of sophisticated continuous vat bioreactors with additional controls; (ii) in situ and in stope bioleaching and the need to solve problems associated with microbial activity in that scenario; and (iii) the exploitation of sulfur-oxidising microorganisms that, under specific anaerobic leaching conditions, reduce and solubilise refractory iron(III) or manganese(IV) compounds containing multiple elements. Finally, with the successful applications of stirred tank bioleaching to a polymetallic tailings dump and heap bioleaching to a polymetallic black schist ore, {{there is no reason why}} those proven technologies should not be more widely applied...|$|E
40|$|Spent {{alkaline}} and zinc-carbon batteries {{were subjected}} to a <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> process, in order to recover manganese and mixed manganese zinc oxides. Two solids were synthesized, one of them prepared by reaction of MnSO 4 and KMnO 4 (MnOx) and the other obtained by chemical precipitation with NaOH (ZnMnO). The characterization by XRD, TPR, FTIR and XPS revealed the presence of Mn 3 + and Mn 4 + cations in both samples, {{and the presence of}} ZnO and Mn-Zn spinels in ZnMnO. The samples were evaluated in the oxidation reaction of ethanol and toluene. The results in the flow reactor showed that ethanol conversion on both catalysts, MnOx and ZnMnO, is rather similar, but toluene conversion is markedly higher on MnOx, due to a greater Mn/Zn ratio and to the absence of a crystallized ZnO phase. The FTIR study demonstrated that ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde at low temperature, and to CO 2 and CO at 400 °C. Traces of CH 4 in the gas phase are also detected at high temperature. The formation of ethoxy and acetate groups is observed at the catalyst surface. With respect to toluene oxidation, CO 2 is detected at 300 °C and when the temperature is increased, CO is also observed in the gas phase. The results showed that: (i) the alkaline and Zn-carbon batteries can be recycled as catalysts and (ii) the solids can be used in the catalytic process for VOCs control...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{application}} of biological techniques in the sulfide minerals leaching to obtain valuable metals is an important technological advance, the relatively slow kinetics of the bio-oxidation still limits its commercial application, however, the research for constant improvement under optimal conditions continues. Microorganisms are capable of performing their role with great efficiency under optimal conditions. Bioreactor designing seeks to maintain certain environmental conditions as to favour efficient microbial growth such pH, temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide dissolution, stirring speed, and others. In an aerobic process such as bioleaching the optimum oxygen transference {{is extremely difficult to}} achieve, because oxygen scarcely dissolves in water. Although the oxygen transference usually is facilitated by agitation, which is also required to mix the nutrients and maintain homogeneous solution, this agitation should be limited because of the high power consumption, and the damage the microorganisms subjet to excessive shear may undergo. In order to improve biooxidation kinetics, we designed a new bioreactor, which combines elements of the stirred tank and the airlift reactor, and introduces innovative elements, to their effective use in <b>biohydrometallurgy.</b> The new bio-reactor called RELBA was designed and build-up in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) laboratories. It controls dissolved O 2 among other parameters and it prevents shear. Bioleaching tests of the ore, containing 0. 135 % Cu and 3. 07 % Fe, were performed in the orbital incubator and in the RELBA bio-reactor at 35 o C using a mixed strain of Acidithiobacillus caldus, Acidihiobacillus thiooxidans and Leptospirillum ferriphilum.

40|$|Abstract. Indirect {{bioleaching}} is a biotechnology {{that presents}} important advantages when apply to bioprocessing of zinc and zinc polymetallic concentrates {{such as high}} metals recovery, fast kinetic of 4 - 5 hours to get full metals extraction, sulphur oxidation to elemental sulphur (avoiding sulphuric acid generation, while pyrite mineral remains untouched), and use of conventional reactors (aeration is not required) and normal process equipments. On the other hand, the development of high-efficiency bioreactors for ferrous iron bio-oxidation based on flooded fixed-bed model has opened the way {{to succeed in the}} potential commercial application of this innovative bio-hydrometallurgical technology, being especially attractive to benefit zinc and lead bulk or polymetallic concentrates containing other valuable metals like silver. In addition, a great variety of concentrates is feasible to be processed, e. g. in the range of 15 % to 60 % Zn and Pb metals content. That aim, within European Biomine project, {{for the first time in}} <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> field, indirect bioleaching technology applied on Zn/Pb polymetallic concentrates has been demonstrated in continuous in an integrated pilot plant at Tecnicas Reunidas ’ (TR) R&D Centre in Madrid (Spain) producing electrolytic SHG zinc plates. Overall zinc recovery in the integrated pilot facility after more than 300 operating hours has been above 95 % thanks to the ability and good performance of the ZincexTM technology (solvent extraction and electrowinning), in which obtaining of SHG electrolytic zinc is fully guaranteed with high current efficiency (above 93 %) and good deposit morphology.

40|$|<b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> has {{intrigued}} {{many researchers}} {{over the last}} decades, but few processes under controlled plant conditions have resulted. There are several reasons for this, but the important ones are the design limitations on both mass (02) and heat transfer in agitated bioreactors. The Delft Inclined Plate (DIP) bioreactor is being developed to overcome the current limitations of tank reactors used for bacterial oxidation of sulphide minerals in suspension, namely ine~cient power usage (kg 02 ~kWh) {{and the presence of}} high shear zones, or low rates of oxygen transfer per volume of reactor (kg 02 /m 3 /h). The principle of operation of the DIP bioreactor is exceedingly simple and based on the proven floating aerator, used in water and sewage treatments. The latter gives circular surface patterns, each circle created by an individually driven impeller. By "breaking " the circle and using inclined plates instead, the same e~cient oxygen transfer is obtained on a linear pattern. The Slurry is lifted only 6 - 8 feet by one large slurry pumping device, for which the Archimedes screw is recommemted. This device is used extensively in the Netherlands for low head pumping of silty water and is characterized by high e~ciency and low shear forces. The elevated slurry continuously falls back into the tank via parallel inclined plates as flat, thin sheets, creating many contact lines instead of a few circles and a much higher 0 2 transfer. Scale up should be linear, at least in one horizontaldirection. A 4 m 3 pilot model was designed and installed at the Faculty of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, Delft University of Technology. The unit has been tested with water and has reached 0. 25 kg 02 /m 3 /h at approx. 1 kg 02 ~kWh. Only pumping limitations have prevented reaching higher ates. The optimum geometric configuration and waterflows are now being established...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{extensive}} and comprehensive reviews {{in the field}} of metal sulfide precipitation in the context of environmental remediation. However, these works have focused mainly on the removal of metals from aqueous solutions-usually, metal-contaminated effluents-with less emphasis on the precipitation process and on the end-products, frequently centering on metal removal efficiencies. Recently, there has been an increasing interest not only in the possible beneficial effects of these bioremediation strategies for metal-rich effluents but also on the formed precipitates. These metal sulfide materials are of special relevance in industry, due to their optical, electronic, and mechanical properties. Hence, identifying new routes for synthesizing these materials, as well as developing methodologies allowing for the control of the shape and size of particulates, is of environmental, economic, and practical importance. Multiple studies have shown proof-of-concept for the biological synthesis of inorganic metallic sulfide nanoparticles (NPs), resorting to varied organisms or cell components, though this information has scarcely been structured and compiled in a systematic manner. In this review, we overview the biological synthesis methodologies of nanosized metal sulfides and the advantages of these strategies when compared to more conventional chemical routes. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of the use of numerous organisms for the synthesis of different metal sulfide NPs, with emphasis on sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Finally, we put in perspective the potential of these methodologies in the emerging research areas of <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> and nanobiotechnology for the uptake of metals in the form of metal sulfide nanoparticles.

40|$|International audienceIn Europe, most of {{the primary}} copper {{resources}} that possess a high or moderate amount of metals, have a reasonable accessibility and are easy to process are exhausted. In this context, low grade and complex ores as well as old waste deposits related to past mining activities are receiving increasing attention. For an economic exploitation of such ores and resources, with quite different mineral matrix, new and efficient methods need to be developed. Bioleaching is a reliable and promising option. Among {{the different kinds of}} copper mineralisation that can be found in Europe, sulphidic Kupferschiefer deposits have been explored and exploited for years in Germany and Poland. They are Europe’s largest copper reserve with more than 60 million tons of Cu, and contain additional associated metals such as Ag, Pb, Zn and possibly other high-value metals. Kupferschiefer deposits are currently under exploitation in Poland, but process operations are more and more penalised by the significant amounts of organic matter and arsenic present in this type of ores. Therefore bioleaching is more and more considered as a credible alternative to the pyrometallurgical technology which may no longer be feasible in future given the concentrate chemistry. In this context, this paper provides an overview of the previous work on the geology, mineralogy, and (bio) processing of the Kupferschiefer. It will also present new opportunities and challenges related to the development of innovative methods for metal recovery by means of biotechnology. Generally, bioleaching of Kupferschiefer is influenced by the mineralogical nature of sulphides and organic matter contained in the ores. For example, recalcitrance of chalcopyrite during leaching is a major limitation of <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> applied to copper ores in general and blackshales in particular. Organic matter, moreover, causes also flotation problems. However, the organic materials especially the metallorganic compounds containing platinum group (PGE) or rare earth elements (REE) may make processing of Kupferschiefer economically interesting. The first works dealing with Kupferschiefer bioleaching in Europe date back more than three decades, and were pursued again beginning of the 21 st century in the European Bioshale project. This project demonstrated the overall efficiency of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) bioleaching of a blackshale concentrate with an extraction rate above 90 %. Nevertheless, two possible improvement paths were identified: reducing the tank size or improving chalcopyrite dissolution affecting the operation efficiency. These challenges were then further addressed in ProMine project opening new perspectives for bioleaching of Kupferschiefer ores which will be dealt with in the French–German project Ecometals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis review {{outlines}} {{classic and}} current research, scientific documents and research achievements in bioleaching, particularly {{in respect of}} the bioleaching of chalcopyrite and pyrite. The diversity and commonality of the microbial leaching process can be easily studied through comparing the bioleaching mechanism {{and the application of}} these two metal sulfides. The crystal, electronic and surface structures of chalcopyrite and pyrite are summarized in detail in this paper. It determines the specific and complicated interaction pathways, kinetics of the atmospheric/aqueous oxidation, and the control process of bioleaching of the minerals as the precondition. Bioleaching of metal sulfides is performed by a diverse group of microorganisms and microbial communities. The species of the bacteria which {{have a significant effect on}} leaching ores are miraculously diverse. The newly identified acidophilic microorganisms with unique characteristics for efficient bioleaching of sulfidic minerals are increasing sharply. The cell-to-cell communication mechanisms, which are still implicit, elusive and intangible at present day, have gradually become a research hotspot. The different mineralogy characteristics and the acid solubility of the metal sulfides (e. g., chalcopyrite and pyrite) cause two different dissolution pathways, the thiosulfate and the polysulfide pathways. The bioleaching mechanisms are categorized by contact (an electrostatic attachment) and noncontact (planktonic) process, with emphasis on the produce of extracellular polymeric substances and formation of biofilm on the surface of the metal sulfides in this paper. The division of the direct and indirect effect are not adopted due to the redox chain, the reduction of the ferric iron and oxidation of the ferrous iron. The molecular oxygen is reduced by the electrons extracted from the specific metal sulfide, via a redox chain forming a supercomplex spanning the periplasmic space and connecting both outer and inner membrane. The passivation of the mineral surface can obviously hinder the dissolution of metal sulfides during the bioleaching process, which is significantly affected by the kinetic model, microenvironment on the surface of ore and the leach conditions, such as temperature, pH and Eh. The new development of mechanism research, enhanced and intensified technologies on the bioleaching of chalcopyrite and pyrite, are conducted and summarized from the different branches of natural science. Some are depicted and explained based on molecular level in this paper. Catalyst and catalytic mechanisms in bioleaching and biooxidation for this two sulfide minerals have been concluded and applied for several decades, the continuous emergence of the new material and technology are also gradually applied into the <b>biohydrometallurgy.</b> The industrial applications of the bioleaching on chalcopyrite and pyrite are totally based on the understanding of the interaction mechanism between microbes and minerals, the optimization of ore leaching conditions and the development of new material and the leaching equipment. It is not incredible and unimaginable to take a different bioleaching process and diagram to deal with the two sulfuric metals, which is vital to succeed in elevating the leaching rate of copper...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} {{the demand for}} heavy metals is ever increasing, but the reserves of high-grade ores are diminishing. Therefore {{there is a need}} to explore alternative sources of heavy metals. The rapid industrialization generates a variety of industrial wastes. These industrial wastes possess toxic elements such as heavy metals. Improper disposal of these wastes becomes a key factor in metal contamination and thus when leached into atmosphere cause serious environmental problem. These metals exert wide variety of adverse effects on human being. Some of the metals have extremely long biological half-life that essentially makes it a cumulative toxin. Also some metals are carcinogenic in nature. Among the wastes, electronic scraps, medical waste, metal finishing industry waste, spent petroleum catalysts, battery wastes, fly ash etc., are some of the major industrially produced wastes. These solid wastes mostly contain Au, Ag, Ni, Mo, Co, Cu, Zn, and Cr like heavy metals in it. Hence these waste materials which are causing serious environmental problems, can act as potential source for heavy metals. In this sense these industrial wastes can act as artifitial ores. The valuable metals can be recovered from these industrial wastes. There are varieties of methods in use for recovery of heavy metals. These include pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical and bio-hydrometallurgical methods. Pyrometallurgical recovery consists of the thermal treatment of ores and metal containing wastes to bring about physical and chemical transformations. This enables recovery of valuable metals. Calcining, roasting, smelting and refining are the pyrometallurgical processes used for metal recovery. The hydrometallurgical recovery uses mainly the leaching process. It involves the use of aqueous solutions containing a lixiviant which is brought into contact with a material containing a valuable metal. Further the metals are concentrated and purified by using precipitation, cementation, solvent extraction and ion exchange. The metals are finally recovered in pure form by using electrolysis and precipitation methods. <b>Biohydrometallurgy</b> is one of the most promising and revolutionary biotechnologies. This technique exploits microbiological processes for recovery of heavy metal ions. In last few decades the concept of microbiological leaching have played a grate role to recover valuable metals from various sulfide minerals or low grade ores. Now the microbiological leaching process has been shifted for its application to recover valuable metals from the different industrial wastes. There are many microrganisms which play important role in recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastes. Among the bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, and Sulfolobus sp., are well known for the bioleaching activity while Penicillium, and Aspergillus niger are some fungi those help in metal leaching process. The process of recovery makes sense only if the cost of recovery is much less than the value of the precious metal. The restrictions imposed on waste disposal and stringent environmental regulations demand eco-friendly technologies for metal recovery. This paper reports a review of number of industrial processes that generate metal containing waste and the various methods in use for recovery of metals from these wastes. This will help in selection of a proper method for recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastes...|$|E
40|$|Kumba Iron Ore, Ltd. is the world‘s {{fourth largest}} {{supplier}} of sea-borne iron ore and currently operates two mines in South Africa namely: the Sishen {{mine in the}} Northern Cape and Thabazimbi mine in Limpopo. The Sishen mine, located at {{the northern end of}} the Maremane anticline where the bulk of the hematite ore is buried beneath younger cover lithologies, was our focus area. Here the iron resources are made up by laminated and massive ore bodies that belong to the Asbestos Hills Subgroup. These ore bodies are overlain by conglomerates, shales, flagstone and quartzite. The alkalis, potassium and phosphorous, are common constituents of iron ore, which is known to have a deleterious effect on the manufacturing of iron and steel. Therefore steel making companies charge penalties when purchasing iron ore concentrates with alkali concentrations above predetermined levels. To ensure that the export batches at the Sishen mine stay within set limits, the ores from different batches (with alkali concentration greater and below set limits) are mixed to produce a batch which meet requirements. However this solution will soon become ineffective as the low alkali ore is progressively depleted. Conventional methods used to treat high alkali ores include pyro-and hydrometallurgical methods. These approaches have several limitations such as poor product recovery, involvement of high process and energy cost and an increase in pollution load of water resources. Therefore necessitating research and development of alternative cheap and environment friendly procedures, which could supplement or replace conventional methods to ensure that mining stays economically feasible at the Sishen Iron Ore mine. The application of microorganisms to mining practices is collectively referred to as <b>biohydrometallurgy</b> and includes bioleaching and biooxidation processes. The phrase bioleaching refers to the conversion of an insoluble metal (typically a metal sulfide) into a soluble form (typically a metal sulfate), via microbial activity. When metals are extracted into solution, the process is referred to as bioleaching, whereas if the metal remains in the mineral, it is referred to as biooxidation. The latter term biobeneficiation refers to the selective dissolution of undesired minerals from the ores by direct or indirect action of microbes, thereby enriching the desirable mineral content. Therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether bacteria (naturally occurring on the ore or introduced species) could be used to selectively remove the alkalis from the iron ore mined at Sishen. The species evaluated were able to change the solution pH and/or form biofilms, which is assumed to have affected mineral mobilization. Data obtained during this study suggests that the composition of the ore plays a significant role in its susceptibility to bioleaching. Furthermore we also found that the indigenous cultures were more effective than the introduced species to mobilize the alkalis, which could possibly be ascribed to an adaptation of the microbes present. These preliminary results suggest that bioleaching is an effective alternative cost effective approach to treat iron ore and could possibly be implemented in future into the mining schedule at Sishen.

40|$|Gold, amongst {{other group}} 11 metals, was almost {{certainly}} one of the first three metals known to man. In addition to the economic importance of the metal, gold has a wide variety of applications in the medical, electrocatalytical and micro-electronics fields. However, the determination of gold ions in solution, with accuracy, precision, sensitivity and selectivity is still an interesting and much debated topic in analytical chemistry. A system whereby gold ions have been successfully detected employing an electrochemical technique, known as stripping voltammetry, has been developed. The electrochemical method was chosen over other available techniques for the sensitivity, particularly at low concentrations, and selectivity properties; notably in the presence of other metal ions. Under acidic conditions, the electrochemical technique was applied and the presence of gold(III), at a concentration of 2. 53 x 10 - 5 mol dm- 3 in a mine waste water sample, was detected. Biomass, in particular yeast and algal types, have been successfully employed in extractinglow concentrations of gold ions from industrial effluents. The manipulation of the biological facility for mineral interaction, <b>biohydrometallurgy,</b> may yield numerous potential new technologies. South Africa in particular would benefit from this area of research, since the country is a major ore and metal refining country and if the output and the efficiency of the mines could be improved, even by a small percentage, the financial rewards would be vast. In this study, the application of adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (AdCSV) of gold(III) in the presence of various Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall components, was investigated to determine which, if any, were involved specifically in the chemical binding of the gold ions. The chitin and mannan extracts showed the most promise with detection limits of 1. 10 x 10 - 6 mol dm- 3 and 9 x 10 - 9 mol dm- 3, respectively; employing the AdCSV technique. A modification of the stripping voltammetry technique, Osteryoung square wave stripping voltammetry (OSWSV), provided the lowest detection limit, for gold(IIl) in the presence of mannan, of 1. 70 x 10 - 11 mol dm- 3; utilising a modified carbon paste electrode. The detection of gold(III) {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the type of electrode employed, the electrolyte solution and the presence of interfering agents. The effect of copper(II) and silver(I) on the detection of the gold(III) in solution was investigated; whilst the silver(I) has shown no detrimental effects on gold (III) detection systems, copper(II) has indicated the possibility of forming an inter-metallic compound with the gold(III). However, mannan has shown to selectively and preferentially bind the gold(III) in the presence of a ten-fold excess of copper(II). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, as well as computer modelling techniques were employed to further investIgate the mannan-gold(III) interaction and proposed complex formed. The NMR, IR and computer modelling data are in agreement with the electrochemical data on proposing a mannan-gold(III) complex. The co-ordination site was established to be in the vicinity of the H-I and H- 2 protons and the gold(III) adopts a square-planar geometry upon co-ordination. The benefits of the research are useful from a biological perspective (i. e. as more is known about the binding sites, microbiologists/biochemists may work on the optimisation of parameters for these sites or work could be furthered into the enhanced expression of the sites) and an industrial one. In addition to the' two major benefits, an improved understanding of gold and its chemistry would be achieved, which is advantageous for other fields of research as well. ...|$|E
