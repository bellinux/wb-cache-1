30|$|The {{empirical}} data fits well against Eqs. 7 and 9 {{in a variety}} of populations and settings. It also helps clarify some of the key questions regarding the relationships between fertility, marriage, and marital birth ratios. First, it demonstrates the interrelationship and dual importance of both marital/nonmarital fertility and the proportion of women married. Either of these variables can be held constant, yet the other varied to produce an effect on the proportions of <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock.</b> Dropping either produces a decrease in the proportion of <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock</b> unless age-specific fertility decreases. However, Eqs. 7, 8, and 9 also allow us to analyze the effect of the changes in values of marital fertility and proportions married across different values of age-specific fertility.|$|R
30|$|Second, Eq. 9 {{addresses}} the phenomenon {{about the relative}} differences between fertility rates and nonmarital birth ratios across different contexts. In one case, the differences of nonmarital <b>birth</b> ratios <b>in</b> low fertility countries in parts of Europe and those in East Asia become clear. In Eq. 8, given marital fertility {{on the right-hand side}} of the equation, the value on the left-hand side can be any combination of values that trades off general fertility and the proportion of <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock.</b> Some countries such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have kept their proportion of <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock</b> very high—to the detriment of fertility—while others such as in Scandinavia and in the USA have maintained relatively higher levels of fertility while dealing with a large percentage or even a majority of births out of wedlock though this often still accommodates family formation through cohabitation (Kiernan, 2001 and Kiernan 2004).|$|R
3000|$|Equation 4 {{demonstrates}} that the relative values of unmarried and married births are due to {{the product of the}} inverse of the odds, W/ 1 [*]− W, a woman in a certain age group has had a first marriage and the ratio of the nonmarital and marital fertility rates. The marital birth ratio, bw, or the proportion of all <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock</b> can be derived as: [...]...|$|R
30|$|Marital {{fertility}} {{can also}} tend to decrease as average or median marriage age increases, but the causation is not as clear and there are exceptions such as increased marital fertility at the highest age groups such as 40 – 44 as marriage is postponed later in life. Given these dependencies, a rising marriage age typically lowers {{the right side of}} the equation and constrains the product of the terms on the left: the age-specific or general fertility rate and the proportion of <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock.</b> This puts modern societies that have undergone the second demographic transition in a bit of a quandary: between a relatively high marriage age, low nonmarital birth ratios, and high (hopefully replacement) fertility, they must pick only two.|$|R
30|$|The black {{border line}} {{indicates}} {{the frontier of}} the plot where 100 % of births are within marriage and the marital fertility rate times the proportion of women having a first marriage equals the age-specific fertility rate, the exact relationship first postulated in Eq. 3 by Coale and Trussell (1974). The points indicated by years display the values of W and rW by year and how this matches with the expected values of bw. One can see the relative effects of {{the reduction in the}} proportion of women married and the reduction in marital fertility and how it affects the ratio of <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock.</b> Similar plots can be made for population scenarios, using forecasted or targeted fertility rates, to understand how different scenarios of family formation will affect the ratio of births within and outside of wedlock.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} abortion legalization on <b>births</b> <b>in</b> the United States. A simple theoretical model demonstrates {{that the impact of}} abortion legalization on the birth rate is ambiguous, because both pregnancy and abortion decisions could be affected. We use variation in the timing of legalization across states in the early 1970 's to estimate the effect of abortion on birth rates. Our findings indicate that states legalizing abortion experienced a 5 % decline <b>in</b> <b>births</b> relative to other states. The decline among teens, women over 35, and nonwhite women was even greater: 13 %, 8 %, and 12 % respectively. Out-of-wedlock births declined by twice as much as <b>births</b> <b>in</b> <b>wedlock.</b> If legalization <b>in</b> some states affected <b>birth</b> rates <b>in</b> neighboring states (through travel to obtain an abortion), comparing births between states will underestimate the actual reduction. Using more distant comparison states increases the estimated impact of abortion legalization on birth rates to about 8 %. Applying this estimate to the current level of births, a complete recriminalization of abortion would result in 320, 000 additional births per year. ...|$|R
