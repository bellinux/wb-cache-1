25|$|Complete loss {{of signal}} in an X-Y CRT display means that the beam strikes a small spot, which risks burning the phosphor. Older {{phosphors}} burned more easily.

25|$|CRTs with an unphosphored {{front glass}} but with fine wires {{embedded}} in it {{were used as}} electrostatic print heads in the 1960s. The wires would pass the electron <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> through the glass onto {{a sheet of paper}} where the desired content was therefore deposited as an electrical charge pattern. The paper was then passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
40|$|In heavy-ion physics, high <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> can {{eventually}} melt or destroy the target. Tightly focused beams on stationary targets of modest melting point will exhibit short lifetimes. Defocused or wobbled beams are employed to enhance target survival. Rotating targets using large diameter wheels can help overcome target melting {{and allow for}} higher <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> {{to be used in}} experiments. The purpose of the calculations in this work is to try and predict the safe maximum <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> which produce heat loads below the melting point of the target material...|$|R
50|$|Accelerator {{systems for}} ion {{implantation}} are generally classified into medium <b>current</b> (ion <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> between 10 μA and ~2 mA), high <b>current</b> (ion <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> up to ~30 mA), high energy (ion energies above 200 keV {{and up to}} 10 MeV), and very high dose (efficient implant of dose greater than 1016 ions/cm2).|$|R
40|$|As {{semiconductor}} device design rule dimensions continue to shrink, {{there is a}} demand for transistor junction depths to decrease. New processes are required that involve lower energy implants but the reduced <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> available due to space charge limits in beam generation and transport at these lower energies can limit productivity to such a level that other non-implant technologies become attractive. The Applied Materials xR 80 implanter uses {{state of the art}} beam generation and extraction optics coupled to an open geometry, short beamline to produce enhanced performance to energies down to 2 keV. The xRLEAP significantly increases <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> at these energies and further reduces the energies at which product worthy <b>beam</b> <b>currents</b> can be obtained by the use of high transmission energy retardation optics added to the xR 80 system.

25|$|When {{the primary}} {{electron}} beam {{interacts with the}} sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the synchrocyclotron is the isochronous cyclotron, which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with time. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> than synchrocyclotrons, but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a strong focusing effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral trajectory. For this reason, an isochronous cyclotron is also called an [...] "AVF (azimuthal varying field) cyclotron". This solution for focusing the particle beam was proposed by L. H. Thomas in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|The OPERA team used {{an already}} {{existing}} beam of neutrinos traveling continuously from CERN to LNGS, the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso beam, for the measurement. Measuring speed meant measuring the distance traveled by the neutrinos from their source {{to where they}} were detected, and the time taken by them to travel this length. The source at CERN was more than [...] away from the detector at LNGS (Gran Sasso). The experiment was tricky because {{there was no way to}} time an individual neutrino, necessitating more complex steps. As shown in Fig.1, CERN generates neutrinos by slamming protons, in pulses of length 10.5microseconds (10.5millionths of a second), into a graphite target to produce intermediate particles, which decay into neutrinos. OPERA researchers measured the protons as they passed a section called the <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> transducer (BCT) and took the transducer's position as the neutrinos' starting point. The protons did not actually create neutrinos for another kilometer, but because both protons and the intermediate particles moved almost at light speed, the error from the assumption was acceptably low.|$|E

2500|$|In an EBPVD system, the {{deposition}} chamber must be evacuated to a pressure {{of at least}} 7.5 Torr (10−2 Pa) to allow passage of electrons from the electron gun to the evaporation material, which {{can be in the}} form of an ingot or rod. Alternatively, some modern EBPVD systems utilize an arc-suppression system and can be operated at vacuum levels as low as 5.0 Torr, for situations such as parallel use with magnetron sputtering. [...] Multiple types of evaporation materials and electron guns can be used simultaneously in a single EBPVD system, each having a power from tens to hundreds of kilowatts. Electron beams can be generated by thermionic emission, field electron emission or the anodic arc method. The generated electron beam is accelerated to a high kinetic energy and directed towards the evaporation material. Upon striking the evaporation material, the electrons will lose their energy very rapidly. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into other forms of energy through interactions with the evaporation material. The thermal energy that is produced heats up the evaporation material causing it to melt or sublimate. Once temperature and vacuum level are sufficiently high, vapor will result from the melt or solid. The resulting vapor can then be used to coat surfaces. Accelerating voltages can be between 3 and 40 kV. When the accelerating voltage is 20–25 kV and the <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> is a few amperes, 85% of the electron's kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy. Some of the incident electron energy is lost through the production of X-rays and secondary electron emission.|$|E
50|$|The main {{drawback}} of {{this device}} is that, {{as a result}} of the variation in the frequency of the oscillating voltage supply, only a very small fraction of the ions leaving the source are captured in phase-stable orbits of maximum radius and energy with the result that the output <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> has a low duty cycle, and the average <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> is only a small fraction of the instantaneous <b>beam</b> <b>current.</b> Thus the machine produces high energy ions, though with comparatively low intensity.|$|E

In contrast the IOT uses current modulation like an ordinary triode; most of the bunching {{is done by the}} grid, so the tube can be much shorter, making it less expensive to build and mount, and less bulky. Secondly, since the klystron has <b>beam</b> <b>current</b> throughout the RF cycle, it can only operate as an inefficient class-A amplifier, while the grid of the IOT allows more versatile operating modes.
