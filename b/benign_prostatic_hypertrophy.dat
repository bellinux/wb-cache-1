40|$|A {{truncated}} {{form of the}} c-Kit {{tyrosine kinase}} receptor, originally identified in mouse haploid germ cells, is aberrantly expressed in human cancer cell lines of various origin. This alternative transcript originates in the 15 th intron of the human c-kit gene. We have previously demonstrated that sperm-carried mouse truncated c-Kit (tr-Kit) is a strong activator of the Src-family tyrosine kinases both in transfected cells and in mouse oocytes. In the present work, we report that human tr-Kit mRNA and protein are expressed in LNCaP prostatic cancer cells. We have identified two regions in the 15 th and 16 th introns of the human c-kit gene that show homology with sequences in the spermatid-specific tr-Kit promoter within the 16 th intron of mouse c-kit. We also show that nuclear factors present in LNCaP cells bind to discrete sequences of the mouse tr-Kit promoter. Moreover, Western blot analysis of 23 primary prostate cancers indicated that tr-Kit was expressed in ∼ 28 % of the tumors at less advanced stages (Gleason grade 4 to 6) and in 66 % of those at more advanced stages (Gleason grade 7 to 9), whereas it was not expressed in <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hypertrophies.</b> Sequencing of the cDNA for the truncated c-Kit, amplified from both LNCaP cells and neoplastic tissues, confirmed the existence in prostate cancer cells of a transcript arising from the 15 th intron of human c-kit. We also show that tr-Kit-expressing LNCaP cells and prostatic tumors {{have higher levels of}} phosphorylated/activated Src than tr-Kit-negative PC 3 cells or prostatic tumors, and that transfection of tr-Kit in PC 3 cells caused a dramatic increase in Src activity. Interestingly, we found that Sam 68, a RNA-binding protein phosphorylated by Src in mitosis, is phosphorylated only in prostate tumors expressing tr-Kit. Indeed, both activation of Src and phosphorylation of Sam 68 were observed in all of the three grade 7 to 9 tumors analyzed that expressed tr-Kit. Our data describe {{for the first time the}} existence of a truncated c-Kit protein in primary tumors and show a correlation between tr-Kit expression and activation of the Src pathway in the advanced stages of the disease. Thus, these results might pave the way for the elucidation of a novel pathway in neoplastic transformation of prostate cells...|$|R

40|$|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {{is the one}} of {{the most}} {{valuable}} tumor markers for the early detection and management of prostate carcinoma, but not an ideal one because of poor specificity in the case of <b>prostatic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and other <b>benign</b> conditions. In order to overcome this drawback some other parameters as is free to total ratio (F/T) PSA and PSA density (PSAD) are introduced. It has been investigated in 60 patients, 18 of them are proved to be found prostate cancer and other 42 were identified as <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia. Patients with CaP had TPSA median of 11. 4 ng/ml and the others with <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia (BPH) had 6. 9 ng/ml. In these two groups there was statistical significant difference (p 0. 01). By receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) estimated cutoff for TPSA was 4. 0 ng/ml with 95 % sensitivity, 30 % specificity and area covered by ROC was in amount of 0. 76. Median F/T ratio for patients with prostate cancer was 0. 10, and for <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia patients it was 0. 25. For these values there is also statistical difference (p). Using ROC cutoff for F/T PSA was determined at the value of 0. 18 with sensitivity 95 %, specificity 80 % and area under the curve (AUC) 0. 93. Median for PSAD in the group with CaP was 0. 38 and in the BPH group was 0. 16. There was statistical significance within those two groups. In conclusion F/T PSA, PSAD and TPSA are valuable tumor markers in distinguishing patients with CaP ant those without with modestly raised TPSA. Also F/T PSA showed up as better marker than TPSA and PSAD in investigated group of patients.

Comparative analysis showed that the patients with <b>prostatic</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> have a tendency of fainting forehead hearing and thinning of bearing, but many patients with prostatic cancer showed thick bearing.

40|$|Background: To treat {{symptomatic}} <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists {{with little}} antagonism at α 1 b -adrenoceptor {{were used to}} avoid orthostatic hypotension. In <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia tissues α 1 D -adrenoceptor are thought to predominate, but in the Japanese experience, either α 1 A - or α 1 D - adrenoceptor antagonists can alleviate <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia symptoms. We hypothesized that prostatic expression of α 1 A - and α 1 D -adrenoceptor varies quantitatively between patients. Materials and Methods: We immunohistochemically localized α 1 A - and α 1 D -adrenoceptor within <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia tissues, and quantitated mRNA expression for these subtypes by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Immunohistochemistry detected both subtypes in stromal but not detected epithelial cells.

40|$|Aim: This {{integrative}} review aims {{to summarize}} the evidence regarding the health-related quality of life, psychological well-being, and the relevant influencing factors in men with <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia. Methods: An integrative published work review was adopted. Articles published in English from 2002 to 2014 that addressed the variables of health-related quality of life, psychological well-being, or the relevant influencing factors in men with <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia were included. Results: Of the 4708 articles retrieved, 16 were deemed relevant. Analysis of the published work suggests that <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia has {{a negative impact on}} health-related quality of life, citing two major predictive factors: lower urinary tract symptoms and medical management. The psychological well-being of men with <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia remains inconclusive as very limited studies have been conducted to investigate this aspect in these men. Limited studies collectively investigate the relationship among concepts such as health-related quality of life, psychological well-being, and sociodemographic and clinical factors related to <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia. Conclusion: This review highlights the need to conduct further study on health-related quality of life and the psychological well-being of patients with <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia, especially in an Asian context.
