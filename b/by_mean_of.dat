40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Acute {{diarrhoea}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} health challenges globally, causing millions of child deaths every year. A continued effort is made by the WHO, in collaboration with other institutions, to successfully combat diarrhoea. A new formulation for ORS (with a reduced osmolarity), in combination with zinc supplementation, was proposed to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea (WHO, 2006 : 1). Appropriate zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhoea includes: zinc sulfate, zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate. With no monographs available in The Ph. Int. for zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs, the development thereof has become a priority to the WHO. During this study, suitable methods according to The Ph. Int. for the quality control testing of zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs were investigated and proposed. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc acetate dihydrate API: * Identification <b>of</b> zinc <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction of zinc hydroxide and zinc sulfide, * Identification <b>of</b> acetate <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction of ferric acetate, * Clarity and colour of a 0. 05 g/ml solution, * pH value of a 0. 05 g/ml solution, * Assay <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing substances <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a reduction reaction with potassium permanganate, o chlorides <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction of barium sulfate, o arsenic <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> reaction between arsine and bromide, o aluminium, cadmium, copper, iron and lead <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> atomic absorption spectrometry. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc gluconate API: * Identification <b>of</b> zinc <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction of zinc ferrocyanide, * Identification <b>of</b> gluconate <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a thin layer chromatographic separation method, * Clarity and colour of a 0. 01 g/ml solution, * pH value of a 0. 01 g/ml solution, * Water <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> the Karl Fischer method, * Assay <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing sugars <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a reduction reaction with cupri–tartaric test solution, o chlorides <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction of barium sulfate, o heavy metals <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> a precipitation reaction of sulfides in acidic solutions, o cadmium <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> atomic absorption spectrometry, and o microbial testing if required by The Ph. Int. The proposed methods were then validated or verified according to international standards. Once the methods were proven to be fit for purpose, they were assembled into the respective monographs for inclusion in The Ph. Int. The newly developed monographs were then evaluated by determining the compliance of commercially available zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate to the proposed specifications. The study contributes to the WHO, pharmaceutical industry and medicines regulatory authorities by making these two monographs globally available, thus providing a quality gauge to ensure the availability of zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc gluconate APIs of pharmaceutical acceptable quality.
