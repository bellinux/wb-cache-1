[...] and [...] (both 1974) are significant <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> examples of surviving early pink films from an independent studio other than Shintōhō Eiga.

Both these films were produced by Akitaka Kimata's Pro Taka production studio and directed by his son Akiyoshi Kimata under the pseudonym [...] Both films show a light-hearted and easy-going style which contrasts with the darker style of the director and of Million Film productions in later years. The non-political nature of these two films contrasts with the politically charged pink films of the 1960s, such as those by Kōji Wakamatsu, which often tackled current events. [...] made by Genji Nakamura for his own Genji Pro, and released by Million in October 1977 shows a similarly relaxed style, though it does make reference to the political themes of earlier pink film, particularly the Anpo.|$|E
