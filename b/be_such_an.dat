In October, the Australians played additional matches in the USA and Canada on their return journey. The tour followed one {{made by an}} England team to Australia in 1876–77, during which the first matches retrospectively given Test match status were played.

25|$|In 1055, Henry turned south, to Italy again, for BonifaceIII of Tuscany, ever an {{imperial}} ally, had died, and his widow, Beatrice of Bar had married Godfrey of Lorraine (1054). First, however, {{he gave his}} old hostage, Spitignev, the son of Bretislaus to the Bohemians as duke. Spitignev did homage and Bohemia remained securely, loyally, and happily within the Imperial fold. By Easter, Henry had arrived in Mantua. He held several courts, one at Roncaglia, where, a century later (1158), Frederick Barbarossa held a far more important diet, sent out his missi dominici to establish order. Godfrey, ostensibly {{the reason for the}} visit, was not well received by the people and returned to Flanders. Henry met the pope at Florence and arrested Beatrice for marrying a traitor, and her daughter Matilda, later to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> enemy of Henry's son. The young Frederick of Tuscany, son of Beatrice, refused to come to Florence and died within days. Henry returned via Zürich and there betrothed his young son to Bertha, daughter of Count Otto of Savoy.|$|E

The work marked the first of Lichtenstein's [...] "artistic appropriations of the canonical works of Modernism" [...] that resulted from his realization of the interrelation [...] "between avant-garde and kitsch".|$|E

2500|$|For {{quadratic}} systems [...] {{in other}} words, for [...] there can <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> interval vector , which covers all possible solutions, found simply with the interval Gauss method.

[...] However, since this method uses the interval entities and [...] repeatedly in the calculation, it can produce poor results for some problems.

2500|$|Until 2008, CERA (a {{consulting}} company wholly owned by energy consultants IHS Energy) {{did not believe}} this would <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> immediate problem.

This reversal of opinion was significant, as CERA, among other consultancies, provided price projections that were used by many official bodies to plan long-term strategy in respect of energy mix and price.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Rishel, in {{his history}} of Duquesne University, The Spirit that Gives Life, writes of Father Hehir that [...] "never, before or since, would one man <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> overshadowing figure to the school". Hehir {{maintained}} a highly visible presence in the day-to-day life of the university, participating in and supporting college events, and taking personal interest {{in the lives of}} students. A popular legend of his presidency was that Father Hehir had two groups of student files: one for [...] "those who can pay" [...] and another for [...] "those who cannot pay"; he was often willing to bankroll the education of talented students, confident that the school would be repaid later. His relationship with the deans of the schools was also notably good: all the founders of the various schools—except one—still headed those schools {{at the time of his}} retirement.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the Platform One {{interiors}} were filmed at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff, Wales in October 2004. Sets {{were also}} built and painted {{to match the}} Temple's marble interiors. Due to complexities in animating Cassandra, some of her lines were dropped and the episode underran. To compensate, Davies {{came up with the}} character of maintenance worker Raffalo, and scenes between Raffalo and Rose were filmed at the Temple of Peace on 19 February 2005. Russell T Davies joked that there would never <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> expensive episode again (because of the large amount of CGI special effects). Both Cassandra and the robotic spiders— other than an inactive one— are completely CGI creatures.

As of [...] "The Wedding of River Song" [...] (2011), no Doctor Who episode contains as many special effects shots.|$|E
2500|$|The weaker {{form of the}} theorem can {{be proven}} from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume {{that we have a}} {{consistent}} and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements i.e. an algorithm N that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers, such that for all the true statements {{there is at least one}} n such that N(n) is equal to that statement. Now suppose we want to decide whether the algorithm with representation a halts on input i. [...] By using Kleene's T predicate, we can express the statement [...] "a halts on input i" [...] as a statement H(a, i) in the language of arithmetic. Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) = [...] H(a, i) or there is an n such that N(n) = ¬ H(a, i). [...] So if we iterate over all n until we either find H(a, i) or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.|$|E
