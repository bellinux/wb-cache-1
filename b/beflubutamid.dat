40|$|The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{provides}} a tractable genetic model to study herbicide {{mode of action}} using forward genetics. The herbicide norflurazon inhibits phytoene desaturase, which is required for carotenoid synthesis. Locating amino acid substitutions in mutant phytoene desaturases conferring norflurazon resistance {{provides a}} genetic approach to map the herbicide binding site. We isolated a UV-induced mutant able to grow in very high concentrations of norflurazon (150 µM). The phytoene desaturase gene in the mutant strain contained the first resistance mutation to be localised to the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-likedomain. A highly conserved phenylalanine amino acid at position 131 of the 564 amino acid precursor protein was changed to a valine in the mutant protein. F 131, and two other amino acids whose substitution confers norflurazon resistance in homologous phytoene desaturase proteins, map to distant regions in the primary sequence of the C. reinhardtii protein (V 472, L 505) but in tertiary models these residues cluster together to a region close to the predicted FAD binding site. The mutant gene allowed direct 5 µM norflurazon based selection of transformants, which were tolerant to other bleaching herbicides including fluridone, flurtamone, and diflufenican but were more sensitive to <b>beflubutamid</b> than wild type cells. Norflurazon resistance and <b>beflubutamid</b> sensitivity allow either positive or negative selection against transformants expressing the mutant phytoene desaturase gene...|$|E
40|$|Three natural somatic {{mutations}} at codon 304 of the phytoene desaturase gene (pds) of Hydrilla verticillata (L. f. Royle) {{have been}} reported to provide resistance to the herbicide fluridone. We substituted the arginine 304 present in the wild-type H. verticillata phytoene desaturase (PDS) with all 19 other natural amino acids and tested PDS against fluridone. In in vitro assays, the threonine (Thr), cysteine (Cys), alanine (Ala) and glutamine (Gln) mutations imparted the highest resistance to fluridone. Thr, the three natural mutations [Cys, serine (Ser), histidine (His) ] and the wild-type PDS protein were tested in vitro against seven inhibitors of PDS representing several classes of herbicides. These mutations conferred cross-resistance to norflurazon and overall negative cross-resistance to <b>beflubutamid,</b> picolinafen and diflufenican. The T 3 generation of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants harbouring the four selected mutations and wild-type pds had similar patterns of crossresistance to the herbicides as observed in the in vitro assays. The Thr 304 Hydrilla pds mutant proved to be an excellent marker for the selection of transgenic plants. Seedlings harbouring Thr 304 pds had a maximum resistance to sensitivity (R/S) ratio of 57 and 14 times higher than that of the wild-type for treatments with norflurazon and fluridone, respectively. These plants exhibited normal growth and development, even after long-term exposure to herbicide. As Thr 304 pds is of plant origin, it could become more acceptable than other selectable markers for use in genetically modified food...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} occurrence {{of resistance to}} Apera spica-venti, especially to ALS inhibitors and partially to ACCase inhibitors has been reported for the new federal states, too. The dominance of winter wheat and winter rape in crop rotations associated with a unilateral application of herbicides has increased the selection pressure. In order to counter further spread of herbicide resistance, the right choice of the mode of action of the herbicide or herbicide combination and highly efficacious herbicide treatments are the methods of choice, of course {{in addition to the}} agronomic aspects, such as sowing date and crop rotation. The research determined how and to what extent dicotyledonous weeds are associated with loose silkybentgrass. Based on the results, single herbicides or herbicide tank mixes were tested to achieve the expected level of control. As a result, treatments which have achieved very high level of control against A. spica-venti and the most common dicotyledonous weeds can be recommended. A total of 191 trial sites have been included in the analysis of A. spica-venti. Using the HRAC-classification of herbicides used, groups were formed which might contribute to solving problems specifically linked to the detected resistance situation of the site. In the autumn, flufenacet-containing herbicides, such as Malibu (flufenacet, pendimethalin), Herold SC (flufenacet, diflufenican), Bacara Forte (flufenacet, flurtamone, diflufenican), Carmina 640 (chlortoluron, diflufenican) and Fenikan (isoproturon, diflufenican) demonstrated high efficiency against A. spica-venti. Combinations of herbicides with the HRAC classification of N and E provide further opportunities for the implementation of anti-resistance management strategies, such as Sumimax + Ciral (flumioxazin + metsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron) or Boxer (prosulfocarb) + Diflanil 500 SC (diflufenican) or Beflex (<b>beflubutamid).</b> When applied in spring, significant differences concerning the efficiency and robustness of sulfonylureas for the control of A. spica-venti were observed...|$|E
