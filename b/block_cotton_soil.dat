40|$|During {{a survey}} of black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> zones of Karnataka, indigenously {{stabilized}} black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> deposits were encountered in Belgaum, Bijapur, Bagalkot and Gadag Districts of Karnataka. These modified black <b>cotton</b> <b>soils</b> have low swelling and negligible shrinkage tendencies. Owing to their low volume change potential on moisture content changes, these soils are widely preferred in earth construction activities. The exact origin of these modified black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> deposits is not known. According to anecdotal references, these soils were prepared by mixing unknown proportions of wood ash, organic matter and black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> and allowing them to age for unknown periods of time. As wood-ash was apparently used in their preparation, these modified black <b>cotton</b> <b>soils</b> {{are referred to as}} ash-modified soils (AMS) in the thesis. The practice of preparing ash-modified soils is no longer pursued in black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> regions of Karnataka and the available supply of this indigenously stabilized soil is being fast depleted. Also, attempts have not been made to characterize the physico-chemical and engineering properties of AMS deposits of Karnataka. Given the widespread utilization of ash-modified <b>soils</b> in black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> areas of Karnataka, {{there is a need to}} understand their physico-chemical and engineering behaviour and the physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for their chemical modification. Swelling and shrinkage of expansive soil deposits are cyclic in nature due to periodic climatic changes. Chemically stabilized black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> deposits are also expected to experience cyclic wetting and drying due to seasonal climatic changes. The impact of cyclic wetting and drying on the swelling behaviour of natural expansive soils is well-documented. However, the impact of alternate wetting and drying on the swelling behaviour of admixture stabilized expansive soils (these include natural - ash-modified soils and laboratory - lime stabilized black <b>cotton</b> <b>soils)</b> has not been examined. Such a study would be helpful to assess the long term behaviour of admixture stabilized soils in field situations. To achieve the above objectives, experiments are performed that study: 1. The physico-chemical and engineering properties of ash-modified soils from different Districts of Karnataka. The physico-chemical and engineering properties of natural black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> (BCS) specimens from locations adjacent to ash-modified soil deposits are also examined to understand and evaluate the changes in the engineering characteristics of the ash-modified soils due to addition of admixtures. 2.

40|$|Soil is {{a base of}} structure, which {{actually}} supports the structure from beneath and distributes the load effectively. If {{the stability of the}} soil is not adequate then failure of structure occurs in form of settlement, cracks etc. Expansive soil also known as black <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> is more responsible for such situations and this is due to presence of montmorillonite mineral in it, which has ability to undergo large swelling and shrinkage. To overcome this, properties of soil must be improved by artificial means known as ‘Soil Stabilization’.

The Caustis M 63 plants grown in the two soils did not show P toxicity symptoms when fertilised with RP, but shoot dry weight was 30 - 60 % lower than the control in both soils at {{the highest rate of}} MCP-P application (156 kg ha(- 1), 184 g m(- 3)) and this was associated with visible symptoms of drying of the tips of the ultimate branchlets, in the Mt <b>Cotton</b> <b>soil</b> only.

Caustis plants grown in the Palmwoods soil had 2. 3 times greater root dry weights than plants grown in the Mt <b>Cotton</b> <b>soil</b> irrespective of the P fertiliser type used. Caustis plants growing in Mt <b>Cotton</b> <b>soil</b> which did not receive P showed significantly lower shoot and root dry weight when compared to plants in the Palmwoods soil, probably due to the low initial bicarbonate-extractable P and the high buffering capacity of the Mt <b>Cotton</b> <b>soil.</b> The P concentration in shoots of Caustis fertilised with MCP at 184 g m(- 3) was higher when grown in Mt <b>Cotton</b> <b>soil</b> (0. 22 %) than in the Palmwoods soil (0. 15 %). The P concentration was lower in the terminal ultimate branchlets (TUB); 0. 15 % for the Mt <b>Cotton</b> <b>soil</b> and 0. 10 % for the Palmwoods soil, suggesting that shoots would provide a more useful indicator of P toxicity than the TUB. It is interesting to speculate as to why plants in the Palmwoods soil showed greater root growth and fewer symptoms of P toxicity. This could be because the Palmwoods soil had the greater P adsorption capacity. These results indicate in ground production of Caustis cut foliage will require careful management of P nutrition and understanding of the complex soil/plant interactions associated with the acquisition of P.
