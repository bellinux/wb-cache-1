25|$|Dīkṣā (Sanskrit: दीक्षा). Reṇukā {{does not}} feel any weight, nor is troubled by the pregnancy. Jamadagni {{performs}} the Puṃsavana ceremony of Reṇukā, traditionally performed in the eighth month of pregnancy. All good omens happen for Reṇukā. The seven seers (Saptarṣi) <b>bless</b> <b>her</b> and the nine planets become favourable. Reṇukā gives birth to a child {{on the third day}} of the bright half of Vaiśākha month, known as Akṣayatṛtīyā. The deities, seers, and devotees rejoice. On the instruction of Bhṛgu, the child is named as Rāma by Jamadagni. Rāma is very fond of a toy-axe, and so he is also called Paraśurāma. The child tames and plays with wild animals like lions and tigers. Five years pass by, and ten Saṃskāras ("rites of passage") of the child are completed. Then the Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") ceremony of Paraśurāma is performed. Brahmā is the giver of the sacred thread, Śiva initiates the child in the Gayatrī Mantra, and Paraśurāma begs Reṇukā for alms. The canto ends with Paraśurāma going to the Kailāsa mountain to learn from his guru Śiva.|$|E

500|$|Film critic Subhash K Jha rated it 3.5/5 and quoted : [...] "Zoya, God <b>bless</b> <b>her</b> aesthetics, sucks us {{into the}} beauty of the moment, not giving us any reason to believe that life's most {{precious}} truths are swathed in squalor." [...] Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: [...] "For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls", he wrote, giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, [...] "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts." [...] He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length [...] "sucks some fun of out of the ride" [...] and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film [...] "tried too hard to be cool" [...] and gave it 1.5/5 stars.|$|E

500|$|... "Fakin' It" [...] opens side two {{and finds}} the protagonist mulling over his insecurities and shortcomings. It has been {{suggested}} that [...] "Fakin' It" [...] may be an allegory for Simon's relationship with Art Garfunkel. [...] "Punky's Dilemma" [...] employs breakfast-food images to lampoon Hollywood and the film industry. It improbably takes an [...] "abrupt left turn" [...] in its third verse, when the singer begins to fantasize himself an admired soldier. [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] collects wide-ranging images to address social milieu, with a constant reassurance that Jesus loves the eponymous character, God will <b>bless</b> <b>her,</b> and heaven will welcome her. The song includes a famous reference to athlete Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees, one of Simon's favorite baseball teams. It also features an explicit homage to the Beatles, with Simon uttering the meaningless phrase [...] "coo-coo-ca-choo" [...] that John Lennon sings in [...] "I Am the Walrus". [...] "A Hazy Shade of Winter" [...] is an older track that dates back to Simon's days in England in 1965. The song follows a hopeless poet, with [...] "manuscripts of unpublished rhyme", unsure of his achievements in life. In sharp contrast, the whimsical, Orwellian [...] "At the Zoo" [...] both concludes the album and what Simon described as the [...] "cycle of life". The song indicates that the personalities of certain zoo animals may represent particular walks of people. The song was originally intended as a possible children's book. According to rock journalist Bud Scoppa, [...] "the record is a meditation on the passage of life and the psychological impact of life's irreversible, ever-accumulating losses". The song cycle also describes {{the life and death of}} the romantic ideal of the American Dream.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News awarded Walton a [...] "Daytime Gold Standard" [...] for her portrayal. He stated: [...] "Walton played each {{scene in}} this “Bette Davis-like” {{emotional}} marathon of a week. How did Walton do it? With aplomb and greatness." [...] The following year, when Jill opened her own nail salon, Mike Jubinville, also of Zap2it, {{noted that the}} character had [...] "stepped into a time warp". Prior to being paired with Colin, Nekeeta Borden wrote that, [...] "Jill Foster Abbott (cough, cough) Fenmore’s (Jess Walton) Jimmy Choos must have crossed paths with a black cat, because she can’t find a good man to <b>bless</b> <b>her</b> somewhat shriveled heart." [...] Of the character's possible pairing with Colin, she added: [...] "I, for one, hope that Maria Arena Bell and Co. keep Colin in Genoa City and surprise us all by making him a dream lover for Jill. She is a multidimensional character {{with a lot of}} fire, and a great capacity to be soft and vulnerable. Goodness knows she’s been through the ringer. Can Jill find love with Colin, or will her newest dalliance lead to heartbreak?" [...] In 2013, Giddens wrote of Walton's portrayal throughout her run, stating: [...] "Unlike most soap opera recasts, where success or failure depends on chemistry with an opposite sex romantic lead, newcomer Jess Walton would sink or swim, based on her ability to connect with fellow female powerhouse Jeanne Cooper, who played Jill's bitter rival Katherine [...] "Kay" [...] Chancellor." [...] He also commended Walton and Cooper's portrayal of their characters' rivalry, [...] "To say Walton swam alongside Cooper would be an understatement. The two women did a backstroke even Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps would have to admire, during their 26 years as acting partners," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God <b>bless</b> <b>her</b> heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God promised to {{maintain}} the covenant with Abraham and his offspring as an everlasting covenant throughout the ages, and assigned all the land of Canaan {{to him and his}} offspring as an everlasting holding. God further told Abraham that he and his offspring throughout the ages were to keep God's covenant and every male (including every slave) was to be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin at the age of eight days {{as a sign of the}} covenant with God. If any male failed to circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person was to be cut off from his kin for having broken God's covenant. And God renamed Sarai as Sarah, and told Abraham that God would <b>bless</b> <b>her</b> and give Abraham a son by her so that she would give rise to nations and rulers. Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed at the thought that a child could be born to a man of a hundred and a woman of ninety, and Abraham asked God to bless Ishmael. But God told him that Sarah would bear Abraham a son, and Abraham was to name him Isaac, and God would maintain the everlasting covenant with him and his offspring. In response to Abraham's prayer, God blessed Ishmael as well and promised to make him exceedingly numerous, the father of twelve chieftains and a great nation. But God would maintain the covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah would bear at the same season the next year. And when God finished speaking, God disappeared. That very day, Abraham circumcised himself, Ishmael, and every male in his household, as God had directed. The maftir (...) reading that concludes the parashah reports that when Abraham circumcised himself and his household, Abraham was 99 and Ishmael was 13. The seventh reading ( [...] , aliyah), the third open portion ( [...] , petuchah), chapter [...] and the parashah end here.|$|E
