5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{bears the}} title of "The {{question}} of non-standard procedures also used within the Integrated Rescue System. Nowadays, non-standard procedures are used in most branches, therefore they can be found within the Integrated Rescue System as well. The thesis describes the current situation of the Integrated Rescue Systems <b>basic</b> <b>bodies</b> and its documentation, which indicates the procedures of the individual bodies for dealing with crisis situations. A portrayal of terrorism as a worldwide phenomenon of recent years, including a brief account of selected types, weapons and terrorism threats follow, also pointing out the extent of possibilities in using the TerEx programme, {{which is designed to}} promptly assess the consequences of a potential or actual terrorist attack. The following part of the thesis identifies the existence of all available materials and procedures, which the Integrated Rescue Systems <b>basic</b> <b>bodies</b> are obliged to follow when dealing with selected emergencies. Subsequently, particular emergencies are described and evaluated in the TerEx programme, as are the available procedures that would be used in those cases by the Integrated Rescue Systems <b>basic</b> <b>bodies.</b> A partial objective of the thesis was to find out whether standard procedures can be used in selected crisis situations without having to use the non-standard ones. The conclusion of the thesis deals with the analysis and assessment of the following specified hypothesis: "The Integrated Rescue Systems bodies are ready to ensure the safety and health of people during actual extraordinary situations. The hypothesis was confirmed. The outcome of this thesis may be used to supplement and extend the procedures specified in the type activities of the Integrated Rescue Systems bodies, which make the guide for dealing with any arisen crisis situations...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} get into the male psyche, they spend a day at Walthamstow Stadium dog track and {{subsequently}} decide to invent six rules of fashion for men based on the way that the betting information is arranged. The six <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> shapes include man boobs, beer belly, short legs, thick neck, broad shoulders and skinny. With each body shape, there includes a list of clothing items men must avoid, and others that are suitable. To test out the rules, Trinny and Susannah travel to a Cumbrian slate mine for the miners to take the rules and go shopping on their own. After the trial, they fear the rules are not simple enough. They seek the help from an advertising company who come {{up with the idea of}} arranging the six rules in the form of the Highway Code, therefore renaming the rules The Male Dress Code. Meanwhile, the fashion duo have arranged for the male section of an Oxford Street department store to be sectioned off to allow a male only day. The section has the six important rules displayed, complete with six live male manikins, one for each body shape, to demonstrate the clothing rules. They also invite some of the civil engineers and slate miners to test the newly formatted rules. Then outside of the store, Trinny and Susannah unveil the six male manikins in the shop window to the women outside.|$|E

40|$|To {{deal with}} {{and prepare for}} {{extraordinary}} events, the Czech Republic has the Integrated Rescue System, which is not an individual organization as such, but rather a system of co-ordinated activities of <b>basic</b> <b>bodies,</b> namely the Fire-Brigade of the Czech Republic and fire prevention units included in the area coverage, the Police of the Czech Republic and the Medical Rescue Service of the Czech Republic. It is the coordination of the Integrated Rescue Systems <b>basic</b> <b>bodies</b> what is absolutely essential for {{the effectiveness of the}} intervention in the place of an extraordinary event. To make the process of rescue and liquidation work really effective, type activities for the <b>basic</b> <b>bodies</b> during a collective intervention have been put together for selected extraordinary events. These activities focus mainly on the co-ordination of the bodies in the place of the extraordinary event as well as the co-ordination of the related bodies by their operations centres. This thesis aimed to analyze the work of the Czech Police as a body of the Integrated Rescue System in the area of extraordinary events as well as to point out possible insufficiencies and propose some ways of improvement. The findings gained can be used in the professional training of individuals, particularly from the ranks of the Czech Police, which handle the question of dealing with extraordinary events. The thesis includes a list of these type activities approved by the Integrated Rescue Systems bodies with reference to the effective legal documents and the analysis of responsibilities performed by the Police of the Czech Republic within the individual type activities. The conclusion indicates disparities between the theory and the practice, which arose during the elaboration of the thesis, particularly insufficient knowledge of the type activities on behalf of the policemen and deficient material facilities of the Czech Police as an Integrated Rescue Systems body, mainly protective aids for performing tasks related to potential contamination of the policemen by various chemical, biological and radioactive substances etc...|$|R

500|$|Cnidaria (...) is a phylum {{containing}} over 10,000 {{species of}} animals found exclusively in aquatic (freshwater and marine) environments: they are predominantly marine species. Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells {{that they use}} mainly for capturing prey. Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. They have two <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, {{both of which are}} radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both (hence they are trimorphic). Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptors. Several free-swimming species of Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balance-sensing statocysts, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians reproduce sexually, with many species having complex life cycles of asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae. Some, however, omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.|$|E
