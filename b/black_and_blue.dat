5|$|The title Leave Home {{refers to}} the Ramones leaving New York City to go on tour around the world. The album cover was {{designed}} by Moshe Brakha, {{who had worked with}} the Rolling Stones to yield the <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blue</b> (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. The back cover of the album was a drawing of a bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band's logo.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{have three}} main jersey colors: black, white, and blue. Their blue jerseys, {{designated}} their alternate uniforms, are the newest and {{were introduced in}} 2002. NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.|$|E
5|$|The photo {{originated}} from a washed-out colour {{photograph of a}} dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr. In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone, more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress, using hashtags such as #thedress, #whiteandgold and #blackandblue. Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue,</b> the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms, with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour. At the same time, members {{of the scientific community}} began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision.|$|E

5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played {{police officers in}} <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blue,</b> Framed, Between the Lines and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in The One That Got Away (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E
5|$|PETA {{took on the}} Pokémon {{series with}} Pokémon <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blue,</b> a parody of Pokémon Black and White that focuses on animal {{fighting}} and experimentation. In role-playing-style battles, the player controls a Pikachu who escapes its Trainers, Cheren. Pikachu first fights Cheren and then moves on to other Trainers in order to rescue their Pokémon from ownership. Pikachu recruits these Pokémon to its cause, {{as well as the}} sympathetic Nurse Joy. A sequel, Pokémon Red, White, and Blue, followed in 2013. The game suggests that Nintendo's continual releases of Pokémon games reduce humans' empathy for animals. Also a role-playing game, it stars Pikachu and Miltank, who battle McDonald's characters like the Hamburglar in a crusade against the rare but ongoing practice of meat production in the Unova region.|$|E
5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E

25|$|For {{a period}} of time, however, Inter was forced to abandon their <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> uniforms. In 1928, Inter's name and {{philosophy}} made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy. As a result, during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with Unione Sportiva Milanese. The new club was named Società Sportiva Ambrosiana after {{the patron saint of}} Milan. The flag of Milan (the red cross on white background) replaced the traditional <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue.</b> After World War II, when the Fascists had fallen from power, the club reverted to their original name and colours. In 2008, Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt. The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city, and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit. In 2014, the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes before returning to a more traditional design the following season.|$|E
