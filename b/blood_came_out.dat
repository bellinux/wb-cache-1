25|$|Finding {{the barrio}} Capaya {{completely}} deserted, the platoon ganged-up on Duman who was brusquely interrogated regarding the Katupunero band that raided Bo. Capaya and {{the whereabouts of}} the entire barrio population. The poor Duman, knowing nothing of what transpired in his village as his field was quite far from the village, answered he knew nothing what the soldiers were talking about. Immediately, he was branded as a big liar and was quickly {{accused of being a}} Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force him to talk, but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but <b>blood</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of his mouth, nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied his elbows in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him.|$|E

500|$|After the shooting, Newman {{was interviewed}} {{by the police and}} {{remained}} determined {{that he did not want}} his parents to be present during questioning, however Newman's father had arrived sometime after to ask for the questioning to stop until a lawyer would be consulted. During questioning Newman stated that he wanted to use the attack as a way to end abuse from his father, brother, and others. He said he was tired of being called [...] "stupid" [...] by them. He researched the Columbine High School massacre on the Internet and planned the attack about a week in advance. He conclusively decided against using a knife because [...] "he did not want to be up close when <b>blood</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of any of the victims." [...] The night before the attack, Newman's father had given him a collection of ammunition which included three live [...]38 caliber rounds. When his parents left the house to eat, he took his mother's handgun from a small safe in his father's closet and hid it in his backpack.|$|E

60|$|Then the Master Horse {{decided to}} stick to his old tactics again, and {{suddenly}} went off at a gallop. He headed down the slope, taking the steep places at a rush, swerving neither to the right nor to the left, and, as they rode down, the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind the approaching skirmishers of oak and hawthorn. They skirted a sudden hollow with the pool of a spring, rank weeds and silver bushes. The ground grew softer and the grass taller, and {{on the right-hand side}} and the left came scattered bushes of May--still splashed with belated blossom. Presently the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing rider, and little flashes and gouts of <b>blood</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> on horse and man. Then the way opened again.|$|E
60|$|Came a straggling volley again, {{like a man}} {{running a}} metal hammer very rapidly along iron corrugations, and this time people were {{dropping}} all over the road. One white-faced man not a score of yards away fell with a curse and a sob, struggled up, staggered for some yards with blood running abundantly from his neck, and fell and never stirred again. Another went down upon his back clumsily in the roadway and lay wringing his hands faster and faster until suddenly with a movement like a sigh they dropped inert by his side. A straw-hatted youth in a flannel suit ran and stopped and ran again. He seemed to be holding something red and strange to his face with both hands; above them his eyes were round and anxious. <b>Blood</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> between his fingers. He went right past the hotel and stumbled and suddenly sprawled headlong at the opposite corner. The majority of the crowd had already vanished into doorways and side streets. But there was still shouting {{and there was still}} a remnant of amazed and angry men in the roadway--and one or two angry women. They were not fighting. Indeed they were unarmed, but if they had had weapons now they would certainly have used them.|$|E

5000|$|The 13-minute <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> (1966) uses {{similarly}} manipulated {{recordings of}} a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused Harlem Six, who was severely injured by police. The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police about his beating. The spoken line includes the phrase [...] "to let the bruise’s <b>blood</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to show them." [...] Reich rerecorded the fragment [...] "come out to show them" [...] on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech's rhythmic and tonal patterns. In 1999, Rolling Stone magazine dubbed Reich [...] "The Father of Sampling" [...] and compared his work with the parallel evolution of hip-hop culture by DJs such as Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash.|$|R

2500|$|Bleeding, says Hildegard, {{should be}} done when the moon is waning, because then the [...] "blood is low" [...] (77:23-25). Men should be bled {{from the age of}} twelve (120:32) to eighty (121:9), but women, because they have more of the {{detrimental}} humors, up to the age of one hundred (121:24). For therapeutic bleeding, use the veins nearest the diseased part (122:19); for preventive bleeding, use the large veins in the arms (121:35-122:11), because they are like great rivers whose tributaries irrigate the body (123:6-9, 17-20). 24 From a strong man, take [...] "the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp" [...] (119:20); from a weak one, [...] "the amount that an egg of moderate size can hold" [...] (119:22-23). Afterward, let the patient rest for three days and give him undiluted wine (125:30), because [...] "wine is the blood of the earth" [...] (141:26). This blood can be used for prognosis; for instance, [...] "if the <b>blood</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> turbid like a man's breath, and if there are black spots in it, {{and if there is a}} waxy layer around it, then the patient will die, unless God restore him to life" [...] (124:20-24).|$|R

In three separate letters to Cromwell the Duchess repeated the accusation that the Duke had 'set his women to bind me till <b>blood</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> at my fingers' ends, and pinnacled me, and sat on my breast till I spit blood, and he never punished them'. Howard responded to the stream of allegations by writing that 'I think the apparent false lies were never contrived by a wife of her husband that she doth daily increase of me'.|$|E
