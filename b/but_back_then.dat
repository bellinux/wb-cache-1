Daily {{who played}} Baby Doll {{says it was}} [...] "a very {{frustrating}} thing for me" [...] to not sing in the film [...] "Because Diane Lane was singing, and I remember thinking, “Ah!” It was so frustrating for me. It was painful. Because I {{wanted to be on}} that stage singing with those guys... <b>But</b> <b>back</b> <b>then</b> I always played those quirky characters. I didn’t get those fancy leads. I got those best friend of the leads, quirky, funny characters. Hookers with a heart of gold. Weirdos." ...|$|E

Grandin has described herself as the [...] "nerdy kid" [...] whom everyone ridiculed. She has described occasions when she walked down the hallways and her fellow students would taunt her by saying [...] "tape recorder" [...] because of her habit of repetitive speech. Grandin states, [...] "I could laugh about it now, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>then</b> it really hurt." ...|$|E

2500|$|The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn't be used, {{as there}} would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the {{designers}} used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said [...] "people ask {{me all the time}} [...] "Why didn't you just use 3D?" [...] Well, that's easy to say now we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>then</b> you just didn't. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn't accurate on a lot of the cards. Nowadays I'd do it all in 3D." [...] Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time.|$|E
2500|$|An {{actor who}} {{performed}} regularly at the Adelphi {{in the latter}} half of the 19th century, William Terriss, was stabbed to death during the run of ‘Secret Service’ on 16 December 1897 whilst entering the Theatre by the royal entrance in Maiden Lane which he used as a private entrance. [...] This is now recorded on a plaque on the wall by the stage door. [...] Outside a neighbouring pub, a sign says that the killer was one of the theatre's stage hands, but Richard Archer Prince committed the murder. [...] It has been said that Terriss' ghost haunts the theatre. [...] Terriss' daughter was Ellaline Terriss, a famous actress, and her husband, actor-manager Seymour Hicks managed the Adelphi for some years at the end of the 19th century. [...] The stage door of the current Adelphi is in Maiden Lane <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>then</b> it was in Bull Inn Court. William Terriss would later have a Theatre named after him, the Terriss Theatre in Rotherhithe, later known as the Rotherhithe Hippodrome.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' <b>But</b> <b>back</b> <b>then,</b> I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, because you never really know someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|E

5000|$|This {{attitude}} was explained in 1996 by Chief Apostle Richard Fehr, while church spokesman Peter Johanning elaborated {{on it in}} 2003. Johanning gave an account of a Jugendfreund article of July 1933, in which [...] "allegiance" [...] was already invoked shortly after Hitler's seizure of power. By referencing Sir 10 EU, that text legitimized the relation of church and state, [...] "It may be regarded as naïve today, <b>but</b> age <b>back</b> <b>then</b> revealed different reasonings".|$|R

50|$|Daez's {{first major}} break {{as an actor}} came when he landed the role of Lumad, one of Marian Rivera's love {{interests}} in the epic series, Amaya. He later appeared in the primetime series My Beloved, where he first had the opportunity of working with Torres. The two never had scenes together, <b>but</b> everyone, <b>back</b> <b>then,</b> kept teasing them to each other. Unknown to both, they will end up as a pair in this afternoon drama series.|$|R
50|$|The series did {{contain some}} {{stereotype}}s. For instance, Hashimoto {{was an expert}} in judo and the ninja arts, but never used his skills to harm anyone. Today, this {{could be seen as}} a stereotype <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>then,</b> it was unexpected. He also frequently told stories about Japan to an American reporter named G.I.

50|$|The Jatimatic submachine gun is {{an example}} of a firearm where the bore axis is {{inclined}} against the bolt and the rest of the firearm in order to redirect the recoil force slightly upwards.The KRISS Vector submachine gun uses a more elaborate mechanical articulated mechanism which allows the block and bolt to recoil not just rearward like most other firearms, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> and <b>then</b> 'vectored' down off-axis along a rail system behind the weapon's magazine well to reduce muzzle rise and felt recoil.|$|R
5000|$|The creators {{spoke of}} the series' {{authenticity}} in a 1990 interview, with Lovece saying, [...] "Every car, for example, is a real car. We have a drag race {{in one of the}} issues, and the cars are a '56 Dodge and a '57 Chevy". Okamoto said of a scene involving a motorcycle, [...] "We were going to put a Harley in the book, <b>but</b> ... kids <b>back</b> <b>then</b> couldn't afford a motorcycle as expensive as that, so most of them used Indian brand bikes, like actor Marlon Brando did in film The Wild One." ...|$|R

50|$|These {{dwellings}} {{are very}} helpful in giving a better look {{into the lives of}} the Chacoan people and how they had to adapt to the changing environment around them. As avid farmers who depended on their fields for food, they needed to move when the soil could no longer provide the nutrients for their crops. Nowadays, there are techniques of rotating crops, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> <b>then</b> there was no such strategy.

50|$|The {{arbitrary}} powers (constitution forming, legislative, {{executive and}} other) exercised {{by the military}} council had not attracted legal scrutiny or caused the judiciary to issue rulings on their validity or constitutionality.

50|$|For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle, but is inexperienced. Queen Clarisse {{provides}} an ancestral wooden leg decoy {{to make it}} look like she's riding sidesaddle.

At a garden party, Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia's relationship with Andrew; Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting she doesn't love Andrew. Frustrated, she argues, but instead gets bombarded by a kiss. At first, she kisses him <b>back</b> <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>backs</b> away.
