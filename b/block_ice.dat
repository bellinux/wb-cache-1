50|$|An <b>Ice</b> <b>block</b> {{occurs when}} the icee can find another Ice within one step and arm's reach. If this happens, the icer must drop and chug both ices, the {{original}} presented Ice and the new <b>blocking</b> <b>Ice.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>blocking</b> is a {{recreational}} {{activity in which}} individuals {{race to the bottom}} of a hill sitting on large <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice.</b> In the United States <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> is thought to be regional, occurring in the West. The only equipment needed is some large <b>blocks</b> of thick <b>ice</b> and clothing, preferably padded. Hessian sacks or old towels have been recommended to sit on. Enthusiasts have been known to make [...] "customized" [...] <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> by freezing ropes into them to act as handles, and mixing colouring agents into the water prior to freezing.|$|R
5000|$|... solute {{diffusion}} - this {{depends on}} the fact that brine inclusions trapped in ice will begin to migrate toward the warmer end of the <b>ice</b> <b>block.</b> The <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> is warmest at the water-ice interface, thus pushing the brine out into the water surrounding the ice.|$|R
50|$|It {{is built}} in a Palladian style with six bays built over three floors (including basement) made of course rubble with fine {{limestone}} dressings. Adjoining {{the main part of}} the building and connected by single story arcades are two storey wings, creating a courtyard. In the grounds are stable <b>block,</b> <b>ice</b> house and other outbuildings.|$|E
50|$|William Besley (or Beasley), {{son-in-law}} of Daniel Windiate, owned {{a general}} store, which also later {{served as a}} post office, election hall, Sunday school and Saturday night dance hall. It even housed Meinrad Hangee’s tin shop., and <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> was cut from Loon Lake by Pittman and Dean Ice House and sold throughout the area.|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork {{rated the}} album 7.7 out of 10 observing that [...] "Friedlander wields not only unfathomable {{technical}} ability but also uncommon inquisitiveness tailed by imagination. <b>Block</b> <b>Ice,</b> more personal than his previous solo work, {{is the product}} of such breadth: In his hands, the cello is capable of long, daunting tones, hanging, impressionistic pizzicato phrases, and short, furious hybrid bursts of both".|$|E
50|$|At Torre del Reloj, {{teams had}} to load three <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice</b> into a wooden cart and then {{transport}} it to Plaza Fernández de Madrid. Once there, they would exchange the <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice</b> {{for their next}} clue.|$|R
5000|$|For {{areas on}} land, as the Puget Lobe receded, <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice</b> broke off and became separate. The melting glacier {{produced}} streams which carried sediment. The {{bottom of the}} <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> became buried in sediment. As the <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice</b> melted, it left depressions in the ground called kettles. Some of these kettles filled up with water to become kettle lakes and kettle ponds. (see Kettle (landform)) ...|$|R
50|$|The company {{opened a}} {{storefront}} in the Strand, London {{in the summer}} 1844. Every day, workers would put a large <b>block</b> of <b>ice</b> in the window, {{and none of the}} typical neighborhood residents had ever seen a <b>block</b> of <b>ice</b> anywhere before. As a gimmick, the workers would put a newspaper {{on the other side of}} the <b>block</b> of <b>ice</b> so that passers-by could read the print through the ice, from outside the store looking into the window.|$|R
50|$|Mason {{transferred}} to the 48th Aviation Company (United States) in May 1966, although he called it the 49th in the book. He continued to fly helicopters, including assault missions for the 101st Airborne in Dak To as part of Operation Hawthorne in June 1966. Mason carried out other flying tasks and tells funny stories {{about life in the}} 48th including flying drunk and trading for <b>block</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{ice hockey}} rink built in [...] Moonah, an inner suburb of Hobart at 7 Main Road, Moonah. The surface was a {{standard}} international size of 16000sq ft, measuring 85ft x 185ft and contained suitable plant to enable the production of <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> for public consumption and provide cool storage lockers to store fruit and other perishable goods. The formation of Tasmanian Glaciarium Ltd. into a public company occurred on 6 July 1950. The Rink differed from any other rinks built in Australia {{as it was the}} only open air rink at the time.The rink was opened on 23 October 1950 by the Premier of Tasmania, [...] Robert Cosgrove after being introduced by the Managing director of Tasmanian Glaciarium Ltd. Mr. R.L. Worsley to the thousands in attendance.|$|E
5000|$|Yaoyue (...) is {{the first}} {{mistress}} of Yihua Palace. Although she possesses beauty, charisma and skill, she is described by Jiang Feng as [...] "not a living person or human being, but fire, a <b>block,</b> <b>ice</b> or a sword instead". Jiang Feng rejects her and elopes with one of Yihua Palace's slave girls, Hua Yuenu. Yaoyue is angered and she pursues and hunts down the couple. After Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu die, Yaoyue intends to kill their twin boys but Lianxing stops her. The sisters choose one of the twins and raise him as their son and groom {{him to be the}} heir to Yihua Palace. According to Lianxing, before Yaoyue and Yan Nantian mastered all their respective skills, Yaoyue was slightly better than Yan, so she is actually the most powerful martial artist in the novel.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{pressure}} on the grass from <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> can damage the grass and {{has resulted in the}} activity often being banned or restricted by park authorities and groundskeepers. The Slicer All-Season Sled by Ice Meister is a commercially available sled that uniquely incorporates the concept of <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> in order for it to be used on grass during the summer (as well as on snow during the winter without the <b>ice</b> <b>blocks).</b> Because the Slicer Sled utilizes lighter and thinner <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> with a large surface area, it does not damage the grass the way that traditional <b>ice</b> <b>blocking</b> can.|$|R
50|$|The ice used can be {{in solid}} pellet form or shaved from a larger <b>block</b> of <b>ice.</b> The shaved <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> {{produces}} a less dense ice medium and is more delicate than the solid pellet system.|$|R

50|$|Zamboni {{was born}} in 1901 in Eureka, Utah, to Italian immigrants. His parents soon bought a farm in Lava Hot Springs near Pocatello, Idaho, where he grew up. In 1920, he moved with his parents to the harbor {{district}} of Los Angeles, where his older brother George was operating an auto repair shop. After Frank attended a trade school in Chicago, he {{and his younger brother}} Lawrence opened an electrical supply business in 1922 in the Los Angeles suburb of Hynes (now part of Paramount). The following year he married and eventually had three children, a son and two daughters. In 1927, he and Lawrence added an ice-making plant and entered the <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> business. They continued their ice business in 1939, but saw little future in that business with the advent of electrically operated refrigeration units. They decided to use their excess refrigeration equipment to open an ice rink nearby.|$|E

30|$|SQUID rock {{magnetometer}} (SRM- 760; 2 G Enterprises) {{was used}} to measure remanent magnetization of ice block samples. First, a <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> sample from each of the three sites was prepared and natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was measured by stepwise demagnetization with AC magnetic field of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40  mT. Second, anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) was imparted in DC magnetic field of 50  mT and AC magnetic field of 80  mT, then the samples were stepwise demagnetized with AC magnetic field of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40  mT.|$|E

50|$|As glaciers {{advanced}} and retreated through Minnesota, {{some of the}} ice that stagnated was more difficult to melt than other areas. The glaciers continued to deposit sediments around and sometimes on top of these isolated <b>ice</b> <b>blocks.</b> As the <b>ice</b> <b>blocks</b> melted, they left behind depressions in the landscape. The depressions filled with snowmelt and rainwater producing kettle lakes.|$|R
40|$|This paper simulates the {{formation}} of <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> by the unstructured finite volume method. The mathematical model {{is based upon the}} explicit heat conduction equation with the fixed grid, latent heat source approach. The main contributions on the solidification models are the comparison of pseudo-implicit temporal scheme and the gradually changing conductivities at solid-fluid interface against the explicit scheme and the use of solid conductivity, respectively. The temperature profiles, rates of ice formation and transfer energy in a 1 D problem with prescribed boundary temperature are first compared with exact solutions. The results show that the most suitable schemes are still the combination of explicit and solid conductivity schemes. Then, the convective boundary condition is considered. Finally, the case study is simulated under 3 D situations. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} ICE CUBE is {{impacted}} via definite observational limits, a potentially serious flaw in estimated collection ability as predicted {{by a short}} fall in Monte Carlo simulations, and a datum that the CP violations connected with Baryogenesis are not predicted by SUSY accurately. All these considerations, plus the known datum that water is a superior medium for data collection than <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> argue pervasively in first building neutrino physics collection systems first in the Mediterranean sea, and relying upon ICECUBE as a back up to planned and running systems in place near Europe. This is made urgent also in the known datum that both the near European sub continent facilities now have bio luminence problems in the water, but have the same sensitivity as the South polar region neutrino astrophysics facilities now planned fo...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{over the}} range of 2. 2 to 12. 0 GHz show that CO 2 snow is a {{slightly}} lossy dielectric whose constant varies with density following the Rayleigh formula to 1. 27 g/cu cm. It is independent of frequency and does not vary with temperature in the 113 to 183 K range; frequency independence and agreement with the Rayleigh fit are obtained from measurements on dry <b>block</b> <b>ice.</b> The dielectric constant of solid CO 2 in block form is {{lower than that of}} solid water ice or solid rock; in powder form, the constant for CO 2 is also lower than that of H 2 O (snow) or soils. These measurements may be useful in limiting the interpretations of the Viking radio reflection experiment; a radio value of 3. 0 for the dielectric constant near the North Pole would be strong evidence against the presence of cm thicknesses of CO 2 in that region...|$|E

40|$|Economists conomists {{have long}} puzzled over the astounding {{differences}} in productiv-ity between firms and countries. For example, looking at disaggregated data on U. S. manufacturing industries, Syverson (2004 a) found that plants at the 90 th percentile produced {{four times as}} much as the plant in the 10 th percentile on a per-employee basis. Only half of this difference in labor productivity could be accounted for by differential inputs, such as capital intensity. Syverson looked at industries defined at the four-digit level in the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system (now the North American Industry Classification System or NAICS) like “Bakeries and Tortilla Manufacturing ” or “Plastics Product Manufacturing. ” Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) show large differences in total factor productivity even within very homogeneous goods industries such as boxes and <b>block</b> <b>ice.</b> Some of these productivity differences across firms and plants are temporary, but in large part they persist over time. At the country level, Hall and Jones (1999) and Jones and Romer (2009) show how the stark differences in productivity across countries account for a substantial fraction of the differences in average per capita income...|$|E
40|$|Two cell {{permeable}} peptide fluoromethyl ketone inhibitors of Interleukin- 1 � converting enzyme (ICE) family proteases {{were tested}} as inhibitors of apoptotic cell death of T lymphocytes {{at various stages}} of differentiation. The CPP- 32 –like protease activity in apoptotic cell lysates was blocked by both the ICE inhibitor Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) -fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD-FMK) {{as well as its}} truncated analog Boc-Asp(OMe) -fluoromethyl ketone (BD-FMK), which failed to <b>block</b> <b>ICE.</b> In vitro apoptotic death in murine thymocytes triggered by the independent agents dexamethasone, etoposide, radiation, anti-Fas, and anti-CD 3 was blocked equally well by BD-FMK and ZVAD-FMK, but not by the control reagent Cbz-Phe-Ala-fluoromethyl ketone. In activated T cell blasts, while anti-CD 3 / Fas-induced death was almost completely inhibited by both ZVAD-FMK and BD-FMK, death induced by dexamethasone, etoposide, or irradiation was more sensitive to inhibition by BD-FMK. In the murine T cell line CTLL- 2, apoptotic death induced by IL- 2 withdrawal, etoposide, or dexamethasone was inhibited by BD-FMK, while ZVAD-FMK was without effect. These data indicate that ICEfamily proteases comprise a common functional step in distinct T cell apoptotic death pathways, but suggest that different family members are likely to be critical in various differentiate...|$|E
30|$|Figure  8 c shows {{response}} in X (black curve), Y (red curve) and Z axis (blue curve) gradiometers for thin model sample with volcanic ash particles of JARE 54 -ASH 3 mixed with epoxy glue. The <b>block</b> <b>ice</b> sample was melted, and the extracted particles were mixed with epoxy glue {{to make a}} half-cylinder model sample with 29  mm radius and 1  mm thickness. The sample was magnetized in X axis with a DC magnetic field of 25  mT. Among three axes, Z axis response has a highest peak of 152  pT, whereas X axis response has a negative peak of − 85  pT. Y axis response is nearly zero for the whole length, which is predicted from the theoretical calculation. Z axis response could be well compared with the theoretical response with a thickness of 1  mm. The distances of two zero crossings are 16  mm for both measured and theoretical responses. Negative lobes for theoretical response are 19  % of the peak value on both sides, whereas those for measured response are 22 and 17  % with asymmetry. The asymmetry might be caused by slight tilt of half-cylinder model slice relative to the axes of the gradiometer pickup coil.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> in Sc_ri­oara Cave, NW Romania, is {{preserved}} due to unusual climate and permafrost conditions within the cave. The air {{temperature in the}} cave is governed by the winter cold, the cooling effect of the <b>ice</b> <b>block,</b> and only to a minor extent influenced by summer temperatures. At present, the <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> is slowly thinning, but the present-day climate is sufficiently cold to preserve the permafrost conditions caused by the cold air trapped in the cave. In February 2003 a 22. 5 m long ice core was recovered from the <b>ice</b> <b>block.</b> Approximately 200 <b>ice</b> layers have been identified by visual examination. Ice crystallographic analyses indicate a steady growth of ice crystals with depth {{and there is no}} sign of deformation. Carbon- 14 dates on wood-related samples collected from a natural vertical exposure of the <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> indicate that the ice spans more than 1000 years.

50|$|In this game, players control Dana. The goal of {{each stage}} {{is to put}} out all the fires. The fires are {{extinguished}} by either kicking an <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> into the flame, or dropping one from above. Dana's moveset includes the abilities to walk left and right across level ground. He can also climb {{on top of a}} solid block to his left or right, provided it is only one block tall and there is nothing on top of it. Dana can also push <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice,</b> which will then slide until they fall or hit a wall. Dana's most important ability is his ice magic. He can create and destroy <b>blocks</b> of <b>ice.</b> As the gameplay is grid-based, Dana's ice magic affects the squares beneath him and to the left and right, similar to Lode Runner. If the <b>ice</b> <b>block</b> is placed horizontally adjacent to a wall, pipe, jar, or another <b>ice</b> <b>block,</b> it will freeze to the adjacent surface.|$|R
