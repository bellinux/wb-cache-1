5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
500|$|Writer James Baldwin, who {{had been}} a friend of MalcolmX's, was in London when he heard the news of the assassination. He responded with indignation towards the reporters {{interviewing}} him, shouting, [...] "You did it! It is because of you—the men that created this white supremacy—that this man is dead. You are not guilty, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it.... Your mills, your cities, your rape of a continent started all this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene of}} Sniper Wolf {{wounding}} Meryl {{to set a}} trap for Snake was included among the top ten cutscenes in the Metal Gear series by Jeremy M. Loss of Joystick Division in 2010 and ranked as the seventh most shocking surprise in video games ("subverting the power fantasy") by George Reith of GamingBolt in 2012. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole noted how the [...] "brillantly manipulative" [...] Metal Gear Solid can make the player feel guilty, even as [...] "it {{makes no sense to}} wish that you hadn't killed Sniper Wolf — that is, [...] properly to regret your actions — because it is a task that the game demands be fulfilled before you can progress." [...] In 2012, Ryan King of PLAY included the character of Sniper Wolf among the six [...] "things you didn’t want to kill (<b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> anyway)" [...] and Ian Dransfield from the same magazine included her among the top [...] "bad guys you wanted to win". In 2015, Aleksander Gilyadov from VentureBeat included Sniper Wolf's death among six most memorable Metal Gear moments opining it [...] "still remains {{as one of the most}} poignant and beautiful scenes in the entire series. It also displays just how multilayered, benign, and well-written Kojima’s characters (both heroes and villains) really are." [...] That same year, Javy Gwaltney from Paste had this scene top his list of the saddest moments in Metal Gear.|$|E
