Gas seal separates the fluid end from the power end, thus allowing infinite dry running operation and solids-handling capability to 40 percent particulates. Since the back end is separated, fluid-lubricated journal bearings are not required, and antifriction ball bearings, are used instead providing stiff rotor construction, with (L^ 3) /(D^ 4) ratio as low as 9. 3, which significantly minimizes deflections of the shaft.

Abandoned coal mines are currently less studied than other reservoirs but {{could also be used}} for the storage of carbon dioxide. However the problem of shaft sealing appears to be central as far as the safety, economic, ecologic and health stakes of geological storage are concerned. The purpose of the present work is the study of shaft sealing in the framework of CO 2 storage projects. More precisely the problem consists in the numerical study, with the LAGAMINE finite elements code, of gas transfers around a shaft seal system. A coupled hydro-mechanical model of unsaturated geomaterials is presented. The response of the flow model is first studied through a simple synthetic problem simulating the injection of gas in a concrete-made column. It stands out of this first modeling that the advection of the gas phase represents the main transfer mechanism of CO 2 in highly unsaturated materials. Furthermore the setting of a bentonite <b>barrier</b> <b>seal</b> allows limiting considerably gas influx to the biosphere.

The formation of this <b>barrier</b> (<b>seal)</b> was assessed by measuring the decay of injury current at the cut end; its location at the cut end {{was determined by the}} exclusion of fluorescent hydrophilic dye at the cut end. When a membrane-incorporating styryl dye was placed in the bath prior to axonal transection and a hydrophilic dye was placed in the bath just after axonal transection, many vesicles near the barrier at the cut axonal end had their limiting membrane labeled with the styryl dye and their contents labeled with the hydrophilic dye, indicating that these vesicles originated from the axolemma by endocytosis. This barrier does not form in Ca 2 +-free salines. Similar collections of vesicles have been observed at regions of plasmalemmal damage in many cell types. From these and other data, we propose that plasmalemmal lesions in most eukaryotic cells (including axons) are repaired by vesicles, at least some of which arise by endocytosis induced by Ca 2 + inflow resulting from the plasmalemmal damage.

40|$|Lecturepg. 27 In recent years, {{manufacturers}} of mechanical seals have been faced with meeting more stringent leakage requirements along with reliability and extended MTBPM.

Some {{of the test}} results are described along with analysis performed to verify sealing performance on pusher and nonpusher seals in flashing and nonflashing hydrocarbons conducted per API Standard 682,? Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps,? testing requirements. API Standard 682 ?s mission {{was to create a}} specification for seals that would have a good probability of meeting emission regulations and have a life of at least three years. These testing requirements are set up to simulate refinery pump operation that entails continuous duty, pump shutoffs, fluid vaporization, or low pressure operation and to run the seals without a flush. While there are no pass/fail criteria established, the seals are expected to perform within regulated emission limits and demonstrate a minimum three year life. Testing seals to meet this standard required some face material evaluation and some optimization of the seal design parameters to improve performance. The testing was verified with finite element analysis to establish proper guidelines, in order to maintain design integrity with intermediate seal sizes. Two classes of mechanical seals were studied: *Process or liquid lubricated seals *Gas barrier lubricated seals. Both single and dual liquid lubricated, or contacting face seals, were tested to the standard?s requirements. In addition, tests were conducted to verify seal performance limits and to demonstrate stable operation, while being exposed to varying steady state pressures.

40|$|The {{assembly}} joints {{of modem}} solid rocket motor cases are generally sealed using conventional O-ring type seals. The 5500 + F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic insulation. Special compounds are used to fill insulation gaps {{leading up to the}} seals to prevent a direct flowpath to them. Design criteria require that the seals should not experience torching or charring during operation, or their sealing ability would be compromised. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings of the Space Shuttle solid rocket nozzle assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. NASA is investigating different approaches for preventing torching or charring of the primary O-rings. One approach is to implement a braided rope seal upstream of the primary O-ring to serve as a thermal barrier that prevents the hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals. This paper presents flow, resiliency, and thermal resistance for several types of NASA rope seals braided out of carbon fibers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the seals when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. Rope seals braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over six minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Room and high temperature flow tests are presented for the carbon seals for different amounts of linear compression. Room temperature compression tests were performed to assess seal resiliency and unit preloads as a function of compression. The thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>seal</b> was tested in a subscale "char" motor test in which the seal sealed an intentional defect in the gap insulation.

40|$|The petrophysical {{properties}} of cap rocks and intraformational barriers can constrain {{the carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) containment volumes of potential geosequestration sites. Characterisation of regional seals and intraformational barriers requires {{an understanding of the}} seal capacity of the cap rock or <b>barrier.</b> <b>Seal</b> capacity is the capillary pressure (or column height) at which a trapped fl uid commences to leak through a seal rock. Seal rocks are effective due to very fi ne pore and pore-throat sizes that result in low porosities and permeabilities. These in turn generate high capillary threshold pressures. High threshold pressures, together with wettability and interfacial tension (IFT) properties determine the fi nal column height that a seal can hold. Wettability and IFT {{play an important role in}} the geological storage of CO 2 through their effect on seal capacity (CO 2 column height) with respect to capillary pressure, thereby controlling the potential for the movement of CO 2 through the seal and affecting ultimate reservoir storage volumes. Mercury injection capillary pressure analysis has been used extensively in the petroleum industry to determine the effectiveness of the top seal in relation to hydrocarbon column height retention. With the burgeoning interest in geological storage of CO 2, this technology can be applied to establish the suitability of a top seal for containment of CO 2; however, the role of IFT and wettability in the CO 2 -water-rock systems is not well understood. It is unclear how supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) affects these two properties, particularly as the water front becomes saturated with scCO 2 and eventually becomes miscible with the scCO 2 at high pressure reservoir conditions. Selected examples of top and intraformational seals from the Bowen, Otway, Gippsland and Cooper basins are discussed in light of new experimental evidence on wettability and IFT variations in the CO 2 -water-rock system. These variations may be more signifi cant than in hydrocarbon-water-rock systems and based on non-wetting assumptions, the calculated CO 2 column heights may be signifi cantly different than previously predicted.

Occludin was detected in mouse and rat and claudin- 3 was found only in mice. Thus, we selected claudin- 11 for further analysis of localization.

A seal construction incorporating the Rene 41 spring tube was fabricated and tested against the baseline Inconel X- 750 spring tube seal. Although resiliency improvements were not as dramatic as in previous tests with the spring tubes alone, seals incorporating the Rene 41 spring tube exhibited an average 20 percent resiliency enhancement up to 1750 F when compared to seals containing the Inconel spring tube. In addition, the seals with the Rene 41 spring tubes showed less reduction in resiliency as temperatures increased above 1200 F. Results also indicated the Saffil (Saffil Ltd.) insulation in the core of the seal contributed more to resiliency than previously thought. Leakage data did not demonstrate an improvement with the seal containing the Rene 41 spring tube.

If the casing cannot be cut and pulled, a section milling operation has traditionally been the solution. The P&A is an expensive operation that offers no value creation, and the economic situation of the industry along with stricter regulations is causing an active search to strongly reduce rig-time and costs. To address the situation, this thesis is compiled with an investigation into the P&A industry with a particular focus on the section milling operation and its requirements. The challenges of section milling have been discussed in depth with relations to performance enhancement, and statistics has been presented and compared with novel methods with the aim to define improvement potential. Investigated alternatives include perforate, wash and cement (PWC), upward section milling, melting, chemical degradation and the crushing of tubular. The results show that the main disadvantage of the section milling is the swarf generation and handling of it with addition to HSE issues, violent vibrations and plug verification. The improvement of the cutters and the milling fluid has been presented as the most important factors for performance enhancement. The investigation into novel methods show that several technologies have the potential to substitute section milling and to significantly reduce duration and cost, with the largest documented potential being PWC’s ability to cut the expected 24 -day multiple casing section mill operation by 83 %.
