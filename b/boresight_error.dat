40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} a {{systematic}} approach to radome design is presented. The problem is formulated {{as a global}} optimization procedure such that the radome performance is optimized by properly adjusting {{the thickness of the}} radome layer over the entire radome surface. In this approach the thickness profile is parameterized via B-splines representation. Simulated annealing technique is applied to finding the best thickness profile so that the maximum <b>boresight</b> <b>error</b> is re-duced as small as possible over the entire range of the antenna look angle. A two-dimensional design example is given. The best possible thickness profile is found and the <b>boresight</b> <b>error</b> is reduced considerably compared to that due to a uniform layer. The method is general and can be applied without difficulty to other realistic three-dimensional radomes of arbitrary shapes. I...|$|E

However, {{from the viewpoint of}} electromagnetics, the radomes also lead to the degradation of radiation characteristics of the enclosed antennas, such as gain loss, <b>boresight</b> <b>error</b> and the rise in side-lobe level [3, 4], which can be represented by the distortion of radiation pattern. Therefore, minimizing the degradation of radiation characteristics and maximizing structural stiffness are the prior purposes in the design of modern high-performance antenna-radome systems [5, 6].|$|E

40|$|This study explores parametrically as a {{function}} of wavelength the degrading effects of several common optical aberrations (defocus, astigmatism, wavefront tilts, etc.), using the heterodyne mixing efficiency factor as the merit function. A 60 cm diameter aperture beam expander with an expansion ratio of 15 : 1 and a primary mirror focal ratio of f/ 2 was designed for the study. An HDOS copyrighted analysis program determined the value of merit function for various optical misalignments. With sensitivities provided by the analysis, preliminary error budget and tolerance allocations were made for potential optical wavefront <b>errors</b> and <b>boresight</b> <b>errors</b> during laser shot transit time. These were compared with the baseline l. 5 m CO 2 LAWS and the optical fabrication state of the art (SOA) as characterized by the Hubble Space Telescope. Reducing wavelength and changing optical design resulted in optical quality tolerances within the SOA both at 2 and 1 micrometers. However, advanced sensing and control devices would be necessary to maintain on-orbit alignment. Optical tolerance for maintaining boresight stability would have to be tightened by a factor of 1. 8 for a 2 micrometers system and by 3. 6 for a 1 micrometers system relative to the baseline CO 2 LAWS. Available SOA components could be used for operation at 2 micrometers but operation at 1 micrometers does not appear feasible...|$|R

Two sets of side lobes have been found, lying in planes located 1600 from the vertical. The largest of the side lobes is 22 db below the main beam in amplitude. These side lobes are produced by energy scattered from flanges which run at angles of 1300 from the vertical. A third, but much smaller set of side lobes {{is located on the}} vertical plane. Transmission tests indicate an average on-way loss of 1 db. This is twice that previously reported. VSWR measurements show a variation ranging from 1. 04 to 1. 10, while the VSWR of the antenna is 1. 08. The maximum vertical <b>boresight</b> <b>error</b> was measured to be 0. 23 milliradian.

40|$|A time {{division}} multiplexing and a quadraphase combining dual channel system were analyzed, designed, and tested. Analyses performed include the following: (1) <b>boresight</b> <b>error</b> {{as a function of}} the error channel bandwidth; (2) error channel interference with the sum channel functions; (3) threshold performance; and (4) error channel crosstalk, linearity, and drift as a function of signal level, Doppler, and environment. Test results indicate that the {{time division}} multiplexing system meets the design goals of the program. However, careful selection and alignment of all gain controlled amplifiers are required along with temperature compensation of the angle channel gain. The quadraphase system crosstalk performance is comparatively poor (- 15 dB) with respect to the - 30 dB requirements and this consequently affects gain tracking performance. Gain tracking was found to be + or - 20 percent rather than the + or - 5 percent specification. Data for the two systems is compared and recommendations are presented...|$|E
40|$|Sandwich radomes are {{structures}} providing communication- and radar antennas with {{protection from}} the environment. The sandwich materials are designed to affect the electromagnetic radiation {{as little as possible}} with respect to transmission- and reflection loss, <b>boresight</b> <b>error,</b> <b>boresight</b> <b>error</b> slope, increased sidelobe levels and depolarization. In order to match the frequency response of the radome material to the specifications, simulation and optimization of the thickness and dielectric properties of the individual sandwich layers is done. To simulate the transmission- and reflection coefficients for sandwich materials a Matlab scripts has been developed. The script calculate the response for up to 10 different layers for incidence angles and frequencies defined by the user. Verification of the results has been done by comparing the simulated data to results in Kozakoff (2010) and show that the script works correctly. Waveguide measurement and calibration components have been designed and manufacturedin order to measure samples of dielectric materials and samples of complete radome sandwich materials. The results have been compared to results from simulations done in CST Microwave Studio and show a good match for complete sandwich materials and thicker dielectrics. However the measurement results for thin material samples show more deviation compared to the simulation results. The deviation seems to be dependent on the thickness of the sample. Two optimization routines have been developed in Matlab. The first compare the measuredresults from measurements to the simulated results from Matlab. Least square optimization is used to adjust the dielectric properties (relative permittivity and dielectric loss tangent) used by the simulation script in order to match the simulation values to the measured values. The results show good match of the optimized relative permittivity for a 22 mm thick sample of Teflon with the optimized value deviating 1. 3 % from the specified permittivity value. With decreasing thickness of the test samples the deviation increased to approximately 3 - 12 %. The optimized loss tangent values however show very large deviation from the specified values and should be treated as invalid. The main reasons are believed to be the low loss of the materials combined with the thickness relative to the measurement wavelength. The second optimization routine adjust the thickness of the individual layers to achieveminimum loss for one- or more predefined frequency bands. The results show that theoptimization work as intended. To investigate the effect of production errors/productiontolerances the core thickness of an A-sandwich has been adjusted with +/- 10 % from theoptimized thickness. The result show that the thickness deviation has a bigger impact onhigh frequencies. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} for high precision astrometry on ELTs will be challenging, with requirements {{in the range}} from 10 to 50 micro-arc-seconds for some instruments and science cases. Reducing and correctly calibrating the systematic and quasi-static errors introduced by optical surface distortions will be an important part of meeting these goals. In a recently submitted paper, we described an analytical Fourier domain model for evaluating these effects as the sum of three terms: (i) under-sampling errors, due to measuring the effects of static surface distortions using a finite number of discrete reference sources; (ii) unknown beam wander across the static surface distortions due to line-of-sight jitter or <b>boresighting</b> <b>errors,</b> and (iii) quasi-static errors due to slowly varying surface distortions. In this paper, we apply these methods to evaluating this term in the astrometry error budgets for the TMT Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the facility AO system, NFIRAOS. The inputs to this exercise include the original top-down allocations for this error term, the original optical surface specifications for IRIS and NFIRAOS as derived earlier on the basis of wavefront error requirements, our assessment of the feasible density and positioning accuracy for an array of calibration sources, and the expected beam wander due to tip/tilt jitter and bore-sighting errors between NFIRAOS and IRIS. The astrometry error computed for these initial parameters was considerably larger than the top-down allocation due to the contributions from the NFIRAOS double-pane entrance window, which is close to the system's input focal plane. The error can be reduced to fall within the allocation by defining tighter, but still feasible, specifications for these elements. We also evaluated the astrometry errors due to quasi-static drift of the figures of the NFIRAOS deformable mirrors, and determined that they are acceptable for RMS wavefront distortions of up to about 30 nm RMS.

40|$|Generalized fading {{has been}} an {{imminent}} {{part and parcel of}} wireless communications. It not only characterizes the wireless channel appropriately but also allows its utilization for further performance analysis of various types of wireless communication systems. Under the umbrella of generalized fading channels, a unified performance analysis of a free-space optical (FSO) link over the Malaga (M) atmospheric turbulence channel that accounts for pointing errors and both types of detection techniques (i. e. indirect modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) as well as heterodyne detection) is presented. Specifically, unified exact closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF), the cumulative distribution function (CDF), the moment generating function (MGF), and the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a single link FSO transmission system are presented, all in terms of the Meijer's G function except for the moments that is in terms of simple elementary functions. Then capitalizing on these unified results, unified exact closed-form expressions for various performance metrics of FSO link transmission systems are offered, such as, the outage probability (OP), the higher-order amount of fading (AF), the average error rate for binary and M-ary modulation schemes, and the ergodic capacity (except for IM/DD technique, where closed-form lower bound results are presented), all in terms of Meijer's G functions except for the higher-order AF that is in terms of simple elementary functions. Additionally, the asymptotic results are derived for all the expressions derived earlier in terms of the Meijer's G function in the high SNR regime in terms of simple elementary functions via an asymptotic expansion of the Meijer's G function. Furthermore, new asymptotic expressions for the ergodic capacity in the low as well as high SNR regimes are derived in terms of simple elementary functions via utilizing moments. All the presented results are verified via computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations. Besides addressing the pointing <b>errors</b> with zero <b>boresight</b> effects as has been addressed above, a unified capacity analysis of a FSO link that accounts for nonzero <b>boresight</b> pointing <b>errors</b> and both types of detection techniques (i. e. heterodyne detection as well as IM/DD) is also addressed. Specifically, an exact closed-form expression for the moments of the end-to-end SNR of a single link FSO transmission system is presented in terms of well-known elementary functions. Capitalizing on these new moments expressions, approximate and simple closed-form results for the ergodic capacity at high and low SNR regimes are derived for lognormal (LN), Rician-LN (RLN), and M atmospheric turbulences. All the presented results are verified via computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations. Based on the fact that FSO links are cost-effective, license-free, and can provide even higher bandwidths compared to the traditional radio-frequency (RF) links, the performance analysis of a dual-hop relay system composed of asymmetric RF and FSO links is presented. This is complemented by the performance analysis of a dual-branch transmission system composed of a direct RF link and a dual-hop relay composed of asymmetric RF and FSO links. The performance of the later scenario is evaluated under the assumption of the selection combining (SC) diversity and the maximal ratio combining (MRC) schemes. RF links are modeled by Rayleigh fading distribution whereas the FSO link is modeled by a unified GG fading distribution. More specifically, in this work, new exact closed-form expressions for the PDF, the CDF, the MGF, and the moments of the end-to-end SNR are derived. Capitalizing on these results, new exact closed-form expressions for the OP, the higher-order AF, the average error rate for binary and M-ary modulation schemes, and the ergodic capacity are offered. Cognitive radio networks (CRN) have also proved to improve the performance of wireless communication systems and hence based on this, the hybrid system analyzed above is extended with CRN technology wherein the outage and error performance analysis of a dual-hop transmission system composed of asymmetric RF channel cascaded with a FSO link is presented. For the RF link, an underlay cognitive network is considered where the secondary users share the spectrum with licensed primary users. Indoor femtocells act as a practical example for such networks. Specifically, it is assumed that the RF link applies power control to maintain the interference at the primary network below a predetermined threshold. While the RF channel is modeled by the Rayleigh fading distribution, the FSO link is modeled by a unified Gamma-Gamma turbulence distribution. The FSO link accounts for pointing errors and both types of detection techniques (i. e. heterodyne detection as well as IM/DD). With this model, a new exact closed-form expression is derived for the OP and the error rate of the end-to-end SNR of these systems in terms of the Meijer's G function and the Fox's H functions under amplify-and-forward relay schemes. All new analytical results are verified via computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations and are illustrated by some selected numerical results...|$|R

40|$|The Iterative DEsign of Antenna Structures (IDEAS) {{program is}} a finite element {{analysis}} and design optimization program with special features for the analysis and design of microwave antennas and associated sub-structures. As the principal structure analysis and design tool for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ground Antenna and Facilities Engineering section of NASA's Deep Space Network, IDEAS combines flexibility with easy use. The relatively small bending stiffness {{of the components of}} large, steerable reflector antennas allows IDEAS to use pinjointed (three translational degrees of freedom per joint) models for modeling the gross behavior of these antennas when subjected to static and dynamic loading. This facilitates the formulation of the redesign algorithm which has only one design variable per structural element. Input data deck preparation has been simplified by the use of NAMELIST inputs to promote clarity of data input for problem defining parameters, user selection of execution and design options and output requests, and by the use of many attractive and familiar features of the NASTRAN program (in many cases, NASTRAN and IDEAS formatted bulk data cards are interchangeable). Features such as simulation of a full symmetric structure based on analyses of only half the structure make IDEAS a handy and efficient analysis tool, with many features unavailable in any other finite element analysis program. IDEAS can choose design variables such as areas of rods and thicknesses of plates to minimize total structure weight, constrain the structure weight to a specified value while maximizing a natural frequency or minimizing compliance measures, and can use a stress ratio algorithm to size each structural member so that it is at maximum or minimum stress level for {{at least one of the}} applied loads. Calculations of total structure weight can be broken down according to material. Center of gravity weight balance, static first and second moments about the center of mass and optionally about a user-specified gridpoint, and lumped structure weight at grid points can also be calculated. Other analysis outputs include calculation of reactions, displacements, and element stresses due to specified gravity, thermal, and external applied loads; calculations of linear combinations of specific node displacements (e. g. to represent motions of rigid attachments not included in the structure model), natural frequency eigenvalues and eigenvectors, structure reactions and element stresses, and coordinates of effective modal masses.
