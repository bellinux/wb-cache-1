5|$|In April 1979 Imogen {{was present}} when the Queen Mother opened the new Britten–Pears School {{building}} in Snape. The building included a new library—the Gustav Holst Library—to which Imogen had donated {{a large amount}} of material, including books which her father had used in his own teaching career. She had intended that, after 1977, her retirement from the Aldeburgh Festival would be total, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> an exception in 1980 when she organised a 70th birthday celebration concert for Pears.|$|E

25|$|Dalglish {{has been}} married to Marina since 26 November 1974. The couple have four children, {{including}} Kelly, born 1975 and Paul, born 1977. Kelly is now a football presenter for BBC Radio 5 Live and Channel 5; Paul followed in his father's footsteps as a footballer, and is currently the head coach for Ottawa Fury FC. Dalglish's wife {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer in March 2003, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> a good recovery from the disease.|$|E

25|$|Marie {{admitted}} this, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> {{the gardener}} confirm {{that she gave}} him the arsenic to make rat-poison paste out of it. Their fears were momentarily allayed, but the next day, white residue was found {{at the bottom of a}} glass of sugar water that Marie had administered to Charles. A third doctor, René de Lespinasse, was called on 13 January. He suspected poison, but by then it was too late: Charles died a few hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of August 1889, Konstantin suffered a severe stroke that left his legs paralyzed and him unable to speak. The loss of his health struck the once vibrant Konstantin particularly hard. As an invalid, he depended from then on on the care of adjutants while confined in a bath chair. Konstantin was cared for by his wife, who gained a sort of revenge for his unfaithfulness and past humiliations. Alexandra Iosifovna did not expel Anna Kuznetsova and her children from the nearby house that Konstantin had provided for them, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> sure that Konstantin's attendants never took him there.|$|E
25|$|Following the New Year's Day episode where Ronnie and Roxy were killed-off after {{drowning}} in a swimming pool, the BBC released a 10-second alternate ending clip on their Snapchat account, in which Ronnie survives, finding Roxy's corpse on {{a pool table}} with Jack. It then cuts to a hospital where Ronnie is shown grieving when Roxy dies in hospital from a suspected drug overdose. Ronnie's death episode aired on 1 January 2017 <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> a further appearance on 5 January in the wedding video which Jack watches. She was also credited in another episode on 19 January 2017, making her last appearance as a corpse when Jack says goodbye to her.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Le Marchand {{moved from}} Worcestershire to Somerset, {{allowing}} her to compete in Division Two of the Women's County Championship. She made her debut in the competition against Surrey in May 2008, scoring 45 runs off 57 balls for her new county. She finished {{the season with a}} batting average of 41.00, joint second-highest on the team behind Elwyn Campbell. Playing in the middle order, her 45 on debut remained her highest score of the season, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> useful scores in both matches against Lancashire and remained unbeaten twice. She was once again selected to play in the Super Fours, playing four of six matches for the Rubies. She failed to pass 20 runs in any of her innings, although she remained not out on 19 against the Diamonds {{at the close of the}} innings.|$|E
25|$|She made 87 runs at 43.50 in five innings as Australia took a clean {{sweep of}} the ODIs. In the second match, Nitschke took 1/6 from eight overs and then made 31 from 36 balls as Australia reached their target of 176 with one wicket to spare, having been six not out from 14 balls in a one-run win in the opening match. In the fourth ODI, having been {{elevated}} to No. 7, Nitschke made 20 not out from 19 balls at the death and took 3/32 in an 85-run win, and she ended the series with 2/36 and three catches in a four-wicket win. In this match, she was promoted to No. 5, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> only 16 runs from 23 balls before being caught. Nitschke ended with seven wickets at 18.28 and an economy rate of 3.04.|$|E
25|$|Andrews had a {{quiet and}} {{ineffective}} 2004–05 WNCL season, taking only five wickets at 44.80 at an economy rate of 3.01 from ten matches. Her best performance {{came in a}} round-robin match against Victoria, taking 2/29 in a four-wicket defeat. The teams met again in the finals. In the first match, she took 0/30 from nine overs in a 21-run win. The second match saw a fightback from the Victorian bowlers, who dismissed New South Wales for 71, Andrews making 19 not out in a tail-wagging performance. She then took 1/10 from six overs but Victoria reached their target with five wickets in hand to square the series. Andrews took 0/11 from six overs to help restrict Victoria to 6/159, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> only one before being run out as the defending champions fell 50 runs short and ceded their title. Andrews ended the season with 23 runs at 23.00.|$|E

25|$|The Australian {{season ended}} with a home series against India in Adelaide. In the one-off Test, Nitschke—now {{promoted}} to No. 7—came in at 5/130 and made 18 from 27 balls before fallaing at 6/159, before Australia was out for 250. She then took 2/9 from eight overs, removing Devika Palshikar and Amita Sharma, as the hosts took a 157-run first innings lead and then enforced the follow on. She then took 1/29 from 26 overs, including 15 maidens, again dismissing Sharma, to help dismiss the tourists for 153 and seal victory by an innings and four runs. Nitschke played in all three matches as Australia swept the ODIs. She had a small workload, making six runs in her only innings and totalling 0/30 from 12 overs. In her only innings, she was {{given an opportunity to}} bat in the middle-order for the first time for Australia, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> only six from 22 balls before being bowled.|$|E

500|$|Maxim Gorky (...) was a Project 26bis [...] of the Soviet Navy {{that saw}} action [...] during World War II and {{continued}} in service into the Cold War. The ship’s bow was blown-off by a mine in the Gulf of Riga during the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> it to Kronstadt for repairs. [...] However, after being repaired, the ship was trapped in harbour {{for most of the}} war, by Axis minefields at Leningrad and Kronstadt. Despite being trapped, Maxim Gorky was active in two engagements: the ship provided gunfire in support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad, and she later bombarded Finnish positions during the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid-1944. She saw no further action in World War II. A major modernization was begun in 1953, but the navy reconsidered the cost-effectiveness of the refit and work was cancelled in 1955. Maxim Gorky was sold for scrap in 1959.|$|E
500|$|Since Walcourt, though, Marlborough's {{popularity}} {{at court}} had waned. William and Mary distrusted both Lord and Lady Marlborough's influence as confidants {{and supporters of}} Princess Anne (whose claim to the throne was stronger than William's). Sarah had supported Anne {{in a series of}} court disputes with the joint monarchs, infuriating Mary who included the Earl in her disfavour of his scheming wife. Yet for the moment the clash of tempers were over-shadowed by more pressing events in Ireland where James had landed in March 1689 in an attempt to regain his thrones. When William left for Ireland in June 1690 Marlborough became commander of all troops and militia in England, and was appointed a member of the Council of Nine to advise Mary on military matters in the King's absence; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> scant effort to disguise her distaste at his appointment – [...] "I can neither trust or esteem him", she wrote to William.|$|E

500|$|The Whitsun festivals, {{suspended}} during Holst's absence, resumed at Dulwich in 1920. Joseph's part in {{this event}} is unrecorded, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> a major contribution to the following year's festivities, which began beside the Thames at Isleworth and concluded on Whit Monday at SPGS in the gardens of Bute House. For the Monday's celebrations Joseph devised a presentation of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Dioclesian. Writing of the occasion after Joseph's death, Holst recalled that she had woven Purcell's music and Thomas Betterton's text, both long neglected, [...] "into a delightful out-door pageant founded on a fairy story, complete with lost princess, dragon and princely hero". Not satisfied with planning {{every aspect of the}} outdoor performance, Joseph prepared an indoors version of the entertainment, should the weather require this. The production was a great success, and was repeated that summer in Hyde Park and, [...] in October 1921, at the Old Vic theatre. Throughout this considerable organisational task, Holst wrote, [...] "Jane gave the minimum of worry to each person concerned by giving herself the maximum of hard work and forethought".|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth's senior adviser, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His {{political}} mantle {{passed to}} his son, Robert Cecil, who soon became {{the leader of}} the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and [...] "secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions". The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: [...] "So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort". In historian J. E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> them known with [...] "unmistakable if veiled phrases".|$|E
500|$|Adams {{was educated}} at the Douglas County High School. She was not academically inclined, but was {{interested}} in the creative arts and sang in the school choir. Although she competed in track and gymnastics, she harbored ambitions of becoming a ballerina and trained as an apprentice at the local David Taylor Dance Company. She disliked her experience in high school and kept mostly to herself. After her graduation, she moved to Atlanta with her mother. She did not intend to go to college, which disappointed her parents, and she later regretted not getting more of an education. Realizing, at age 18, that she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina, Adams inclined towards musical theater, which she found was [...] "much better suited to [...] personality". One of her first jobs was in a community theater production of Annie, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>made</b> no money in it. To support herself, Adams worked as a greeter at a Gap store. She also {{took a job as a}} waitress at Hooters, where she had to work wearing tight gym outfits, and customers frequently misbehaved with her. Adams left the job soon after she had saved enough money to buy a used car.|$|E
