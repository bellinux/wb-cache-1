5|$|Hand's {{three years}} at Harvard Law School were intellectually and {{socially}} stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house {{with a group of}} fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts. He was also chosen as an editor of the Harvard Law Review, although he resigned in 1894 <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> too much time from his studies.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{testing of}} the rocket launchers {{took place at the}} end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of 5,500 metres (3.4mi). But the artillery branch was not fond of the Katyusha, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds, while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time. Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940, and the BM-13-16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production. Only forty launchers were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E

5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scrutiny}} {{was held}} on December 3, the fifth day of the conclave in the Cappella Paolina (not the Sistine Chapel, which had been divided into nineteen cells for infirm cardinals). <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> ten days for the news of Pope Paul III's death to reach the French court, {{at the start of}} the conclave almost all the cardinals aligned with the Holy Roman Empire were in Rome, while only two of the fourteen French cardinals were in Italy (one was Antoine du Meudon, who had been vacationing in Farnese territory); because one clause of the Concordat of Bologna allowed the pope to fill French benefices if the French prelate died in Rome, Henry II exhorted his cardinals to remain in France, and relied on his non-French allies (in particular, Ippolito II d'Este) to act as his go-between with the Roman Curia. d'Este had done his best to delay the start of the conclave to allow the French cardinals to arrive, using his influence to schedule the papal funerary rite (which was, by law, nine days long) to begin an unusual nine days after Paul III's death.|$|E
25|$|This type of card caused {{complaints}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> up {{to three}} months to replace.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other sailing sports, {{match racing}} is suited to {{locations}} like Bornholm, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> place {{in close proximity}} to the shore which provides spectacular heat-of-the-action viewing for the on-shore audience.|$|R
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> {{so long to}} {{identify}} a culprit, the 2001 anthrax attacks have been compared to the Unabomber attacks which took place from 1978 to 1995.|$|E
25|$|The {{path of the}} antumbra over highly {{populated}} areas allowed at least an estimated 100 million people to view annularity. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> place during Southeast Asia's summer monsoon season, viewing conditions were not ideal in some areas, including Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Another smaller {{earthquake}} {{took place}} in AD 64; it was recorded by Suetonius in his biography of Nero, and by Tacitus in Annales <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> place while Nero was in Naples performing {{for the first time}} in a public theatre. Suetonius recorded that the emperor continued singing through the earthquake until he had finished his song, while Tacitus wrote that the theatre collapsed shortly after being evacuated.|$|E

25|$|When Green Day's drummer, John Kiffmeyer, {{left the}} band, the group {{recruited}} Tré Cool {{to be their}} drummer. In his second year, Tré Cool {{dropped out of high}} school and opted to earn a GED. He began taking classes at a local community college but would again drop out as the band became a more time consuming priority. During this time the band considered breaking up <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> a long time to adjust to playing with Tré Cool.|$|E
25|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the concept}} of Pythagorean triples is the search for triples of positive integers a, b, and c, such that , for some n strictly greater than 2. Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that {{came to be known as}} Fermat's Last Theorem <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proven or disproven. The first proof was given by Andrew Wiles in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The People's Republic of China was {{the first}} country to allow commercialized {{transgenic}} plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992, which was withdrawn in 1997. The first genetically modified crop approved {{for sale in the}} U.S., in 1994, was the FlavrSavr tomato. It had a longer shelf life, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> longer to soften after ripening. In 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first commercially genetically engineered crop marketed in Europe.|$|E
30|$|Gambling {{drives a}} wedge in your {{relationship}} and pulls it apart, and it becomes destructive. You feel like they’re being unfaithful to you, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> up such {{a huge part of}} the relationship (Jill).|$|R
50|$|Cryptic female {{choice is}} a postcopulatory {{mechanism}} that cannot be observed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> place inside a female’s body. It enables a female {{to have some}} control over who fathers her child even after fertilization.|$|R
50|$|Among these games, longue paume is {{the most}} known <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> place with rackets. Rules change little {{according}} to the concerned sport but the basic principles remain from a game to the other one.|$|R
25|$|Millet {{was also}} used for {{couscous}} by the Kel Ahaggar, a nomadic people of the desert of southern Algeria, who probably learned {{about it in the}} West African Sudan, where it has been known for centuries. Ibn Baṭṭūṭa in the above quote may have had a millet couscous. Ibn Baṭṭūṭa also mentions rice couscous in the area of Mali in 1350. Millet couscous was never as popular as hard wheat couscous <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> longer to cook and didn’t taste as good.|$|E
25|$|In early 1997 he was {{appointed}} vice-Prime Minister of Chechnya by Maskhadov. In January 1998 he became the acting head of the Chechen government for a six-month term, after which he resigned. Basayev's appointment was symbolic <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> place {{on the eve of}} the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of his renowned namesake. Basayev subsequently reduced the government's administrative departments and abolished several ministries. However, the collection of taxes and the Chechen National Bank's reserves shrunk, and theft of petroleum products increased seriously.|$|E
25|$|While Morenz {{was in the}} hospital, {{plans for}} a game for Morenz's benefit were already under way. However, the game was not as {{successful}} as Bailey's game, partially <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> place many months after Morenz's passing (on November 3 at the Forum) and partially because Morenz had not survived. The game saw two All-Star teams, the first being a team of stars from the Canadiens and the Montreal Maroons, the second being an All-Star team made of players from the other teams, with the latter team winning 6–5.|$|E
5000|$|Uppercase letters (A, C, D, F, G) {{indicate}} the note names as sharp (black keys). Using the hash symbol # is also acceptable (A#, C#, D#, F#, G#) but not recommended <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> extra space.|$|R

25|$|The {{origin of}} surfing {{was most likely}} started in New Guinea. It was a sport full of culture, fun, and adventure. Surfing was used to explore the oceans and to have fun {{becoming}} a part of nature. It spread from New Guinea to Hawaii. It is mostly known to be practiced in Hawaii and the surrounding islands, but it has spread {{to the rest of}} the continents. It was not widely accepted by Europeans <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> time away from working and labor, although they enjoyed the excitement of seeing the action of surfing.|$|E
25|$|Delicate {{sounds and}} fine overtones were mostly lost, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> {{a lot of}} sound energy to vibrate the {{recording}} horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward {{the end of the}} acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E
25|$|In the Tang dynasty, Mulian was {{a popular}} topic of sutra lectures by monks. They often used {{pictures}} and songs to amuse their illiterate audiences, enriching the Mulian story with many variations and making it thoroughly Chinese. The story-tellers shaped their stories to meet the charge that Buddhism undermined filial piety <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> believers away from their families and prevented them from attending to their ancestors. The written versions of these stories were bianwen, of which a large number were preserved in the library cave at Dunhuang, an oasis in Central Asia, and not rediscovered until the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|The Fragile States Index {{is subject}} to criticism, in part, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> {{institutions}} and data to draw its conclusions, {{as opposed to the}} Human Development Index or other more telling signs. The FSI is checked against human analysis.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary {{language}} {{philosophy is}} closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between language and world.|$|R
50|$|Gain {{is often}} a compromise. On one hand, having lots of gain is good <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> weak signals above the noise floor. On the other hand, lots of gain means higher level signals and more {{problems}} with non-linear mixing.|$|R
