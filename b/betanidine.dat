Red beet is a {{potential}} source of betalains pigment, with the major one is a water soluble antioxidant <b>betanidine</b> 5 -O-beta-glucose. Betalain pigments plays essential role {{in the formation of}} purplish red color on red beet, and potential to be applied as natural food colorant. These pigments can be extracted and used in the form of liquid, paste, or powder. The powder one has advantages such as good stability, solubility, and low moisture content which prolongs its shelf life. The purpose of this research is to produce red beet powder by understanding the influence of using microencapsulating agents (gum arabic, and maltodextrin 10 DE) with different concentrations in red beet powder’s characteristics as food colorant that made using spray drying method. In this research, spray dryer was operated at 150 °C inlet temperature and 90 °C outlet temperature. Gum arabic, and maltodextrin 10 DE were added as microencapsulating agents. There were 2 different treatments for each microencapsulating agent which are A (40 % CA) and B (60 % CA). Then the red beet powder was chemically and physically analyzed. The chemical analysis includes moisture content and antioxidant activity. While physical analysis includes bulk density, wettability, and color intensity. Maltodextrin treatments tend to produce higher yield, antioxidant activity (% inhibition), bulk density, and color intensity (a* value) than gum arabic ones. Maltodextrin treatments also tend to produce lower moisture content and faster time of wettability than gum arabic ones. Red beet powder made with 60 % maltodextrin as microencapsulating agent, gives the highest yield (36, 01 ± 4, 33 %) and antioxidant activity (% inhibition) (86, 08 ± 1, 58 %), lowest reduction percentage of antioxidant activity (% inhibition) (1, 69 %), fastest time of wettability (66, 44 ± 6, 23 seconds), and high a* value (30, 43 ± 1, 51) which shows good red color as natural food colorant...|$|E
