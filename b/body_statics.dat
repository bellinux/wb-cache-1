50|$|Adams {{began his}} {{research}} on rigid <b>body</b> <b>statics</b> and dynamics in mechanics {{from the point of}} view of space and counter-space on the basis of projective linear geometry. The results were published in the late 1950s in the magazine Mathematisch-Physikalische Korrespondenz edited by Unger and appeared in book form in 1996. Based on the groundwork done by a number of mathematicians like Felix Klein, Arthur Cayley, William K. Clifford and Eduard Study, Adams pursued the idea of counter-space into the concrete details of rigid <b>body</b> <b>statics</b> and dynamics (in non-Euclidean spaces). Peter Gschwind was to build on this research and lead it into the sphere of Quantum physics. Adams and Unger also began to collaborate with Alexandre Leroi and Theodor Schwenk, leading to the establishment of the Instituts für Strömungsforschung in Herrischried in the Black Forest. During the last years of his life, Adams expended a lot of his energy on this project, desiring to test the efficacy of his ideas on space and counter-space into the realm of technology. He worked out specific planes (W-planes) and with John Wilkes built models for the self-purification and re-enlivening of water through special forms. He often worked in Herrischried with Whicher, following with interest the research of Leroi and Schwenk.|$|E
40|$|Upper-crossed {{syndrome}} is, {{according to}} Janda, {{described as a}} muscle imbalance in {{the upper part of}} the body, which significantly affects function of the cervical spine, the thoracic spine and the shoulder girdle. The non-physiological function and the position in these parts further influence, above all, respiratory stereotype - upper breathing - and <b>body</b> <b>statics.</b> Therapy is based on influencing the deep stabilizing system, followed by a therapy focused on the place of malfunction and the kinesiology count. Therapy of deep stabilization system complex infuences breath and postural function in their mutual coordination and it is program-controlled by CNS. Importance of close connection of breath and postural functions ensues from the fact, that respiratory muscles participate in internal stabilization with deep spinal muscles.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the sexual difference of the factorial structure of swimming ability in well-trained junior high school swimmers. Factor analytic technique was applied to each correlation matrix of boys and girls, which consisted of a total of 66 selected variables. The main results were as follows; 1) It was inferred that the factorial structures of both swimming abilities were composed of many common factors. The differentiation in the domain of physique and static strength for girls seemed to advance more rapidily as compared to that for boys, while the domain of flexibility for boys differentiated to a greater extent. 2) From the examination of communality, it was inferred that the domains of swimming skill, physique, and cardio-respiratory functions showed high relationships with other ability domains in both sexes. Relationships of elementary swimming skills with other domains were higher in girls, while in boys higher relationships were observed between static strength and other domains. 3) It was inferred that, in boys, six factors, i. e., swimming speed skill, <b>body</b> bulk and <b>static</b> strength, agility of total <b>body,</b> <b>static</b> balance, ankle flexibility, and linearity of physique, developed in accordance with the advance in age, but, in girls, only two factors of <b>body</b> bulk and <b>static</b> strength showed developmental trend with age. 4) For boys, the development of swimming speed skill seemed to be larger than that of <b>body</b> bulk and <b>static</b> strength in the 7 th grade, while the former seemed to be inferior to the growth of linearity of physique in the 7 th and 8 th grades. Furthermore, it was suggested that swimming speed skill developed as accompanied by the growth of linearity of physique from the 7 th to 8 th grade, and then, the development of <b>body</b> bulk and <b>static</b> strength from the 8 th to 9 th grade...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out whether in bulimia nervosa the perceptual {{component}} of a disturbed body image is restricted to the overestimation of one’s own <b>body</b> dimensions (<b>static</b> <b>body</b> image) or can be extended to a misperception of one’s own motion patterns (dynamic body image). Method: Participants with bulimia nervosa (n 30) and normal controls (n 55) estimated their body dimensions by means of a photo distortion technique and their walking patterns using a biological motion distortion device. Results: Not only did participants with bulimia nervosa overestimate their own body dimensions, but also they perceived their own motion patterns corresponding to a higher BMI than did controls. <b>Static</b> <b>body</b> image was correlated with shape/ weight concerns and drive for thinness, whereas dynamic body image was associated with social insecurity and body image avoidance.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{method for}} {{segmenting}} arbitrary human <b>body</b> in <b>static</b> images is proposed. With the body probability map {{obtained by the}} pictorial structure model, we develop a superpixel based EM-like algorithm to refine the map, which can then serve as the seeds of graph cuts optimization. To better obtain the final segmentation, we propose a novel ℓ 1 based graph cuts algorithm, which uses the sparse coding to construct the initialized graph and calculates the terminal links (t-links) and neighborhood links (n-links) simultaneously from the constructed graph. By employing this ℓ 1 based graph cuts, we can effectively and efficiently segment the human <b>body</b> from <b>static</b> images. The experiments on the publicly available challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on human body segmentation. Department of Computin...|$|R

40|$|Capacitive biopotential {{measurements}} {{are susceptible to}} motion-artifacts (MA) due to the non-contact property of capacitive electrodes. Among the methods used to reduce MA, the two proposed by Serteyn et al. and Heuer et al. are based on analyzing the time domain behavior of the measurement system. Serteyn's method only partially reduces MA, while Heuer's method can completely remove MA with a reconstruction equation. However, {{it has not been}} investigated to what extent Heuer's method can tolerate the inaccuracies in the parameters of the reconstruction equation. This is why we performed a sensitivity analysis on Heuer's method using dynamic simulations in MATLAB with different inaccuracies added to the known reconstruction parameters. The results were compared to those of Serteyn's method, showing that Heuer's method becomes inferior to Serteyn's method at a lower inaccuracy of parameters when the <b>body</b> <b>static</b> charge is higher...|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} contact {{phenomenon is}} surface-to-surface friction, {{a force that}} impedes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact, or that of a body in a fluid. In this section we discuss surface-to-surface friction of two <b>bodies</b> in relative <b>static</b> contact or sliding contact. In the real world, friction {{is due to the}} imperfect microstructure of surfaces whose protrusions interlock into each other, generating reactive forces tangential to the surfaces. To overcome the friction between two <b>bodies</b> in <b>static</b> contact, the surfaces must somehow lift away from each other. Once in motion, the degree of surface affinity is reduced and hence bodies in sliding motion tend to offer lesser resistance to motion. These two categories of friction are respectively termed static friction and dynamic friction.|$|R

Understanding its persistence in the absence of evidence, a number of factors are outlined. A precautionary safety regime enforced by oil companies in the UK established a restriction on mobile use on station forecourts that had the effect of confirming a danger. Warning signs in mobile phone handbooks had a similar effect and led to further restrictions at petrol stations. Among a number of problematic consequences, most ironic has been to distract from the real cause of the increased number of petrol stations fires at, particularly, American petrol stations. Investigations have identified the real cause, <b>body</b> <b>static</b> generated through vehicle re-entry while refuelling.

In order to save unloading costs tipper trucks are becoming very popular now a day. These bodies are also known as dump bodies. These are useful in {{a simple way to}} unload the material. Every extra pound of vehicle weight increases manufacturing cost, lower fuel efficiency and reduces vehicle payload capacity. With this concept of reducing weight and stress reduction the optimized model of tipper dump body is modeled and analyzed. Three models of tipper dump bodies are considered, whose specifications are taken from local industry. The three models are modeled in CAD package Pro-E and Static Structural analysis is done in ANSYS. The three models are 14 cubic meter capacity and bearing cubic load of 18 tons. By conducting the Finite Element Analysis on the three Models and according to standards, weight reduction and stress reduction is carried out.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of warm-up involving static stretching on leg power. It was expected that the inclusion of static stretching in the warm-up would decrease leg power. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers (16 male, 11 female) participated in the study. A prospective, repeated measures design was implemented where volunteers underwent 2 testing sessions at least 24 hours apart. One testing session involved a control warm-up (5 min submaximal cycling) followed by 4 10 -s leg power tests at 5, 20, 40 and 60 min postwarm-up. For the other testing session, the subjects performed 5 min of submaximal cycling followed by 15 min of lower <b>body</b> <b>static</b> stretching and then the four leg power tests. Relative peak power, time to peak power and relative total work were measured for each leg power test. Peak power and total work were significantly greater after the static stretching warm-up compared to the control warm-up on all power tests. Peak power was achieved more quickly for the static stretching warm-up compared to the control warm-up on the 5 min test only.
