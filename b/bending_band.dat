Lead can be immobilized using {{phosphate}} amendments (Cao et al. 2003). This technique, however, results sometimes in arsenic migration. Mineral phases, which can precipitate in this conditions include schultenite PbHAsO 4 and phosphoschultenite PbHPO 4. Only recently it has been experimentally shown that these minerals can form a continuous solid solution series in Earth surface environments (Zembal 2012). Therefore, it is important to extend our knowledge on the properties of schultenitephos-phoschultenite solid solution series in order to solve certain environmental problems. For the first time, Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize schultenite, phosphoschultenite and their solid solutions. The main objective of this research is the identification and interpretation of systematic changes in the results of X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy applied to synthetic schultenites with various P to As ratio. Six samples were synthesized from aqueous solutions at ambient conditions. The ratio of P/(P + As) varied from 0 to 1 by 0. 2 (Zembal 2012). Schultenite PbHAsO 4 and phosphoschultenite PbHPO 4 belong to monoclinic crystallographic system. The standard model of the P 2 /c symmetric group was used in the calculation of unit cell parameters. The results show systematic increase in unit cell parameters with substitution of P for As in the series: parameter a from 4, 6737 to 4, 8588, parameter b from 6, 6381 to 6, 7528 and parameter c from 5, 7617 to 5, 8495. The Raman spectra have also shown systematic variation in stretching and bending vibrations in the series. The ν 1 stretching As-O band shifts from 463 cm- 1 in schultenite PbHAsO 4 to 469 cm- 1 in P-substituted schultenite while ν 4 bending As-O band shifts form 824 cm- 1 to 841 cm- 1. Similar is observed in phosphoschultenite: the v 1 stretching P-O band shifts from 555 cm- 1 to 569 cm- 1 and v bending P-O band shifts form 905 cm- 1 to 940 cm- 1 with increasing P content Observed shifts in position of Raman effects correlate linearly with As-P substitution: the bands originating from vibration modes shift to higher wave numbers with the substitution of P for As from schultenite PbHAsO 4 towards phosphoschultenite PbHPO 4. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that atomic mass of As is higher than that of P and that As-O bonds are longer than P-O bonds. The results extend our knowledge about schultenite-phosphoschultenite isomorphic series. Systematic shifts of Raman effects correlate strongly with chemical composition of analyzed phases. This is associated with systematic linear variation in the height (between 4, 403 and 411 units for As-O ν 4 <b>bending</b> <b>band</b> and between 825 and 70 units for P-O v 4 <b>bending</b> <b>band)</b> and area under certain peaks on Raman spectra (between 71, 423 and 30, 805 units for As-O ν 4 <b>bending</b> <b>band</b> and between 28, 982 and 2, 095 units for P-O ν 4 <b>bending</b> <b>band).</b> Current findings suggest that it is possible to estimate the overall P/(P+As) ratio in mineral samples by precise determination of the position and area under the respective Raman spectra and comparison with standard measurements.

At cellular and molecular levels, the timing of events leading to root bending after gravistimulation is well described in Arabidopsis, and rely on the formation of an asymmetrical lateral auxin gradient. This auxin differential flux between the upper and lower side of the root is initiated and maintained by polarized accumulation of several PIN proteins in lateral root cap and epidermis tissues. These differential lateral auxin gradients will activate root cell expansion on the upper side and inhibition of growth on the lower side, resulting in root <b>bending</b> (<b>Band</b> et al. 2012; Rosquete et al. 2013; Sato et al. 2015).

The Kelvin probe, which is mounted inside an optical cryostat, is {{used to measure the}} surface potential. Illumination of the GaN surface with band-to-band light generates electron-hole pairs, which quickly separate in the depletion region due to a strong electric field caused by the near-surface <b>band</b> <b>bending.</b> The charge that is swept to the surface reduces the <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> and generates a surface photovoltage (SPV). Information about the <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> can be obtained by fitting the SPV measurements with a thermionic model based on the emission of charge carriers from bulk to surface and vice versa. The <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> in freestanding n-type GaN templates has been evaluated. The Ga-polar and N-polar surfaces exhibit upward <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> of about 0. 74 and 0. 57 eV, respectively. The surface treatment also {{plays a major role in}} the SPV behavior, where the SPV for mechanical polished surfaces restores faster than predicted by a thermionic model in dark. When measuring the photoluminescence (PL) signal, the PL from mechanically polished surfaces was about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the PL from chemically mechanically polished surfaces. The PL and SPV behaviors were explained by the presence of a large density of defects near the surface, which quench PL and aid in the restoration of the SPV via electron hopping between defects. Temperature-dependent SPV studies have also been performed on doped n- and p-type GaN samples. In Si-doped n-type GaN, the estimated upward <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> was about 1 eV at temperatures between 295 and 500 K. However, in p-type GaN, the downward <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> appeared to increase with increasing temperature, where the magnitude of <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> increased from 0. 8 eV to 2. 1 eV as the temperature increased from 295 to 650 K.

Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) damage was observed to increase surface <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> by about 0. 4 eV where as surface treatments in organic solvents and inorganic acids did not affect surface <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> significantly.

For an applied reverse bias of 4 V, about 0. 5 eV increase of <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> was observed.

It is proposed that the water is highly structured in the hydrotalcite interlayer as it is hydrogen bonded to both the carbonate anion, adjacent water molecules and the hydroxyl surface...|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} and widely used FET in modern microelectronics is the MOSFET. There are different kinds in this category, such as MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor), and IGFET (insulated-gate FET). A schematic of a MISFET {{is shown in}} Figure 1a. The source and the drain are connected by a semiconductor and the gate is separated from the channel by a layer of insulator. If there is no bias (potential difference) applied on the gate, the <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> is induced due to the energy difference of metal conducting band and the semiconductor Fermi level. Therefore a higher concentration of holes is formed on the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator. When an enough positive bias is applied on the gate contact, the <b>bended</b> <b>band</b> becomes flat. If a larger positive bias is applied, the <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> {{in the opposite direction}} occurs and the region close to the insulator-semiconductor interface becomes depleted of holes. Then the depleted region is formed. At an even larger positive bias, the <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> becomes so large that the Fermi level at the interface of the semiconductor and the insulator becomes closer {{to the bottom of the}} conduction band than to the top of the valence band, therefore, it forms an inversion layer of electrons, providing the conducting channel. Finally, it turns the device on.|$|R
40|$|The surface <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> tunes {{considerably}} {{the surface}} band structures and transport properties in topological insulators. We present a direct {{measurement of the}} <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> on the Bi 2 Se 3 by using the bulk sensitive angular-resolved hard x-ray photospectroscopy (HAXPES). We tracked the depth dependence of the energy shift of Bi and Se core states. We estimate that the <b>band</b> <b>bending</b> extends up to about 20 nm into the bulk with an amplitude of 0. 23 - 0. 26 eV, consistent with profiles previously deduced from the binding energies of surface states in this material...|$|R
