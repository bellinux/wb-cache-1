5|$|Biographer Mellow {{believes}} that In Our Time is Hemingway's most experimental book, particularly with its unusual narrative form.

5|$|Gladstone {{is served}} by the Gladstone School District, which {{includes}} John Wetten Elementary School, Kraxberger Middle School, and Gladstone High School. In 2006, a bond was passed to allow approximately $40 million worth of construction on the three schools. The majority (approx. 26 million) of the money was applied towards a remodel of the high school. The district later refinanced the bond, saving taxpayers over 5 percent on its total ($805,040), with savings to <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2024 tax year.|$|E

The facility will have 250 room, 20 operating suites and 54 intensive care beds. When the new hospital is complete, along with the renovations at John Sealy, both complexes will have around 600 beds.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living {{during the}} time of the Liao dynasty predicted that the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, was to <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were also concerned with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were different from the one selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, efforts were made to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in the years immediately preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E

5|$|Debuting {{to strong}} viewing figures {{and with a}} fairly {{positive}} critical reception, Scott & Bailey ran from 29 May 2011 until 3 July {{over the course of}} six episodes. The second series premiered 12 March 2012 and consisted of eight episodes. A third series was announced 28 May 2012, began filming November 2012, and premiered on 3 April 2013.

5|$|German {{forces in}} Stalingrad {{soon began to}} run out of supplies, some {{soldiers}} were forced to live on horse meat. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler's insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army to continue in its efforts to cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.|$|E

This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E
