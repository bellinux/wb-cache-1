40|$|A <b>business</b> <b>group</b> is {{a complex}} system; thus {{it is much more}} {{difficult}} to predict its credit risk than that of an individual company. This study proposes an iterative model, which describes the internal interactions and dynamic credit risk of a <b>business</b> <b>group.</b> The proposed model was analyzed from a complex dynamics perspective. The simulation results based on this model show that chaos will emerge in the credit risk of a <b>business</b> <b>group</b> due to the dynamic decision-making processes of its subsidiaries, even if the interactions in the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> are fairly simple. The results of this study might explain some economic phenomena, and they also provide insights into the credit risk of a <b>business</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Social Credit Party was {{weakened}} by considerable conflict between its {{organizations in the}} two provinces it controlled, Alberta and British Columbia. It failed to establish a strong national office to run the campaign due to infighting between the two groups.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether <b>business</b> <b>group</b> affiliation affects tax avoidance {{in a global}} setting. While the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> structure could facilitate tax avoidance by allowing the ultimate owner to transfer resources and income across group firms, such activities likely incur nontax costs, such as minority shareholder protection, agency costs, and political costs. We find that, overall, <b>business</b> <b>group</b> firms exhibit greater tax avoidance than standalone firms, but the effect is restricted to firms in countries with developed economies where the nontax costs are lower. In contrast, we find that <b>business</b> <b>group</b> firms exhibit lower tax avoidance in emerging market countries, where the nontax costs are higher. This suggests that the nontax costs in emerging markets are sufficiently high to overcome the tax avoidance advantage provided by the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> structure. Our results therefore indicate that the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> structure enables group firms to reduce their tax liability, but that this ability {{is limited by the}} associated nontax costs...|$|R

5|$|On December 18, 2008, {{sources close}} to the Obama {{transition}} team identified Solis as the President-elect's choice for U.S. Secretary of Labor, the last cabinet position yet to be filled. The selection earned praise from the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> and the anti-union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a special election in California's 32nd congressional district; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election).|$|E

To that end, the city purchased The Arena, a 15,000-seat venue for professional ice hockey that was home of the St. Louis Blues. In the early 1990s, Schoemehl worked with <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> {{to develop a new}} ice hockey arena (now known as the Scottrade Center) {{on the site of the}} city's Kiel Auditorium, with the promise that the developer would renovate the adjacent opera house.|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} that information sharing across divisions within a <b>business</b> <b>group</b> can generate substantial value. We hypothesize that <b>business</b> <b>group</b> firms generate proprietary {{information about the}} future performance of their industry, and can therefore help the asset management company within the group. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that business group-owned mutual funds earn more on their investments in industries where the group has significant real operations. <b>Business</b> <b>group</b> mutual fund-owned stocks in related industries outperform <b>business</b> <b>group</b> mutual fund-owned stocks in unrelated industries by 6 percent per year; this out-performance increases to 16 percent per year in over-weighted stocks...|$|R

5|$|Efforts {{during the}} Ford and Carter administrations to force {{metrication}} were seized on by many newspaper editorialists as being dictatorial. Public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule. The underlying {{reasons for this}} response include a relative uniformity of weights and measures (though, notably, US liquid measure differed by about 20% from British Imperial measure, which was adopted throughout the British Empire in 1824) inherited from the United Kingdom in 1776, a homogeneous economy {{and the influence of}} <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> and populists in Congress caused the country to look at the short-term costs associated with the change-over, particularly those that would be borne by the consumer rather than long-term benefits of efficiency and international trade. The Metrication Board was disbanded under President Ronald Reagan's direction in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment {{options for}} the Northgate segment, with residents voicing their opposition to at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further discussion on the two remaining choices in 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported the elevated station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake neighborhood. On January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference in cost compared to the elevated option.|$|E
5|$|Money {{comes from}} Lebanese <b>business</b> <b>groups,</b> private persons, businessmen, the Lebanese {{diaspora}} involved in African diamond exploration, other Islamic groups and countries, and the taxes {{paid by the}} Shia Lebanese. Hezbollah says that {{the main source of}} its income comes from its own investment portfolios and donations by Muslims, however, Western sources maintain that Hezbollah actually receives most of its financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran and Syria. Iran is said to have given $400 million between 1983 and 1989 through donation. The situation has been changed due to economic problems, but Iran still funds humanitarian actions carried on by Hezbollah. According to reports released in February 2010, Hezbollah received $400million from Iran. The US estimates that Iran has been giving Hezbollah about US$60–100million per year in financial assistance. Other estimates are as high as $200-million annually. In 2011 Iran earmarked $7 million to Hezbollah’s activities in the region.|$|E

5|$|The 15th Avenue Northeast {{site for}} the University District's station was {{rejected}} {{in favor of an}} option on Brooklyn Avenue. The placement of the Brooklyn station, either on the north or south side of NE 45th Street, was debated by the Sound Transit Board in 2004. Seattle mayor Greg Nickels favored a station on the north side, but other boardmembers sided with community and <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> who wanted a site on the south side. The station site was further complicated the following year by Safeco's decision to expand its headquarters building {{on the west side of}} Brooklyn Avenue NE, impacting staging areas that were selected by Sound Transit. Ultimately, Safeco moved its headquarters to a downtown building in 2006, and sold the Brooklyn building to the University of Washington, and the staging areas remained available.|$|E
5|$|At the season-opening Daytona 500, Robinson {{qualified}} in 36th place {{making her}} the second woman {{to start the}} race; she finished 24th despite spinning into the track's infield, and avoided a pit road collision with Bobby Labonte. After the event, Sharp left BAM Racing, and car chief Teddy Brown became Robinson's new crew chief. She struggled during her rookie season, {{and was unable to}} attend most races due to sponsorship issues along with her team hiring new drivers which limited her on track experience. Her rival competitors said it was due to Robinson driving an noncompetitive car rather than her driving skill. Robinson made no further appearances for BAM Racing after the second race at Daytona International Speedway, and was later released by the team. She ended the season 52nd in the Drivers' Championship, and was fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. Outside racing, Robinson spoke for Women in Sports, and attended meetings of several associations and <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> while taking the time to be with her children.
