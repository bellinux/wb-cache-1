50|$|A {{plantar reflex}} {{is a normal}} reflex that {{involves}} plantar flexion of the foot, which moves toes away from the shin and curls them down. An abnormal plantar reflex (aka Babinski Sign) occurs when upper motor neuron control over the flexion reflex circuit is interrupted. This results in a dorsiflexion of the foot (foot angles towards the shin, big toe curls up). This also occurs in babies under c. 1 year, because of low myelination of the corticospinal tracts. As these tracts develop to adult form, the flexion-reflex circuit is inhibited by the descending corticospinal inputs, and the normal plantar reflex develops. Also known as the <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex,</b> this {{is a sign of}} neurological abnormality in adults (e.g., upper motor neuron lesion).|$|E

50|$|Older {{children}} and adults with atypical neurology (e.g., people with cerebral palsy) may retain these reflexes and primitive reflexes may reappear in adults. Reappearance {{may be attributed to}} certain neurological conditions including dementia (especially in a rare set of diseases called frontotemporal degenerations), traumatic lesions, and strokes. An individual with cerebral palsy and typical intelligence can learn to suppress these reflexes, but the reflex might resurface under certain conditions (i.e., during extreme startle reaction). Reflexes may also be limited to those areas affected by the atypical neurology, (i.e., individuals with cerebral palsy that only affects their legs retaining the <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> but having normal speech); for those individuals with hemiplegia, the reflex may be seen in the foot on the affected side only.|$|E
50|$|Like ALS, {{diagnosing}} PLS is {{a diagnosis}} of exclusion, {{as there is no}} one test that can confirm {{a diagnosis of}} PLS. The Pringle Criteria, proposed by Pringle et al, provides a guideline of nine points that, if confirmed, can suggest a diagnosis of PLS. Due to the fact that a person with ALS may initially present with only upper motor neuron symptoms, indicative of PLS, one key aspect of the Pringle Criteria is requiring a minimum of three years between symptom onset and symptom diagnosis. When these criteria are met, a diagnosis of PLS is highly likely. Other aspects of Pringle Criteria include normal EMG findings, thereby ruling out lower motor neuron involvement that is indicative of ALS, and absence of family history for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) and ALS. Imaging studies to rule out structural or demyelinating lesions may be done as well. Hoffman's sign and <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> may be present and indicative of upper motor neuron damage.|$|E

However, predicting the delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) of carbon monoxide poisoning (COP) has not been well studied. We investigated the independent predictors of DNS in patients with COP. This study was conducted at four hospitals in China. Data were retrospectively collected from 258 patients with COP between November 1990 and October 2011. DNS was the primary endpoint. A positive <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> was the independent predictor for DNS: sensitivity = 53. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 26. 1 – 79. 6), specificity = 88. 6 % (95 % CI: 83. 7 – 92. 1), positive predictive value (PPV) = 20. 0 % (95 % CI: 9. 1 – 37. 5), and negative predictive value (NPV) = 97. 3 % (95 % CI: 94. 0 – 98. 9).

A positive <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> was very memorable, immediately available, and applicable in clinical practice. Even when the sensitivity and PPV of a positive <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> were unsatisfactory, it had a good specificity and NPV for excluding the risk of DNS.

Background and Purpose. Spasticity is a positive sign of upper motor neuron syndrome that usually develops weeks after a stroke. The mechanisms that lead to its appearance are not completely understood, namely, the cortical regions whose lesion may induce spasticity. Summary of Cases. We report two patients with an ischaemic stroke entailing the anterior cingulate gyrus (pericallosal artery territory), who presented with acute hemiplegia and spasticity since symptom onset. Spasticity resolved within days after onset. Conclusions. The acute destruction of the anterior cingulate region, interrupting inhibitory projections towards lower motor centres, probably explains the acute onset of spasticity that occurred in these two patients. Further studies addressing the role of this region in acute and chronic disturbances of muscular tone are necessary. 1. Background and Purpose Ischaemic damage to the corticospinal tract may induce both negative (muscle weakness, impaired coordination, motor planning, and fatigue) and positive signs (rigidity, spasticity, exaggerated deep tendon <b>reflexes,</b> <b>Babinski</b> signs, and clonus) [1].

40|$|Background: Assessment of {{primitive}} reflexes {{is one of}} the earliest, simplest, and most frequently used assessment tools among health care providers for newborns and young infants. However, very few data exist for high-risk infants in this topic. Among the various primitive reflexes, this study was undertaken particularly to describe the sucking, Babinski and Moro reflexes in high-risk newborns and to explore their relationships with clinical variables. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive study. Sixty seven high-risk newborns including full-term infants required intensive care as well as premature infants were recruited in a neonatal intensive care unit using convenient sampling method. The sucking, Babinski and Moro reflexes were assessed and classified by normal, abnormal and absence. To explore their relationships with clinical variables, birth-related variables, brain sonogram results, and behavioral state (the Anderson Behavioral State Scale, ABSS) and mental status (the Infant Coma Scale, ICS) were assessed. Results: The sucking reflex presented a normal response most frequently (63. 5 %), followed by <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> (58. 7 %) and Moro reflex (42. 9 %). Newborns who presented normal sucking and <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> responses {{were more likely to have}} older gestational age, heavier birth and current weight, higher Apgar scores, shorter length of hospitalization, better respiratory conditions, and better mental status assessed by ICS, but not with Moro reflex.

40|$|Acquired acute demyelinating {{peripheral}} polyneuropathy (AADP) {{is a general}} classification of pathologies that could affect secondary the peripheral nervous system. They are characterized by an autoimmune process directed towards myelin. Clinically they are characterized by progressive weakness and mild sensory changes. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy often {{is referred to as}} Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is the major cause of acute nontraumatic paralysis in healthy people and it is caused by autoimmune response to viral agents (influenza, coxsackie, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus) or bacterial infective organisms (Campylobacter jejuni, Mycoplasma pneumoniae). A detailed history, with symptoms of progressive usually bilateral weakness, hyporeflexia, with a typical demyelinating EMG pattern supports the diagnosis. Progressive affection of respiratory muscles and autonomic instability coupled with a protracted and unpredictable recovery normally results in the need for ICU management. We present a case report of a patient with a typical GBS presentation but with a unilateral upgoing plantar <b>reflex</b> (<b>Babinski</b> sign).

40|$|FRIEDREICH 'S ATAXIA {{is one of}} {{the rare}} {{heritable}} spinocerebellar degenera-tions. The spinocerebellar tracts, dorsal col-umns, pyramidal tracts, and, to a lesser extent, the cerebellum and medulla are in-volved. The disorder is usually manifest be-fore adolescence and is generally character-ized by incoordination of limb movements, dysarthria, nystagmus, diminished or absent deep tendon <b>reflexes,</b> <b>Babinski's</b> sign, impair-ment of position and vibration sense, scoliosis, pes cavus, and hammer toe. Some of these signs may be absent, particularly early in the course of disease. A variety of other findings, for example, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, appear in a minority of patients. The triad of hypoactive knee and ankle jerks, evidence of progressive cerebellar dysfunction, and pre-adoleseent onset is commonly regarded as sufficient for diagnosis. Cardiac disturbances were mentioned by Friedreich in his account of 1863. 1 Although Pitt 2 and Saury 3 emphasized these features they were generally unnoticed until Mollaret described electrocardiographic abnormalities in 1929. 4 Thereafter many reports appeared in the European literature and, up to 1938, were summarized by Loiseau. 5 Evans and Wright 6 examined the 3 - and 4 -lead electro-cardiogram of 38 patients with Friedreich's ataxia and found it abnormal in 12.

The relationship between prevalence of the pyramidal signs and the severity of myelopathy was investigated. We reviewed the records of 275 patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent surgery. Of these, 143 patients were excluded from this study due to comorbidities that might complicate neurological findings. The MR images of the remaining 132 patients were evaluated in a blinded fashion. The neurological findings of 120 patients with ISI (90 men and 30 women; mean age 61  years) were reviewed for hyperreflexia (patellar tendon reflex), ankle clonus, Hoffmann <b>reflex,</b> and <b>Babinski</b> sign. To assess the severity of myelopathy, the motor function scores of {{the upper and lower}} extremities for cervical myelopathy set by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (m-JOA score) were used. The most prevalent signs were hyperreflexia (94 %), Hoffmann <b>reflex</b> (81 %), <b>Babinski</b> sign (53 %), and ankle clonus (35 %). Babinski sign (P <  0. 001), ankle clonus, and Hoffmann reflex showed significant association with the lower m-JOA score. Conversely, no association was found with the upper m-JOA score. In patients with cervical myelopathy, hyperreflexia showed the highest sensitivity followed by Hoffmann <b>reflex,</b> <b>Babinski</b> sign, and ankle clonus. The prevalence of the pyramidal signs correlated with increasing severity of myelopathy.

Amyloid process seems to be early in AD and brain amyloid load affects the frontal lobe. Our objective is to determine if certain simple clinical signs especially frontal-related signs could help reach an earlier and better diagnosis. Methods: In {{the frame of the}} 3 -City cohort, we conducted a nested case-control study comparing incident cases of Alzheimer’s dementia to controls matched for age, sex and education. The standardized neurological exam included extrapyramidal signs (akinesia, rigidity, rest tremor), pyramidal symptoms (spastic rigidity, <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex),</b> primitive reflexes (snout, palmomental reflex grasping) and tremor (essential, intentional, head) at the time of diagnosis and two years before. Results: We compared 106 incident Alzheimer’s dementia subjects (mean age at diagnosis 82. 2 (SD= 5. 9); median MMSE at diagnosis= 23) to 208 matched controls. In patients younger than 80, palmomental reflexes were more frequent in Alzheimer’s dementia than controls, two years before diagnosis (25. 0 vs. 7. 0 %, p= 0. 03) and at time of diagnosis (30. 3 vs. 12. 3 %, p= 0. 02). No difference was observed for other signs two years before diagnosis or for patients older than 80. Conclusions: Before diagnosis, the clinical examination of AD patients is not strictly normal, the primitive reflexes appear to be pathological.

40|$|Purpose: The Babinski sign is {{a finding}} known {{since the start}} of the teachings of {{physical}} diagnosis by almost all medical students. This reflex is an incredibly helpful phenomenon that enables physicians to distinguish between central and the peripheral nervous system diseases right at the bedside. Yet, most students as well as physicians remain oblivious to the remarkable history behind the Babinski sign and what it means to evolutional history of the modern neurological exam. We intend to study the birth of the “signe de l’éventail” (the fanning sign) and how it transformed medical diagnosis as we practice it today. Methods: An extensive search was conducted through the Internet to identify historical documents referring to Babinski and other physicians who also observed the phenomenon as early as the 17 th and 18 th century. We also conducted a search through medical journals that examined the Babinski sign and its history. Results: The <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> had been observed much earlier than 1896, when Babinski referred to his finding for the first time. The reflex had been reported in the literature as far back as 1784 and afterwards re-observed several times before Babinski. However, it was Babinski who first offered an interpretation of the reflex and suggested that it was related to an organic disruption in the central nervous system. By identifying the sign, Babinski separated himself from Charcot in the sense of creating a new tradition in neurology where the findings in a neurological exam were of far more importance than just a plain history as his mentor had relied upon. Conclusions: Babinski was not only responsible for suggesting the significance of such sign, but also transformed the role that physical diagnosis plays in modern medicine, where physical examination is key in revealing underlying pathology...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mercury is {{a highly}} {{dangerous}} neuro-toxicant, affecting over 2 million people in Tanzania. High exposures in artisanal gold mining have significant health and environmental impacts. Burning of mercury amalgamate is of great concern as it emits mercury directly to the atmosphere affecting miners and nearby residents. We assessed environmental and occupational exposure to mercury in miners and their families from Handeni District, north-east Tanzania. Objectives: We aimed to determine mercury exposure levels among miners and their families by testing urine, blood and hair, as well as determining the relationship between exposure biomarker and {{signs and symptoms of}} mercury intoxication. We also aimed to determine the concentration of mercury in water and vegetables, in the areas surrounding the gold mining community. Moreover, we aimed to assess the health effects of mercury exposure on miners and their families Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted among 292 miners and their families. Interviews and medical examinations were conducted on all participants. A sample of 30 participants with history of mercury use, provided hair, urine and blood, residential ground water and vegetable samples for mercury analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Data analysis was done using Epi-Info. Results: We enrolled 292 participants {{with a mean age of}} 31. 8 years [...] The mean mercury levels in urine and blood from selected participants were 46. 3 µg/L and 14. 5 µg/L respectively. Out of 21 urine samples, 10 (47. 6 %) exceeded the maximum acceptable level of 50 µg/L provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Additionally, out of 25 blood samples, 13 (52 %) exceeded the WHO normal range of 5 - 10 µg/L. All hair samples were below the detection limit of 0. 01 ppm. Miners engaged in amalgamation and burning of amalgam had higher mean mercury levels in urine (53. 7 µg/L, p= 0. 02) and blood (27. 6 µg/L, p= 0. 6). Mercury levels in groundwater were below Tanzanian standards of 1 µg/L. Tremor of the eyelid (30 %) was significantly higher (p< 0. 005) in miners than non-miners. Other signs recorded on examination of miners were blue line in gums (34 %), blue coloured ring in periphery of iris (11 %), dysmetria (9 %), gingivitis (7 %), intention tremor (5 %), decreased mental labial reflex (5 %) and decreased <b>Babinski</b> <b>reflex</b> (5 %) Conclusion and recommendation: High mercury concentrations in urine and blood were found in mining community of Handeni District. Miners, who are known to have a high occupational exposure, have higher mercury concentrations than non-miners. In addition; signs of mercury intoxication were also identified in miners. Immediate efforts should be directed into reducing occupational and residential exposures to mercury in communities near gold mines. Larger studies should be carried out to better characterize exposures found while control measures are implemente...|$|E
