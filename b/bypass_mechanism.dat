40|$|Abstract—Electric {{vehicles}} powered with large-scale {{battery packs}} are gaining popularity as gasoline price soars. Large-scale battery packs usually consist {{of an estimated}} 12, 000 battery cells connected in series and parallel, which are susceptible to battery-cell failures. Unfortunately, current battery-management systems are unable to handle the inevitable battery-cell failures very well. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic reconfiguration framework that monitors, reconfigures, and controls large-scale battery packs online. The framework is built upon a syntactic <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that provides {{a set of rules}} for changing the battery-pack configuration, and a semantic <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanism</b> by which the battery-cell connectivity is reconfigured to recover from a battery-cell failure. In particular, the semantic <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is dictated by constant-voltage-keeping and dynamic-voltage-allowing policies. The former policy is effective in pre-venting unavoidable voltage drops during the battery discharge, while the latter policy is effective in supplying different amounts of power to meet a wide-range of application requirements. Our experimental evaluation has shown the proposed framework to enable the battery packs to be 9 times as fault-tolerant as a legacy scheme...|$|R

A Full analysis of the mechanisms by which dislocations bypass particles has been hindered because of complexities associated with elastic interactions between dislocation segments. their interactions with particle stress field, {{the flexibility of the}} dislocation line in three dimensions and the three-dimensional topological changes that occur.

50|$|The system {{includes}} three hydropower stations (one inactive) and two wind turbines, {{with a total}} capacity of 19.8 MW. Water released to the Swift River flows through the Winsor Station below the Winsor Dam but the turbines were damaged in a fire and have not been reactivated. Water transferred from Quabbin to Wachusett can pass either through the turbines at Oakdale or through bypass pipes when flow requirements exceed turbine ratings. Water released from Wachusett into the Cosgrove Tunnel passes through the Cosgrove turbines. The 4 original turbines in the Wachusett Gatehouse, located {{at the start of}} the Wachusett Aqueduct, have not been used in over 40 years. A 1.54MW turbine is currently being installed at the dam. A turbine at Southborough {{at the start of the}} Weston Aqueduct has also been inactive for a long period.The Quabbin Aqueduct connects the two reservoirs, and relies upon gravity to accommodate the three separate operational needs. First, diversion of water from the Ware River into the Quabbin Reservoir uses this aqueduct. Second, water transfer from the Quabbin Reservoir to the Wachusett Reservoir, through a hydropower station or a bypass pipe, uses it as well. The bypass valves are non-regulating valves, and when opened, only the head in the Quabbin Reservoir and the physical characteristics of the aqueduct govern the flow.

40|$|The {{headland}} sand <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the Eastern Australian longshore sand {{transport system}} are investigated at Cape Byron, {{in response to}} wave climate variability. The mechanisms are interpreted from shoreface bathymetric change between surveys in 1883, 2002 and 2011 CE. They involve a split in the sand transport to follow a nearshore path along the inner bar and a cross-embayment path connecting the up-coast and down-coast outer bars. The relative magnitude of the net sand transported via the two pathways is controlled by a rotation in directional wave conditions. Two <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were interpreted: (i) a predominantly cross embayment transport during unimodal east-southeast wave climate such as those interpreted for the period prior to 1883; and, (ii) a split transport between the inner nearshore and cross-embayment paths during a bimodal dominant south-south-easterly and sub-dominant east-north-easterly wave climate {{such as in the}} 2000 s. The net sand transport bypassing Cape Byron was dominated by a connected outer bar system prior to 1883 and conversely, a stronger inner bar system during the 1960 s to 2000 s. This is manifest in the 10 ° rotation in seabed morphology and shoreline planforms. These changes are in accordance with decadal climate variability described by the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). The switching between headland sand <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on interannual to decadal timescales determines the geometry of the bypass strand with the downcoast littoral zone and has important implications for understanding the shoreline rotation and the application of the headland-bay beach concept to predicting planform curvature in open compartments. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{mutation}} G 143 A in the inhibitor {{binding site}} of cytochrome b confers {{a high level}} of resistance to fungicides targeting the bc 1 complex. The mutation, reported in many plant-pathogenic fungi, has not evolved in fungi that harbor an intron immediately after the codon for G 143 in the cytochrome b gene, intron bi 2. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we show here that a codon change from GGT to GCT, which replaces glycine 143 with alanine, hinders the splicing of bi 2 by altering the exon/intron structure needed for efficient intron excision. This lowers the levels of cytochrome b and respiratory growth. We then investigated possible <b>bypass</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that would restore the respiratory fitness of a resistant mutant. Secondary mutations in the mitochondrial genome were found, including a point mutation in bi 2 restoring the correct exon/intron structure and the deletion of intron bi 2. We also found that overexpression of nuclear genes MRS 2 and MRS 3, encoding mitochondrial metal ion carriers, partially restores the respiratory growth of the G 143 A mutant. Interestingly, the MRS 3 gene from the plant-pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea, overexpressed in an S. cerevisiae G 143 A mutant, had a similar compensatory effect.

The universal sulfuryl group donor for SULT-catalyzed sulfation is adenosine 3 ′-phosphate 5 ′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), whereas the reaction products are a sulfated product and adenosine 3 ′, 5 ′-diphosphate (PAP). Although SULT-catalyzed kinetic mechanisms {{have been studied}} since the 1980 s, they remain unclear. Human SULT 1 A 1 is an important phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme. Previously, isotope exchange at equilibrium indicated steady-state ordered mechanism with PAPS and PAP binding to the free SULT 1 A 1 (Tyapochkin, E., Cook, P. F., and Chen, G. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 11894 – 11899). On the basis of activation of SULT 1 A 1 by para-nitrophenyl sulfate (pNPS), an ordered <b>bypass</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been proposed where pNPS sulfates PAP prior to its release from the E·PAP complex regenerating E·PAPS.

Exchange against forward reaction flux (PAPS plus naphthol) beginning with [35 S]PAPS and generating [35 S]naphthyl sulfate is also consistent with pNPS intercepting the E·PAP complex.

Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) misactivates non-leucine amino acids including isoleucine, methionine, and norvaline. To prevent translational errors, mischarged tRNA products are translocated 30 Å from the canonical aminoacylation core to a hydrolytic editing-active site within a completely separate domain. Because it is transient, the tRNA translocation mechanism {{has been difficult to}} isolate. We have identified a “translocation peptide” within Escherichia coli LeuRS. Mutations in the translocation peptide cause tRNA to selectively bypass the editing-active site, resulting in mischarging that is lethal to the cell. This <b>bypass</b> <b>mechanism</b> also rescues aminoacylation of an editing site mutation that hydrolyzes correctly charged Leu-tRNALeu.

The MAC-notification message is used to distinguish between mobility-related packet loss and other source-related packet losses (signal interference, packet error rate, fading environment, and packet collision). Unlike AODV, the <b>bypassing</b> <b>mechanism</b> minimizes routing overheads by limiting the area of route bypass search based on spatial locality where a node cannot move too far too soon. Thus, with high probability, the new distance between the broken links end nodes will not exceed 2 hops.
