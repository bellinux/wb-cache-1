40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the total sum of premium <b>payments</b> and <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> from 2005 to 2010 and make proposals for future policy. This study has made clear that there is a tendency of a total decrease in premium payments. Moreover, the sum of premiums will be less than the sum of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> to be paid. Therefore, our proposal is benefit cutting, raising of the starting age of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> and raising premium payments. Thus we will be able to save a total of 17. 42 trillion yen in finance for the public pension system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{describing}} the international {{practice on the}} various forms of retirement <b>benefit</b> <b>payment</b> currently allowed in countries throughout the world and the regulatory environment surrounding these different forms of <b>benefit</b> <b>payment.</b> The analysis suggests considerable variance between countries. Some countries only allow one form of retirement payment, while others allow several forms or even a combination of them. Examining country practices as regard the providers of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments,</b> suggest that lump-sums and programmed withdrawals are generally provided by pension funds; while, as regard life annuities, providers varied from insurance companies, to pension funds, financial intermediaries and a centralised annuity fund. The paper ends by examining the role of taxation where a choice between different types of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> is allowed. Tax provision plays a key direct or indirect role in influencing payout options. Cross country evidence is varied but suggests that there is often an unequal tax treatment of {{the various forms of}} retirement payout option...|$|R

50|$|Payroll taxes paid by {{railroad}} {{employers and}} their employees {{are the primary}} source of funding for the railroad retirement-survivor benefit programs. Railroad retirement taxes, which have historically been higher than social security taxes, are calculated, like <b>benefit</b> <b>payments,</b> on a two-tier basis. Railroad retirement tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay tier I taxes {{at the same rate as}} social security taxes. In addition, both employees and employers pay tier II taxes which are used to finance railroad retirement <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> over and above social security levels. These tier II taxes are based on the ratio of certain asset balances to the sum of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> and administrative expenses.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report discusses how workers' compensation (WC) benefits affect benefit programs run by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies. GAO (1) examines the effects of WC benefits on SSA programs, focusing on SSA's progress in administering the WC offset provision; (2) discusses other federal programs whose <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> are also affected by WC benefits; and (3) discusses ways to address federal <b>benefit</b> <b>payment</b> errors related to workers' compensation. GAO found that SSA's administration of the WC offset provision continues to be undermined {{by the lack of}} reliable information on WC benefits received by Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries which causes some beneficiaries to be overpaid and others to be underpaid. No national reporting system identifies WC beneficiaries. Instead, SSA largely relies on applicants and beneficiaries to report their receipt of WC benefits and any changes that occur in the benefit amounts [...] an approach that makes it very difficult for SSA to make accurate <b>benefit</b> <b>payments.</b> Other federal agencies also need WC information to make accurate <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> and face similar difficulties identifying WC beneficiaries. Like SSA, Medicare relies on its applicants and beneficiaries to self-report WC benefits and is vulnerable to payment errors when they do not. In addition, food stamp programs and Section 8 rental housing assistance consider WC benefits as income or assets, and an inability to obtain benefit information could affect the accuracy of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments.</b> There are ways to address the difficulty of reliably identifying WC beneficiaries. However, the fragmented structure of WC programs and the lack of federal involvement in state WC programs defy a simple solution. ...|$|R

Since estimated average <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> do not steadily decline as the eligibility screen is gradually tightened, we find that narrow targeting is not optimal. The best candidate is a low bonus amount with a long qualification period, targeted to the half of profiled claimants most likely to exhaust their UI benefit entitlement. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{existing}} literature on optimal unemployment insurance by allowing for self-insurance; individuals may save using a one-period riskless asset, but their access to the credit market is restricted. I show that under this market arrangement, an asset based unemployment insurance scheme implements the optimal allocations. The optimal <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> policy shows no duration dependence, and relies exclusively upon an individual’s current asset position. <b>Benefit</b> <b>payments</b> are decreasing in wealth and, as a consequence, peaks at a constant level when the liquidity constraint is binding. Over the course of unemployment, individuals decumulate assets and the sequence of <b>benefit</b> <b>payments</b> is thus observationally non-decreasing; a result that stands in sharp contrast with the previous literature. In a quantitative exercise it is shown that the US unemployment insurance programme is surprisingly close to optimal for the asset poor, but too generous for wealthier individuals. The potential cost-savings of switching to the optimal program ranges from roughly 33 % of the present value insurance budget for the affluent, to 7 % for the less fortunate...|$|R
