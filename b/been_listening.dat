He {{made no attempt}} to notate what he heard, but absorbed it and let it find its way later into his own music. On Gravity Frith mixed up all these different musical styles to make new songs out of them.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|Yamaguchi {{felt that}} the album's music focus was a {{way for them to}} explain their instincts, and what kind of a band they were. The band members {{primarily}} listened to minimalist techno and instrument-focused music during the recording sessions of Sakanaction, which strongly affected the sound of the album. In particular, Sakanaction had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to German DJ Stimming, UK house artist Miguel Campbell and American recording artist Toro y Moi. Yamaguchi noted that the other band members all listened to Akufen, and that bassist Ami Kusakari preferred goa trance.|$|E
25|$|The band {{have cited}} bands such as Fugazi, Polvo and Archers of Loaf as {{influences}} for the albums sessions, while Brian Lane proclaimed {{that the main}} influence for their progression towards the more aggressive and raw sound was coming off of tour and being bored of the songs {{that they had been}} playing. Accardi had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to albums such as Ten by Pearl Jam, Jar of Flies by Alice in Chains, and Purple and Core by Stone Temple Pilots. Garrett Tierney looked to emulate some of the bass guitar sounds found on the records of The Jesus Lizard and Hüsker Dü.|$|E

[...] "If I would go to some cat's room," [...] remembered the guitarist about the band, [...] "he'd <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to Sly [...] and Jimi Hendrix; another guy to the Stones and the Beatles.

25|$|The {{following}} day, on 15 August, the Japanese declared their {{acceptance of}} the Potsdam Declaration terms, and unconditionally surrendered to the Allies. On the afternoon of that day, Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh, Soekarni, and Wikana, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to Western radio broadcasts. They urged Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence immediately, while the Japanese were in confusion and {{before the arrival of}} Allied forces. Faced with this quick turn of events, Sukarno procrastinated. He feared bloodbath due to hostile response from the Japanese to such a move, and was concerned with prospects of future Allied retribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{band had}} <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to Martha Wainwright's Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole during the {{sessions}} and were fans of it. Towards {{the end of}} the recording sessions, Lightbody wrote a duet with her in mind, hoping to get her to sing it. She liked the song and agreed to record it. Eugene Kelly and a few members from The Reindeer Section also appear as choir in various songs throughout the album. Simpson credited Lee for being supportive of the band, {{and at the same time}} critical, when necessary. Each band member used to come to him for opinion on work they were doing. Morale during the sessions was high, with the band feeling a sense of togetherness seeing the hard work everyone was doing.|$|E

Tsuburaya was third, a few seconds behind Heatley. After the finish, not appearing exhausted, Abebe again performed a routine of calisthenics, which included touching [...] "his toes twice then [...] down on his back, cycling his legs in the air." ...|$|E

[...] Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States, while Rustan {{preferred}} to remain a producer in Norway because {{he did not want to}} leave his family behind.|$|E

Written by Katy alongside Goldon Warren, who also produced it under the name Geeneus, the track was released as a standalone single via digital retailers on 8 July 2013 by Rinse and Columbia Records. It was composed after Katy had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to dance genres. The theme conveyed in the lyrics is love while musically, the song {{has been described as}} a [...] "trance-y" [...] and [...] "rave-y" [...] dance song with its production containing synthesizers and piano. Katy later decided to not include it in Little Red (2014).|$|E

Ultimately, his A Aaron Bay-Schuck came up with the idea to sample [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)" [...] in a song. Bay-Schuck told HitQuarters that he had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to a shuffle beat produced by DJ Frank E on a CD of potential beats and had kept hearing in his head the melody of the Dead or Alive song over the top of it. Co-A Mike Caren then brought the sample to the attention of Flo Rida.|$|E

500|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the phrase}} to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford. In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: [...] "Nobody who's <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in {{the last few years}} could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock." [...] In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice described the sound as [...] "heavy" [...] and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.|$|E
500|$|Smith was a {{dedicated}} fan of The Beatles (as {{well as their}} solo projects), once noting that he had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to them frequently since he was about [...] "four years old" [...] and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith contributed a cover of the Beatles song [...] "Because" [...] to the closing credits and soundtrack of the film American Beauty. Although {{this was the only}} Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least two others ("Revolution" [...] and [...] "I'll Be Back") and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts.|$|E
500|$|According to {{engineer}} Ryan Hewitt, the track contains [...] "four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing." [...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural ambience {{of the home}} it was recorded in. Upon playback of a rough mix of the song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song's conclusion, but mistakenly forgot {{to do the same}} for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to the Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to keep it in the final version of the song.|$|E
