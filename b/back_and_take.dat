25|$|In {{his great}} career Walter Payton rushed for an all-time career record 16,726 yards. The Bears earned a Divisional Playoff rematch with Redskins at Soldier Field. The Bears jumped {{out to a}} 14–0 lead early on only to see the Redskins storm <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a 21–17 lead late in the game. As time was winding down on the season and Payton's career, the Bears need to score a {{touchdown}} late. The ball was {{in the hands of}} Payton who tried to extend his career, but on fourth down he was shoved out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker allowing the Redskins to run the clock out. Payton watched the rest of the game as he sat alone on the bench.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of now, some of them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument to try and find chords, which I did with the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> out any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E

2500|$|Napoleon {{received}} {{a message from}} Vandamme, informing him that a strong column, composed of all three arms (infantry, cavalry, and artillery), was advancing towards Fleurus; that it had at first been looked upon as the corps detached from Ney's forces, until {{it was discovered that}} it moved by a different road from that along which those troops had been expected, and in a direction towards the French left rear, instead of the Prussian extreme right; that Girard's Division had been consequently induced to fall <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> up a position to cover Fleurus and that the effect produced upon his own Corps by the sudden appearance of this Column was such, that if Napoleon did not immediately move his reserve to arrest its progress, his troops would be compelled to evacuate Saint-Amand and commence a retreat.|$|E

2500|$|George Washington marched {{his army}} to Bedford in 1794 to subdue the Whiskey Rebellion. There {{was much more}} at stake than quieting the {{uprising}} of rebels angered by a tax on whiskey; Washington felt the Constitution itself was at risk. The rebellion mainly consisted of farmers who could, due to {{the high cost of}} pack mule transport to the eastern cities, earn more selling whiskey instead of grain. The rebellion spread fast, and when it reached Pittsburgh some rebels threatened to burn the city to the ground. Anarchy was on its way; the British and French watched every move hoping they could come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> over. Washington knew he had to act and make a statement; the laws of America would be obeyed. 12,950 militiamen were called to Bedford leaving the rebels without many choices. One historian later stated, [...] "It was at Bedford that the new federal government was finally to establish itself as sovereign in its own time and place." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dodgers {{went back}} on the road on April 19 to play a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. Multi-hit games by Tyler Flowers and Jeff Francoeur led the Braves to a 8–1 rout in the opener. Justin Turner's RBI double in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers the 5–3 win the {{following}} day. Yasmani Grandal took his turn with a 10th inning RBI in the series finale as the team won 2–1. Kershaw struck out 10 in eight innings in the game. The team next traveled to Coors Field for a weekend series against the Colorado Rockies. A two-run triple by Brandon Barnes in the eighth inning gave the Rockies a 7–5 win on April 22. Kenta Maeda allowed only three hits and struck out eight in 6 [...] innings the following game as the Dodgers won 4–1. He was the first pitcher in modern baseball history to allow only one run over his first four starts. In the series finale, the Dodgers jumped out to a quick 7–1 lead only for the Rockies to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the lead in the late innings. Chase Utley's two-out double off Rockies closer Jake McGee in the ninth capped was part of five runs they scored that inning to win 12–10.|$|E
