50|$|The {{island is}} {{approximately}} 1 km from Victoria Point, also in Redland City. A natural cliff composed of iron-rich rock is exposed {{on the south}} {{western side of the}} island. Sandy <b>beaches</b> <b>wrap</b> around the island's southern, eastern and northern sides. Mangroves cover the western foreshore of the island.|$|R
2500|$|Apart {{from its}} sea beach and Teignmouth Pier with {{amusement}} arcade and rides, the <b>beach</b> <b>wraps</b> around the spit {{at the head}} of the river Teign providing a river beach, commonly known as the Back Beach (dogs are allowed all year on this part of the beach), on the estuary side which overlooks the harbour with its moorings for many pleasure craft, and has views up the estuary to Dartmoor. An [...] long waymarked route known as the Templer Way has been created between Haytor on Dartmoor and Shaldon. It closely follows the route of George Templer's granite tramway, his father James's Stover Canal and finally the estuary to Teignmouth.|$|R

50|$|On Magnolia's {{south end}} is Magnolia Park, {{overlooking}} Puget Sound, Mount Rainier, {{and the city}} skyline. It features a picnic area and tennis courts across the street. Also in Magnolia are Smith Cove and its marina. Discovery Park, in the northwest, encompasses 534 acre and is Seattle's largest park. The park is home to eagles, herons, falcons, and beavers. Seven miles of trails provide visitors with a wilderness experience and views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Parts of Fort Lawton, such as the officer's homes and other historic buildings, remain in the park. Discovery Park has extensive <b>beaches</b> <b>wrapping</b> around West Point, the westernmost point in Seattle, and West Point hosts a lighthouse which guides ships into Seattle's harbour, Elliott Bay.|$|R

50|$|The {{western side}} of the island is free of {{mangroves}} and dominated by low energy beaches fronted by wide sand flats. Weeroona Island <b>beach</b> <b>wraps</b> around the western half of the 1 km wide island for 1.6 km, the eastern half being surrounded by mangroves. While detached from the mainland at high tide, at low tide it is linked by tidal flats. Road vehicle access is provided by a 300 m long causeway. Beaches border the southern, western and northern shore and generally consist of a narrow high tide beach. 20 shacks line the southern shore, and larger freehold titles are privately owned along the northern shore. Shorelines are backed by grassy slopes which rise to a 30 m high island crest. The beaches are fronted by a narrow strip of sand, behind which vegetated tidal flats extend for hundreds of metres north and south. The western side is an exception to this, where the spread of tidal flat vegetation is limited by the tidal channel.|$|R

50|$|In 1994-1996, {{the mall}} was {{expanded}} to include an elevator and a food court (modeled after a Jersey Shore theme) including 1920s style <b>beach</b> photos <b>wrapped</b> around the columns in the older section of the mall, as well as Nobody Beats the Wiz, a new 15-screen Loews Theatres (currently/now AMC) and Old Navy to replace the closed Caldor. The mall also saw minor cosmetic changes that consisted of replacing black with sky blue in the color schemes through painting and retiling, {{as well as new}} lighting along the pillars.|$|R
5000|$|Manx legends {{also tell}} of four items {{that he gave}} to Lugh as parting gifts, when the boy went to aid the people of Dana against the Fomorians. These were: [...] "Manannan's coat, wearing which {{he could not be}} wounded, and also his breastplate, which no weapon could pierce. His helmet had two {{precious}} stones set in front and one behind, which flashed as he moved. And Manannan girt him for the fight with his own deadly sword, called the Answerer, from the wound of which no man ever recovered, and those who were opposed to it in battle were so terrified that their strength left them." [...] Lugh also took Enbarr of the Flowing Mane, and was joined by Manannan's own sons and Fairy Cavalcade. When he looked back on leaving, Lugh saw [...] "his foster-father's noble figure standing on the <b>beach.</b> Manannan was <b>wrapped</b> in his magic cloak of colours, changing like the sun from blue-green to silver, and again to the purple of evening. He waved his hand to Lugh, and cried: 'Victory and blessing with thee!' So Lugh, glorious in his youth and strength, left his Island home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it is all}} of {{the same}} piece," [...] said Mrs. Breen. Grace did not ask what the piece was. She {{remained}} staring at the dark wall across the sea, and spiritually confronting her own responsibility, no atom of which she rejected. She held herself in every way responsible,--for doubting that poor young fellow's word, and then for forcing that reluctant creature to go with him, and forbidding by her fierce insistence any attempt of his at explanation; she condemned herself to perpetual remorse with even greater zeal than her mother would have sentenced her, {{and she would not}} permit herself any respite when a little sail, which she knew for theirs, blew round the point. It seemed to fly along just on the hither side of that mural darkness, skilfully tacking to reach the end of the-reef before the wall pushed it on the rocks. Suddenly, the long low stretch of the reef broke into white foam, and then passed from sight under the black wall, against which the little sail still flickered. The girl fetched a long, silent breath. They were inside the reef, in comparatively smooth water, and to her ignorance they were safe. But the rain would be coming in another moment, and Mrs. Maynard would be drenched; and Grace would be to blame for her death. She ran to the closet, and pulled down her mother's India-rubber cloak and her own, and fled out-of-doors, to be ready on the <b>beach</b> with the <b>wrap,</b> against their landing. She met the other ladies on the stairs and in the hall, and they clamored at her; but she glided through them like something in a dream, and then she heard a shouting in her ear, and felt herself caught and held up against the wind.|$|R
