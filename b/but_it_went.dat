5|$|Georgia {{announced}} on 9 August 2008, {{that it was}} considering withdrawing from the Beijing Olympic Games because of the 2008 South Ossetia war, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on to compete while the conflict was still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans {{and the sound of}} the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E
5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E

5|$|Before the Tests, Fingleton {{expected}} the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen {{would be unable}} to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton deceived Bradman with a googly. Bradman {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg-glanced the next one for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both players had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled {{by many of the}} deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E

25|$|On 3 November 1917, Scaroni filed {{his first}} claim for an aerial victory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> {{unconfirmed}} and uncredited. On 14 November, Scaroni scored his first official victory, while flying a Nieuport 17. By 19 December, he had scored six victories, and his squadron phased out the Nieuports.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was also influenced by personal and inter-group rivalries within the RAF command, particularly between 11 Group and 12 Groups whose commanders constantly bickered. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, commander of 12 Group, had originally been slated to take over 11 Group command <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to Keith Park instead. Leigh-Mallory felt further slighted by Dowding because 12 Group had to defend 11 Group airfields while 11 Group attacked the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Johann Jakob Sulzer (1806–1883), a Democratic Party {{politician}} from Winterthur, {{founded the}} Lake Constance–Lake Geneva Railway (German: Bodensee-Genfersee-Bahn), later renamed the Swiss National Railway (German: Schweizerische Nationalbahn, SNB) to overcome {{shortcomings of the}} existing railways in providing an adequate and co-ordinated network. It planned to build a line from Lake Constance and Singen to Lausanne via Winterthur, Aargau, Solothurn, Lyss, Murten and Payerne. Construction started in 1875 <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> bankrupt in 1878 and its assets were acquired by the NOB and SCB.|$|E

25|$|Captained by Gazi Ashraf, Bangladesh were {{dismissed}} for 94 and Pakistan reached their target for victory with seven wickets in hand. They lost their second ODI, which was against Sri Lanka, finishing {{last in the}} three-team tournament. Bangladesh qualified for the 1988 Asia Cup, this time hosting the tournament; {{it was the first}} time ODIs had been staged in the country. Although they lost all their matches, Bangladesh's fixtures were retrospectively awarded ODI. Floods in the preceding months meant the tournament was in doubt, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> ahead as planned. A charity match raised $70,000 for the flood victims.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the defeat}} and the dismay felt in Washington, Burnside {{was not yet}} {{relieved}} from command. He planned to resume his offensive north of Fredericksburg, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> amiss in January 1863 in the humiliating Mud March. Following this, a cabal of his subordinate generals {{made it clear to}} the government that Burnside was incapable of leading the army. One of those conspirators was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, who was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac on January 26, 1863. Hooker, who had an excellent record as a corps commander in previous campaigns, spent the remainder of the winter reorganizing and resupplying his army, paying special attention to health and morale issues. And being known for his aggressive nature, he planned a complex spring campaign against Robert E. Lee.|$|E
25|$|The ILP {{still had}} some {{significant}} strength {{at the end}} of the war, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> into crisis shortly afterward. At the 1945 general election it retained three MPs, all in Glasgow, although only one of them had a Labour opponent. Its conference rejected calls to reaffiliate to the Labour Party. A major blow came in 1946 when the party's best known public spokesman, James Maxton MP, died. The ILP narrowly held his seat in the Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1946 (against a Labour opponent). However all their MPs defected to Labour at various stages in 1947, and the party was roundly defeated at the Glasgow Camlachie by-election, 1948, in a seat they had won easily only three years earlier. The party was never again able to take a significant vote in a Parliamentary election.|$|E

25|$|Klimt invited Schiele {{to exhibit}} {{some of his}} work at the 1909 Vienna Kunstschau, where he {{encountered}} the work of Edvard Munch, Jan Toorop, and Vincent van Gogh among others. Once free of the constraints of the Academy's conventions, Schiele began to explore not only the human form, but also human sexuality. Schiele's work was already daring, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> a bold step further with the inclusion of Klimt's decorative eroticism and with what some may like to call figurative distortions, that included elongations, deformities, and sexual openness. Schiele's self-portraits helped re-establish the energy of both genres with their unique level of emotional and sexual honesty and use of figural distortion in place of conventional ideals of beauty. He also painted tributes to Van Gogh's Sunflowers as well as landscapes and still lifes.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
25|$|The last {{moderate}} {{proposal was}} the Fourteenth Amendment, whose principal drafter was Representative John Bingham. It {{was designed to}} put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> much further. It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States (except visitors and Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It guaranteed the Federal war debt would be paid (and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid). Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states since three-fourths of the states were required for ratification (the amendment was later ratified.). The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed, and a political fight broke out between the Republicans (both Radical and moderate) on one side, {{and on the other}} side, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party in the North, and the conservative groupings (which used different names) in each southern state.|$|E

25|$|An 18-hour {{standoff}} ensued {{during which}} time the police talked over the phone to Bryant, still calling himself Jamie. He requested a helicopter, saying {{that he wanted to}} be flown to a plane and then on to Adelaide, South Australia. He said that if the helicopter arrived, he would release Pears and only keep Noelene Martin. Bryant could see the movements of SOG officers, and continually demanded their retreat each time they began to approach the house. As he appeared to have excellent awareness of the events unfurling around him, despite the pitch black of night, the police believed he had some kind of visual aid device; none was ever found, however. A man was spotted on the roof of an adjacent building at one point, believed to be Bryant. Later in the night, the cordless phone Bryant was using began to run low on batteries. Police tried unsuccessfully to get him to return the phone to the charger, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> dead and there were no further communications.|$|E
25|$|In the MVC final, the Cougars were {{pitted against}} the 3rd seeded Drake Bulldogs, {{who had already}} won two tournament games. SIUE came out hard, {{dominating}} possession {{during the first half}} and outshooting DU 9 to 1, but the Bulldogs' defense held firm for a 0–0 halftime score. The second half was more evenly played, but Drake was a bit more effective. When the Cougars failed to clear a ball in the 77th minute, Dal Santo made a last instant save that set up a Drake corner kick; the kick bounced around in the six yard box before SIUE finally seemed to clear it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> straight toward Drake freshman reserve Ciszweski, who blasted a return shot through the crowd in front of the net that Dal Santo barely saw and had no chance of stopping. The Cougars then intensified their effort after falling behind, but as in the semis, seemed unable to put together an effective attack. In the end, Drake earned its first MVC Tournament title since 2009, and SIUE would have to wait to find out if their record was good enough to get an at-large bid to return to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
25|$|Boudet donated {{a copy of}} La vraie langue celtique to the Cambridge University Library, {{the book}} {{is still in the}} University of Cambridge's {{possession}} as late as 2015, in a letter written and signed by Boudet to the rector of the University of Cambridge, established the date of the donation on 11 December 1886. The manuscript of La vraie langue celtique was deposited in 1887 in the Manuscript Division of the Archives départementales, communales et hospitalières de l'Aude. Boudet donated another copy of his book to the Bibliothèque de la Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne in 1894. A Joseph Bonnafous was recorded to have done the same in 1907, this time to the Société d'Études Scientifiques de l'Aude which he was also a member and possibly the same Bonnafous who was printer in Carcassonne, rue de la Mairie and blood relative of Victor Bonnafous who printed Boudet's book. The Bibliothèque nationale de France once held an original copy of the La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> missing at some unknown date, its disappearance was reported during an inventory. The Bibliothèque de Narbonne had also received a copy of Boudet's book in 1889.|$|E
