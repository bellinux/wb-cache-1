5|$|Dr. Perry Nussbaum, Beth Israel's rabbi from 1954 to 1973, {{was active}} in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1967 the {{congregation}} moved to a new synagogue <b>building,</b> (<b>its</b> current one), and both the new building and Nussbaum's house were bombed by the Ku Klux Klan that year.|$|E
5|$|The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage leased {{the house}} in the fall of 1915, and made the <b>building</b> <b>its</b> {{headquarters}} for two years. The group rented {{the house in}} order to emphasize their importance in the fight for women's suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad's {{structure}} is notable as it embeds key parts of verses from early Principal Upanishads, thus referencing them and yet <b>building</b> <b>its</b> own message. The fragments of earlier major Upanishads it thus integrates within it, include Mundaka Upanishad and Shvetashvatara Upanishad.|$|E

5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further <b>building</b> <b>its</b> military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} when the {{wireless}} network was under consideration, various other American cities already had such networks or {{were in the process of}} constructing them. Chaska and Moorhead, both in Minnesota, had city-owned and -operated wireless networks, while Philadelphia was considering <b>building</b> <b>its</b> own and Corpus Christi, Texas, was experimenting with a specialized government-use-only network.|$|E
5|$|Mondion {{also made}} further plans to {{strengthen}} Mdina's fortifications, {{but they were}} not implemented since the Order focused on <b>building</b> <b>its</b> fortifications in the harbour area. The only major addition to the Mdina fortifications after Mondion's reconstruction was Despuig Bastion, which was built during the reign of Ramon Despuig between 1739 and 1746.|$|E
50|$|The Middlesex County Training School is {{a former}} reform school located in North Chelmsford, Massachusetts. After <b>its</b> closure, <b>its</b> <b>buildings</b> were {{purchased}} by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, which utilized <b>its</b> <b>buildings</b> for <b>its</b> College of Education. Today, the school's records are housed in the Massachusetts Archives, while one of <b>its</b> <b>buildings</b> {{is home to the}} Judge Rotenberg Educational Center.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the Supreme Court <b>Building</b> {{maintains}} <b>its</b> own police force, the Supreme Court Police. Separate {{from the}} Capitol Police, the force {{was created in}} 1935 {{to look after the}} <b>building</b> and <b>its</b> personnel.|$|R

5|$|SAS started <b>building</b> <b>its</b> current {{headquarters}} in a forested area of Cary, North Carolina in 1980. Later that year it started providing on-site daycare {{in order to}} keep an employee who was planning on being a stay-at-home mom. By 1984, SAS had begun building a fitness center, medical center, on-site cafe and other facilities. It had also developed some of its other benefits programs. SAS became known as a good place to work and was frequently recognized by national magazines like BusinessWeek, Working Mother and Fortune for its work environment.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical <b>building.</b> <b>Its</b> rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, <b>building</b> <b>its</b> compact, three-layered nest {{on a tree}} branch. Ten {{to twelve}} eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. It may be killed by birds of prey or carry parasites, but its large range and population mean {{that it is not}} considered to present any significant conservation concerns.|$|E
50|$|Warkworth {{is popular}} with {{visitors}} for <b>its</b> old <b>buildings,</b> <b>its</b> walks by the River Coquet, and {{its proximity to}} the Northumberland Coast, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). It is twinned with Warkworth, New Zealand.|$|R

5|$|The manor of Winslade {{was held}} by Hugh de Port and his {{descendants}} from 1086 until 1555, after which it was bought by William, Marquis of Winchester. Hackwood Park was acquired by William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester in the 16th century, and {{was used as a}} deer hunting park until the 20th century. Winslade contains 42 Grade II listed buildings, including Hackwood House, a Grade II* listed <b>building.</b> <b>Its</b> church, dedicated to St Mary, dates from 1816 and was Grade II listed on 26 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the <b>building.</b> <b>Its</b> roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} four weeks, while the ship was dry-docked, Bruce negotiated with the Argentine government {{over the future of}} the weather station. He was assisted by the British resident minister, the British Consul, and Dr W. G. Davis who was director of the Argentine Meteorological Office. When contacted by cable, the British Foreign Office registered no objection to this scheme. On 20 January 1904, Bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of the Argentine government would travel back to Laurie Island to work for a year, under Robert Mossman, as the first stage of an annual arrangement. He then formally handed over the Omond House <b>building,</b> <b>its</b> furnishings and provisions, and all magnetic and meteorological instruments, to the Argentine government. The station, renamed Orcadas Base, has remained operational ever since, having been rebuilt and extended several times.|$|E

50|$|From {{the very}} beginning, JovanoviÄ‡'s {{ambition}} {{was to create}} a collection of paintings and lithographs of Belgrade. He first painted and lithographed, and then when the new invention came along, photographed <b>its</b> historic <b>buildings,</b> <b>its</b> fortresses, garrisons, statues, shops and streets, and almost every notable Serb of his day.|$|R

Rangiroa Airport is located 5.5 km southeast of Avatoru. The atoll's black pearl industry is centered here as well. Its population is approximately 700.|$|R
5|$|Fluor diversified its {{business}} more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling {{and it started}} a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968 and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s. Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction. In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started <b>building</b> <b>its</b> new headquarters on it. The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when <b>building</b> <b>its</b> environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community <b>building.</b> <b>Its</b> interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E
50|$|The Monumental Axis {{designated}} {{for political and}} administrative activities is considered {{the body of the}} city with the style and simplicity of <b>its</b> <b>buildings,</b> <b>its</b> oversized scales, broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes ministries, the national congress, and the television and radio tower.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in <b>building</b> <b>its</b> own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{established}} a shipyard on the Sheepscot River at Merrymeeting Bay in Maine in 1675 at {{the outbreak of}} King Philips War. The shipyard was successful, turning {{out a number of}} small boats and <b>building</b> <b>its</b> first large merchant ship in 1676. As he was preparing for its maiden voyage in August 1676, planning to deliver a load of lumber to Boston, a band of Indians descended on the area during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1676). Rather than take on his cargo, he took on board as many of the local settlers as he could. Although he was financially ruined (the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo of masts and lumber), Phips was considered a hero among the colonists in Boston.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It {{was the first}} branch of the museum outside {{southeast}} England, {{and the first to}} be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskindâ€™s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the <b>building</b> <b>its</b> shape. Originally budgeted at Â£40 million, the museum was eventually completed for Â£28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed Â£12.5 million.|$|E
