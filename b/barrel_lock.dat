50|$|One {{exception}} {{in which no}} concealed carry permit is required is when the weapon is in a non-functioning state (for instance, {{if it has a}} <b>barrel</b> <b>lock</b> in place), or if the weapon is unloaded and no ammunition is readily accessible.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, the SG-43 was {{improved}} and renamed SGM ("M" [...] for modernized); dust covers and a new <b>barrel</b> <b>lock</b> were fitted, and a splined barrel was fitted to improve cooling. A coaxially-mounted stockless electric solenoid-fired variant was developed under the designation SGMT (the [...] "T" [...] standing for Tankovy, or [...] "Tank").|$|E
50|$|The Strike One pistol {{features}} a low bore axis as {{the distance from}} the barrel central axis {{to the top of the}} grip is 12 mm. Other 9×19mm Parabellum chambered service pistol designs have higher bore axes like the short recoil, locked breech, tilting barrel Caracal F 18 mm, Glock 17 20 mm, Tanfoglio Force 30 mm and Heckler & Koch USP Compact 32 mm The short recoil, locked-breech Beretta 92 and short recoil and locked-breech, rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>lock</b> Beretta Px4 Compact designs both have a 34 mm bore axis height.|$|E

50|$|The M79 {{is easy to}} operate. To load, the {{grenadier}} {{pushes the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> latch on the receiver group to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened. A round then may be loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> latch to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.|$|R
50|$|The SIG Pro {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol. It uses {{a traditional}} Browning cam-operated <b>locking</b> system. The <b>barrel</b> <b>locks</b> into the slide via enlarged ejection port.|$|R
50|$|Both of the Berettas, and the K100, {{have the}} archetypal square {{shouldered}} lock {{protruding from the}} otherwise round barrel, easily visible at the ejection port with the slide fully forward. This square shoulder is rotated in behind a solid column of steel running {{the length of the}} slide forward of the ejection port, and on the left side out of view, when the slide and barrel are fully forward in battery. This locks the slide forward in battery. Given that the MP9 uses the same basic locking mechanism, and has a cyclical rate of fire of 900 rounds/min, the rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>lock</b> has shown itself to be capable of very fast lock times.|$|E
50|$|The QSW-06 is a polymer framed, short recoil operated, {{semi-automatic}} pistol that shares {{its development}} {{history with the}} QSZ-92 pistol and externally the two pistols are similar in appearance and share 60% of the same components but internally there are many {{differences between the two}} pistols. The most notable of these differences is, that while both pistols use a short recoil operation, the QSW-06 uses a non-rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>lock</b> as opposed to the QSZ-92 and its rotating barrel. The QSW-06 is chambered for DCV05 5.8 X 21mm subsonic round which creates less noise compared to standard pistol rounds. The QSW-06 is also capable of firing the standard PLA pistol round, the DAP92 5.8 x 21mm as well. The QSW-06 uses a double-column, double-feed, twenty-round magazine as opposed to the QSZ-92's fifteen-round magazine. A rail has been placed under the barrel and various sights, flashlights and other accessories may be attached. Most importantly, the QSW-06 comes with a detachable suppressor that may be screwed onto the barrel.|$|E
5000|$|The MG 15 fires {{from an open}} bolt, {{meaning that}} the bolt stays back when the gun is ready to fire, and also making it nearly {{impossible}} for [...] "through the propeller" [...] synchronized forward firing on a fuselage mount. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt and allows it to go forward, stripping a round from the magazine. The bolt continues pushing the round into the chamber and locks up when the lockring rotates and locks the bolt and barrel extension together. At this point the trip lever releases the firing pin and the gun fires. Recoil pushes the <b>barrel,</b> <b>lock</b> and bolt backwards until the lockring hits a cam that rotates it unlocking the bolt and barrel. Inertia carries the bolt backwards until {{the base of the}} fired case hits the ejector flinging the empty out of the receiver. If the trigger is held down the cycle will continue. If the trigger is released the bolt will remain in the rearward position.|$|E
5000|$|WIST-94 was {{designed}} at Military Institute of Armament Technology (WITU) under the code name Piryt (pl.Pyrite) [...] Two prototypes {{were made in}} 1992, which differ in the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system: Model A01 used a rotary-locking system and Model B01 using conventional, Browning-type tilting <b>barrel</b> <b>locking.</b> B01 {{was the only one}} to complete testing but the development was temporarily halted due to the military cutting off funding. Financed by WITU and Prexer company, the project continued and in 1994 a new prototype was developed. Called WIST-94 {{it is based on the}} B01 prototype. The new pistol was chosen by the Polish military as its new standard sidearm.|$|R

50|$|The Mark II, {{known as}} the service air rifle because of its use by the UK military, used break-action with a {{superimposed}} <b>barrel</b> <b>locked</b> by bolt action. The detachable barrel was easily interchangeable with others of the three calibres available.|$|R
5000|$|The K100 uses a rare locking system, {{similar in}} some ways to the Beretta Cougar, Px4 Storm, and Brügger & Thomet MP9 which employs a {{rotating}} <b>barrel</b> <b>lock,</b> which in the K100's case is cammed by a cross pin. When the pistol is fired the barrel and slide move backward together for about 3/8 of an inch while the barrel is cammed clockwise (with respect to the shooter) by a flat, twisting, helical [...] "cut" [...] in the barrel extension. Once the barrel and slide have moved back {{to the point where the}} barrel has twisted about 45°, the slide is free to continue traveling back while the barrel's travel is arrested by its interface to the frame via the barrel extension's square shoulders. On the K100, the Beretta's barrel extension cam cut, and transfer block's cam tooth, are replaced by a curled, twisting cut in the barrel extension, and a round, frame-embedded cross-pin respectively. As such, there is no transfer block (locking block) per se, and the barrel extension directly interfaces with the frame via the replaceable cross-pin. The design allows a low bore axis relative to the shooter's hand and avoids the use of the transfer/locking block typically found in rotating barrel pistols.|$|E
50|$|The stud on the bayonet crossguard {{fits the}} gas {{cylinder}} lock screw under the M1 <b>barrel.</b> <b>Locking</b> grooves {{attach to the}} bayonet lug on the rifle. The M5 fits only the M1 and does not interchange with any other firearms.|$|R
5000|$|... 200 mm 2.8: This lens was a New FD {{updating}} of {{the previous}} 200 mm 2.8 lens, replacing the locking ring of the old FD system with the rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism of the New FD series but otherwise little updated.|$|R
50|$|The BI-7-2 is, probably, {{the most}} famous rifle of that series. Its key {{difference}} from any previous models was the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system, which increased the firing rate of the rifle to the self-loading level, which improved the results of biathletes dramatically.|$|R
5000|$|Roller locking {{is used by}} the CZ 52 pistol, slide, <b>barrel,</b> <b>locking</b> {{piece and}} rollers shown here. Normally the recoil spring pushes the locking piece rearward, which in turn pushes the barrel back and holds the locking rollers. (In some of these {{pictures}} the spring is removed) ...|$|R
50|$|The P9RC is the {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the P9R. There are 3 notable differences: the guide rod assembly, the bottom part of the barrel (on which the tilting <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system works) and the grips. Earlier P9Rs had wooden grips, later ones came with plastics as well, while P9RCs were made with plastics only.|$|R
50|$|Cougar 8000 series pistols are recoil-operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistols. These pistols use {{a relatively}} rare rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system, {{in which the}} barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel {{is controlled by the}} stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert.|$|R
50|$|The Kel-Tec KSG shotgun is a {{manually}} operated, pump (slide) action weapon. <b>Barrel</b> <b>locking</b> {{is achieved}} by a swinging wedge, located inside {{the top of the}} bolt, which engages the barrel extension. The sliding forend is connected to the bolt by dual operating bars. The ammunition feed is from two independent tubular magazines, located below the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The locking {{mechanism}} on the joiner {{consists of a}} notch that can be pushed into a small barrel. A flap is then able to push down into the notch, inside the <b>barrel,</b> <b>locking</b> the link, hence the name Link Lock. Link Locks are made in various metals to match the base pieces they are affixed to.|$|R
50|$|The MKS was a gas-operated select fire rifle {{chambered}} for the 5.56 mm NATO cartridge and {{was capable}} of firing around 750/1,100 RPM. It featured rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> {{and was the first}} gun made by Interdynamics in 1979. Tests in the Philippines proved the gun too uncomfortable for the average shooter to fire well and it never made it beyond the prototype stage.|$|R
50|$|Instead of the locking lugs and {{recesses}} milled {{into the}} barrel and slide of Browning-derived weapons {{such as the}} Colt M1911A1, Browning Hi-Power and CZ 75, the P220 variants (and many other modern pistols) <b>lock</b> the <b>barrel</b> and slide together using an enlarged breech section on the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> into the ejection port. The SIG Sauer System (embossed {{on the side of}} the Browning BDA) is a refinement of the Petter-Browning system.|$|R
25|$|The Jarmann M1884 fired a 10.15mm {{black powder}} {{cartridge}} in an 8-round, tubular magazine {{in which the}} rounds were lined up in a tube below the barrel. It has a non-rotating bolt (the part of the action that seals the rear end of the <b>barrel)</b> <b>locked</b> by a rotating bolt handle, and reputedly a smooth action. However, this action is not considered strong enough to fire modern ammunition, since the only locking {{is provided by the}} rotating bolt handle.|$|R
50|$|Instead of the locking lugs and {{recesses}} milled {{into the}} barrel and slide of other Browning-type weapons (such as the Colt M1911A1, Browning Hi-Power and CZ 75), the P226 <b>locks</b> the <b>barrel</b> and slide together using an enlarged breech {{section of the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> into the ejection port. This modified system, which was devised by SIG based on Charles Petter's Modèle 1935A pistol and their own SIG P210, has no functional disadvantages compared to the original system, and has since been copied by numerous firearm manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The pistol operate is a recoil-operated, locked-breech {{and has a}} {{rotating}} <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to lock and unlock itself from the slide, and the front part of the frame under the barrel is shaped as an accessory rail to accept laser sights or flash lights. A unique feature of this pistol is the detachable steel frame that sits inside the polymer grip and contains the fire control group. Like many modern military pistols, the QSZ-92 has a double-action/single-action trigger with a combined safety/decocker.|$|R
5000|$|The Obregón is a Mexican {{designed}} semi-automatic pistol {{designed in}} the mid-1930s by a mechanical engineer, Alejandro Obregón. It uses the same [...]45 caliber ammunition as the Colt 1911 and resembles it in overall appearance, frame size and weight. However, its short-recoil operating and <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system employs a diagonal cam on {{the rear of the}} barrel sliding against a diagonal receiver-mounted groove to rotate the barrel, much like that of the Austro-Hungarian Steyr M1912 pistol, not the [...] "swinging link and pin" [...] of the Colt M1911 series.|$|R

50|$|The M/50 {{is made of}} stamped sheet metal. It is an open bolt design {{which means}} it fires when the bolt is in the locked back open {{position}} with a fixed firing pin. The M/46-M/50 share a unique design: the firearm is stamped from 2 pieces of sheet metal which are shaped with an integral rear pistol grip and magazine housing. The two pieces fit together like a clam shell with the hinge {{at the rear of}} the pistol grip. The firearm is held together with a <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> nut which is threaded onto the fore section of the two receiver halves. The pistol grip is hollow, providing storage space for a magazine loading tool.|$|R
5000|$|... 'lock-tab DC coaxial connector' (also called 'bayonet lock') {{offers a}} {{compromise}} that resists unplugging, but which will disengage when pulled hard enough.

5000|$|The Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle, {{also known}} as the Semi Automatic 22 or SA-22, is a {{takedown}} rifle produced by FN Herstal based on a John Browning patent. The rifle is currently produced by Browning as the Semi-Auto 22. Production began in 1914 and continued through 1974 in Belgium and production continued in 1976 in Japan by Miroku. [...] It was first exported by FN for the American market in 1956. A close copy made by the Chinese company Norinco was formerly imported into the US by Interarms as the Model ATD. Remington manufactured a lighter weight version under license from 1919-1935 as the Remington Model 24 and then replaced it with the Remington Model 241 in 1935. Except for the <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism the Remington Model 241 is very similar to the Browning SA-22.|$|R

50|$|After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt {{submissions}} {{were selected}} to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They {{came up with a}} design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating <b>barrel</b> <b>locking</b> system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.|$|R
