40|$|In {{this project}} we have {{proposed}} {{to investigate a}} number of experimental and theoretical issues associated with the practical use of multi-version software in providing dependable software through fault-avoidance and fault-elimination, as well as run-time tolerance of software faults. In the period reported here we have working on the following: We have continued collection of data on the relationships between software faults and reliability, and the coverage provided by the testing process as measured by different metrics (including data flow metrics). We continued work on software reliability estimation methods based on non-random sampling, {{and the relationship between}} software reliability and code coverage provided through testing. We have continued studying <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> as an efficient mechanism for removal of uncorrelated faults, and common-cause faults of variable span. We have also been studying <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> as a tool for improvement of the software change process, including regression testing. We continued investigating existing, and worked on formulation of new fault-tolerance models. In particular, we have partly finished evaluation of Consensus Voting in the presence of correlated failures, and {{are in the process of}} finishing evaluation of Consensus Recovery Block (CRB) under failure correlation. We find both approaches far superior to commonly employed fixed agreement number voting (usually majority voting). We have also finished a cost analysis of the CRB approach...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{functionally}} equivalent {{programs were}} built and {{tested in a}} multiversion software experiment. Following unit testing, all programs were subjected to an extensive system test. In the process sixty-one distinct faults were identified among the versions. Less than 12 percent of the faults exhibited varying degrees of positive correlation. The common-cause (or similar) faults spanned as many as 14 components. However, a majority of these faults were trivial, and easily detected by proper unit and/or system testing. Only two of the seven similar faults were difficult faults, and both were caused by specification ambiguities. One of these faults exhibited variable identical-and-wrong response span, i. e. response span which varied with the testing conditions and input data. Techniques {{that could have been}} used to avoid the faults are discussed. For example, it was determined that <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> of 2 -tuples could have been used to eliminate about 90 percent of the faults. In addition, four of the seven similar faults could have been detected by using <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing</b> of 5 -tuples. It is believed that most, if not all, similar faults could have been avoided had the specifications been written using more formal notation, the unit testing phase was subject to more stringent standards and controls, and better tools for measuring the quality and adequacy of the test data (e. g. coverage) were used...|$|R

40|$|For dynamic {{simulations}} to be credible, {{verification of}} the computer code must {{be an integral part}} of the modelling process. This two-part paper describes a novel approach to verification through program testing and debugging. In Part 1, a methodology is presented for detecting and isolating coding errors using <b>back-to-back</b> <b>testing.</b> Residuals are generated by comparing the output of two independent implementations, in response to identical inputs. The key feature of the methodology is that a specially modified observer is created using one of the implementations, so as to impose an error-dependent structure on these residuals. Each error can be associated with a fixed and known subspace, permitting errors to be isolated to specific equations in the code. It is shown that the geometric properties extend to multiple errors in either one of the two implementations. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the possible interactions between contact fatigue and dynamic tooth loading in spur gears. To this end, a dynamic gear model is used which incorporates the influence of gear body distortions and simultaneously deals with the equations of motion and the normal contact conditions on tooth flanks. Both crack initiation and propagation are analyzed; crack initiation is studied using several multi-axial fatigue criteria while an approach based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics is employed to analyze the crack propagation period. It is shown that the corresponding fatigue life and defect shape agree well with the evidence from a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>test</b> rig. An extensive parameter analysis is conducted focusing on three characteristic points on the tooth profile, respectively near the root, the pitch point and the tooth tip.

40|$|Both {{the tooth}} root and tooth flank load {{carrying}} capacity are characteristic parameters that decisively influence gear size, as well as gearbox design. The principal requirements towards all modern gearboxes are {{to comply with the}} steadily-increasing power density and to simultaneously offer a high reliability of their components. With increasing gear size, the load stresses at greater material depth increase. Thus, the material and particularly the strength properties also at greater material depth gain more importance. The present paper initially gives an overview of the main failure modes of case carburized gears resulting from material fatigue. Furthermore, the underlying load and stress mechanisms, under particular contemplation of the gear size, will be discussed, as these considerations principally define the required material properties. Subsequently, the principles of newly developed, as well as modified alloy concepts for optimized gear steels with high {{load carrying capacity}} are presented. In the experimental work, the load carrying capacity of the tooth root and tooth flank was determined using a pulsator, as well as an FZG <b>back-to-back</b> <b>test</b> rig.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the Gripen NG exterior noise emissions, a back-to-back noise test has been performed, comprising measurements {{on both the}} Gripen NG demonstrator and Gripen C. The measurements of the two aircraft versions back-to-back has allowed for the difference in measured A-weighted sound pressure levels to be deduced. Knowing the delta is very valuable information, since application of this delta on the comprehensive NPD database for the current Gripen versions A-D is possible.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a passive <b>back-to-back</b> <b>test</b> rig have been characterised, {{leading to a}} multi-coordinate approach {{for the analysis of}} arbitrary test configurations. Universal joints have been introduced into a typical pre-loaded back-to-back system in order to produce an oscillating torsional moment in a test specimen. Two different arrangements have been investigated using a frequency-based sub-structuring approach: the receptance method. A numerical model has been developed in accordance with this theory, allowing interconnection of systems with two-coordinates and closed multi-loop schemes. The model calculates the receptance functions and modal and deflected shapes of a general system. Closed form expressions of the following individual elements have been developed: a servomotor, damped continuous shaft and a universal joint. Numerical results for specific cases have been compared with published data in literature and experimental measurements undertaken in the present work. Due to the complexity of the universal joint and its oscillating dynamic effects, a more detailed analysis of this component has been developed. Two models have been presented. The first represents the joint as two inertias connected by a massless cross-piece. The second, derived by the dynamic analysis of a spherical four-link mechanism, considers the contribution of the floating element and its gyroscopic effects. An investigation into non-linear behaviour has led to a time domain model that utilises the Runge-Kutta fourth order method for resolution of the dynamic equations. It has been demonstrated that the torsional receptances of a universal joint, derived using the simple model, result in representation of the joint as an equivalent variable inertia. In order to verify the model, a test rig has been built and experimental validation undertaken. The variable inertia of a universal joint has lead to a novel application of the component as a passive device for the balancing of inertia variations in slider-crank mechanisms...|$|E
