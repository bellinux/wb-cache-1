5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is viewed as dubious.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion.

40|$|Purpose. Triple-negative (TN) <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> {{have high}} ma-lignancy {{potential}} {{and are often}} characterized by early sys-temic relapse.

5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> due to a defective BRCA1 gene.

Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.
