50|$|Littlejohn {{was called}} into the Ireland squad in February 2015, listed as a free agent. After a year with Celtic in 2015, Littlejohn {{returned}} to Glasgow City for her fourth spell with the club in January 2016. She departed during the mid-season <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in Celtic colours for {{the second part of}} the campaign.|$|R
50|$|The 8th Panzer Division took up {{defensive}} positions {{north of}} the Ukrainian capital, but failed to prevent the soviet armies <b>break</b> through, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> pushed <b>back</b> until Manstein, now commander of Army Group South orchestrated a counter stroke at Zhitomir temporarily stabilising the front. However the reprieve did not last and renewed Soviet thrusts forced the 4th Panzer Army and the 8th Panzer Division with it, back towards the Polish frontier.|$|R
5000|$|Six {{years after}} her initial exit, Dean <b>was</b> lured <b>back</b> to EastEnders by {{producer}} John Yorke, where she reprised the role of Sharon from 2001 to 2006. In December 2004 the Sunday Mirror reported that executive producer Kathleen Hutchison offered to double Dean's salary from £150,000 a year to £300,000 a year, to persuade her {{to remain in the}} show, making her one of the highest paid actresses in British soap. Dean's character left the serial again in January 2006. Dean's exit was announced in August 2005 and an official EastEnders press report stated that she was merely taking a scheduled <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> due <b>back</b> on set later in 2006; [...] however, this did not happen, and in June 2006 the BBC denied press speculation that there were any immediate plans for her to return to the series.|$|R
50|$|The field started quickly, with {{an average}} speed close to 50 km/h for the first half-hour of racing, as <b>breaks</b> went <b>and</b> <b>were</b> brought <b>back.</b> Finally a {{breakaway}} formed, which consisted of seven riders: in the break were Oleg Chuzhda, Maxim Iglinsky, Tanel Kangert, Robert Kišerlovski, Pablo Lastras, Christian Poos and Anthony Roux. As the lead rose up to eight minutes, the Great Britain team began to increase {{the pace of the}} peloton to start chasing the group and lower their lead. The lead <b>was</b> brought <b>back</b> to about four minutes, mainly due to the work of Steve Cummings and David Millar.|$|R
50|$|During her journey, Georgia <b>breaks</b> down <b>and</b> <b>is</b> taken <b>back</b> to the {{roundhouse}} by Doc. Left behind, Rollo eventually takes Doc's {{advice of}} flagging {{down one of}} the other engines returning from their daily runs over the mountain. Farnsworth and Pete turn blind eyes to the offer, and Jebediah explains that going over the mountain is too much for him. Meanwhile, despite the tower turning down Tillie's offer to help carry the birthday train, she and Chip sneak past the tower and pulls the birthday train up a mountain. Despite being ridiculed by the animals along the way, Tillie manages to reach the summit after crossing a bridge that collapses, but loses the last train car, which snaps off and falls into the river along the way.|$|R
50|$|On 13 August 2008, Fox News interviewed 12-year-old Ossetian-American girl Amanda Kokoeva and {{her aunt}} Laura Tedeeva-Korewicki, who had {{returned}} from South Ossetia. Fox began the interview by emphasizing the experiences of a 12-year-old girl. Invited to tell about Georgian bombings, the 12-year-old girl and her aunt said they were saved by Russians. As the aunt started to mention the conflict was started by Saakashvili, Fox News cut the interview for commercials. When the <b>break</b> ended <b>and</b> they <b>were</b> <b>back</b> on the air, Fox granted the aunt additional time to finish her thoughts during the last minute of the program at which time she started to blame the Georgian government but explicitly distinguished it from the Georgian people. Thereafter {{before the end of}} the program the anchorman said that there were grey areas in war. CBS also had an interview with this girl before.|$|R
25|$|Krukenberg {{and many}} of the {{survivors}} of the remnants of the Nordland Division crossed the Spree shortly before dawn but could not <b>break</b> through <b>and</b> <b>were</b> forced <b>back</b> into the centre. There they split up, some discarded their uniforms and tried to pass themselves off as civilians, but most were either killed or, like Krukenberg, captured. An attempt to break out northward along the Schönhauser Allee by German troops on the north-eastern side of the central defence area failed because the Soviets were now aware that breakout attempts <b>were</b> being made <b>and</b> <b>were</b> hurriedly putting cordons in place to stop them. The remnants of the Münchenberg Division (five tanks, four artillery pieces, and a handful of troops) and the remnants of the 18th Panzer Grenadier and 9th Parachute divisions broke out of the centre westward through the Tiergarten. They were followed by thousands of stragglers <b>and</b> civilians. Spandau <b>was</b> still {{in the hands of a}} Hitler Youth detachment, so an attempt was made to force a passage across the Charlottenbrücke (Charlotten bridge) over the Havel. Despite heavy shelling which killed many, German weight of numbers meant that they were able to drive the Soviet infantry back and many thousands crossed into Spandau. The armoured vehicles that crossed the bridge made for Staaken.|$|R
50|$|Juli Baker meets Bryce Loski {{two weeks}} before the {{beginning}} of second grade; it's something about those blue eyes that attract her. Julianna knows it's love, while Bryce, like any seven-year-old boy, doesn't. Julianna stalks Bryce all through his childhood; staring at his house, asking him to play, following him at school, etc. Every day, Bryce watches Julianna climb the sycamore tree at the bus stop, from which Julianna always watches the town. She constantly asks Bryce to come join her in the tree, as well as yelling out how far away the bus is. Bryce, being unbelievably shy and annoyed by all the attention, asks out Juli's arch enemy, Shelly Stalls, to get rid of his admirer. Bryce looks over his shoulder for Julianna every time he's with Shelly, which causes Julianna to think he's being forced to date her. This provokes a cat fight between Juli and Shelly over Bryce. The two <b>break</b> up, <b>and</b> Bryce <b>is</b> <b>back</b> to square one. There comes an incident in sixth grade when, much to Bryce's chagrin and irritation, Juli constantly sniffs Bryce's hair in spelling from her assigned position behind him. According to Juli, his hair smells like watermelon and he has blond earlobe fuzz. Bryce is disgruntled from this seat change, because Juli had initially sat next to him where he could see her answers and copy off of them. Now that she's behind him, he's lost that advantage, and his grades slip, especially in spelling. This halts, however, when as Juli sniffs him, she begins to whisper answers in his ear. Bryce, torn between feeling grateful and awkwardly guilty for hating her so much when she's helping him, follows the answers anyway {{until the end of the}} year.|$|R
5000|$|At about 4pm, Bedford {{ordered his}} men to advance. The English {{soldiers}} shouted [...] "St. George! Bedford!" [...] as they slowly began to cross the field. At the same time, as if by some pre-arranged signal, the Milanese knights charged through the English archers on Bedford's right. Once Bedford had taken his troops within arrow range, he ordered a halt and the archers started to drive their stakes into the ground, a simple but effective device for snaring cavalry. The ground had been baked hard by the summer sun, and the stakes could be forced in only with difficulty. Seeing an opportunity, the French began an immediate charge out of synchronisation with the Scots division. As the French advanced under Aumale, they shouted [...] "Montjoie! Saint Denis!". The archers on Bedford's extreme right were caught off balance, allowing the French cavalry to break through their ranks (improved, tempered steel armour worn by the Lombards may also {{have contributed to the}} effect). The most dangerous time for infantry was during a rout, when they lost formation and therefore could not bring in defensive firepower, which allowed the French knights to hunt down the English archers one by one with their heavy broadswords that could easily smash a man's skull to pieces with one blow. Many of the English panicked in face of the French advance and a Captain Young was afterwards found guilty of cowardice for retreating with the 500 men under his command without orders. Young <b>was</b> drawn <b>and</b> quartered as punishment for his retreat. The French continued their charge towards the baggage train to the north, while the men-at-arms in Bedford's division began a spirited attack on the French infantry to their front. While Salisbury was hard pressed by the Scots, the men defending the baggage train were equally hard pressed by the attacks of the 600 Lombard horsemen together with the French knights.The head-on clash between the English and French knights on the field of Verneuil, both of whom had marched on foot into battle, resulted {{in the words of the}} British medievalist Desmond Seward [...] "... a hand-to-hand combat whose ferocity astounded even contemporaries". One veteran of Verneuil, Wavrin, recalled how [...] "the blood of the dead spread on the field and that of the wounded ran in great streams all over the earth". For about three-quarters of an hour, Frenchmen and Englishmen stabbed, hacked and cut each other down on the field of Verneuil without either side gaining any advantage in what is generally considered to be one of the most fiercely fought battles of the entire war. Bedford himself fought in the battle, wielding a fearsome two-handed pole-axe that cut down many a Frenchman, leading one veteran to recall: [...] "He reached no one whom he did not fell".> Seward noted that the Bedford's battle-axe [...] "... smashed open an expensive armour like a modern tin can, the body underneath being crushed and mangled before even the blade sank in". After about three-quarters of an hour of the onslaught, Narbonne's division began to give ground before finally <b>breaking</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> chased <b>back</b> to Verneuil, where many, including Aumale, were drowned in the moat. Narbonne, Ventadour, Tonnerre were all dead.|$|R
