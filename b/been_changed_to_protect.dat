5000|$|Another Dragnet {{trademark}} is the show's opening narration: [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: {{the story}} {{you are about to}} hear is true. Only the names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent." [...] This underwent minor revisions over time. The [...] "only" [...] and [...] "ladies and gentlemen" [...] were dropped at some point, and for the television version [...] "hear" [...] was changed to [...] "see". Variations on this narration have been featured in subsequent crime dramas, and in parodies of the dramas (e.g. [...] "Only the facts have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the guilty").|$|E
5000|$|... "While In Search of Excellence {{turned out}} to be a fraud, In Search of Stupidity is genuine, and no names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the guilty," [...] {{according}} to one reviewer.|$|E
30|$|The {{names of}} persons and places <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> {{the privacy of}} the interviewees.|$|R
50|$|Like its {{companion}} series Dragnet {{a disclaimer}} {{at the end}} of episodes remarks this was story was based on true incidents and names <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1959 {{the first}} editions of [...] "The Big Decision" [...] were published. This was Cvetic's {{personal}} {{account of his}} actions as a counterspy, many of the names in the story <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> identities.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{stories you}} are about to see are true and based on actual events. Names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the identities of the deceased.""WARNING: The deaths portrayed in this show are real and {{extremely}} graphic." ...|$|E
5000|$|Writer-producer Frank Howson later {{claimed that}} [...] "every incident" [...] {{in the film}} was true: [...] "either I have lived it, or I know {{somebody}} who has. There is no fabrication, except in the names, which have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the guilty." ...|$|E

[...] (this time, the emphasis is on the word [...] "WILL").|$|E
50|$|Most {{characters}} are composites of several real people and appear {{in only one}} story. Some characters feature in several stories, such as 'Lumi', the narrator's helpful neighbour. A minority of {{characters are}} based on sole, real persons whose names/milieu <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> privacy.|$|R
50|$|The hot {{year where}} the {{temperature}} was around 42 degrees but with the reflected heat off the road surface played havoc with all riders. Only 31% finished the 200 km {{and as a result}} the rules <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> riders in extreme heat.|$|R
5000|$|According to Elizabeth May, Fish habitat {{provisions}} will <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> only fish of [...] "commercial, Aboriginal, and recreational" [...] {{value and}} even those habitat protections are weakened. The new provisions create an incentive to drain a lake and kill all the fish, if not in a fishery, in order to fill a dry hole with mining tailings. Elizabeth May 2012 ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{description}} at {{the beginning}} of the first episode stated: [...] "This program is based on Charles Falco's account of events that took place between 2003 and 2006, when he infiltrated one of America's most notorious biker gangs. Names, locations and key details have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the identities of those involved." ...|$|E
5000|$|The show's {{cultural}} {{impact is}} such that after five decades, elements of Dragnet are familiar {{to those who have}} never seen or heard the program. The ominous, four-note introduction to the brass and tympani theme music (titled [...] "Danger Ahead"), composed by Walter Schumann, is instantly recognizable. [...] It is derived from Miklós Rózsa's score for the 1946 film version of The Killers. Another Dragnet trademark is the show's opening narration: [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: the story you are about to hear is true. Only the names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent." [...] This underwent minor revisions over time. The [...] "only" [...] and [...] "ladies and gentlemen" [...] were dropped at some point. Variations on this narration have been featured in subsequent crime dramas, and in parodies of the dramas (e.g. [...] "Only the facts have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the guilty").|$|E
50|$|Fire And Fame is {{an account}} of Deisinger’s life and career, with no embellishment. It does not attempt {{to cash in on}} cliché tales of music {{industry}} debauchery, although the occasional sordid tale does surface. Some names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the not-so-innocent, and Deisinger makes a point of portraying former bandmates and rivals alike in a respectful light.|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} Bushmaster is <b>to</b> provide <b>protected</b> {{mobility}} transport (or protected troop lift capability), with infantry dismounting from the vehicle before going into action. As the Bushmaster is only lightly armoured, the term Infantry Mobility Vehicle (IMV) was initially adopted to distinguish it from a heavier wheeled or tracked armoured personnel carrier, such as the ASLAV and M113 also in Australian service. Later the Bushmaster's designation <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>Protected</b> Mobility Vehicle (PMV).|$|R

Within {{a couple of}} weeks of downloading the app, Kendra had met two guys. While her first date went well, her second date out was anything but a romantic night out. She should’ve known right away that he was a little creepy. “He told me he was looking for whatever was out there. I should have known that as my first clue of, this guy’s kind of a creeper,” Kendra says. *Names <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the identities of those involved...|$|R
5000|$|Bolivar Trask is {{mentioned}} in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse in stage 4 concerning his Sentinels {{and how they}} have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> New York from the forces of Apocalypse.|$|R
5000|$|The 1954 Woody Woodpecker cartoon Under the Counter Spy was {{a parody}} of Dragnet. At the beginning, a narrator says, [...] "The story {{you are about to}} see is a big fat lie. No names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> anybody!" [...] At the end, a hammer and stamp make the words [...] "THE END", and the hammerer hits his thumb.|$|E
5000|$|In {{interviews}} and articles, McBain has freely admitted that his series was {{heavily influenced by}} the radio and TV series Dragnet. This introduction, simultaneously evoking and contradicting Dragnets introductory phrase, [...] "The story {{you are about to}} see is true. The names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent," [...] was apparently McBains way of acknowledging the debt, yet announcing his intention to go his own way in every book.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Laurie Lindeen, Minneapolis author, wife of ex-Replacements member Paul Westerberg, {{and former}} bandleader of Zuzu's Petals, chronicles {{several years of}} working at the [...] "Hi-Lo Diner," [...] {{described}} in her book Petal Pusher as a [...] "famous fourteen-stool breakfast joint" [...] near the U of M campus that has narrow walls [...] "covered in grease-preserved foreign money." [...] While the name may have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent, it's clear she worked at Al's.|$|E
2500|$|The grazing {{rules for}} the land went through changes over the years, {{including}} some updated grazing rules in 1993 in the Gold Butte and Bunkerville land area of Nevada. Among other issues, the 1993 rules <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the vulnerable desert tortoise. [...] Other rules included limits {{to the number of}} cattle allowed in certain areas <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the lands from the severe overgrazing caused by less regulation in previous years and to help the land recover from recent wildfires. Currently there are no grazing permits on the Bunkerville allotment, and any livestock on that land are there illegally.|$|R
50|$|Doe v. Borough of Barrington was a {{legal case}} in the US. In the case, {{it was decided that}} a family’s privacy rights were {{violated}} when a police officer told their neighbors that the husband had AIDS after he had relayed that information to the police during a search. Because the information was given to a state employee in confidence, and because there was no compelling government interest in giving that information to the neighbors, the police violated the family’s privacy rights by telling the neighbors of the husband’s condition. It also caused substantial harm to the family due to the stigma that was attached to the wife and children after this information was revealed. Some of the names <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their identities.|$|R
50|$|The {{objectives}} of the rival resistance movement which emerged some weeks earlier, the Chetniks, were the retention of the Yugoslav monarchy, ensuring the safety of ethnic Serb populations, {{and the establishment of}} a Greater Serbia through the ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs from territories they considered rightfully and historically Serbian. Relations between the two movements were uneasy from the start, but from October 1941 they degenerated into full-scale conflict. To the Chetniks, Tito's pan-ethnic policies seemed anti-Serbian, whereas the Chetniks' royalism was anathema to the communists. In {{the early part of the}} war Partisan forces were predominantly composed of Serbs. In that period names of Muslim and Croat commanders of Partisan forces had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> them from their predominantly Serb colleagues.|$|R

Presenting the best homies you never knew you needed.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} who exactly Maggie is, Kiedis {{said that he}} is not about to reveal his inspirations. [...] "It's just a {{collection}} of memories and people along the way that had maybe left my consciousness until I heard that music, and then they kind of came dancing back into my consciousness, and out the old pen onto the paper. [...] "Names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent. Although there is a Maggie, I realized later. There's two Maggies, actually." ...|$|E
5000|$|A 1956 Looney Tunes short, Rocket Squad, starred Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as Sgt. Joe Monday and Det. Schmoe Tuesday, respectively. Daffy narrated, {{giving a}} running {{timeline}} {{in the manner}} of Sgt. Friday. This police adventure ends with both officers convicted and imprisoned for false arrest. The opening title reads: [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen, The story you are about to see is true. The drawings have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the Innocent". Another short Tree Cornered Tweety, featured Tweety imitating the narrator of Dragnet as he is being pursued by Sylvester again.|$|E

5000|$|... "To Love in the Rest of Life" [...] was {{inspired}} by a girl from Taichung, Taiwan, who was diagnosed with terminal gastric cancer. After she was diagnosed, her boyfriend did not abandon her, but took good care of her and still proposed to her eventually. Some media including EBC News reported this touching real story about a man's proposal to his 22-year-old girlfriend named Xiaoyan (The name <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the identity of the girl). At that time, Jacky Cheung was projecting his new Chinese album. He was deeply touched and inspired by the news, so he asked his friend Albert Leung, who is called [...] "God of Lyrics", to write a song about this story. The melody was composed by five musicians of five different nationalities. But unfortunately, the heroine of the song Xiaoyan died {{a few days before the}} song was released. She was unable to listen to the song in memory of her short marriage with her husband.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{announcer}}s were used. Episodes {{began with}} announcer George Fenneman intoning the series opening ("The story {{you are about}} to hear is true; only the names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent.") and Hal Gibney describing the premise of the episode. [...] "Big Saint" [...] (April 26, 1951) for example, begins with [...] "You're a Detective Sergeant. You're assigned to auto theft detail. A well organized ring of car thieves begins operations in your city. It's one of the most puzzling cases you've ever encountered. Your job: break it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fenneman {{was one of}} a pair of announcers on Dragnet; {{he shared}} {{narration}} duties with Hal Gibney on radio and the original 1951 Dragnet television series, and then with John Stephenson when Dragnet returned to TV in 1967. It was Fennemans voice which announced, [...] "The story you are about to see is true. The names have <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the innocent." [...] while Stephenson would be heard {{at the end of the}} episode describing the court trials and verdicts. He was also the principal commercial announcer for the radio version of Gunsmoke, and frequently introduced [...] "Matt Dillon" [...] (William Conrad) after the episode to extoll the virtues of L&M or Chesterfield cigarettes.|$|E
5000|$|On April 12, 2016, the Ottawa Citizen {{reported}} that MacLaren's website included a testimonials section praising his work {{where most of}} the constituents were fictional and were represented by photos that had been taken without permission from the internet. One of the testimonials was from a [...] "Robert & Karen" [...] from Constance Bay, which coincidentally is where MacLaren's federal counterpart, Liberal MP Karen McCrimmon lives with her husband Robert. MacLaren's website initially added a disclaimer claiming that the names and depictions of constituents had <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their privacy before removing the page entirely. MacLaren then issued an apology for the improper use of constituent testimonials and had his website taken offline.|$|E
5000|$|The Croatian Parliament {{passed an}} {{amendment}} to Croatia's extradition law just days before formal EU accession, including a provision which prevented extradition for crimes committed before 2002, when new EU extradition rules came into effect, thus omitting the 1983 murder of Đureković in which Perković was implicated. [...] This amendment was highly controversial in Croatia; the government's critics dubbed the law Lex Perković, asserting it <b>was</b> <b>changed</b> specifically <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{discrepancies}} between the re-inaction {{of the first}} communication on 19 April 1942 and official accounts.

50|$|Sweeping <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> seen at Indy for 1993, both at {{the track}} and amongst the competitors.

Among the noticeable <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> smaller rear wings, and the banning of the wheel disc inserts.
