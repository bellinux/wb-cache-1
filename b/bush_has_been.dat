The U.S. was criticized for alleged prisoner abuse at Guantánamo Bay, Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and secret CIA prisons in eastern Europe, according to Amnesty International. In response, the U.S. government claimed incidents of abuse were isolated incidents which did not reflect U.S. policy.|$|E

25|$|Even though Clinton roughly {{received}} 3.1 {{million more}} votes than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had four years earlier, the Democrats recorded a 2.6 percentage point decrease in {{their share of}} the popular vote compared to 1988 due to the higher turnout. His 43% share of the popular vote was the second-lowest for any winning candidate in the 20th century after Woodrow Wilson in 1912 (41.8%). President Bush's 37.5% was the lowest percentage total for a sitting president seeking re-election since William Howard Taft, also in 1912 (23.2%); just like this one, the 1912 election was also a three-way race (that time between Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Theodore Roosevelt). It was also the lowest percentage for a major-party candidate since Alf Landon received 36.5% of the vote in 1936. Bush had a lower percentage of the popular vote than even Herbert Hoover, who was defeated in 1932 (39.7%). However, none of these races included a major third candidate. As of the 2016 election, <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the last president voted out of office after one term, as Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama were all re-elected to second terms in office.|$|E

500|$|Kele Okereke of Bloc Party {{said about}} [...] "Hounds of Love": [...] "The first time I heard it I {{was sitting in}} a {{reclining}} sofa. As the beat started I was transported somewhere else. Her voice, the imagery, the huge drum sound: it seemed to capture everything for me. As a songwriter you're constantly chasing that feeling". Rufus Wainwright named Bush as one of his top ten gay icons. Outside music, <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an inspiration to several fashion designers, including Hussein Chalayan.|$|E

He also read 14 Lincoln biographies, and {{during the last three}} years of his presidency, he reportedly read 186 books. Walt Harrington, a journalist, recalled seeing [...] "books by John Fowles, F.

Other activities include cigar smoking and golf. Since leaving the White House, Bush has also taken up oil painting.|$|E

Courtney Love of Hole mentioned Bush among other artists {{as one of her}} favourites as a teenager. Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: [...] "Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds Of Love: [...] "I love the way it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be [...] "beauty beyond belief". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled [...] "Bird in Hand" [...] (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Bush was one of the singers who Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls. In December 1989, Robert Smith of The Cure chose [...] "The Sensual World" [...] as his favourite single of the year, The Sensual World as his favourite album of the year and included [...] "all of Kate Bush" [...] plus other artists in his list, [...] "the best things about the eighties".|$|E

6000|$|The only {{domestic}} animals about these villages are dogs, poultry, and pigeons (fine blue rocks): I never saw in Pongo-land the goats mentioned by M. du Chaillu. The bush, however, supplies {{an abundance of}} [...] "beef," [...] and, as most South Africans, they have a word, Isángú (amongst the Mpongwes), or Ingwámbá (of the Cape Lopez people), to express that inordinate longing and yearning for the stimulus of meat diet, caused by the damp and depressing equatorial climate, of which Dr. Livingstone so pathetically complains. The settlements are sometimes provided with little plots of vegetables; usually, however, the plantations are distant, to preserve them from the depredations of bipeds and quadrupeds. They are guarded by bushmen, {{who live on the}} spot and, shortly before the rains all the owners flock to their farms, where, for a fortnight or so, they and their women do something like work. New grounds are preferred, because it is easier to clear them than to remove the tangled after-growth of ferns and guinea grass; moreover, they yield, of course, better crops. The plough has not yet reached Pongo-land; the only tools are the erem (little axe for felling), the matchet (a rude cutlass for clearing), the hoe, and a succedaneum for the dibble. After the <b>bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> burned as manure, and the seed has been sown, no one will take the trouble of weeding, and half the surface is wild growth.|$|E
