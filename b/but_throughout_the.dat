5|$|Back in Britain, in December 1775, the King's Proclamation of Rebellion had {{declared}} the colonies outside his protection, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> first four Virginia Conventions, {{there was no}} adopted expression in favor of independence from the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|He {{was little}} known {{personally}} to the English public. His absence at sea, and on travels and duty with his regiment, {{kept him out}} of the general eye... at times, there was a sallowness of hue, which much increased the grave aspect... not only in the metropolis, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> country, somehow, it was always said, 'He will never come to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried {{to cling to}} the rigging, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept {{overboard}} by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} bout of illness subsided, Augustus {{gave up his}} consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul {{would be in the}} years 5 and 2BC, both times to {{introduce}} his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.|$|E
5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class {{that served as the}} recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. <b>But</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E
5|$|With Pink Flamingos (1972) and Reefer Madness (1936) {{making money}} in midnight showings nationwide, a Fox executive, Tim Deegan, {{was able to}} talk {{distributors}} into midnight screenings, starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976. The cult following started shortly after the film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theater in New York City., then spread to other counties in NYC, and to Uniondale, L.I. Rocky Horror was not only found in the larger cities <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> United States where many attendees would get in free if they arrived in costume. The western division of the film's release included The U.A. Cinemas in Fresno and Merced, The Cinema J in Sacramento, California, and the Covell in Modesto. In New Orleans, an early organised performance group was active with the release there {{as well as in}} such cities as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at the Biograph Theater). Before long nearly every screening of the film was accompanied by a live fan cast.|$|E

5|$|Work {{performed}} by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided {{much of the}} labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming (latifundia), these may have been mostly slaves, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> Empire, slave farm labour was probably less important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} attracts {{an extensive}} television audience, {{not just in}} Europe, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> world.

The 2013 final was the most watched final to date, drawing 360million television viewers.|$|E
25|$|The {{subject-matter}} (see synopsis below) did not offend Viennese {{sensibilities of}} the time, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> 19th and early 20th centuries, {{it was considered}} risqué, vulgar, and even immoral. The opera was rarely performed, and when it did appear it was presented in one of several bowdlerised forms.|$|E

25|$|The lives, roles, {{and rights}} of women in Chile have gone through many changes over time. Chilean women's {{societal}} roles have historically been impacted by traditional gender roles and a patriarchal culture, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century, women increasingly involved themselves in politics and protest, resulting in provisions to the constitution to uphold equality {{between men and women}} and prohibit sex discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Irene Reilly is {{the mother}} of Ignatius. She has been widowed for 21 years. At first, she allows Ignatius his space and drives him where he needs to go, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> course of the novel she learns to stand up for herself.

25|$|In {{addition}} to decreasing property taxes, the initiative also contained language requiring {{a two-thirds majority}} in both legislative houses for future increases of any state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates.

25|$|At room {{temperature}} and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium {{when the air}} over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up.

25|$|The {{government}} {{learned of}} the planned attacks from informants named Faustino Díaz Pacheco and Luciano Cuadra. Faustino Díaz Pacheco was the brother of Raimundo Díaz Pacheco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Cadets of the Republic. He was thus aware of all Nationalist activity and planning not only in San Juan, <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> entire island. Luciano Cuadra {{was president of the}} San Juan chapter of the Nationalist Party. Pacheco and Cuadra betrayed their own organization, informed the police, and later became government witnesses.|$|E

25|$|With the {{acquisition}} of a new ring and training facilities, IPW was prepared to achieve its first goal of running regular house shows in the Auckland area. Beginning with Genesis at Pt.

In May 2005, TVNZ's Hadyn Jones conducted an interview with The Economist and The Machine at their Auckland gym.|$|E
25|$|There was resistance, {{much of it}} from Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. But {{there was}} also a pattern of denial, {{cover-up}} and cozy bureaucratic collusion between industry and government, the last especially notorious in Japan but by no means limited to that country. Even then, pro-nuclear power forces could prevail only by managing to instill in the minds of Japanese people a dichotomy between the physics of nuclear power and that of nuclear weapons, an illusory distinction made not only in Japan <b>but</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} cities, slavery was a {{consuming}} topic; some of Louisville's economy {{was built on}} its thriving slave market. Slave traders' revenues, and those from feeding, clothing and transporting the slaves to the Deep South, all contributed to the city's economy. The direct use of slaves as labor in the central Kentucky economy had lessened by 1850. <b>But</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, the state slaveholders sold 2500-4000 slaves annually downriver to the Deep South. Slave pens were located on Second between Market and Main Streets.|$|E
