40|$|BACKGROUND: Glycerol {{plasticised}} {{wheat gluten}} shows advantages for non-food {{applications such as}} <b>biodegradable</b> <b>package</b> films and bioplastics because of their abundant resources, low cost, good biodegradability and suitable mechanical and oxygen barrier properties. The intention {{of this study was}} to evaluate to the equibiaxial stress relaxation of 400 g kg(- 1) glycerol plasticised gluten at different biaxial strains at room temperature for a better understanding of the processibility. RESULTS: The plasticised gluten shows significant stress relaxation and the spectra span over six decades of time at biaxial strains from 0. 03 to 1. 51. Plotting the instantaneous modulus against strain reveals strain softening and strain hardening at strains below and above 0. 25, respectively. The relaxation modulus as a function of time can be fitted to the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts equation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that stress relaxation of plasticised gluten is highly dependent on strain level and biaxial deformation accelerates the network relaxation by widening the distribution of relaxation times.

In addition, the objective for this research also wants to study the mechanical properties of biofilms at different percentage of weight of polylactic acid, chitosan, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The <b>biodegradable</b> plastic food <b>packaging</b> was prepared by blending the films based on these four main chemicals (PLA, chitosan, PEG) and 30 ml of silver nanopaticles for every blend of biofilms. Then tested the films with universal testing machine according to American Standard Test Method (ASTM D 882) to investigate the mechanical properties (tensile and elongation) with 1 mm thickness film. Then, the mechanical properties of <b>biodegradable</b> food <b>packaging</b> films optimized by changing the parameters of percentage polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ratio of chitosan to PLA using Response Surface Method (RSM) {{in order to obtain}} the good <b>biodegradable</b> food <b>packaging</b> films. Degradation rate test has been determined by using the soil burial degradation rate method by burial the blend films for 14 days. The results show that, at the optimum condition, the tensile strength reached the maximum value of 10. 573 MPa when the PEG is 17. 6 % and PLA is 71. 21 %. For the elongation at break point, the optimum condition for the elongation at the break point reached the maximum value of 68 % when the PEG is 22. 07 % and PLA is 50 %.

40|$|Packaging waste forms a {{significant}} part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to reduce amounts of packaging waste. Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>packaging</b> materials from renewable natural resources (e. g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal. This paper discusses the potential impact of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>packaging</b> materials on waste management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer packaging materials.

40|$|Introduction: Lipid {{oxidation}} {{can produce}} changes in food quality parameters, such as organoleptic properties and nutritional value, {{which leads to}} the generation and accumulation of compounds that may be responsible for product unacceptability for human consumption.

Traditionally, synthetic antioxidants have been used, like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), although the potential toxicity is making their application questionable. In this respect, natural antioxidants and the search for naturally occurring compounds that have antioxidant effect are gaining interest for their antimicrobial activity and their flavors that lead them to be widely used within the food industry [3].
