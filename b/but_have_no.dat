5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol-related {{birth defects}} (ARBD), {{formerly}} known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE), was a term proposed {{as an alternative to}} FAE and PFAE The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> key features of FASD. PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD. The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD.|$|E

25|$|The boroughs were {{originally}} intended to retain some local governance in the consolidated city. Each borough individually elects a borough president and used to elect two at-large city council members, {{in addition to those}} elected based on each borough's population. The borough presidents once wielded considerable power as members of the New York City Board of Estimate, but the position is now largely ceremonial and advisory. Boroughs function as counties for certain purposes, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> county government. Each of the five New York City district attorneys, however, is still elected by county (for example, the district attorney for Brooklyn is called the Kings County District Attorney).|$|E

In her time in prison during legal proceedings, she is quickly becoming insane, planning one tea shop after another. Mr Entwhistle and Hercule Poirot suspect her punishment might be served in Broadmoor, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt she had plotted and carried out the cold blooded murder in full possession of her faculties – this ladylike murderer.|$|E
25|$|Military {{swarming}} {{is often}} encountered in asymmetric warfare where opposing forces {{are not of}} the same size, or capacity. In such situations, swarming {{involves the use of}} a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization. Historically military forces have used the principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but there is now active research in consciously examining military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming. In nature and nonmilitary situations, there are other various forms of swarming. Biologically driven forms are often complex adaptive systems, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> central planning, simple individual rules, and nondeterministic behavior {{that may or may not}} evolve with the situation.|$|E
