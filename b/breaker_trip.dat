40|$|PosterInternational audienceA {{comparative}} study between inductive and resistive superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) from current limitation {{point of view}} is presented. Different types of fault current limiters are available but the SFCL, thanks to its intrinsic properties, with an extremely non-linear resistivity, {{can be seen as a}} natural fault current limiter. At this day, the resistive SFCL (rSFCL) and the inductive SFCL (iSFCL) appear to be the most used in electrical network. Some papers deal with rSFCL and iSFCL but most of them reduce the comparison to the three-phase short-circuit only. However, despite it's one of the most critical case, it is not the most common. For example, if a phase-to-phase short circuit with earth connection occurs close to a transformer with low zero sequence impedance, its amplitude could be higher than the three-phase one. The proposed study, based on symmetrical components, takes into account various fault types (i. e. single line-to-ground fault, line-to-line fault, double line-to-ground fault, three-phase fault) at different locations in meshed and non-meshed HV power system. Comparisons were made by studying the initial symmetrical short-circuit current and the first peak short-circuit current at the fault point and near the fault location (parallel transmission line, generator, …). Various SFCL impedance values and SFCL locations were studied to determine which type of SFCLs is the most effective. In addition, we studied the effects of the power system parameters changes in presence of SFCL (i. e. transformer connection, X/R line ratio). Results show that the rSFCL is the most suitable to limit the first peak of the fault current. About the optimal location the SFCL, we conclude that the transformer feeder is more interesting than the line feeder. In fact, for a power system with parallel transmission lines, we show that a line feeder position induces a significant increase of the current in the healthy line leading to a <b>breaker</b> <b>trip...</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityCyber {{intrusions}} into substations of a {{power grid}} {{are a source of}} vulnerability since most substations are unmanned and with limited protection of the cyber and physical security. In the worst case, simultaneous cyber intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In addition, substation communication protocols do not include cyber security features in their original standard. Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) contains the circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>trip</b> command whereas Sampled Measured Value (SMV) includes measured analog values such as currents and voltages. Due to the importance of substation automation multicast messages, IEC 62351 standards proposed the authentication method as a primary security measure for GOOSE and SMV messages since they required fast transmission time. However, performance testing for the application of the authentication method to GOOSE and SMV is in an early stage, and there is presently no solution to detection of the GOOSE and SMV related error, anomaly and intrusion. Cyber security technologies for anomaly detection at a substation are in an early stage of development. Technologies to detect anomalies for substation automation multicast protocols and applications are critically needed. This dissertation is concerned with anomaly detection in the computer network environment of a substation. The proposed integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed based on the IEEE 39 and modified IEEE 118 -bus systems. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed impact evaluation method can help operators find the most critical substation among the anomaly detected substations. In addition, the proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations {{of a power}} grid.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Increase {{in power}} {{generation}} capacity of electrical power systems has led to increase in the fault current level which can exceed the maximum designed short-circuit ratings of the switchgear.
