500|$|The cabinet {{clashed with}} Brătianu {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that it had been negotiating in secret with the disinherited Prince Carol (a traditional adversary of the PNL) as Ferdinand's health was taking {{a turn for the worse}} (Averescu later claimed that he had been asked by Brătianu: [...] "So, after I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> power, you wish to rise and dominate?"). The PNL withdrew its support, and, through an order signed by Constantin Hiott, Averescu's was replaced by the broad coalition government of Barbu Știrbey, Brătianu's brother-in-law. The general's deposition, confirmed by King Ferdinand on his deathbed, created a vacuum on the Right, soon filled by the Iron Guard, a fascist movement formed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (formerly an associate of Cuza's).|$|E
2500|$|The {{paper had}} a big {{circulation}} and began to exercise a great influence on the masses of the people. In Mitchel's Letters to [...] "The Protestant Farmers, Labourers and Artisans of the North of Ireland", Mitchel maintained that England did not care about any religion and plundered Protestants as well as Catholics. [...] "The Pope," [...] he wrote, [...] "we know is the 'Man of Sin', and the 'Antichrist', and also, if you like, the 'Mystery of Iniquity', and all that; but he brings no ejectments in Ireland. The Seven Sacraments are, to be sure, very dangerous, but the quarter-acre clause touches you more nearly. In short, our vicious system of Government, and especially the infamous land laws, are the machinery that <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> this pass." ...|$|E

60|$|King. So just, as if thou wert {{inspired}} to come; As if the guardian-angel of my throne, Who had o'erslept himself so many years, Just now was roused, and <b>brought</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> my rescue.|$|R

6000|$|... 'This {{must never}} be,' said Redgauntlet. 'Let me that <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{the point of}} danger, at least provide for your safe retreat.' ...|$|E
