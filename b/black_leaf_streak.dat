The 39. 7 -Mb genome of M. graminicola was sequenced completely and consists of 13 core chromosomes plus a dispensome of eight small chromosomes that differ from those in the core and probably originated by horizontal transfer from an unknown donor more than 10, 000 years ago.

50|$|Black sigatoka is a fungal {{leaf spot}} disease first {{observed}} in Fiji in 1963 or 1964. Black Sigatoka (also known as <b>black</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>streak)</b> {{has spread to}} banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars), impeding photosynthesis by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow ripen prematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment, with the current expense for treating 1 ha exceeding $1,000 per year. In addition to the expense, {{there is the question}} of how long intensive spraying can be environmentally justified. Several resistant cultivars of banana have been developed, but none has yet received commercial acceptance due to taste and texture issues.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola cause {{bacterial}} blight and bacterial <b>leaf</b> <b>streak</b> of rice (Oryza sativa), which constrain {{production of}} this staple crop {{in much of}} Asia and parts of Africa. Tremendous {{progress has been made}} in characterizing the diseases and breeding for resistance. X. oryzae pv. oryzae causes bacterial blight by invading the vascular tissue, while X. oryzae pv. oryzicola causes bacterial <b>leaf</b> <b>streak</b> by colonizing the parenchyma. In rice there are 29 major genes for resistance to bacterial blight, but so far only a few quantitative resistance loci for bacterial <b>leaf</b> <b>streak.</b> Over 30 races of X. oryzae pv. oryzae have been reported. Both pathogens exhibit genetic variation among isolates. Mechanisms of pathogenesis and resistance have begun to be elucidated. Members of the AvrBs 3 /PthA family of transcription activator-like effectors play a major role in the virulence of X. oryzae pv. oryzae and possibly X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. Cloning of six rice resistance genes for bacterial blight and one from maize effective against bacterial <b>leaf</b> <b>streak</b> has uncovered a diversity of structure and function, some shared by genes involved in defence in animals. This article reviews research that spans a century.

50|$|Like yellow sigatoka, black sigatoka, {{was first}} {{documented}} in the Sigatoka valley of Fiji. It was first recorded in 1964 and being more virulent tended to displace yellow sigatoka in banana crops. Therefore, yellow sigatoka is rarely found in locations where black sigatoka occurs. Black sigatoka infection appears on the leaves of crops during the unfurling. Sigatoka spores will incubate on the leaves {{for up to six}} days before penetrating the leaf. After this the infection will continue to colonize for a week before the plant exhibits symptoms. The initial symptoms are small spots on the undersides of the leaves. These appear 10-15 days after infection and grow until they appear as black streaks on the leaves. This is what gives black sigatoka its alternate name of <b>black</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>streak.</b> These streaks can dry out and collapse in less than a day. This affects growth and yield of bananas by reducing the total photosynthetic area of the leaf. However the largest effect on yields is through the toxins produced by black sigatoka that causes a premature ripening of the bananas. These prematurely ripened fruit cannot be sold and must be discarded.|$|E
