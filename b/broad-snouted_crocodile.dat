The TransAlta Rainforest occupies 2,900 square metres (31,000 square feet) and features a collection of African rainforest flora and fauna. The African Savannah building is home to hippos, giraffes, red river hogs, and a baobab tree. A 340,000-litre (80,000-gallon) indoor pool for hippos offers view of the creatures underwater. In the warmer months, the doors lift to connect the building {{with the rest of}} the Savannah exhibit, home to zebras, grey crowned cranes and ostriches. Many other animals of the grasslands, including African lions, also reside in the Savannah exhibit. In the TransAlta Rainforest, there are mammalian primates such as gorillas, guerezas, and mandrills, and a number of reptiles including Leopard tortoises, [...] Malagasy tree boas, a panther chameleon and a pair of <b>broad-snouted</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> as well as an aviary containing various species of African birds.|$|R
