5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings.

The broadcast coincided with the transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win.
