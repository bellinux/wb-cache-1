Here, kinetic studies of the interaction of bovine alpha 2 -antiplasmin with <b>bovine</b> <b>plasmin</b> were performed on isolated bovine midiplasmin (lacking kringles 1 - 3) and on <b>bovine</b> <b>plasmin</b> containing all of the activation products from the bovine plasminogen. A series of experiments using stopped-flow fluorescence fast kinetics as well as conventional techniques suggests a reaction model {{in accordance with the}} one known for the human system. First, a tight complex (K 1 in the nanomolar range) is formed in a fast reaction step; and second, a tightening of this complex occurs in a slow reaction step. The final complex is indeed so tight (Ki < or = pM), that the reaction for many practical purposes is legitimately considered irreversible. The stopped-flow method allows for the determination of reliable values of the second-order rate constant for the fast association step. At pH 7. 4 and 25 degrees C, k+ 1 = 1. 7 x 10 (6) M- 1 s- 1 was obtained in the absence and k+ 1 = 0. 9 x 10 (6) M- 1. s- 1 {{in the presence of the}} kringles 1 - 3 domain of <b>bovine</b> <b>plasmin.</b> In contrast to this, substantial reductions of k+ 1 were seen in the presence of concentrations of 6 -amino-hexanoic acid corresponding to lysine-binding-site interactions and far too low to be attributed to active-site interactions with the <b>bovine</b> <b>plasmins</b> (for each, Ki = 42 mM).

A total of 380 milk samples from nineteen Holstein (one herd) and nineteen Jersey (one herd) cows was collected monthly during one lactation period. Samples from each cow were analyzed for fat, protein, plasmin activity, plasminogen, pH, SCC, clotting time, curd firming rate, and final curd firmness. Three age groups form each breed/herd were chosen; first, third, and fourth and later lactations. Plasmin activity in milk was most affected by lactation number, with milk from fourth- and later-lactation cows having higher activity than milk from first- or third- lactation cows. Plasmin activity in milk increased during lactation but was not affected by breed/herd, pH, protein, or fat. Plasminogen averaged 5. 4 times the plasmin activity in milk and increased during {{the first five months}} of lactation. Plasmin {{activity was}} higher in milk collected ruing summer and fall but plasminogen was higher in milk collected during fall and winter. Percentage of the total (plasmin+plasminogen) enzyme activated to plasmin increased in late-lactation milk and in milk from fourth- and later-lactation cows. Plasmin activity did not affect any milk clotting parameters in this study. Increased protein in milk resulted in shorter clotting times. When statistically adjusted for protein content, clotting time was longer in milk from the Holstein herd compared to the Jersey herd. Curd firming rate was increased in milk with higher protein and fat. Milk samples collected in the fall had faster firming rates than milk from other seasons. Firming rates remained constant during lactation but increased with higher protein and fat content.

40|$|Plasminogen {{was found}} to be present in bovine milk by crossreactivity between rabbit {{antiserum}} to plasminogen and casein prepared from milk by acid precipitation. This result was further supported by recovery of intact 125 I-labeled plasminogen from rabbit milk after its intravenous injection. Freshly isolated whole bovine casein was observed to undergo slow autoproteolysis at 37 degrees C. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed gradual disappearance of major caseins accompanied by appearance and increase in intensity of numerous electrophoretic bands. This autoproteolysis was inhibited by low concentrations of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (0. 1 mM) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mM); catalytic amounts of urokinase accelerated the process. Autoproteolysis of isolated bovine beta-casein was shown by both urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to result in formation of gamma 1 - and gamma 2 -caseins.

Plasmins obtained by 'spontaneous' activation procedures in glycerol containing solutions, however, appeared not to be suitable. In this second group, the behaviour of the plasmins resembles that of 442 -Val-plasmin (miniplasmin), which is known to show a low inactivation rate with ?? 2 -antiplasmin due to the absence of lysine-binding in the plasmin molecule.

Several compounds such as EDTA, EGTA, citrate and iminodiacetic acid appear to have a separate effect. In the absence of calcium ions these compounds appear to make the ??-chain carboxy-terminal ends of the D and D-dimer fragments more susceptible to plasmin digestion.

All three enzymes initiated prorenin activation; 50 % activation was achieved with Hageman factor fragments at 1 microgram/ml, plasma kallikrein at 2 - 4 microgram/ml, or plasmin at 5 - 10 microgram/ml. We then showed that the alkaline phase of acid activation occurred normally in plasminogen-free plasma but was almost completely absent in plasmas deficient in either Hageman factor or prekallikrein; alkaline phase activation was restored to these latter plasmas when equal parts were mixed together. Therefore, both Hageman factor and prekallikrein were required for alkaline phase activation to occur. We then found that, although plasma kallikrein could activate prorenin in plasma deficient in either Hageman factor or prekallikrein, Hageman factor fragments were unable to activate prorenin in prekallikrein-deficient plasma. These studies demonstrate that alkaline phase prorenin activation is initiated by Hageman factor-dependent conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein which, in turn, leads to activation of prorenin.

A novel numerical procedure was applied for identification of kinetic parameters and their confidence intervals, with Monte Carlo simulation of the reaction progress curves, providing adequate grounds for discrimination of different models of the enzyme action. All three fatty acids caused a 10 – 20 -fold increase in the Michaelis constant on Spectrozyme-PL (baseline value 5. 9 μm). The catalytic constant decreased from 5. 8 ·s− 1 to 2. 4 – 2. 8 ·s− 1 in the presence of arachidonate and oleate, but increased to 14. 8 ·s− 1 in the presence of stearate, implying enhancement of plasmin activity at saturating substrate concentrations.

We have examined the in vivo effects of recombinant human TNF administration on fibrinolysis as assessed by parameters in plasma during a 24 -hour period of continuous TNF infusion to 17 cancer patients with active disease. The plasma levels of PAI activity increased sevenfold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion. This {{was the result of}} an increase of PAI- 1 antigen; PAI- 2 antigen was not detectable. Plasma concentrations of tissue-type PA (t-PA) antigen increased twofold to fivefold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion, whereas urokinase-type PA antigen levels in plasma remained unaltered. After 3 hours of TNF infusion the plasma levels of α 2 -antiplasmin were slightly decreased, 5 % on average, suggesting that fibrinolysis continued. After 24 hours of TNF infusion a highly significant increase in fibrin- plus fibrinogen-degradation products, and separately of fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen degradation products, was found. This indicates that fibrinolysis persisted, at least partly, in the presence of high levels of PAI activity. Whereas PAI- 1 production increased, t-PA production by human endothelial cells in vitro remains unaltered or even decreases on TNF addition. It has been shown previously that TNF infusion in our patients results in thrombin and fibrin generation. Therefore, it is possible that thrombin, not TNF, is the actual stimulus for t-PA production in our patients. We speculate that fibrin is formed during TNF infusions and that plasmin is generated by t-PA action immediately on the initial formation of (soluble) fibrin molecules.

40|$|In Italy {{buffalo milk}} is an {{important}} animal product utilized solely for the manufacture of Mozzarella cheese. Of an estimated population of 200000 buffalo there are ∼ 25000 controlled animals. The average milk production, expressed over 270 d lactation, is 2000 kg/head with average fat and protein contents of 82 · 6 and 46 · 4 g/l respectively (Associazione Italiana Allevatori, 1996). In recent {{years there has been}} a steady {{increase in the number of}} dairy buffalo replacing dairy cows as a consequence of the European Union quota system. The cheesemaking qualities of milk depend on many factors, the most important of which are the concentrations of intact casein and fat. Milk in which casein has been broken down by proteolytic enzymes is of less value to cheese manufacturers (Lucey & Kelly, 1994). <b>Plasmin</b> (<b>EC</b> 3. 4. 21. 7), the most important endogenous milk proteinase, occurs in milk together with its inactive proenzyme, plasminogen (Schaar & Funke, 1986). Plasmin hydrolyses αs-casein and β-casein, although κ-casein has been reported to be resistant (Fox, 1981). However, Andrews & Alichanidis (1983) found κ-casein to be hydrolysed quite rapidly by plasmin. Plasmin activity is higher in mastitic than normal milk (Bastian & Brown, 1996). Stage of lactation affects plasmin activity: late lactation is associated with higher concentrations of plasmin (Gilmore et al. 1995; Baldi et al. 1996). Thus, plasmin could be a major problem in herds with seasonal breeding such as buffalo, which progress through lactation in synchrony and are therefore at a similar stage of lactation at a given time. The cascade of reactions leading to plasminogen activation is regulated by a complex network of molecular interactions between plasminogen activators (PA; EC 3. 4. 21. 31) and at least three types of specific PA inhibitors (PAI- 1; PAI- 2; PAI- 3; Saksela, 1985; Politis, 1996). There are two types of highly specific PA: tissue-PA (t-PA) and urokinase-PA (u-PA) (Saksela & Rifkin, 1988). PA activity is higher in mastitic than normal milk (Heegaard et al. 1994 a). However, previous studies on PA in milk were carried out on bovine and caprine milk. No information is available on the presence and type of PA in buffalo milk. Thus the objective of the present study was to determine the level and type of PA in different fractions of buffalo milk: casein, serum, and somatic cells...|$|R
40|$|Tsetse flies are blood-sucking insects. The {{ability to}} keep their blood meal in an anticoagulated state by means of anticoagulant(s), fibrinogenuse(s), fibrinolysin(s) or {{plasminogen}} activator like activities is essential to their survival. In this investigation tsetse midgut fibrinolytic activities have been characterised. Five proteases that hydrolyse Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pnitroanilide (chromozym-TH) at different rates, were identified in tsetse midgut extracts and four of them purified to apparent homogeneity using anion-exchange chromatography on DE- 52 cellulose followed by isoe 1 ectric focusing. Assays using radio-labelled fibrinogen and fibrin were developed. These showed {{that two of the}} proteases with highest fibrinogenolytic activity (P 3 and P 4) had exo- and endopeptidase- like activities respectively. The two enzymes had pIs of 6. 0 and 5. 3 on isoelectric focusing and Mr of 26 and 24. 5 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) denaturing gels, respectively. They appeared electrophoretica 1 ly homogeneous as judged by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE). The two enzymes seem to digest fibrinogen and fibrin at different sites but within the same domains as does <b>bovine</b> <b>plasmin,</b> a classical fibrinolysin. Tsetse fibrinolysin P 3 initially generates very low molecular mass products (range 14 - 20 kDa), but after extended incubation times it starts generating a br. eakdown product of apparent ftlr 94 kDa. Fibrinolysin P 4 also produced the 94 kDa fragment and another fragment of 42 kDa, as well as larger intermediate breakdown products of approximate Mr 160 and 240 kDa. The two tsetse fibrinolysins have a pH optimum around 8. 0. Inhibition studies showed that these two tsetse fibrinolysins were serine proteases since diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) completely abolished their hydrolytic activity towards Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA. These enzymes had trypsin-like specificity since TLCK, a chloromethyl ketone inhibitor with trypsin-like enzyme-specificity, inhibited 75 % of their activity towards this tripeptide substrate. This compared with only 25 % inhibition of these enzymes by TPCK, an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases. Their trypsin-like specificity was also suggested by trypsin specific chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrates, which these enzymes hydrolysed rapidly, and additionally by the inhibition of the enzymes by aprotinin. A thermolability study showed a biphasic curve with gradual loss of activity upto 500 C after which there was a precipitious loss of activity with further increase in temperature. An antibody against fibrinolysin p 4 was raised in rabbits. This antibody reacted with~fibrinolysins P 3 and P 4 thus suggesting that the two share some common antigenic determinants. Fab fragments made from the purified immune IgG did not inhibit in vitro hydrolysis of the Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-PNA thus suggesting that these antibodies we~e not directed to the active sites of the enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a novel Kunitz {{inhibitor}} of trypsin-like enzymes {{has been}} discovered in bovine platelets that has {{a higher degree of}} association for plasmin than trypsin, and thereby has been termed <b>bovine</b> platelet <b>plasmin</b> inhibitor (BPPI). Basic problems in the purification, resulting in protein that was essentially insoluble, has hampered structural determinations by x-ray or NMR analysis. An investigation into the cause of the protein insolubility has revealed that an excessively high concentration of acetonitrile, used to elute the protein from a C 18 reversed-phase cartridge, was most probably the cause of the insolubility. Concentrated BPPI solutions permitted the preparation of a suitable sample for structural determination by NMR, and preliminary 1 H-NOESY and 1 H-TOCSY spectra have been obtained. However, given the high degree of sequence homology with a bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), a protein whose three-dimensional structure has been extensively characterized, a structural determination of BPPI has been performed using molecular modelling. Circular dichroism studies have indicated that the secondary structural elements in BPPI {{are similar to those of}} BPPI and are accurately predicted in the model. A search for a similar protein in human platelets has resulted in the discovery of a 12, 000 Da (by SDS-PAGE) protein that also inhibits trypsin and plasmin and has preliminarily been termed human platelet plasmin inhibitor (HPPI).

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>plasmin</b> is a {{proteolytic}} enzyme that is naturally present in milk. Plasmin {{can have a}} detrimental impact on product quality including proteolysis, age-gelation and bitterness. The activity of plasmin is difficult to control as its precursor, plasminogen, and its activators can survive severe heat treatments such as ultra-high-temperature processing. The aim of this work was to understand and control the plasmin-induced hydrolysis of caseins in milk systems. A sequential approach was used. In the first stage, the effect of substrate modification on plasmin-induced hydrolysis in a pure ß-casein model system was studied; this allowed us to propose a control mechanism to limit {{the availability of the}} substrate by protein modification. In the second stage, different protein modifications were applied to a real milk system. In the analysis of this system, the casein micelle structure, whey protein denaturation and whey protein association with the casein micelle were considered. The final stage investigated plasmin-induced dissociation of casein micelles in real milk systems to understand the effect of plasmin activity on gelation and sedimentation in heat-treated milks. Modification of lysine residues on the protein decreased plasmin-induced hydrolysis. Lactosylation had a greater effect than succinylation and transglutamination at the same level of lysine modification. A mechanism for this phenomenon was proposed. Lactosylation involves the attachment of lactose and, in advanced stages, cross-linking, thus modifying lysine and making it unrecognisable to plasmin; in addition, the cross-linking may affect the release of plasmin-generated peptides. Transglutamination also modifies lysine by cross-linking and has a similar effect to lactosylation, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, succinylation modifies the charge associated with lysine, making it unrecognisable to plasmin. Collectively, this knowledge {{can be used to make}} protein resistant to plasmin activity. The combined effect of micellar structure and protein modification on plasmin activity was also studied. Calcium chelation and dissociation of the casein micelle increased plasmin activity because of reduced steric hindrance, which made the protein more readily available to plasmin. In contrast, succinylation decreased plasmin activity, which could be attributed to the formation of succinyl-lysine rendering ß-casein unrecognisable to the substrate-binding pocket of plasmin, resulting in a decrease in hydrolysis with an increase in modification. These results indicated the importance of the casein micelle structure as a tool for controlling the activity of plasmin on milk proteins in food systems. The effect of high heat treatment on plasmin-induced hydrolysis was also investigated. A high-heat-treated skim milk (120 °C/ 15 min) was found to have greater resistance to plasmin activity than non-heated skim milk. Both whey protein association with the casein micelles and lactosylation decreased the availability of protein to plasmin. Whey-protein-free milk was the most plasmin resistant, followed by skim milk and lactose-free milk. Collectively, these results suggest that lactosylation plays a more significant role than whey protein association with the casein micelles in making protein resistant to plasmin activity. The plasmin-induced dissociation of the casein micelle was explored by identifying peptide release from the micelle. Upon plasmin-induced hydrolysis of the casein micelle, hydrophilic peptides, i. e. proteose peptones, were the first to dissociate from the casein micelle, followed by hydrophobic peptides, which had dissociation patterns that were identical to those of ?-casein. This suggests that the release of ?-casein from the micelle is too slow to cause gelation. Extensive plasmin-induced hydrolysis of the casein micelle leads to sedimentation in heat-treated milk because of the formation of ß-lactoglobulin–?-casein complexes and their aggregation with hydrolysed hydrophobic peptides. Overall, the results of the present study showed that casein modification can be useful in controlling plasmin activity and has developed our understanding of the plasmin-induced dissociation of casein micelles. Further research work is needed to understand the mechanism of plasmin’s selective hydrolysis pattern and the structural aspects of the substrate-binding pocket of plasmin. Studies on casein micelle dissociation separately and in conjunction with physicochemical changes during storage could be useful in further understanding the phenomenon of age gelation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTissue {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) is an extracellular {{serine protease}} that converts the proenzyme plasminogen into the broad-spectrum substrate serine protease, plasmin. Plasmin, {{one of the}} most potent pro-angiogenic factors, is a key element in fibrinolysis, cell migration, tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. In the present investigation, we assessed the impact of the truncated form of soluble melanotransferrin (sMTf) on plasminogen activation by t-PA and subsequent endothelial cell detachment. Co-treatment of human endothelial microvessel cells with plasminogen, t-PA and sMTf significantly increased plasmin formation and activity in the culture medium. Plasmin generated in the presence of sMTf also led to a 30 % reduction in fibronectin detection within cell lysates and to a 9 -fold increase within the corresponding cell medium. Moreover, the presence of sMTf increases EC detachment by 6 -fold compared to cells treated only with plasminogen and t-PA. Although the addition of α 2 -antiplasmin completely prevented <b>plasmin</b> formation and <b>EC</b> detachment, epigallocatechin gallate, GM 6001 and a specific antibody directed against MMP- 2 prevented cellular detachment without interfering with plasminogen activation. Overall, these data suggest that the anti-angiogenic properties of sMTf may result from local overstimulation of plasminogen activation by t-PA, thus leading to subsequent degradation of the Fn matrix and EC detachment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> {{platelet}} <b>plasmin</b> inhibitor (BPPI) {{is a novel}} Kunitz inhibitor, {{recently discovered}} in platelets (Li, 1992) for which an expression system is sought. Because the protein 2 ̆ 7 s origin of synthesis was unknown, {{a search for a}} genomic clone was undertaken. PCR was used in an attempt to amplify the BPPI gene from lymphocyte, bovine genomic DNA. The first set of primers used was designed according to the N and C termini of the amino acid sequence of BPPI (P 1 /P 2). These were based on a degenerate nucleotide sequence derived from its amino acid sequence. Amplification with this set of primers was unsuccessful. The second approach in amplifying the gene was to increase the specificity of the primers in the 32 ̆ 7 end (P 3 /P 4) using a table of codon usage of the bovine genome. Two successive amplifications {{led to the formation of}} a 230 bp fragment. The sequence of this product was not comparable to the degenerate sequence of BPPI. A third set of primers (P 6 /P 7) was designed according to the gene sequence of SI (II). An inferred amino acid sequence from the SI (II) gene, outside of the region encoding the mature protein shared almost identical homology with the amino acid sequence of BPPI, hence its use as a template in the design of primers. The use of P 6 /P 7 for amplification, resulted in the formation of two products. One was sized at 450 bp and the other at 172 bp. Sequencing of these genes indicated no similarities with the BPPI or SI (II) genes. Amplification of the BPPI gene from genomic DNA was unsuccessful using these particular primers. Future work could involve the construction of a cDNA library from a suitable source such as megakaryocytes.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of plasminogen activation catalysed by urokinase and {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} were investigated. Kinetic {{measurements are}} performed {{by means of a}} specific chromogenic peptide substrate for plasmin, D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysine 4 -nitroanilide. Two methods are proposed for the analysis of the resulting progress curve of nitroaniline formation in terms of zymogen-activation kinetics: a graphical transformation of the parabolic curve and transformation of the curve for nitroaniline production into a linear progress curve by the addition of a specific inhibitor of <b>plasmin,</b> <b>bovine</b> pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The two methods give similar results, suggesting that the reaction between activator and plasminogen is a simple second-order reaction at least at plasminogen concentrations up to about 10 microM. The kinetics of both Glu 1 -plasminogen (residues 1 - 790) and Lys 77 -plasminogen (residues 77 - 790) activation were investigated. The results confirm previous observations showing that trans- 4 -(aminomethyl) cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylic acid at relatively low concentrations enhances the activation rate of Glu 1 -plasminogen but not that of Lys 77 -plasminogen. At higher concentrations both Glu 1 - and Lys 77 -plasminogen activation are inhibited. The concentration interval for the inhibition of urokinase-catalysed reactions is shown to be very {{different from that of the}} tissue-plasminogen activator system. Evidence is presented indicating that binding to the active site of urokinase (KD = 2. 0 mM) is responsible for the inhibition of the urokinase system, binding to the active site of tissue-plasminogen activator is approx. 100 -fold weaker, and inhibition of the tissue-plasminogen activator system, when monitored by plasmin activity, is mainly due to plasmin inhibition. Poly-D-lysine (Mr 160 000) causes a marked enhancement of plasminogen activation catalysed by tissue-plasminogen activator but not by urokinase. Bell-shaped curves of enhancement as a function of the logarithm of poly-D-lysine concentration are obtained for both Glu 1 - and Lys 77 -plasminogen activation, with a maximal effect at about 10 mg/litre. The enhancement of Glu 1 -plasminogen activation exerted by trans- 4 -(aminomethyl) cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylic acid is additive to that of poly-D-lysine, whereas poly-D-lysine-induced enhancement of Lys 77 -plasminogen activation is abolished by trans- 4 -(aminomethyl) cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylic acid. Analogies are drawn up between the effector functions of poly-D-lysine and fibrin on the catalytic activity of tissue-plasminogen activator...|$|R
