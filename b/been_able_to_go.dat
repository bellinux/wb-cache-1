25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early on a Saturday morning, with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> live immediately.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show. Springsteen said, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for {{making it possible for}} Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out in the audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E

500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out in the audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years that somebody else sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E

2500|$|In 814 King Egbert of Wessex ravaged Cornwall [...] "from {{the east}} to the west", and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 825 the Cornish fought the men of Devon. In 838 the Cornish in {{alliance}} with Vikings were defeated by the West Saxons at the Battle of Hingston Down. This was the last recorded battle between Cornwall and Wessex, and possibly resulted {{in the loss of}} Cornish independence. In 875, the Annales Cambriae record that king Dungarth of Cornwall drowned, yet Alfred the Great had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> hunting in Cornwall a decade earlier suggesting Dungarth was likely an under-king. Kenstec (c.833-c.870) became the first bishop of Cornwall to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in the same period the bishop of Sherborne was instructed to visit Cornwall annually to root out the errors of the Cornish church, further indications that Cornwall was becoming subject to Wessex {{in the middle of the}} ninth century. In the 880s Alfred the Great was able to leave estates in Cornwall in his will.|$|E

2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Beck {{while he was}} visiting Stephenson's home. Although the song was created spontaneously, Beck has claimed {{to have had the}} idea for the song since the late 1980s; he once said, [...] "I don't think I would have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in and do 'Loser' in a six-hour shot without having been somewhat prepared. It was accidental, but it was something that I'd been working toward for a long time." [...] Beck played some of his songs for Stephenson; Stephenson enjoyed the songs, but was unimpressed by Beck's rapping. Stephenson recorded a brief guitar part from one of Beck's songs onto an 8-track, looped it, and added a drum track to it. Stephenson then added his own sitar playing and other samples. At that point, Beck began writing and improvising lyrics for the recording. For the song's vocals, Beck attempted to emulate the rapping style of Public Enemy's Chuck D. According to Beck, the line that became the song's chorus originated because [...] "When [...] played it back, I thought, 'Man, I'm the worst rapper in the world, I'm just a loser.' So I started singing 'I'm a [...] baby, so why don't you kill me.'" [...] According to Rothrock, the song was largely finished in six and a half hours, with two minor overdubs several months later.|$|E
