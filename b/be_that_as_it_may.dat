5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. <b>Be</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>may,</b> there is no hard evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Knútr took other actions to contain Orkney. Evidence that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of the Isles may be preserved by the twelfth-century Ágrip af Nóregskonungasǫgum. The historicity of this event is uncertain, however, and Hákon's authority in the Isles is not attested by any other source. <b>Be</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>may,</b> this twelfth-century text states that Hákon had been sent into the Isles by Óláfr, and that Hákon ruled the region {{for the rest of}} his life. The chronology outlined by this source suggests that Hákon left Norway at about the time Óláfr assumed the kingship in 1016. The former is certainly known to have been in Knútr's service soon afterwards in England. One possibility is that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of Orkney and the Isles in about 1016/1017, before handing him possession of the Earldom of Worcester in about 1017. If this was the case, Hákon would have been responsible for not only a strategic part of the Anglo-Welsh frontier, but also accountable for the far-reaching sea-lanes that stretched from the Irish Sea region to Norway. It seems likely that Knútr was more concerned about Orkney and the Isles, and the security of the sea-lanes around Scotland, than surviving sources let on. Hákon's death at sea would have certainly been a cause of concern for Knútr's regime, and could have been directly responsible to the meeting between him and the three kings. If Hákon had indeed possessed overlordship of the Isles, his demise could well have paved the way for Echmarcach's own rise to power. Having come to terms with the three kings, it {{is possible}} that Knútr relied upon Echmarcach to counter the ambitions of the Orcadians, who could have attempted to seize upon Hákon's fall and renew their influence in the Isles.|$|E

In the paper, an approach, {{based on}} bounded-error {{estimation}} via interval analysis, {{is presented to}} identify viscous damping coefficient and Coulomb friction coefficient of such-rod pumping system of directional well. The approach assumes the error of colleted output data of suck-rod pumping system is bounded. Hence, the problem of parameter estimation can <b>be</b> viewed <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of set inversion, which will be effectively solved via interval analysis. The main advantage of the proposed method {{in comparison with the}} traditional estimation methods <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> global, it bypasses the problem of initialization. Moreover, the method avoids amount error due to transformation of measurement output data. An identification example is given to show the correctness and efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|Having {{failed to}} secure {{substantial}} support in England and Scotland, Guðrøðr {{appears to have}} turned to Ingi, his nominal Norwegian overlord. In late 1160 or early 1161, Guðrøðr distinguished himself in the ongoing {{civil war in the}} Norwegian realm, as evidenced by Hákonar saga herðibreiðs within the thirteenth-century saga-compilation Heimskringla. The fact that the Icelandic Annals allege that Guðrøðr assumed the kingship of the Isles in 1160 could be evidence that, whilst in Norway, Ingi formally recognised Guðrøðr as king in a public ceremony. There is reason to suspect that Guðrøðr's support of Ingi may have been undertaken in the context of fulfilling military obligations as a vassal. <b>Be</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>may,</b> Hákonar saga herðibreiðs reveals that Guðrøðr played an important part in Ingi's final downfall in battle at Oslo in 1161. Up until 1155, Ingi had shared the kingship with his brothers Sigurðr (died 1155) and Eysteinn (died 1157). With both of these brothers dead by 1157, Ingi was forced to contend with Hákon Sigurðarson (died 1162), who had been elected to the kingship within the year. In regard to Guðrøðr himself, the saga relates that during this final battle against Hákon, Guðrøðr, at the head of fifteen-hundred men, went over to Hákon's side. Guðrøðr's decision to abandon his embattled overlord tipped the scales in favour of Hákon, and directly contributed to Ingi's defeat and death. The young Magnús Erlingsson (died 1184) was elected king after Ingi's death, and following the fall of Hákon, was crowned king in 1163/1164. It is likely that Guðrøðr was present at Magnús Erlingsson's coronation, and possible that Guðrøðr rendered homage to him as well.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{earliest}} greedy iterative algorithm is orthogonal matching pursuits (OMP). It {{is one of the}} main stepping stones on which the other greedy algorithm is based on. The basic working of an OMP algorithm revolves under the conditions of a given iteration number. Since it is an iterative process, it is required to stop after certain iterations. To make accurate estimation of the original signal, OMP requires a lot of measurement data. One of the drawbacks of the OMP <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> requires a large number of measurement data to estimate the signal, any increase in the degree of sparse or the number of samples would increase the time it takes to obtain the results.

25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty.

Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|R

30|$|The {{counterpart}} to the mortgages and loans in the banks balance sheets {{are of course}} the liabilities of households and firms. There are important welfare consequences associated with household debt; in particular, low income households may face severe pressure to meet commitments in an environment with high unemployment and low income growth. In the case of firms, debt overhang may have important negative consequences for investment and thus employment creation. Bankruptcy is of course an important deleveraging mechanism. The paper by García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti (2014) {{is concerned with the}} efficiency of Spain’s bankruptcy law. Their starting observation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> businesses in Spain rarely file for bankruptcy. The reason <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well known, the size distribution of firms in Spain is biased towards smaller ones, which have very low filing rates when compared to larger firms. The reason, these authors argue, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Spain’s bankruptcy code entails significant fixed costs, for both firms and creditors, which of course hurt smaller firms proportionally more. García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti (2014) show that Spanish small firms react to these larger costs by raising finance through mortgage loans, which in case of adverse business performance leads to foreclosure and asset repossession.|$|R
