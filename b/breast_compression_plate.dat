40|$|Background: <b>Breast</b> <b>compression</b> is {{important}} in mammography {{in order to improve}} image quality, better separate tissue components, and reduce absorbed dose to the breast. In this study we use a method to measure and visualize the distribution of pressure over a compressed breast in mammography. Purpose: To measure and describe the pressure distribution over the breast as a result of applied <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> in mammography. Material and Methods: One hundred and three women aged 40. 7 - 74. 3 years (median, 48. 9 years) invited for mammographic screening consented to take part in this study. They were subjected to two additional <b>breast</b> <b>compressions</b> of the left breast (standard force and approximately 50 % reduction). Pressure images of the compressed breast were obtained using force sensing resistor (FSR) sensors placed underneath the <b>compression</b> <b>plate.</b> Subjects rated their experience of pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: Four pressure patterns were identified, fitting 81 of the 103 breasts, which were grouped accordingly. The remaining 22 breasts were found to correspond to a combination of any two patterns. Two groups (43 breasts) showed pressure mainly over the juxtathoracic part of the breast, had significantly greater breast thickness (P = 0. 003) and had a lower mean pressure over dense tissue (P < 0. 0001) than those with more evenly distributed pressure. Reducing compression force increased average breast thickness by 1. 8 mm (P < 0. 0001). Conclusion: The distribution of pressure differed greatly between breasts. In a large proportion of <b>breasts</b> the <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> did not provide optimal <b>compression</b> of the <b>breast,</b> the <b>compression</b> force being absorbed in juxtathoracic structures...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} possible {{associations between}} <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> parameters, including compression force, pressure and compressed breast thickness, and mammographic density assessed by an automated software.

50|$|A dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (DCP) is a {{metallic}} plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a tension device to a plate or by using a special dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate.</b> However, <b>compression</b> <b>plating</b> requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the tension device and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|R

Despite higher nonunion rates in initial open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), understanding the problem better and taking in accounts of previous shortcomings, such fractures can be optimally treated by ORIF with locking <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (LCP). This study aims at investigating {{the outcome of}} middle third clavicle fracture treated with locking <b>compression</b> <b>plating</b> in terms of function using constant score union time, complications, and patient satisfaction. Study includes 98 patients with displaced middle third clavicle fracture treated with ORIF with locking <b>compression</b> <b>plate,</b> which had follow-up for at least 1 year.

40|$|The diaphyseal tibia {{fracture}} is best {{treated with}} intramedullary nail {{but in some}} cases where the nail is not applicable, plate fixation will be the next option of fixation. The extensile anterior approach is normally used for conventional <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> fixation in tibia shaft fractures. The extensive surgical dissection may devitalizes the bony fragments and interfere with the fracture union as well as soft tissue healing. Minimally Invasive Plate Osteosynthesis (MIPO) provides good preservation of blood supply and fracture hematoma at the fracture site thus promotes biological bone healing. The use of indirect reduction techniques and small skin incisions to introduce the plate is technically demanding and requires fluoroscopy exposures throughout the surgery, being some of its drawbacks.

40|$|With many {{important}} developments {{over the last}} century, nowadays orthopedic bone plate now excels over other types of internal fixators in bone fracture fixation. The developments involve the design, material and implementation techniques of the plates. This paper aims to review the evolution in implementation technique and biomaterial of the orthopedic bone plates. Plates were initially used to fix the underlying bones firmly. Accordingly, <b>Compression</b> <b>plate</b> (CP), Dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (DCP), Limited contact dynamic <b>compression</b> <b>plate</b> (LC-DCP) and Point contact fixator (PC-Fix) were developed. Later, the implementation approach was changed to locking, and the Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) plate was introduced as a result. Finally, {{a combination of both}} of these approaches has been used by introducing the Locking <b>Compression</b> <b>Plate</b> (LCP). Currently, precontoured LCPs are mainly used for bone fracture fixation. In parallel with structure and implementation techniques, numerous advances have occurred in biomaterials of the plates. Titanium and stainless steel alloys are now the most common biomaterials in production of orthopedic bone plates. However, regarding the biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradability characteristics of Mg alloys, Ta alloys, SMAs, carbon fiber composites and bioceramics, these materials are considered as potentially suitable for plates. However, due to poor mechanical properties, they have very limited applications. Therefore, further studies are required in future to solve these problems and make them feasible for heavy-duty bone plates...|$|R

Methods: An institutional review board-approved, prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was conducted at a level-I trauma center between July 2004 and September 2007. All patients who met the study criteria and provided informed consent were randomized to treatment with a sliding hip screw or percutaneous <b>compression</b> <b>plate.</b> Of the sixty-six patients who consented to participate, thirty-three were randomized to be treated with a sliding hip screw and thirty-three, with a percutaneous <b>compression</b> <b>plate.</b> Data evaluated included surgical time, incision length, blood loss, need for blood transfusion, and postoperative functional status.

Methods and Materials: The standard projections were simulated [craniocaudal/(CC) and mediolateral-oblique/(MLO) ] with the two <b>breast</b> <b>compressions</b> in 90 volunteers women aged between 19 and 86. The women were organised in groups according to the breast density. The intensity of discomfort was evaluated using the scale that have represented several faces (0 - 10) proposed by Wong Baker {{in the end of}} each simulation. It was also applied an interview using focus group to debate the score that were attributed during pain evaluation and to identify the criteria that were considered to do the classification. Results: The women aged between 19 - 29 y (with higher breast density) classified the pain during no gradual compression as 4 and the gradual compression as 2 for both projections. The MLO projection was considered the most uncomfortable. During the focus group interview applied to this group was highlighted that compression did not promoted pain but discomfort. They considered that the high expectations of pain did not correspond to the discomfort that they felt. Similar results were identified for the older women (30 - 50 y; > 50 y).
