40|$|Abstract: In Australia, {{as well as}} {{many other}} countries, post {{consumer}} recycling is used in an attempt to combat excessive waste and conserve resources. Much of the success of such recycling programs depends on the everyday consumer sorting their wastes and deciding whether to send a used packaging item to landfill, a recycling facility, or to a composting facility (when available). With the increasing complexity of common packaging systems, the task of identifying recyclable materials and determining how they should be sorted for recovery has become progressively more complicated for individuals. While there is a range of methods used to communicate necessary information to consumers, targeted labelling is a viable option that can successfully specify what action consumers need to take to ensure the packaging component ends up in the correct recovery stream. By means of surveys and face-to-face interviews with consumers from three demographically different areas, this paper examines the extent to which consumers understand recycling information on packaging labels and the actions that result from this understanding. The research shows that consumers ’ understanding of common household packaging, materials, and labelling is often very poor. Many people have the best of intentions, but their sorting behaviour is often incorrect, sending recyclable materials to be <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>landfill</b> and unrecyclable items to recycling facilities, adding unnecessary costs to both systems. The confusion surrounding current labelling and recycling schemes can be attributed to incorrect labelling and system complexity combined with a lack of consumer understanding and care...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{domestic}} solid wastes <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>landfill</b> sites is {{viewed from the}} aspect of leachate contamination and migration in the substrate. Generally, this occurs through the penetration of the contaminant into the liner material. This study assesses the efficiency of natural clay barriers as an expedient economic lining material. Various chemical constituents of the landfill leachate of an actual waste containment site at Lachenaie (35 km east of Montreal) were determined from samples collected from specially designed basins. In companion laboratory tests, these leachate samples were permeated through laboratory columns that contained the natural clay compacted at the optimum water content. The columns were constructed so as to permit simulation of slow, saturated, anaerobic flow of leachate through the clay lining surrounding the landfill and leachate basins. Leachates were permeated through the soil columns for periods of four to five months, during which effluents were collected periodically and analyzed for different chemical species and physical parameters. These chemical analyses measured changes in the concentration of: (a) cations (Na, K, Ca, and Mg), (b) anions (Cl, HCO$ sb 3 $, and CO$ sb 3 $), (c) total organic carbon (TOC), and (d) heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cu). The physical parameters measured included: (a) pH, and (b) specific conductivity. Subsequent to the leaching tests, the column contents were cut into six sections and analyzed to determine the distribution profiles of the adsorbed and retained contaminants at various time durations. Predictions, using a dispersion-convection model for concentration profile development for either adsorbed or retained contaminants, were compared with the experimentally determined profiles (both in leaching columns and landfill laboratory model). Another set of experiments was also conducted to evaluate the effect of some organic fluids on the geotechnical properties of different clay soils (natural clay and two reference clay soils: illite and kaolinite). The {{results from this study}} have demonstrated that the natural clay soil can be used to adequately contain the different contaminant species usually present in the leachate solutions. Furthermore, the data suggested that under favourable soil conditions, landfill leachates containing low levels of trace metals will not pose a substantial contamination threat to the subsurface environment, provided that a proper thickness of barrier is used.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of agricultural soils in the tropical regions of the Pacific is the low organic matter content. Because of the hot and humid environment, the soil organic matter (SOM) is minimal due to rapid decomposition. Composted organic material is being applied on agricultural fields as an amendment to provide nutrients and enhance the organic matter content for improving the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the cultivated soils. In addition land application of composted material as a fertilizer source effectively disposes of wastes that otherwise are <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>landfills.</b> <b>In</b> our soil program at the University of Guam, we are evaluating the use of organic material as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers. Its goal is to develop management strategies and use available resources for improving crop production while conserving resources and preserving environmental quality. Our case study project is designed to improve soil fertility status by using composted organic wastes and assessing how the nitrogen and other essential nutrients contribute to long-term soil fertility and crop productivity without application of synthetic fertilizers. In our pilot project, compost is produced from wood chips, grinded typhoon debris mixed with animal manure, fish feed, shredded paper and other organic wastes. Mature compost is then applied on the field at the rates of 0, 5, 10 and 20 t/ha as a soil amendment on the eroded cobbly soils of southern Guam. Corn is planted and monitored for growth performance and yield. The effect of land application of composted material on th...|$|R

The highly concentrated sludge with heavy metals is either incinerated or <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>landfills.</b> Heavy metals were analyzed and com-pared in treated sewage effluent (TSE), slurry sludge, dried sludge, landfill and underground wa-ter. Heavy metal concentrations were analyzed using the inductive coupled plasma optical emis-sion spectrometer (ICP-OES). All samples contained the same heavy metals with different concen-trations. The heaviest concentrations were Zn, Cr, Cu and Ni with traces of V, Cd, Pb and Ba. TSE and sludge were the main sources of landfill and underground water contamination. Due to water evaporation, heavy metals concentrations in sludge were higher compared to TSE and under-ground water. Dried sludge and landfill contained higher concentrations than the others.

The story here derives from many visits to Wearable Collections, a business that collects apparel (as well as towels, sheets, shoes, and other textiles) with an “inlet ” at the popular Union Square Green-market in Manhattan. Over several months, I watched hundreds of individuals drop off thousands of kilos of materials for recycling and talked with many of them about what they were doing and why they were doing it. This investigation was undertaken for two purposes. On one hand, it was a device for practicing a variety of ethnographic field methods to support my current Ph.

The pages that follow have been excerpted from a longer and broader account. The term textile recycling is used here broadly. It encompasses upcycling (for example, making a dress from old dresses, or producing yarn from trimmings from garment manufacturing); downcycling (such as shredding worn out textiles for insulation); practices such as selling, swapping, or giving away; and any other ways of reusing or repurposing that saves — or at least delays — textiles from being <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>landfills</b> or otherwise wasted...|$|R
