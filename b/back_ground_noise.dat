A transistor level approach is presented to illustrate {{the effects of the}} substrate on <b>ground</b> <b>noise.</b> The substrate can {{have a significant effect on}} <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> due to the inductance of the ground lines. For a CMOS inverter, the substrate can reduce negative peak <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> by 49 % during the high-to-low output transition.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to outline an approach for the quantification of uncertainty in sonic boom measurements and to investigate the effect of various near-field uncertainty representation approaches on <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> predictions. These approaches included a symmetric versus asymmetric uncertainty band representation and a dispersion technique based on a partial sum Fourier series that allows for the inclusion of random error sources in the uncertainty. The near-field uncertainty was propagated to the ground level, along with additional uncertainty in the propagation modeling. Estimates of perceived loudness were obtained for the various types of uncertainty representation in the near-field. Analyses were performed on three configurations of interest to the sonic boom community: the SEEB-ALR, the 69 o DeltaWing, and the LM 1021 - 01. Results showed that representation of the near-field uncertainty plays a key role in <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> predictions.

A study was performed at different Signal to Noise ratio by changing the number of Zernike orders used for reconstruction.

The EMG signals are usually corrupted by artifacts that hide useful information then the extraction of high-resolution EMG signals from recordings contaminated with <b>back</b> <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> becomes an important problem. The Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is used for overcoming the noise problem. Due to the non-stationary of EMG signals, the analysis of this signal with the timefrequency techniques is inevitable.

The different timefrequency techniques used in this work are parametric techniques such as Periodogram, Capon and Lagunas and non-parametric such as Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville and Hilbert Spectrum. These time-frequency techniques were applied to a normal and abnormal EMG signals, these signals were taken from patients with neuropathy and myopathy pathologies respectively.

40|$|Air-borne {{acoustic}} based {{condition monitoring}} is a promising technique {{because of its}} intrusive nature and the rich information contained within the acoustic signals including all sources. However, the <b>back</b> <b>ground</b> <b>noise</b> contamination, interferences {{and the number of}} Internal Combustion Engine ICE vibro-acoustic sources preclude the extraction of condition information using this technique. Therefore, lower energy events; such as fuel injection, are buried within higher energy events and/or corrupted by background noise. This work firstly investigates diesel engine air-borne acoustic signals characteristics and the benefits of joint time-frequency domain analysis. Secondly, the air-borne acoustic signals in the vicinity of injector head were recorded using three microphones around the fuel injector (120 ° apart from each other) and an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based scheme was developed to decompose these acoustic signals. The fuel injection process characteristics were thus revealed in the time-frequency domain using Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) technique. Consequently the energy levels around the injection process period between 11 and 5 degrees before the top dead center and of frequency band 9 to 15 kHz are calculated. The developed technique was validated by simulated signals and empirical measurements at different injection pressure levels from 250 to 210 bars in steps of 10 bars. The recovered energy levels in the tested conditions were found to be affected by the injector pressure settings...|$|E

Thanks to high position resolution, Nuclear emulsion has mrad angular resolution. In addition, the features which require no power supply and can observe in a large area suitable for muon radiography. In Nagoya University, we launched emulsion manufacturing equipment at 2010. It has become possible to flexible development of our detector and succeeded to development of high sensitive nuclear emulsion film (Nagoya emulsion).
