5|$|Limestone is {{the most}} {{important}} mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement; shale is extracted for cement at Hope, and several gritstone quarries are worked for <b>building</b> <b>stone.</b> Lead mining is no longer economic, but fluorite, baryte and calcite are extracted from lead veins, and small-scale Blue John mining occurs at Castleton.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous {{limestone}} uplands in Britain. They are composed of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for <b>building</b> <b>stone</b> and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. Sand, gravel and peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{in places}} such as the East African coast are used as a source of {{building}} material. Ancient (fossil) coral limestone, notably including the Coral Rag Formation of the hills around Oxford (England), was once used as a <b>building</b> <b>stone,</b> and can be seen in some of the oldest buildings in that city including the Saxon tower of St Michael at the Northgate, St. George's Tower of Oxford Castle, and the mediaeval walls of the city.|$|E
40|$|The <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> {{of ancient}} Egypt are those {{relatively}} soft, plentiful rocks {{used to construct}} most temples, pyramids, and mastaba tombs. They were also employed for the interior passages, burialchambers, and outer casings of mud-brick pyramids and mastabas. Similarly, <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> were used in other mud-brick structures of ancient Egypt wherever extra strength was needed, such as bases for wood pillars, and lintels, thresholds, and jambs for doors. Limestone and sandstone were the principal <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> employed by the Egyptians, while anhydrite and gypsum were also used along the Red Sea coast. A total of 128 ancient quarries for <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> are known (89 for limestone, 36 for sandstone, and three for gypsum), but there are probably many others still undiscovered or destroyed by modern quarrying...|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> have been petrographically and geochemically characterised {{at the city}} of Sagalassos (SW Turkey). The {{provenance}} of most <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> is related to local lithological units, though some stone types were imported from considerable distance. Throughout the building history of the city, beige and pink limestone remained the most important. High quality white limestone from the territory represents a small but important {{fraction of the total}} amount of <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> used. Stable isotope analyses of Hellenistic to Julio-Claudian <b>building</b> <b>stones</b> have shown that the limestone used originated from quarries in the immediate vicinity of the monumental centre. For the later imperial period, the data indicate that the limestone was exploited both in nearby quarries as well as in quarries located further away on the territory. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Economic {{development}} and increased settlement led the Pennsylvania General Assembly to establish Cummings Township in 1832 from land taken from parts of Mifflin and Brown Townships. The new township {{was named for}} John Cummings, who was an associate judge in the local court system at the time.

5|$|Materials for {{building}} the Shrine were sourced from within Australia: the chosen <b>building</b> <b>stone</b> was granodiorite quarried from Tynong; the internal walls use sandstone from Redesdale; {{and the black}} marble columns used stone from Buchan. This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine, as the Tynong quarry {{was no longer in}} use, and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce <b>building</b> <b>stone</b> for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the {{floating}} harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E

5|$|The Triassic rocks {{consist of}} red marls, sandstones, breccias and {{conglomerates}} which {{spread over the}} older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic Beds are full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are famous for their fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source of lime for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative <b>building</b> <b>stone.</b> Blue Lias {{is believed to have}} been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local cement works closed.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and <b>building</b> <b>stone.</b> One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{house for}} which there is {{evidence}} in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began <b>building</b> <b>stone</b> houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the oldest}} surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.|$|E

25|$|The red {{freestone}} of the Keuper <b>building</b> <b>stone</b> {{is familiar}} in buildings and bridges throughout North and West Cheshire.

The <b>building</b> <b>stone</b> represents a particular lithology of medium grained massive sandstones within the Keuper Sandstone and may not always lie at precisely the same horizon.
