5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E

Groundbreaking for the Miami extension took place in Hialeah in January 1926, and by December 1926, the line was open for freight. From January 7 though January 9, 1927, Warfield took a large faction of dignitaries on a special run of the crack Seaboard train the Orange Blossom Special, beginning at Arcadia and proceeding south to Naples, then doubling <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east coast and proceeding south from West Palm Beach to Miami.|$|E
25|$|Leona Helmsley's {{remaining}} {{share in}} the building was bought by Peter Malkin's company in 2006. In 2008 the building was temporary “stolen” by the New York Daily News to show {{how easy it is}} to transfer the deed on a property, since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information, as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money. The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of King Kong, and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber.

25|$|From Mission, the Canadian travels on the CPR {{route through}} the Fraser and Thompson river canyons.

Near Basque (near Lytton), both the CPR and CN are {{on the same side of}} the river and have {{crossovers}} to access each other's tracks, and it is here that the eastbound Canadian transfers from the CPR back onto the CN line. Shortly thereafter the CN line crosses <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west/north side of the Thompson River and makes a few other crossings across the river before the staying on the north/west side for rest of the way into Kamloops and crosses the North Thompson River before arriving at the Kamloops station, which is actually in North Kamloops, across the Thompson River from downtown Kamloops. On their regular schedules, both east and westbound Canadians travel through the Fraser and Thompson river canyons at night.|$|E

25|$|Four {{plays into}} the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide {{receiver}} Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain {{to put the}} Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31–28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38–28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 {{to set up a}} 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41–28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48–28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7–4.|$|E

500|$|When night {{began to}} fall, we climbed into our boats and floated down the Danube and crossed {{over to the}} other side several miles below the place where Vlad's army was stationed. There we dug {{ourselves}} trenches, so that cavalry could not harm us. After that we crossed <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire infantry had crossed over, then we prepared and set out gradually against Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had brought with us. Having halted, we set up the cannon, but not in time to stop three hundred janissaries from being killed ... Seeing that our side was greatly weakening, we defended ourselves with the 120 guns which we had brought over and fired so often that we repelled the prince's army and greatly strengthened our position ... Vlad, seeing that he could not prevent the crossing, withdrew. After that the emperor crossed the Danube with his entire army and gave us 30,000 coins to be distributed among us.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. He {{bent down to}} look at them and dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted {{to move away from the}} table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E

His objective was [...] "to win Luxembourg <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German nation as soon as possible." [...] He was convinced that Luxembourgers only needed a level of education and enlightenment in order to voluntarily declare their loyalty to Germany. He deduced this from his belief that they were, in fact, German [...] "by blood and by descent". To the Gauleiter, Luxembourgish independence was an [...] "absurd idea," [...] which existed only because the monarchy and government had nurtured it: if the Luxembourgers were shown evidence of their belonging to the German nation, the will to be independent must disappear.|$|E
2500|$|Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss {{secured a}} lease {{on the park}} in 1901 as a {{preventative}} measure to keep the upstart American League from establishing a competing baseball franchise in Pittsburgh. Hoping also {{to profit from the}} grounds, Dreyfuss put in a modern bicycle track to be used for motor-paced races featuring the stars of the sport. Baseball umpire and boxing referee Tim Hurst was manager of the facility, which opened in May 1902 under a name variously spelled as [...] "Colosseum" [...] or [...] "Coliseum." [...] The track was a smooth wooden oval with 20-foot-high bankings and encompassed a multipurpose field. Surrounding the track was newly built seating for 7,000 spectators, comprising two covered grandstands—one each on the north and south sides—and open bleachers. The venture was not long in proving a failure: Cycling did not catch on as a spectator sport, and the stadium's alternative use as a football venue was less than lucrative. No longer fearing an invasion by an opposition baseball team, Dreyfuss let the lease expire in April 1904. The track was torn down and the grounds turned <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> owners.|$|E
