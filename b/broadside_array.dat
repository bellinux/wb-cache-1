This paper presents an empirical investigation of spatial corre-lation in ultrawideband (UWB) indoor channels in the FCC-allocated 3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz band. The {{impact of a}} number of system parameters on spatial correlation at the receiver is evaluated. It is found that the coherence distance falls with channel bandwidth in endfire arrays but not in <b>broadside</b> <b>arrays.</b> The complex correlation decays less rapidly with distance in <b>broadside</b> <b>arrays</b> than in endfire arrays, especially under line-of-sight, but the envelope correlation is circularly symmetric in space. Strong dependence of spatial correlation and coherence distance on the channel center frequency is observed. Furthermore, horizontally polarized links are found to exhibit less correlation than vertically polarized links. A discussion of the implications of these results for multiple-antenna UWB systems is provided.

40|$|For linear arrays with fixed {{steering}} and an inter-element spacing smaller than {{one half of}} the wavelength, end-fire steering of a data-independent beamformer offers better directivity than broadside steering. The introduction of a lower bound on the white noise gain ensures the necessary robustness against random array errors and sensor mismatches. However, the optimum broadside performance can be obtained using a simple processing architecture, whereas the optimum end-fire performance requires a more complicated system (because complex weight coefficients are needed). In this paper, we reconsider the oversteering technique as a possible way to simplify the processing architecture of equally spaced end-fire arrays. We propose a method for computing the amount of over{{steering and}} the related real-valued weight vector that allows the constrained directivity to be maximized for a given inter-element spacing. Moreover, we verify that the maximized oversteering performance is very close to the optimum end-fire performance. We conclude that optimized oversteering is a viable method for designing end-fire arrays that have better constrained directivity than <b>broadside</b> <b>arrays</b> but with a similar implementation complexity.

50|$|The {{difficulty}} in achieving high resolutions with single radio telescopes led to radio interferometry, developed by British radio astronomer Martin Ryle and Australian engineer, radiophysicist, and radio astronomer Joseph Lade Pawsey and Ruby Payne-Scott in 1946. Surprisingly the {{first use of}} a radio interferometer for an astronomical observation {{was carried out by}} Payne-Scott, Pawsey and Lindsay McCready on 26 January 1946 using a SINGLE converted radar antenna (<b>broadside</b> <b>array)</b> at 200 MHz near Sydney, Australia. This group used the principle of a sea-cliff interferometer in which the antenna (formerly a World War II radar) observed the sun at sunrise with interference arising from the direct radiation from the sun and the reflected radiation from the sea. With this baseline of almost 200 meters, the authors determined that the solar radiation during the burst phase was much smaller than the solar disk and arose from a region associated with a large sunspot group. The Australia group laid out the principles of aperture synthesis in a ground-breaking paper published in 1947. The use of a sea-cliff interferometer had been demonstrated by numerous groups in Australia, Iran and the UK during World War II, who had observed interference fringes (the direct radar return radiation and the reflected signal from the sea) from incoming aircraft. The Cambridge group of Ryle and Vonberg observed the sun at 175 MHz {{for the first time in}} mid July 1946 with a Michelson interferometer consisting of two radio antennas with spacings of some tens of meters up to 240 meters. They showed that the radio radiation was smaller than 10 arc minutes in size and also detected circular polarization in the Type I bursts. Two other groups had also detected circular polarization at about the same time (David Martyn in Australia and Edward Appleton with James Stanley Hey in the UK).|$|E

Furthermore, the Toeplitz symmetry of the impedance matrix is taken into account, and the singular value decomposition is used to invert the resulting non-square matrix in a numerically stable way. Both the symmetry property and the Toeplitz symmetry procedures reduce storage and CPU-time requirements in the analysis of <b>broadside</b> microstrip <b>arrays.</b> The pattern characteristics calculated with and without mutual coupling interactions are found to differ up to 10 dB in sideloge levels which clearly demonstrates that the pattern can be as severely affected by mutual coupling as the commonly investigated input impedance.
