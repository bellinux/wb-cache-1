(Botany) A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>biological</b> <b>filtering</b> and activated sludge processes at the Johannesburg North Sewerage Works by making use of, inter alia, the physical-chemical and biological research methods. In addition to the standard physical and chemical analytical techniques, the biological growth potential technique, the lC method of determining primary productivity and biomass determination by way of the chlorophyll a method, were also used. The most important findings were: 1. that the activated sludge process purifies the water more effectively than the <b>biological</b> <b>filtering</b> process; 2. that no seasonal fluctuations affecting the effectiveness of the purifying systems were found, and 3. that the biological growth potential of the effluent in the Jukskei River was such that it could still cause algal growth.

40|$|Gene-gene {{interactions}} {{may contribute}} to the genetic variation underlying complex traits but have not always been taken fully into account. Statistical analyses that consider gene-gene interaction may increase the power of detecting associations, especially for low-marginal-effect markers, and may explain in part the missing heritability. Detecting pair-wise and higher-order interactions genome-wide requires enormous computational power. Filtering pipelines increase the computational speed by limiting the number of tests performed. We summarize existing filtering approaches to detect epistasis, after distinguishing the purposes that lead us to search for epistasis. Statistical filtering includes quality control on the basis of single marker statistics to avoid the analysis of bad and least informative data, and limits the search space for finding interactions. <b>Biological</b> <b>filtering</b> includes targeting specific pathways, integrating various databases based on known biological and metabolic pathways, gene function ontology and protein-protein interactions.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> {{capable of}} {{simultaneous}} nitrification and denitrification was constructed for aquatic animal {{experiments in the}} International Space Station (ISS). The <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> {{will be used to}} remove harmful ammonia excreted from aquatic animals in a closed water circulation system (Aquatic Habitat). The <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> is a cylindrical tank packed with porous glass beads for nitrification and dual plastic bags for denitrification. The porous beads are supporting media for Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi. The N. europaea cells and N. winogradskyi cells on the porous beads, oxidize the excreted ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. On the other hand, the dual bag is composed of an outer non-woven fabric bag and an inner non-porous polyethylene film bag. The outer bag is supporting media for Paracoccus pantotrophus. The inner bag, in which 99. 5 % ethanol is packed, releases the ethanol slowly, since ethanol can permeate through the non-porous polyethylene film. The P. pantotrophus cells on the outer bag reduce the produced nitrate to nitrogen gas by using the released ethanol as an electron donor for denitrification. The <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> constructed in this study consequently removed the ammonia without accumulating nitrate. Most of the excess ethanol was consumed and did not affect the nitrification activity of the N. europaea cells and N. winogradskyi cells severely. In accordance with the aquatic animal experiments in the ISS, small freshwater fish had been bred in the closed water circulation system equipped with the <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> for 90 days. Ammonia concentration daily excreted from fish is assumed to be 1. 7 mg-N/L in the recirculation water. Under such conditions, the harmful ammonia and nitrite concentrations were kept below 0. 1 mg-N/L in the recirculation water. Nitrate and total organic carbon concentrations in the recirculation water were kept below 5 mg-N/L and 3 mg-C/L, respectively. All breeding fish were alive and ate the feed well. The results show that the nitrification and denitrification abilities of the <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> sufficed to keep water quality for aquatic animal experiments in the ISS.

The results show temperature increasing is benefit for accelerating start-up of filter in the range of 17. 0 - 33. 0 °C. COD removal of the filter enhances slightly by temperature rising during normal operation. High NH 3 -N reduction (above 84. 0 %) is obtained in range of 25. 0 - 30. 0 °C. pH in range of 7. 1 - 8. 0 is recommended for operation treatment, in which pollutants reduction for COD and NH 3 -N is 85. 7 %- 86. 9 and 86. 8 %- 89. 5 %, respectively. COD and NH 3 -N reduction enhances with recirculation rate increasing. When the recirculation rate is above 4, the increasing of COD and NH 3 -N reduction is slight.

40|$|Fish {{produce a}} variety of wastes {{including}} solids, ammonia, {{carbon dioxide and other}} materials. These wastes must be removed from the culture water or they become toxic to the fish. Many methods have been developed to remove the wastes fish produce. However, in this paper we will concentrate on removal of ammonia and nitrite, both of which are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. In fresh water systems there are two common methods used to remove ammonia: ion exchange and <b>biological</b> <b>filters.</b> In brackish or salt water systems ion exchange is not a viable alternative because salt in the culture water quickly (usually in a matter of minutes) saturates all of the adsorption sites on the ion exchange media. Thus, <b>biological</b> <b>filters</b> are the only widely used method of removing ammonia and nitrite from all types of aquacultural systems. <b>Biological</b> <b>filters</b> consist of some solid media that serves as a surface on which bacteria can attach and live.
