50|$|A bed base, {{sometimes}} called a foundation, {{is the part}} of a bed that supports the mattress. The bed base is itself held in place and framed by the bedstead (bed frame). In the United States, <b>box</b> <b>spring</b> <b>bed</b> bases are very common (to the point where 'bed base' and 'box spring' may be used synonymously). In Europe, sprung slats are much more common.|$|E
5000|$|Bed rails {{are made}} of wood or metal and are {{attached}} to a headboard and footboard. Wooden slats are placed perpendicular to the bed rails to support the mattress/mattress <b>box</b> <b>spring.</b> <b>Bed</b> rails and frames are often attached to the bed post using knock-down fittings.

5000|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} conventions {{have produced}} many standard mattress and <b>box</b> <b>spring</b> sizes. <b>Beds</b> vary by {{country of origin}} as per the table below.

50|$|A bed skirt or valance is a {{piece of}} {{decorative}} fabric that is placed between the mattress and the <b>box</b> <b>spring</b> of a <b>bed.</b> The purpose of a bed skirt is to give a stylish appearance to a bed without exposing the sides of the <b>box</b> <b>spring</b> or any space under the bed that may be used for storage. Historically, bed skirts were used to block drafts, which could chill the undersides of beds, and to prevent dust from accumulating under the bed.|$|R
50|$|Steam {{treatment}} can effectively kill {{all stages of}} bed bugs. To be effective, steam treatment must reach 150-170 degrees Fahrenheit (65 - 75 degrees C) for a sustained period. Unfortunately, bed bugs hide in a diversity of places, making steam treatment very tedious, labour-intensive and time consuming. There is also {{the risk of the}} steam not penetrating materials enough to kill hidden bed bugs. The steam may also damage materials such as varnished wood, or cause mold from the moisture left behind. Effective treatment requires repeated and very thorough steaming of the mattress, <b>box</b> <b>spring,</b> <b>bed</b> frame, bed covers, pillows, not to mention other materials and objects within the infested room, such as carpets and curtains.|$|E
