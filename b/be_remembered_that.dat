5|$|It will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the Virginia was {{a novelty}} in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her {{officers and crew}} strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, it must <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E

25|$|It {{should also}} <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> there are further courts at the Rolls Building, which {{come under the}} wing of the Law Courts and are within short walking distance.|$|E
25|$|These {{figures are}} very low for a {{battalion}} that {{was involved in}} so much combat, though it must <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the Commandos were both smaller than the companies of the average strength infantry battalion of modern warfare and fighting with modern weapons and tactics against a relatively untrained, though well equipped, foe.|$|E
25|$|Grand Treasurers {{supervised}} lesser officials {{such as the}} Master of the Mint (mincerz), dyspensators, kurators, tax collectors (poborca podatkowy), superintendents (overseer {{of customs}} officers), customs officers (celnik) and subkolektors. It should <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that,</b> in those times, goods—as well as people—were taxed not only at borders but at bridges, crossroads and city gates.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Schabak largely {{replaced}} Schuco, {{but it should}} <b>be</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Gama Toys acquired dies from Schuco and reproduced many of Schuco's 1:43 scale line as well.|$|R

25|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> in {{the early}} part of the 20th century matches were a {{necessity}} for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.|$|E
25|$|Possibly in the 2nd-3rd and {{certainly}} {{starting with the}} 5th-6th centuries, Christian religious structures were built at Tell al-Kharrar. It must <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> in the 1st-4th centuries of the Christian Era, Christianity was often persecuted by the Roman state, and only after it became first tolerated and then outright the state religion of the Roman, or now so-called Byzantine Empire, open Christian worship became possible.|$|E
25|$|Older {{cases had}} held {{that if a}} {{contract}} had already been performed, or a misrepresentation had become a term of the contract, this would preclude rescission. This inflexible position was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 1, which simply says such bars no longer exist. However, it must still <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> one cannot ask both for rescission and for recovery of expectation damages for breach of contract.|$|E
60|$|President Roosevelt's first {{message to}} Congress was awaited with {{considerable}} interest. It <b>was</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> the youngest Executive our White House had ever known, {{and many were}} curious {{to know what he}} would say and what he proposed to do.|$|R

50|$|However, the {{principal}} {{reason why the}} Place de Grève <b>is</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{was the site of}} most of the public executions in early Paris. The gallows and the pillory stood there.|$|R
25|$|In Wisconsin, Schurz {{soon became}} {{immersed}} in the anti-slavery movement and in politics, joining the Republican Party. In 1857, he was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for lieutenant-governor. In the Illinois campaign {{of the next year}} between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, he took part as a speaker on behalf of Lincoln—mostly in German—which raised Lincoln's popularity among German-American voters, though it should <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Senators were not directly elected in 1858, the election being decided by the Illinois General Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} {{had been}} long before selected, and {{the whole of the}} ground had even been surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which had now actually occurred; but then it must <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> <b>that</b> in this design the co-operation of the IV Corps (Bülow's) was fully expected, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question: and hence it was that Blücher was led to place more reliance upon a direct support from Wellington, than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
25|$|It must <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the DTM {{is only a}} {{model and}} cannot {{necessarily}} predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, {{as it has been}} shown that after a HDI of 0.9 the fertility increases again.|$|E
50|$|The season saw Huddersfield's wing-three-quarter Albert Rosenfeld score an {{impressive}} 56 tries. However this figure paled into insignificance when it <b>is</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Rosenfeld, a Jewish Australian {{who had come}} over to Britain with the 1908 Kangaroos, had scored 80 tries the previous season. This record has never yet been beaten.|$|R
5000|$|After officially {{ordering}} that Tsarnaev be executed, O'Toole told him, [...] "No {{one will}} <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> your teachers <b>were</b> fond of you, {{that you were}} funny, a good athlete... Whenever your name is mentioned, what will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> the evil you have done.... What will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you murdered and maimed... It was a monstrous self-deception. You had to forget your own humanity. The common humanity you shared with your brother Tamerlan." ...|$|R

25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, {{these stories are}} rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; but it must <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, they deserve high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. His touch is heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E
25|$|He {{also wrote}} that British {{perceptions}} were coloured by the terrible losses of 1 July 1916 (57,000 casualties) {{but that it}} should also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the British never suffered anything like the losses of June 1916, when the Austro-Hungarian Army had 280,000 casualties in a week, or of August 1914 when the French Army lost 211,000 in 16 days, or of March and April 1918 when the Germans lost nearly 350,000 in six weeks (8,600 per day), or 1915 when Russia suffered 2 million casualties in a year.|$|E
25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works. While it has been criticized as the least {{substantial}} of the composer's three ballets, it should <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Tchaikovsky was restricted by a rigorous scenario supplied by Marius Petipa. This scenario provided no opportunity {{for the expression of}} human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are charming and pretty, and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>remembered,</b> too, <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> no bloodhounds in Mariposa, although, mind you, {{there are}} any amount of dogs there.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{no fewer than}} twenty-nine corpses of tribesmen were found round the cookhouse, and in the open space over which the three charges had taken place. This, when it <b>is</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> perhaps twice as many had been wounded and had crawled away, enables an {{estimate}} to be formed of the desperate nature of the fight for the Quarter Guard.|$|R

25|$|This {{description}} has {{similarities to}} the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences are interesting. Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas. Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr's description. Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways. It {{is possible that the}} Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism but it must also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind. Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information.|$|E
25|$|The Tang dynasty {{was a time}} {{of major}} social and {{probably}} linguistic upheavals. Thus, the genre may be divided into several major more-or-less chronological divisions, based on developmental stages or stylistic groupings (sometimes even on personal friendships between poets). It should <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> poets may be somewhat arbitrarily assigned to these based on their presumed biographical dates (not always known); furthermore that the lifetimes of poets toward the beginning or end of this period may overlap with the preceding Sui dynasty or the succeeding Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The chronology of Tang poetry may be divided into four parts: Early Tang, High Tang, Middle Tang, and Late Tang.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources for}} the civil war era are the kings' sagas. Heimskringla, Fagrskinna and Morkinskinna all {{describe}} the period up to the year 1177, although the parts of Morkinskinna that are preserved only extend to 1157. These three sagas were written c. 1220-1230, and in using them as historical sources, it has to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> they were thus written {{a fair amount of}} time after the events they describe. However, they are likely to have been based on earlier works, in particular the saga Hryggjarstykki, written c. 1150, which is lost to us, but was available to the authors of the three aforementioned sagas.|$|E

50|$|When {{considering}} {{the differences between}} ska and rocksteady it <b>is</b> worth <b>remembering</b> <b>that</b> the musicians <b>were</b> essentially the same and so were the producers.|$|R
