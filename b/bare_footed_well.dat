The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} the surface {{roughness}} of polymeric indoors floorings on the static friction of <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> as <b>well</b> as <b>foot</b> wearing cotton and polymeric socks under dry, water, water + 5. 0 vol. % soap, oil and water + 5. 0 vol. % oil lubricated sliding conditions. Polymeric floor sheets of different roughness ranging from 0. 05 and 11. 0 µm were tested. The tested material is commonly used in entrance areas or corridors and in the sport halls. Cotton and polymeric socks as <b>well</b> as <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> were frictionally tested. The results were compared to the friction caused by shoes as simulated by rubber test specimens of vee shape treads were prepared in the form of square sheets of 100 × 100 mm, 10. 0 mm thickness. Experiments were carried out using a test rig designed and manufactured to measure the friction coefficient between the foot and the tested polymeric flooring materials. The experimental results showed that, at dry sliding, frictio...|$|R

The foot/shoe is the most basic foundation, the ground upon which the rest of the socialbody rests. By standing on two feet, the hands are freed to become tool making and using appendages, and the mouth is thereby freed from carrying to bear words instead. In structural terms, the foot/shoe functions as base to the face?s superstructure. But when a shoe is thrown at the face of power, a double inversion comes into play. On the one hand, the base rises up to strike directly at the superstructure and to challenge materially the basis of its legitimacy. On the other hand, the most basic sign of development and civilization ? the shoe ? is removed from the <b>bare</b> <b>foot.</b> As <b>well</b> as turning the foot?s prosthesis into a projectile weapon, this move symbolically reaffirms the body against a becoming-face or a becoming-technology. This moment of unshod insubordination asserts a basic, naked, human dignity in the face of dehumanization. These themes of insubordination and rehumanization, structure and ideology, run through the various contributions to this issue of ephemer...|$|R

50|$|During {{questioning}} or {{in court}} the accused women {{often had to}} stand on a consecrated spot with the soles of their <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> touching the sanctified area. This was believed to completely inhibit any of their purported magic powers. Accordingly, the women were forbidden {{to look at the}} prosecutors when their <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> were not strictly in place. To further ensure safety they were often lead in walking backwards when facing the prosecution. They were allowed to turn around only if their <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> could clearly be seen to be within the bounded spot.As the accused women naturally could not use any magic while they were tried, this assumption became an accepted doctrine.Accordingly, contemporary depictions about inquisition proceedings or similar situations portray the tried women barefooted in almost every case.|$|R
