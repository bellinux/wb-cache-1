30|$|The {{effect of}} pH value could be {{interpreted}} <b>that</b> <b>pH</b> value affects {{the distribution of the}} existing state of the pyridine and all kinds of organic compounds in the wastewater. It is well known <b>that</b> <b>pH</b> value can affect the physicochemical properties of substances in aqueous solution, and thus it <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> <b>pH</b> value can affect the ultrasonic decomposition rates of substance s in the solution (Xu et al. 2005). This dependence of degradation on pH compared well with existing literature. Kotronarou et al. (1991) and Jain et al. (2004) investigated the influence of the changes in the initial pH of the pnitrophenol (PNP) solutions on the decay of PNP. PNP decayed exponentially with time at all pH values. The pseudo-first order rate constant decreased with the increase of pH (pH 5 to 8), and remained constant up to pH 10. At pH >  10, the pseudo-first order rate constant increased slightly because of the slow thermal reaction between PNP and OH radical/H 2 O 2.|$|R

According to our records since the pre-industrial age pH has already dropped approximately 0.1 pH unit, or 30 percent because the pH scale is logarithmic.

30|$|The {{catalyst}} {{surface is}} positively charged while at pH value above just about 6.0, henceforth, at more acidic pH, it is negatively charged [48]. Also, since m-cresol is as weak organic acid in water, therefore, {{depending on the}} pH value in the solution, m-cresol might be exhibited in various structures. In this way, the adsorption amount of m-cresol at the surface TiO 2 most likely as the initial {{step in the process}} of photoelectrocatalysis and subsequently photoelcectrocatalytic degradation efficiency of m-cresol is related to the initial pH value of the solution. pH has doublet effect in reaction, one is pH effect in adsorption of substrate molecules and second is pH effect in the OH− and OH· concentration that affected degradation performance resulting from reaction of holes with H 2 O. Therefore, in some cases, these two effects are alien and reversely affected degradation performances. In these cases, adsorption of substrate molecules at the surface of electrode is more effective than OH· concentration. For photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic degradation of compounds, it is necessary that compounds are absorbed at the surface of TiO 2. Studies showed <b>that</b> <b>pH</b> 4.0 was optimum pH for photoelectrocatalytic degradation of m-cresol (Fig.  9). At low pH values, m-cresol molecules presented in the neutral form might be effectively adsorbed onto the surface of TiO 2 with positive charges. In pH >[*] 8, the surface containing negative charge steadily is shaped onto TiO 2 and due to the repulsion effect between the TiO 2 surface and the ionized m-cresol with negative charge at high pH, adsorption of m-cresol at the surface TiO 2 and accordingly its degradation turn out to be substantially more difficult than <b>that</b> at low <b>pH</b> values. Therefore, it can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> more acidic <b>pH</b> amounts would be desirable for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of m-cresol. At pH 11.0, m-cresol oxidation is being easier due to the presence of large amounts of hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidizing capacity [49].|$|R
40|$|Seagrass {{ecosystems}} <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> {{to benefit}} from the global increase in CO 2 in the ocean because the photosynthetic rate of these plants may be Ci-limited at the current CO 2 level. As well, it <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> lower external <b>pH</b> will facilitate the nitrate uptake of seagrasses if nitrate is cotransported with H+ across the membrane as in terrestrial plants. Here, we investigate the effects of CO 2 enrichment on both carbon and nitrogen metabolism of the seagrass Zostera noltii in a mesocosm experiment where plants were exposed for 5 months to two experimental CO 2 concentrations (360 and 700 ppm). Both the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pm) and photosynthetic efficiency (a) were higher (1. 3 - and 4. 1 -fold, respectively) in plants exposed to CO 2 -enriched conditions. On the other hand, no significant effects of CO 2 enrichment on leaf growth rates were observed, probably due to nitrogen limitation as revealed by the low nitrogen content of leaves. The leaf ammonium uptake rate and glutamine synthetase activity were not significantly affected by increased CO 2 concentrations. On the other hand, the leaf nitrate uptake rate of plants exposed to CO 2 -enriched conditions was fourfold lower than the uptake of plants exposed to current CO 2 level, suggesting that in the seagrass Z. noltii nitrate is not cotransported with H+ as in terrestrial plants. In contrast, the activity of nitrate reductase was threefold higher in plant leaves grown at high-CO 2 concentrations. Our results suggest that the global effects of CO 2 on seagrass production may be spatially heterogeneous and depend on the specific nitrogen availability of each system. Under a CO 2 increase scenario, the natural levels of nutrients will probably become limiting for Z. noltii. This potential limitation becomes more relevant because the expected positive effect of CO 2 increase on nitrate uptake rate was not confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{successfully}} {{demonstrated the}} chemistry and process equipment of the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) flowsheet using MaxCalix for the decontamination of high level waste (HLW). The demonstration was completed using a 12 -stage, 2 -cm centrifugal contactor apparatus at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This represents the first CSSX process {{demonstration of the}} MaxCalix solvent system with Savannah River Site (SRS) HLW. Two tests lasting 24 and 27 hours processed non-radioactive simulated Tank 49 H waste and actual Tank 49 H HLW, respectively. Conclusions from this work include the following. The CSSX process is capable of reducing {sup 137 }Cs in high level radioactive waste {{by a factor of}} more than 40, 000 using five extraction, two scrub, and five strip stages. Tests demonstrated extraction and strip section stage efficiencies of greater than 93 % for the Tank 49 H waste test and greater than 88 % for the simulant waste test. During a test with HLW, researchers processed 39 liters of Tank 49 H solution and the waste raffinate had an average decontamination factor (DF) of 6. 78 E+ 04, with a maximum of 1. 08 E+ 05. A simulant waste solution ({approx} 34. 5 liters) with an initial Cs concentration of 83. 1 mg/L was processed and had an average DF greater than 5. 9 E+ 03, with a maximum DF of greater than 6. 6 E+ 03. The difference may be attributable to differences in contactor stage efficiencies. Test results showed the solvent can be stripped of cesium and recycled for {approx} 25 solvent turnovers without the occurrence of any measurable solvent degradation or negative effects from minor components. Based on the performance of the 12 -stage 2 -cm apparatus with the Tank 49 H HLW, the projected DF for MCU with seven extraction, two scrub, and seven strip stages operating at a nominal efficiency of 90 % is {approx} 388, 000. At 95 % stage efficiency, the DF in MCU would be {approx} 3. 2 million. Carryover of organic solvent in aqueous streams (and aqueous in organic streams) was less than 0. 1 % when processing Tank 49 H HLW. The entrained solvent concentration measured in the decontaminated salt solution (DSS) was as much as {approx} 140 mg/L, although that value may be overstated by as much as 50 % due to modifier solubility in the DSS. The entrained solvent concentration was measured in the strip effluent (SE) and the results are pending. A steady-state concentration factor (CF) of 15. 9 was achieved with Tank 49 H HLW. Cesium distribution ratios [D(Cs) ] were measured with non-radioactive Tank 49 H waste simulant and actual Tank 49 H waste. Below is a comparison of D(Cs) values of ESS and 2 -cm tests. Batch Extraction-Strip-Scrub (ESS) tests yielded D(Cs) values for extraction of {approx} 81 - 88 for tests with Tank 49 H waste and waste simulant. The results from the 2 -cm contactor tests were in agreement with values of 58 - 92 for the Tank 49 H HLW test and 54 - 83 for the simulant waste test. These values are consistent with the reference D(Cs) for extraction of {approx} 60. In tests with Tank 49 H waste and waste simulant, batch ESS tests measured D(Cs) values for the two scrub stages as {approx} 3. 5 - 5. 0 for the first scrub stage and {approx} 1. 0 - 3. 0 for the second scrub stage. In the Tank 49 H test, the D(Cs) values for the 2 -cm test were far from the ESS values. A D(Cs) value of 161 was measured for the first scrub stage and 10. 8 for the second scrub stage. The data suggest that the scrub stage is not operating as effectively as intended. For the simulant test, a D(Cs) value of 1. 9 was measured for the first scrub stage; the sample from the second scrub stage was compromised. Measurements of the pH of all stage samples for the Tank 49 H test showed <b>that</b> the <b>pH</b> for extraction and scrub stages was 14 and the pH for the strip stages was {approx} 7. It <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the <b>pH</b> of the second scrub stage would be {approx} 12 - 13. Batch ESS tests measured D(Cs) values for the strip stages to be {approx} 0. 002 - 0. 010. A high value in Strip No. 3 of a test with simulant solution has been attributed to issues associated with the limits of detection for the analytical method. In the 2 -cm contactor tests, the first four strip stages of the Tank 49 H waste test and all five strip stages in the simulant waste test had higher values than the ESS tests. Only the fifth strip stage D(Cs) value of the Tank 49 H waste test matched that of the ESS tests. It is speculated that the less-than-optimal performance of the strip section is caused by inefficiencies in the scrub section. Because strip is sensitive to pH, the elevated pH value in the second scrub stage may be the cause of strip performance. In spite of the D(Cs) values obtained in the scrub and strip sections, testing showed that the solvent system is robust. Average DFs for the process far exceeded targets even though the scrub and strip stages did not function optimally. Correction of the issue in the scrub and strip stages <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to yield even higher waste DFs...|$|R
