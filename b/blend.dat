Combustion and emission characteristics of ethanol, methanol and gasoline and their <b>blends</b> were evaluated. Results showed that when the vehicle was fueled with ethanol–methanol–gasoline <b>blends,</b> the concentrations of CO and UHC (unburnt hydrocarbons) emissions were significantly decreased, compared to the neat gasoline. Methanol–gasoline <b>blends</b> presented the lowest emissions of CO and UHC among all test fuels.

In {{order to}} study the effect of {{different}} <b>blended</b> ratios on strength and elongation properties of Outlast/viscose <b>blended</b> yarn, ten kinds of <b>blended</b> yarns had been designed and spun. The <b>blended</b> ratios were Outlast/viscose 0 / 100, 15 / 85, 25 / 75, 30 / 70, 35 / 65, 40 / 60, 45 / 55, 50 / 50, 60 / 40, 100 / 0. By testing the strength and elongation properties of the <b>blended</b> yarn, the effect of <b>blended</b> ratio on <b>blended</b> yarn’s breaking tenacity and elongation rate was analysed. The results showed that, {{with the increase of}} <b>blended</b> ratio, the breaking tenacity and breaking elongation rate of the <b>blended</b> yarn both presented a downward trend.
