5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish <b>become</b> <b>more</b> highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> difficult to obtain.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately {{during the}} initial {{preparations}} for 2015 event it was realized that the Little Wittenham site was no longer suitable. The reason given was that the logistics had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> difficult over the previous few years, as the event had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> popular {{and the use of}} the land had changed. This was announced by the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires on 7 January 2015.|$|E

50|$|Most first {{generation}} owner/managers make {{the majority of}} the decisions. When the second generation (sibling partnership) is in control, the decision making <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> consultative. When the larger third generation (cousin consortium) is in control, the decision making <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> consensual, the family members often take a vote. In this manner, the decision making throughout generations <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> rational.|$|R

50|$|As {{knowledge-based}} systems <b>became</b> <b>more</b> complex {{the techniques}} {{used to represent}} the knowledge base <b>became</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated. Rather than representing facts as assertions about data, the knowledge-base <b>became</b> <b>more</b> structured, representing information using similar techniques to object-oriented programming such as hierarchies of classes and subclasses, relations between classes, and behavior of objects. As the knowledge base <b>became</b> <b>more</b> structured reasoning could occur both by independent rules and by interactions within the knowledge base itself. For example, procedures stored as demons on objects could fire and could replicate the chaining behavior of rules.|$|R

25|$|Little {{by little}} {{as they were}} handed down, the strips of land <b>became</b> <b>more</b> and more narrow. Some {{were only a few}} metres wide by several {{kilometres}} long following the downward slope. Because of this, farming and access to parcels <b>became</b> <b>more</b> and more difficult.|$|R

5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but <b>become</b> <b>more</b> aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females.

50|$|TIP {{was soon}} {{starting}} to face increased competition. Customer service <b>became</b> <b>more</b> emphasized {{and in the}} late 1990s, credit card orders and 24-7 access via 800 numbers and the Internet <b>became</b> <b>more</b> important to the company.|$|R
50|$|The {{last two}} successes for the Austrians, the Romanian Offensive and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{politically}} unstable, it <b>became</b> <b>more</b> and {{more dependent on}} German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.|$|R

50|$|These are {{the regions}} where Mapuche {{communities}} have thrived the best since the Chilean conquest. With {{the construction of}} the Malleco viaduct in the 1890s, the region <b>became</b> <b>more</b> accessible. Settlements in southern Chile <b>became</b> <b>more</b> consolidated.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could <b>become</b> <b>more</b> frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will <b>become</b> <b>more</b> frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Specific sleep hygiene {{recommendations}} {{have changed}} over time. For example, advice to simply avoid sleeping pills was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced, recommendations concerning their use have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never <b>become</b> <b>more</b> complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E
50|$|After Molloy {{divorced}} Edward Molly, she <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{involved in}} lecturing on temperance and moved west. It is {{during this time}} that Molloy <b>became</b> <b>more</b> involved with the Methodist Church and began an unprofessional career as an evangelist preacher.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} wave, the fat {{acceptance}} movement <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{widespread in the}} USA and started to spread to other countries.

5|$|The {{most basic}} type of {{meetings}} are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow {{people of all}} ages and abilities to compete.

5|$|While the {{incidence}} of use dropped, towards the latter end of the Middle Ages the incendiary devices became more sophisticated, and the principle of wielding fire with sword remained present throughout the Early Modern and Modern periods; improving technology merely allowed the process to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Above all, Kilbourn {{is saying}} that as {{civilisation}} <b>became</b> <b>more</b> complex, art <b>became</b> <b>more</b> complex.

5000|$|The {{hourglass}} {{also found}} popularity on land. As {{the use of}} mechanical clocks to indicate the times of events like church services <b>became</b> <b>more</b> common, creating a [...] "need {{to keep track of}} time", the demand for time-measuring devices increased. Hourglasses were essentially inexpensive, as they required no rare technology to make and their contents were not hard to come by, and as the manufacturing of these instruments <b>became</b> <b>more</b> common, their uses <b>became</b> <b>more</b> practical.|$|R
