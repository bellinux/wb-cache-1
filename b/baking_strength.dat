He held several positions within the agency until his promotion to Branch Chief of the Grain Division in 1943, a position he held until he retired in 1966.

40|$|AbstractLiterature has {{unveiled}} that a {{paper has}} not been published yet on using non-parametric stability statistics (NPSSs) for evaluating genotypic stability in dough properties of wheat. Accordingly, the effects of genotype (G), environment (E) and GE interaction (GEI) on alveograph parameters, i. e. dough <b>baking</b> <b>strength</b> (W) and its tenacity (P) /extensibility (L), of 18 wheat (T. aestivum L.) genotypes were studied under irrigated field conditions in an 8 -year trial (2006 - 2014) in central Turkey. Furthermore, genotypic stability for W and P/L was determined using 8 NPSSs viz. RM-Rank mean, RSD-Rank&# 8217;s standard deviation, RS-Rank Sum, TOP-Ranking, Si(1), Si(2), Si(3) and Si(6) rank statistics. The ANOVA revealed that W and P/L were primarily controlled by E, although G and GEI also had significant effects. Among the 8 NPSSs, only RM, RS and TOP statistics were suitable for detecting the genotypes with high stable and bread making quality (e. g. G 1 and G 17). In conclusion, using RM, RS and TOP statistics is advisable to select for dough quality in wheat under multi-environment trials (METs) ...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted {{for four years}} {{to determine the effects}} of organic and conventional systems and fourteen varieties (nine old and five improved) on growth, yield and quality of durum wheat crop. The experiments conducted at two sites (low semi-arid and higher semi-arid) were laid out in a split-plot design with four replicates. Studied parameters included (i) grain yield, (ii) technological and nutritional quality of the whole grain, dry matter, specific weight, proteins, amino acids, mineral content, gluten and <b>baking</b> <b>strength.</b> Results of the agronomic traits indicated that grain yield is on the average lower under organic cultivation compared to conventional methods (2. 32 and 2. 98 t/ha SEM= 0. 18 qx/ha respectively). However, varieties performance under this environment changed in dry year. Data analysis indicated high production potential of some varieties such as Khiar, Ben Bechir and INRAT 69 (2. 47, 2. 46 and 2. 44 t/ha respectively) under organic farming method. INRAT 69 was found stable for grain yield under organic farming with low coefficient of variation (33...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, an Al– 0. 66 Mg– 0. 85 Si– 0. 2 Cu alloy with Zn {{addition}} was investigated by electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD), high resolution electron microscopy (HREM), tensile and Erichsen tests. The mechanical {{properties of the}} alloy after pre-aging met the standards of sheet forming. After paint <b>baking,</b> the yield <b>strength</b> of the alloy was improved apparently. GP(II) zones and ηʹ phases were formed during aging process due to Zn addition. With the precipitation of GP zones, β″ phases, GP(II) zones and ηʹ phases, the alloys displayed excellent mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} in a {{breeding}} program is the selection of strains with different useful characteristics. A few of the specific requirements of a good bakers' yeast generally recognized by commercial producers are: (1) Keeping quality. A good yeast does not autolyze nor lose viability ex-cessively when held in a cake for a few days at room temperature. (2) <b>Baking</b> <b>strength.</b> A good yeast causes dough to rise quickly. (3) High yield. A good yeast transforms the maximum amount of nutrients in the fermentors into yeast in the shortest possible time. Different strains of bakers ' yeast vary in these and other properties. The second step in a breeding program is the intensive inbreeding of each of the chosen strains. Successful inbreeding accomplishes two results: (1) it intensifies the desirable character, (2) it eliminates undesirable recessive genes and makes the breeding stock homozygous for the desirable traits. Some good breeding stocks do not give outward manifestations of their excellence because the inbreeding process which has intensified their vigor in one character may hav...|$|E
40|$|AW- 7 xxx alloys {{have been}} {{nowadays}} considered for greater light weighting potential in automotive industry {{due to its}} higher strength compared to AW- 5 xxx and AW- 6 xxx alloys. However, due to their lower formability the forming processes are still in development. This paper investigates one such forming process called hot stamping. The investigation started by carrying out hot tensile testing of an AW- 7 xxx alloy, that is, AW- 7921 at temperatures between 350 °C and 475 °C, to measure the strength and formability. Formability was found to improve with increasing temperature and was sensitive to the strain rate. Dynamic recovery is considered as usual reason for the formability improvement. However, examining the precipitation states of the as-received condition and after hot stamping using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the dissolution of precipitates was also believed to contribute to this increase in formability. Following solution heat treatment there was no precipitation during cooling across the cooling rates investigated (5 – 10 °C/s). Samples taken from parts hot stamped at 10 and 20 [*]mm[*]s− 1 had similar yield strengths. A 3 -step paint baking heat treatment yielded a higher postpaint <b>baking</b> <b>strength</b> than a single step treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential of different durum wheat varieties that could be adapted for organic farming. In this context, four experimental years studies (2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004) were carried out in order to assess fourteen durum wheat varieties including nine old and five improved varieties conducted under organic and conventional cultivation methods and in two cereal growing locations : Kef "Boulifa" : low semi-arid and Bousalem “El Kodia” : higher semi-arid. Studied parameters included (i) grain yield, (ii) yield stability using coefficient of variation, linear regression coefficient, deviations from regression, ecovalence of Wricke, ecovalence of Shukla, ecovalence of Plaisted and Peterson and superiority index of Lin and Binns, (iii) technological and nutritional quality of the whole grain, dry matter, specific weight, proteins, amino acids, mineral content, gluten, amylasic activity and <b>baking</b> <b>strength.</b> Results of the agronomic traits indicated that grain yield is on the average lower under organic cultivation compared to conventional methods (23. 2 and 29. 8 qx/ha SEM= 0. 18 qx/ha respectively). However, varieties performance under this environment changed in dry year as was the case in 2001. Data analysis indicated high production potential of some varieties such as Khiar, Ben Bechir and INRAT 69 (24. 7, 24. 6 and 24. 4 qx/ha respectively) under organic farming method. INRAT 69 was found stable for grain yield under organic farming with low coefficient of variation (33...|$|E
