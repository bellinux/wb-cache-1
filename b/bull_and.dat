5|$|Sitting <b>Bull</b> <b>and</b> {{his people}} stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due {{to the smaller}} size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting <b>Bull</b> <b>and</b> his men found it {{difficult}} to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{effective}} protocols {{to replicate the}} transmission of C. fetus subsp. venerealis in cattle is critical {{for the evaluation of}} the biology of the organism as well as the host immune response. Â Protocols for experimental infections with C. fetus venerealis in <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> heifers were developed. A total of 6 Brahman <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> 11 Brahman heifers were randomly allocated to four experimental groups containing exposed and unexposed animals. One group of <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> one group of heifers were challenged by experimental exposure by intrapreputial and intracervical inoculation with a C. fetus venerealis suspension respectively. The remaining groups were challenged by natural mating with previously infected animals. Detection of C. fetus venerealis using culture and real-time PCR in smegma samples from <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> cervico-vaginal samples from heifers; and macro and histological examination of tissue samples from the reproductive tracts collected after slaughter were performed. C. fetus venerealis was detected by culture and/or real time PCR in all groups post-challenge. Experimental exposure was more effective in establishing infection in <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> heifers and the infectious status appeared to last longer (up to 10 weeks in <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> 7 weeks in heifers). There was minimal cellular inflammatory response after experimental and natural challenge...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} Zeranol and {{castration}} on organoleptic and mechanically assessed tenderness were studied using the 193 young beef cattle {{described in the}} companion paper (Impact of castration and zeranol implants on bullocks: I. Behavior, growth and carcass traits). Sensory panel evaluations showed that steaks from control and implanted steer carcasses had higher mean scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall palatability than those from control <b>and</b> implanted <b>bulls.</b> Implanting did not influence juiciness or flavor within the bull or steer groups, but control <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers were significantly (P<. 005) more tender and more palatable overall than were implanted <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers. When comparing the mechanical measurements there was considerable variation among the instruments. The Armour tenderometer ranked meat from the implanted steers significantly tougher than either the control or implanted bulls. The Warner-Bratzler shear, Krammer shear and Instron Press ranked steaks from steers significantly more tender than those from <b>bulls.</b> Implanted <b>and</b> control groups of animals were similar in tenderness when judged by the mechanical measurements. Behavior and palatability characteristics of implanted <b>and</b> control <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers were also studied. Implantation made <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers more docile. The libido measurements were also lower for the implanted <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse three {{commercial}} beef categories of the ‘Serrana de Teruel breed’ to define the appropriate commercial option. Twenty ‘Serrana de Teruel’ male calves at 9 months were assigned to the commercial beef categories (young <b>bulls,</b> <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers), slaughtered at 12, 22 and 22 months of age, respectively. The in vivo ultrasound backfat thickness was greater than the dorsal fat thickness, <b>and</b> the young <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers had a similar fat thickness, that was greater than the bulls in both areas. The slaughter weight and cold carcass weight were significantly different between the commercial categories. However, the differences were not sufficient to modify the dressing percentage, carcass conformation and fatness degree between the young <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulls.</b> The maximum stress of the muscle at 7 d of ageing was lower in the steers than in the young <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>bulls.</b> In general, the lightness of the meat in the bulls was lower than that in the young <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers. The subcutaneous fat of the bull carcasses had a vivid colour and stored more carotenoids than that of the young <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> steers. Hence, <b>bulls</b> produced heavier <b>and</b> better conformed carcasses with more edible meat and less fat than the other categories. However, steers are recommended to produce large carcasses with more trim and cover fat than the other categories. Finally, it seems that bulls are the most suitable commercial category to ‘Serrana de Teruel’ breed. © 2016 INIA...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} factors influencing the market production of <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> pigs. For <b>bulls,</b> I focused {{on the influence of}} breed, carcass weight and influence of age. In pigs, I watched the effect of carcass weight (HJUT). I started from the measured data that have been gathered under demolition leaves carcasses of <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> pigs. From these data, I analyzed the impact on bulls breed Holstein cattle, Czech Pied cattle and Holstein crossbreds and Czech Pied cattle. Then I dealt with a market value of pigs <b>and</b> <b>bulls,</b> which I set as the sum of the prices of individual cut-out parts of their carcasses. I assessed the relationship of cutting prices of individual parts of the total sales of carcasses of <b>bulls</b> <b>and</b> pigs.
