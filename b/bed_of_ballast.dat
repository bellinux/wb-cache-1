40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{investigations}} <b>of</b> {{railway track}} <b>beds</b> {{are becoming more}} important nowadays in civil engineering. The manufacturing of representative full-scale scenarios in the laboratory environment {{for the creation of}} databases can be a critical issue. It is difficult to reproduce and monitor the effect of differing physical and performance parameters in the ballast layer as well as to evaluate the combination of these factors in more complex scenarios. In addition, reproducing full-scale tests <b>of</b> railway <b>ballast</b> implies to handle huge amounts of aggregates. To this effect, the use of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation of the ground-penetrating radar signal can represent a powerful tool for creating, extending or validating databases difficult to build up and to monitor at the real scale of investigation. Nevertheless, a realistic three-dimensional simulation of a railway structure requires huge computational efforts. This work focuses on performing simula-tion of the ground-penetrating radar signal within a railway track bed by using a two-dimensional cross-section model <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> layer, generated by a Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) paradigm. Attention was paid on the geometric reconstruction <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> system {{as well as on the}} content of voids between the aggregate particles, which complied with the real-world conditions of compaction for this material.

40|$|The {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway {{is usually}} {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The ballast layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded ballast, using a ballast breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating ballast breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles. In this paper, an attempt is made to utilise the digital imaging technique for gradation analysis and breakage estimation <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> The technique is fast and convenient, and can be applied to both the laboratory and field conditions, hence, can be used successfully to replace the visual inspection <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage...|$|R

40|$|Impact loads {{generated}} because of wheel and rail defects cause accelerated ballast breakage leading to adverse performance <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> rail tracks. In the present study, experimental and numerical investigations {{have been carried}} out to develop an understanding of the performance of shock mats in the attenuation of dynamic impact loads and subsequent mitigation <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> degradation. The investigations include different locations of shock mats considering stiff and weak subgrade conditions. With the provision of shock mats, the magnitude of impact forces decreases, and the time duration of impact ges prolonged. In the case of stiff subgrade, the efficiency of the shock mat in reducing the impact forces is greater when it is located at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> rather than at the top, whereas the reverse is true for weak subgrade. However, the provision of shock mats both at the top and bottom <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> <b>bed,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the subgrade condition, is the best solution for minimising the impact force.

40|$|Mainly {{due to the}} Sydney Olympics, the State Railway Authority of New South Wales {{has been}} under {{considerable}} pressure to improve the current track conditions to meet the dramatically increased demand for rail transport. Rail track upgrading should cater for high speed trains with heavier carriages, and increased traffic frequency. Consequently, increased degradation and settlement <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> foundations are anticipated, together with higher maintenance costs. In order to minimise maintenance costs, {{a thorough understanding of}} the strength-deformation properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> under static and dynamic loading is essential. Due to the relatively larger size <b>of</b> <b>ballast,</b> conventional laboratory tests often give misleading stress-strain results and failure loads (Indraratna et al., 1998). To overcome the size effects, it is imperative to characterise coarse aggregates by conducting tests using proportionately larger geotechnical equipment. This paper describes the strength-deformation and degradation aspects <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> (latite basalt) in large-scale triaxial equipment. The large cylindrical triaxial apparatus (specimen size 300 mm diameter x 600 mm high) was used to test specimens under fully drained compression (static loading) at low confining pressures (10 - 200 kPa) that are typical <b>of</b> a conventional <b>ballast</b> <b>bed.</b> The influence <b>of</b> confining pressure and initial porosity (compaction) on the ultimate shear strength, angle of internal friction, dilation rate and degree of particle degradation is studied in detail.
