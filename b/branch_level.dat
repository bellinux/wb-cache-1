In the initial days of Lijjat, the profits of the first six months were shared equally among all sisters in the form of gold.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are to investigate empirically the impact of electric power on Togo’s aggregate and economic <b>branch</b> <b>levels</b> (primary, secondary, tertiary) production growth, with a model that relies on a neoclassical production function and to test the causality between that electric power {{and the growth of}} aggregate production and economic <b>branch</b> <b>levels.</b> The empirical methodology is based on the (ARMA) maximum likelihood and Granger causality tests. The obtained results indicate that the impact of electricity consumption on Togo’s aggregate and economic <b>branch</b> <b>levels</b> (secondary, tertiary) production in the long-run is positive and significant. The results show also a significant existence of circular causality between electricity consumption and aggregate production growth, while that the causality goes from electricity consumption to the agricultural, services sectors, and from industrial sector to electricity consumption according to Granger. Cet article à pour objectifs d'examiner empiriquement l'impact de l'énergie électrique sur la croissance économique globale et sectorielle (agriculture, industrie, service) au Togo ainsi que l'existence d'une relation de causalité entre l'énergie électrique et la croissance économique globale et sectorielle à partir d'une fonction de production de type néoclassique augmentée, par l'estimateur du maximum de vraisemblance (ARMA) et du test de causalité de Granger. Les résultats indiquent l'existence de corrélations positives significatives entre la consommation d'électricité et la croissance économique globale et sectorielle (secondaire et tertiaire) à long terme. Les résultats du test de causalité de Granger montrent qu'à long terme, il existe une causalité bidirectionnelle entre la consommation d'électricité et la croissance économique globale, une causalité unidirectionnelle de la consommation d'électricité vers l'agriculture et les services, et de l'industrie vers la consommation d'électricité.

The <b>branching</b> <b>level</b> of the deep branch of the SoA was cephalad to that of the StA on six of nine sides. The deep branch of the SoA diverged shortly after emerging from the supraorbital foramen or notch.

From a practical standpoint, dissection of this pericranial flap below the level of the supraorbital ridge is not advised, and preservation of both feeding arteries is encouraged in order to establish abundant vascularity for this flap...|$|R
