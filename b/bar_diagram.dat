40|$|Teachers of {{mathematics}} often use diagrams to explain concepts related to quantity. Students {{of mathematics}} often have difficulty, however, understanding how the diagrams represent the intended concepts (Uttal, Liu, & DeLoache, 2006). This {{is consistent with}} the research on students’ difficulties with mathematical symbols and notation (Hiebert, 1992), and previous studies have demonstrated that teachers need to make the connections between symbols and their conceptual referents explicit (Osana & Pitsolantis, 2013). This study examined the impact of instruction that explicitly teaches preservice teachers the conceptual meaning of a mathematical symbol called the “bar diagram. ” Fifty undergraduate students (N = 50) were assigned to one of three conditions: <b>Bar</b> <b>Diagram</b> with Links (BDL), <b>Bar</b> <b>Diagram</b> with No Links (BDNL), or Comparison. The students in the BDL condition were explicitly shown, with the use of concrete materials, that Bar Diagrams are mathematical symbols used to represent quantity and relations among quantities. The BDNL condition was exposed to the <b>Bar</b> <b>Diagram</b> symbol without any explicit connection to referents. Students in the third condition served as a comparison group. Objectives of this study were to determine whether it is critical to make explicit connections to the conceptual meaning of a mathematical symbol prior to appropriately applying the symbol to (a) solve word problems presented using text in a story format, (b) view the bar diagrams as pictures that represent quantities for the purpose of solving problems, (c) understand the quantitative meaning of bar diagrams, and (d) use algebraic symbols to solve analogous problems. ...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose - Most of the {{proposed}} decision aid methods provide the user only with a prescriptive approach (quantitative analysis) without any descriptive approach (qualitative analysis). It is therefore not possible to justify and recommend ways of improvement. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce visualization techniques to complement prescriptive approaches. Design/methodology/approach - Visual techniques have been developed for the FlowSort sorting method, namely the FS-GAIA and stacked <b>bar</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Findings - It is found that with visual techniques, fine details can be captured, e. g. detection of incomparability (with FS-GAIA) and the composition of a score (with stacked <b>bar</b> <b>diagrams).</b> Research limitations/implications - In the future, it is expected that other multi-criteria decision methods will be complemented by prescriptive approaches. Practical implications - A real case study is introduced in order to illustrate the practicality of the visual techniques. In this paper, the innovation performances of small and medium enterprises from the French Lorraine region are assessed.

Nowadays banks have started increasing their business to securities and insurance and other sectors by adding new range of products. Bancassurance, one such concept, has gained recognition in the recent years. The growth of bancassurance depends on how well banks and insurance companies are able to conquer the operational challenges that are frequently thrown at them. Banks aims at a comprehensive Bancassurance Management with Core Banking platform ie; ease of premium payments using Auto Debit Cards, Net Banking, collection agencies etc. The present empirical based {{study was conducted with}} an objective to examine the recent trends of bancussurance and to analyse the marketing and distribution channel of insurance, its impact on insurers, customers and banking sector and also to examine the issues and problems of bancussurance.

Each participant was presented with 25 profiles. Each profile contained <b>bar</b> <b>diagrams</b> depicting differential magnitudes of harmony factors. The magnitude of each factor was systematically varied across profiles. Each participant was asked to examine a profile and indicate the extent of harmony experienced on a 20 -point scale. This procedure was repeated for conflict factors. Child-related support emerged as the most significantfactor. Emotional supportfrom spouse and clarity ofdivision of duties were moderately significant. Temperamental differences betweenpartners was a significant conflict-inducing criterion. Family demands and work obligations were significant for females only. Apart from generating relevant dimensions for the study of work-family linkages, the study also offered a possible framework of deriving indigenous parameters {{with the help of the}} lens model.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the common etiological pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in our hospital and sensitivity patterns to the common antibiotics used. Materials and Methods: This study was undertaken in a 750 bedded multi-specialty referral hospital in Kerala catering to both urban and semi-urban populations. It is a prospective study of patients who attended the medical out-patient department and those admitted with a clinical diagnosis of CAP, during the year 2009. Data were collected based on detailed patient interview, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. The latter included sputum culture and sensitivity pattern. These were tabulated and percentage incidence of etiological pathogens calculated. The antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was also classified by percentage and expressed as <b>bar</b> <b>diagram.</b> Results: The study showed Streptococcus pneumoniae to be the most common etiological agent for CAP, in our hospital setting. The other organisms isolated in order of frequency were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alpha hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, Beta hemolytic streptococci and atypical coli. S. pneumoniae was most sensitive to linezolid, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin), cloxacillin and ceftriaxone. Overall, the common pathogens causing CAP showed highest sensitivity to amikacin, followed by ofloxacin, gentamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin), ceftriaxone and linezolid. The least sensitivity rates were shown to amoxicillin and cefoperazone. Conclusion: In a hospital setting, empirical management for cases of CAP is not advisable.

The income and expenditure of middle income group people were found to reduce. Low income group people increased their income and expenditure was decreased. After SIDR due to decrease their average income, they could not manage their basic needs. The food habit of the affected people was also changed. They took more flour rather than rice. The scarcity of agricultural production created the reduction of food stock. Most of the respondents had no food stock. The rate of internal migration was also increased. The rate of migration to other places (47 %) and Dhaka (53 %) was increased due to SIDR. But the situation was better than close post SIDR period.
