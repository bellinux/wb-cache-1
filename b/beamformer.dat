25|$|Understanding {{the channel}} allows for {{manipulation}} of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam. To correctly form a beam, the transmitter needs to understand {{the characteristics of the}} channel. This process is called channel sounding or channel estimation. A known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment. The mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter. The transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device. This is called a closed-loop MIMO system. For beamforming, it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter. In a <b>beamformer</b> optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing, each antenna element simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols.|$|E

2500|$|Active sonar {{creates a}} pulse of sound, often called a [...] "ping", and then listens for {{reflections}} (echo) of the pulse.

A <b>beamformer</b> is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. (1) chemically using explosives, or (2) airguns or (3) plasma sound sources.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} using an antenna array {{to improve the}} {{performance}} of the forward (base station to mobile) link in cellular mobile telecommunications systems is described. Previous methods usually involve either beamforming (forming narrow radiation patterns {{in the direction of the}} mobile) or spatial diversity (exploiting uncorrelated channels realized by placing antennas far apart in a fading environment). However, neither strategy is effective in all channel conditions; for example, beamforming is ineffective in conditions with large angle spread, whereas spatial diversity is ineffective in conditions with low angle spread. In the method proposed here, one switches periodically between two <b>beamformers.</b> The <b>beamformers</b> are selected so as to improve signal power delivered to the mobile to the extent possible, while maintaining low correlation between the channels associated with the two <b>beamformers</b> as perceived by the mobile.
