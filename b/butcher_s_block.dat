Microstructural characterization indicated that the GB 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>blocking</b> effect was an intrinsic effect. Further microanalysis shows that the GB region is rich in La and poor in Si in comparing with the grain interior (GI). Our discussion suggested that the chemical variation from GI to GB, on the one hand, could degrade the GB region 2 ̆ 7 s conductivity; on the other hand, it introduced a strong space-charge effect at GBs.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to describe cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions associated with writing among doctorally-prepared nurses, to determine relationships between writing dimensions and journal article publication, and to compare salient dimensions between low and high-producing groups. From a sample of 500 persons listed in either the American Nurses 2 ̆ 7 Association Directory of Nurses with Doctoral Degrees (1984) or the Sigma Theta Tau Directory of Nurse Researchers (1983), 343 usable questionnaires were returned. The 18 independent variables were categorized as follows: (1) cognitive (writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>block,</b> premature editing), (2) affective (writing apprehension), (3) behavioral (writing in seclusion, setting writing goals and rewards for meeting them, writing regularly regardless of mood or inspiration, writing for a particular audience, using a word processor, selecting competent coauthors, using published articles as examples, revising manuscripts multiple times, and having colleagues review manuscripts). The two dependent variables were research and nonresearch articles published in refereed journals in the past three years. ^ Respondents reported a mean of 2. 34 research and 2. 25 nonresearch articles published in the preceding three years. Low scores were obtained for writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>block,</b> premature editing, and writing apprehension. Behavioral dimensions performed most often included multiple revisions of manuscripts, writing for a specific audience and obtaining feedback from colleagues. The mean number of hours spent writing per week was 3. 2. ^ Forward inclusion multiple regressions analysis showed that five variables accounted for 18 {{percent of the variance in}} research article productivity: time spent writing, a low level of writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>block,</b> not awaiting inspiration, not using writing references, and obtaining feedback from colleagues. Four variables accounted for 12. 9 percent of the variance in nonresearch article productivity: time, a low level of writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>block</b> and writing apprehension, and not writing according to a schedule. The highest producers reported lower levels of writer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>block</b> and writing apprehension, spent more time writing, awaited inspiration less, and wrote according to a schedule more than the nonproducers. ...|$|R
40|$|Phosphatases in serum {{and organs}} (the liver, adrenal gland, spleen, kidney, jejunum and the bone marrow) were {{estimated}} biochemically after subcutaneous injection of CCl(4), ligation of the choledochus and R. E. <b>S.</b> <b>blocking</b> by India ink, obtaing following results. 1) Following injection of CCl(4) the phosphatases in serum were increased temporarily and later decreased markedly, but alkali phosphatase became {{below the level}} of which before injection. Also in the rabbits ligated the choledochus those, especially alkali phosphatase, were remarkably increased, and decreased in R. E. <b>S.</b> <b>blocking.</b> 2) After injection of CCl(4) alkali phosphatse was decreased in the liver with no changes in the acid phosphatase, and no changes were observed in the liver after ligation of the choledohhus. 3) From the facts obtained in 1) and 2), it is concluded that phosphatases (at least alkali phosphatase) were produced in the liver. 4) In the R. E. <b>S.</b> <b>blocking</b> alkali phosphatase was remarkably decreased in the liver, spleen and the bone marrow. This indicates that the R. E. S. plays an important role on the phosphatase, in cooporation with decrease of acid and alkali-phosphatase in the serum. 5) Phosphatases in the adrenal gland have shown no changes by those procedures. 6) Phosphatases in the kidney were not changed by those procedures, with only exception of decrease in alkali phosphatase after ligation of the choledochus. 7) Alkali phosphatase in the jejunum was decreasd after injection of CCl(4) or ligation of the choledochus, and increased after R. E. <b>S.</b> <b>blocking.</b> 8) The spleen is related to the storage of phosphatase and has a regulation effect. 9) Acid phosphatase in the bone marrow was tended to increase after injection of CCl(4) or ligation of the choledochus, and alkali phosphatase was decreased after blocking of R.
