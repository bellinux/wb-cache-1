The 238 patients were grouped by Sokal's risk at diagnosis in low- (LR), intermediate- (IR) and high-risk (HR), and by CP treatment. Group 1 : 160 patients (57 % LR, 31 % IR, 12 % HR) given IFN alone in early CP. Group 2 : 31 patients (65 % LR, 32 % IR, 3 % HR) given IFN alone in late CP. Group 3 : 23 patients (78 % LR, 22 % IR) given IFN {{before and after}} autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Group 4 : 24 patients (83 % LR, 17 % IR) given IFN after ASCT. Of the 72 BC, 52 (72 %) were myeloid (My), and 20 (28 %) lymphoid (Ly). Overall BC incidence was similar in all CP treatment groups, although with a prevalence of Ly BC in groups 3 + 4 vs groups 1 + 2, (p = NS); the incidence of BC was higher in HR patients (P = NS), {{but on the whole}} it was lower than expected on the basis of historical controls. Lymphoid BC was more frequent in LR than in IR + HR patients (P < 0. 05), and was more frequent in responders to IFN, than in non-responders (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: Chronic {{myelogenous leukemia}} (CML) is a clonal stem cell disease and is {{consistently}} {{associated with the}} BCR-ABL fusion gene. The chronic phase of the disease tends to pass into an accelerated phase and eventually leads to acute leukemia if left untreated. Oncoproteins necessary for leukemic transformation are both fundamentally and clinically relevant to identify as they might be new molecular targets {{for the development of}} specific anti-leukemic drugs. This study is an initial step to define the proportion of HOXA 9 gene expression in some Egyptians with chronic-phase CML at diagnosis and to evaluate its relation with BCR-ABL expression and its clinical significance. Materials and Methods: Sixty-two newly diagnosed CML patients (56 in chronic phase, 1 in accelerated phase, and 5 in <b>blastic</b> <b>crises)</b> were enrolled in the study. HOXA 9 and BCR-ABL gene expressions were detected by one-step RT-PCR. ABL was chosen as a control gene to calculate HOXA 9 /ABL and BCR-ABL/ABL ratios from densitometric values of PCR product intensities. Results: HOXA 9 expression was encountered in 25 / 56 (44. 6 %) of newly diagnosed CML patients in the chronic phase. The median expression was 0. 31 (range: 0. 08 - 1. 37) in relation to the ABL gene, with a higher frequency of expression in CML patients presenting with splenomegaly (p< 0. 001), high Sokal score (p< 0. 001), and BCR-ABL expression from the first round (p= 0. 004). No association could be detected with other clinical parameters, overall survival, or disease-free survival.

40|$|By {{using an}} {{indirect}} immunofluorescence technique, {{the distribution of}} poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in human blood cells was investigated. The antibody used was reactive with poly(ADP-ribose) larger than trimers. The specific immunofluorescence of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized in situ from NAD+ was observed in nuclei of lymphocytes and monocytes in normal peripheral blood. No immunofluorescence, however, was detected in granulocytes and erythrocytes. In agreement with this finding, no incorporation of radioactivity from [adenine- 14 C]NAD+ into acid-insoluble material was detectable in nuclei isolated from granulocytes. In normal bone marrow, the immunofluorescence of poly(ADP-ribose) was not observed in myelocytes or in their descendants but was observed in nuclei of lymphocytes and erythroblasts. Myelocytes and mature granulocytes in peripheral blood {{as well as in}} bone marrow of patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia were totally negative in the polymer-specific immunofluorescence.

40|$|The t(3; 21) (q 26;q 22) translocation, {{which is}} one of the {{consistent}} chromosomal abnormalities found in <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), is thought to play an important role in the leukemic progression of CML to an acute <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> phase. The AML 1 gene, which is located at the translocation breakpoint of the t(8; 21) (q 22;q 22) translocation found in acute myelocytic leukemia, was also rearranged by the t(3; 21) (q 26;q 22) translocation. Screening of a cDNA library of the t(3; 21) -carrying leukemic cell line cells (SKH 1) resulted in the isolation of two potentially complete AML 1 -EVI- 1 chimeric cDNAs of 6 kb. Two species of AML 1 -EVI- 1 fusion transcripts of 8. 2 and 7. 0 kb were detected in SKH 1 cells. These cells expressed the 180 kDa AML 1 -EVI- 1 fusion protein containing an N-terminal half of AML 1 including a runt homology domain which is fused to the entire zinc finger EVI- 1 protein. The AML 1 -EVI- 1 fusion transcript was consistent in all three cases of the t(3; 21) -carrying leukemia examined by RNA-based PCR. These findings strongly suggest that the t(3; 21) translocation results in the formation of a new class of chimeric transcription factor which could contribute to the leukemic progression of CML through interference with cell growth and differentiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the massive hyperplasia and for the <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> in chronic myelocytic leukemia are poorly understood. The most generally accepted hypothesis proposes that this progression {{is due to the}} development of genetic instability in the leukemic cells. In particular, the two phases of the disease are believed to reflect different, discrete genetic events. Such events remain undefined as yet, and the causal significance of observed genetic aberrations is not clear. An alternative hypothesis is presented here. It is assumed that the feedback interactions adjust the relative probabilities of maturation and replication of the 'committed' as well as the pluripotent cells, and further that mitotic cells at all stages possess considerable phenotypic adaptability; in particular their self-renewal capacity can vary in response to changes in the cellular composition of the tissue even within a conventionally defined compartment. On this basis, it is shown that chronic leukemia can arise and evolve into the <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> from a progressive decline in a single clonal characteristic [...] inducibility to maturation. It is shown, with the help of mathematical considerations, how an initial hereditable event in an early hemopoietic cell can cause a disturbance of the tissue which feeds back onto the individual members of the clone, resulting in a cascade of dynamic changes which can lead to blast cell dominance...|$|E

40|$|JunB is a {{component}} of the Jun family genes of the activating protein- 1 transcrip-tion factors that are important in the con-trol of cell growth and differentiation and neoplastic transformation. Recently, it was demonstrated that transgenic mice spe-cifically lacking JunB expression in the myeloid lineage developed a myeloprolif-erative disease, eventually progressing to blast crisis that resembled human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To gain further insights into the role of JunB in human CML, we examined peripheral blood from 17 healthy individuals and CML patients (11 in <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> and 21 in chronic phase) by real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis for the expression of JunB. The results showed the expression levels of JunB were significantly impaired in CML cases (<b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> < chronic phase < normal). Mutational analysis of the whole gene and methylation analysis of cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) sites at the promoter area were further performed to investigate the possible mechanisms. However, no mutation was found within the coding region or the 9 flanking evolutionarily conserved regions in all CML cases. Interestingly, in the promoter area of JunB gene, most of the CpG sites were methylated in CML cases; in contrast, none of these CpG sites were methylated in normal cases. Demethyl-ation by treatment of hypermethylated K 562 cells with 5 -aza- 2 -deoxycytidine resulted in partial reactivation of JunB ex-pression. Our results suggest that the down-regulated JunB expression in CML was due to the inactivation of JunB gene by methyl-ation and the differential expression was correlated to the ratio of cells being methyl-ated.

40|$|Abstract: Background: For many years, {{conventional}} karyotyping {{has been}} used as the golden diagnostic tool for t (9; 22) (BCR/ABL) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Recently, there have been an emerging generation of complex translocations and submicroscopic deletions involving BCR & ABL genes in addition to the classic t(9; 22), which have a prognostic impact on the course of the disease, and require sensitive and specific molecular techniques for their detection. Objective: The present study aimed to explore the utility of extra signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (ES-FISH) compared to double fusion FISH(DF-FISH) and conventional karyotyping (CK); for detecting the incidence of typical and atypical patterns of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements and clarify their prognostic significance in CML. Subject and Methods: A series of 64 consecutive BCR/ABL + Egyptian CML patients (42 chronic phase, 9 accelerated phase, 13 blastic crisis),were investigated for typical and atypical BCR/ABL rearrangements using extra signal and double fusion FISH probes. Results: ES-FISH and DF-FISH showed higher sensitivity for detection of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) as a sole anomaly when compared to karyotyping in all phases of CML. ES-FISH was the most sensitive method for detection of ABL deletion (14. 2 % in chronic phase, 33. 3 % in accelerated phase, 30. 8 % in <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis)</b> when compared to DF-FISH and karyotyping.

40|$|The nonrandomness of {{chromosome}} clonal {{evolution in}} <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> of chronic myeloid leukemia is well established, with three major changes [+ 8, +Ph, i(17 q) ] occurring {{alone or in}} combination in over 70 % of the patients. The chromosome changes observed in different tissues may reveal {{the origin of the}} abnormal clones, as well as provide evidence for distinct or common evolution by different cell populations. The significance of the chromosome abnormalities and their relationship to blastic conversion are discussed. In general, chromosome evolution may be considered a rather reliable predictive or diagnostic parameter of <b>blastic</b> <b>crisis</b> but both the nature and the subsequent behavior of abnormal clones appear to be of critical value. As to the clinical/chromosome correlations, a few major points have emerged: a) the i(17 q) aberration is mostly associated with signs of myeloid differentiation of blasts and a marked basophilia; it is mainly observed in the late stage of the disease, but overall median survival of patients with this marker is usually long; b) more atypical or complex changes usually are associated with a worse prognosis; c) patients with only a Ph in their blasts may have a longer survival, at least in some cytologic subgroups; and d) the loss of the Y chromosome seems to protect the cell against further clonal evolution. Finally, the relevance of the chromosome changes in the multistage process of blastic conversion is discussed, and the breakpoints of secondary changes recorded so far are reviewed and examined. It appears that certain chromosome regions are more often affected; these might contain genes of critical importance for the final malignant progression.
