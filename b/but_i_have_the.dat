5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E
500|$|In {{defending}} himself {{from what he}} believed was the elitism of his online critics, Idol admitted {{that he was still}} learning about computers, but compared it to the early punk ethic of simply trying your best as a musician, even if you had difficulty. He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer. [...] "I don't know much about computers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> desire to learn and I have a computer and a modem, so I go for it. Banging my head sometimes, but continuing on." ...|$|E
500|$|Haywood seemed most {{comfortable}} with a philosophy arrived at through the hard-scrabble experiences of the workers. He {{had the ability to}} translate complex economic theories into simple ideas that resonated with working people. He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, [...] "If one man has a dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn't get." [...] While Haywood respected the work of Marx, he referred to it with irreverent humor. Acknowledging his scars from dangerous mining work, and from numerous fistfights with police and militia, he liked to say, [...] "I've never read Marx's Capital, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> marks of capital all over me." ...|$|E
60|$|Clara {{sought to}} rush forward and pull {{him from the}} place of danger; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pardonable {{selfishness}} to hold her back by force.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what proof <b>have</b> <b>I?</b> Was {{that what}} {{you were going to}} say? None. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{information}} from the man himself. He told me in the train that night going to London.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame la Duchesse permits me {{to remind}} her of my existence," [...] he said, bowing low. [...] "It is some years since we met, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honour of a dance at the Palace in Madrid." ...|$|R
500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ‘that — ... that's... the flower’. You {{know that}} Jeannin has the peony, Quost has the hollyhock, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> sunflower, in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 2007, {{there have}} been no further Birtles Shorrock Goble shows. [...] While there has never been an {{official}} announcement of Birtles Shorrock Goble disbanding, when asked in 2010 if they would perform again, Shorrock replied [...] "No... The door is locked, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> key... I don't feel the need to go back and be married to those guys again. We had a stormy marriage [...] a great marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no taste at all; not the slightest. I cannot tell {{good from}} bad. There never {{was such a}} {{complete}} Philistine. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> best man in London down, and another fellow from Vienna. They fixed it up between them." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got <b>the</b> blues to day.|$|R
60|$|All {{this may}} seem wild or witless when spoken by a lad of fifteen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> will and {{determination}} {{of a man who}} had grown grey-headed, and knew that I lacked not the courage once my anger had been aroused.|$|R
2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking myself out of the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally outside of him, looking in. I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|E
60|$|Limb. Before George, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{spirit of}} a lion, and I will tear her limb from limb--if I could believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... "All conditions. Perhaps I can't {{explain it}} properly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{prospectus}} of it indoors if you'd {{like to see}} it. We take up Society." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was shorter}} and I suppose {{a couple of}} years younger than he, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> improvised club in my pocket gripped ready, and <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> fought with him very cheerfully. But he fell a step {{backward}} as I came toward him.|$|R
60|$|At last a {{policeman}} came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people on shore for help. The judge fined me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> advantage of him. My money {{was with my}} pantaloons, and my pantaloons were with the Indians.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Carvel, if you please," [...] I replied. I {{felt the}} demon within me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> sense {{to realize that}} a quarrel with Dr. Courtenay, under the circumstances, would be far from wise. He had no {{intention}} of quarrelling, however. He made me a grand bow.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{should have}} thought. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{information}} from a Major Mallard whom I found in Port Royal, apparently governing in this fool's absence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} say that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> misfortune to be a rather idle man, and in Europe the burden of idleness is less heavy than here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a tailoress," [...] she replied. [...] "It {{is horrible}} work, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{good fortune to}} be quick. I can make a living--there are many who cannot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} as wild {{to know what it}} was the brig was resting on as <b>the</b> stock-broker was; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{advantage}} of him, for I believed that I could find out, and, at any rate, I determined to try. Did you ever hear of a water-glass, miss?" ...|$|R
50|$|I'd like to {{run away}} with her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> nerve.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly he {{sent the}} fellow to Newgate for that assault, and his master gave bail, and so we came away; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{satisfaction}} of seeing the mob wait upon them both, as they came out, hallooing and throwing stones and dirt at the coaches they rode in; and so I came home to my governess.|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means! You {{are free}} to come and go, and see whom you please. I have no power to control your actions. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> power to control theirs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you had but {{seen the}} {{quantity}} of pineapples that boy Dormer Stanhope devoured at our fête champêtre! <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> comfort of knowing that they made him very ill; eh! Dr. Sly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay" [...] said he, [...] "if {{they got}} hands on me, {{it would be}} a short shrift and a lang tow for Alan! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> King of France's {{commission}} in my pocket, which would aye be some protection." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> never {{yet been}} a godfather, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{belief that it}} brought grave responsibilities, which in the very casual and impermanent {{circumstances}} I did not see how I was to meet. Yet how to refuse without wounding these kind people who had so honored me I did not know until a sudden inspiration came to my rescue.|$|R
60|$|To {{my great}} surprise, the duke saluted me quite civilly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> feeling of facing a treacherous bull which would gore {{me as soon}} as ever my back was turned. He was always putting me in mind of a bull, with his short neck and heavy, hunched shoulders,--and with the ugly tinge of red in the whites of his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Hip. Yes, we may; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{experience}} of it: It will be but half flesh, half iron.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cherish hope, not anxiety. Certain {{ideas have}} become too fixed in your mind. It may be presumptuous to say it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{impression}} {{that there is}} something wrong in your notions of the best means of attaining happiness, as there is in----" [...] Second hesitation.|$|E
60|$|But I {{shall not}} understand-- Being set on some later love, Shall not know her for whom I strove, Till she reach me forth her hand, Saying, 'Who <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right?' And {{out of a}} troubled night Shall draw me safe to the land.|$|E
6000|$|... "What puzzles {{me about}} her," [...] Bathurst said, [...] "is that I {{seemed to know}} her face. Where I saw her, and under what circumstances, I have been puzzling myself half the evening to recall, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> strongest {{conviction}} that I have met her." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, she {{was arrested}} and jailed for {{speaking}} against the Emergency Measures. By the late 1930s she felt conscious {{of the need to}} give way to indigenous Indian feminists: I longed to be in <b>the</b> struggle, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> feeling that direct participation by me was no longer required, or even desired by the leaders of India womanhood who were now coming to the front.|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably not," [...] {{said the}} crab. [...] "It's {{no place for}} me, anyhow, for I belong in the Constellations, you know, with Taurus and Gemini and <b>the</b> other fellows. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> misfortune to tumble out of the Zodiac some time ago. My name is Cancer, but I'm not a disease. Those who examine the heavens in these days, alas! can find no Cancer there." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{other options}} as well. Professionally, it's an {{experience}} that can only do me good. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance to sign for three years with AG2R-La Mondiale <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> feeling that <b>I</b> wasn't going to develop enough. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always raced in France and, in my heart, some experience abroad has excited me for some time. I therefore {{decided to take the}} step and Patrick Lefévère's advances completely persuaded me.|$|R
