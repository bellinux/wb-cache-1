The Ramanathaswamy Temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, is located at the centre of the town and is closely associated with Rama. The temple, along with the town, is considered a holy pilgrimage site for both Shaivas and Vaishnavas.|$|E

5|$|The 1964 Lexington <b>Bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River was {{replaced}} by a new bridge, built from 2001 to 2004, due to deterioration of the old structure including cracks in steel beams.

5|$|The Rock Island Railroad {{built the}} first {{railroad}} <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River in 1856. It connected Davenport to Rock Island, Illinois. This railway connection resulted in significant improvements to transportation and commerce with Chicago, a booming 19th-century city. The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City, and the acquisition of other lines by the Rock Island Railroad, resulted in Davenport becoming a commercial railroad hub.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} route connecting Laurel and Fort Meade was MD 216. That highway {{was built}} between 1934 and 1939 along a course generally north of modern MD 198. Modern MD 198 was constructed as MD 602 {{as a military}} access project during World War II. The first segment of the new highway, from US 1 to MD 216 near Brock Bridge Road {{in what is now}} Maryland City, was started in 1943 and completed in 1944. This segment included a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) in Laurel and a <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Patuxent River. The remainder of MD 602, from near Brock Bridge Road to the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River, was completed by 1946. When MD 602 was completed, MD 216 was truncated at US 1.|$|E
5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E

5|$|A new Methodist {{church was}} built in the {{community}} in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing. Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden trestle part of the railroad <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Willamette caught fire and burned. Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what was then the Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received {{an improvement in}} 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E

5|$|In Lake Worth, 600homes were {{destroyed}} and 1,500other dwellings were damaged, leaving about 700people homeless. Approximately 50businesses were wrecked and 200others received damage â€“ roughly 75% of {{buildings in the}} business district. Several additional buildings were demolished, including city hall, St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Church. The Oakley Theater was nearly destroyed, with the roof and walls crushed. Other severely damaged buildings included the Masonic Temple, a hotel, and the auditorium of Lake Worth Community High School. The <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Intracoastal Waterway collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Members of Task Force Manchu {{who escaped}} from Hill 209 brought back {{considerable}} intelligence information of North Korean {{activity in the}} vicinity of the Paekchin ferry crossing site. At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge. A short distance downstream, each night they placed a pontoon <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.|$|E

5|$|Operation Fustain, the division's second {{mission in}} Sicily, {{was carried out}} by the 1st Parachute Brigade. Their {{objective}} was the Primosole <b>Bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Simeto River. The intention was for the parachute brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land {{on both sides of the}} river. While one battalion seized the bridge, the other two battalions would establish defensive positions to the north and south. They would then hold the bridge until relieved by the advance of XIII Corps, part of the Eighth Army which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the site}} of mudflats which {{restricted}} river navigation, the Colony Government constructed a causeway and <b>bridge</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> site. The project was first planned in 1834 and opened in 1843. When floods in 1862 almost destroyed it, the structure was rebuilt using convict labour, and raised to better withstand future floods. Governor John Hampton officially opened the new Causeway on 12 November 1867. Over the following decades, the three bridges making up this second Causeway were widened several times, and they were eventually replaced in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Past NY182, I-190 {{turns to}} the northwest, {{skirting}} the northeastern edge of Niagara Falls and roughly paralleling NY265 to the east. In Lewiston, the expressway meets NY31 at exit24 southwest of the large Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant reservoir. I-190 continues onward, crossing the canal between the reservoir and the power plant on a small dam also used by NY265. The freeway then interchanges with NY265, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and NY104 at the expansive exit25 before curving {{to the west and}} terminating at the approach to the Lewistonâ€“Queenston <b>Bridge.</b> <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> bridge in Queenston, Ontario, the roadway becomes Highway405.|$|E
