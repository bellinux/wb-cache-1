5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could be traced <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> an originating single point, scientists have built on {{his idea of}} cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but {{a wide range of}} empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
