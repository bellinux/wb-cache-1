40|$|The {{relationship}} between the total flavans (<b>biflavan,</b> catechin, epicatechin and oligomer flavans) and the graft-take in walnut was studied. Total flavans were determined by thin layer chromatography in the phloem tissues of annual shoots. Content of total flavans and percentage graft-take were recorded from November 1997 to October 1998. Following chip-budding, grafted plants were exposed to controlled conditions for one month. The total flavan contents ranged from 10. 8 mg g− 1 in March to 14. 1 mg g− 1 in May. Graft-take percentages varied from 32 % in June to 100 % in February. A negative correlation (r = − 0. 618) was found between total flavan content and graft-take. Other flavans (<b>biflavan,</b> epicatechin and oligomer flavans) in the upper, middle and lower portions of the graft union were also detected in phloem tissues sampled 15 days, 30 days, 45 days and 60 days after grafting. Flavans increased below the union and decreased in the upper portion. The results suggested that graft-take in walnut might also {{be affected by the}} flavan content of annual shoots...|$|E

Its fruits can be processed into jam and the leaves can be used for making tea. In the work reported herein a new <b>biflavan,</b> (M),(2 S),(2 ''S) -,(P),(2 S),(2 ''S) - 7, 8, 3 ', 4 ', 5 ', 7 '', 8 '', 3 ''', 4 ''', 5 '''-decamethoxy- 5, 5 '' <b>biflavan</b> (1), a new flavone, 4 '-hydroxy- 7, 8, 3 ', 5 '-tetramethoxyflavone (2), and a new dihydrochalcone, (R) - 2 ',β-dihydroxy- 3 ', 4 '-dimethoxydihydrochalcone (3), have been isolated from the stem wood of M. calabura, together with 12 known compounds (4 – 15). The structures of these new compounds were elucidated by the interpretations of extensive spectroscopic data. Among the isolated compounds, 5 -hydroxy- 7 -methoxyflavone (5), quercetin (6), and (2 S) - 7 -hydroxyflavanone (10) exhibited potent inhibition of fMLP-induced superoxide anion generation by human neutrophils, with IC 50 values of 1. 77 ± 0. 70, 3. 82 ± 0. 46, and 4. 92 ± 1. 71 μM, respectively...|$|E
