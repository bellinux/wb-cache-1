5|$|The Rosewood {{massacre}} was {{a racially}} motivated massacre of <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> {{destruction of a}} black town that {{took place during the}} first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida. At least six <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> two white people were killed, though eyewitness accounts suggested a death toll as high as 150. The town of Rosewood was abandoned and destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States, reflecting the nation's rapid social changes. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black males in the years before the massacre, including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E

5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of <b>Black</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
5|$|When Constantine {{returned}} to Trinidad in late 1954, {{he found a}} growing desire for independence from Britain. At Trinidad Leaseholds he felt isolated from other, mainly white, senior staff; this drew him towards political involvement. Eric Williams, leader of the newly founded People's National Movement (PNM), was aware of Constantine's popular appeal and recruited him. By January 1956 Constantine, with the full co-operation and blessing of his employers, was party chairman {{and a member of}} its executive committee. Feeling that the PNM's policies were in harmony with his views on improving the lives of <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> encouraged by his wife, Constantine stood for election in the parliamentary constituency of Tunapuna in 1956. He won a narrow victory, which his colleagues believed few in the party could have done, and resigned from Trinidad Leaseholds. The PNM formed a government, in which Constantine became the Minister of Communications, Works and Utilities.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although {{attempts have been made}} to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{acceptance}} that a society may show towards an inheritance rule can also vary.

When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> <b>And</b> for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

25|$|There was {{widespread}} {{fear in the}} aftermath of the rebellion, and white militias organized in retaliation against the slaves. The state executed 56 slaves accused of being part of the rebellion. In the frenzy, many non-participant slaves were punished. Approximately 120 slaves and free African Americans were murdered by militias and mobs in the area. Across the South, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil rights for free <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services.|$|E
25|$|During the 1994 all-race elections, some Coloured {{people voted}} for the white National Party. The National Party recast itself as the New National Party, partly to attract non-White voters. This {{political}} alliance, often perplexing to outsiders, has sometimes been {{explained in terms of}} the culture and language shared by White and Coloured New National Party members, who both spoke Afrikaans. In addition, both groups opposed affirmative action programmes that might give preference to non-Coloured <b>Black</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if African National Congress gained leadership in the government.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{generally}} classify the KKK {{as part of}} the post-Civil War insurgent violence related {{not only}} to the high number of veterans in the population, but also to their effort to control the dramatically changed social situation by using extrajudicial means to restore white supremacy. In 1866, Mississippi Governor William L. Sharkey reported that disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan used public violence against <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> their allies as intimidation.

25|$|Some of {{the main}} causes of the spread of this disease were the {{insufficient}} supply of drinking water, pollution of ground water by human waste, the warm and humid climate in summer, the overcrowding suffered by the <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and,</b> since 1871, the overcrowding of the European immigrants who entered the country incessantly and without sanitary measures. Also, the saladeros (manufacturing establishments for producing salted and dried meat) polluted the Matanza River (south of the city limits), and the infected ditches full of debris which ran through the city encouraged {{the spread of the}} mosquito Aedes aegypti, which was responsible of transmitting Yellow Fever.|$|E

It was the Alliance that formed the New Cross Massacre Action Committee {{in response to the}} alleged arson attack which resulted in the death of 14 young blacks, and mobilised 20,000 <b>black</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> their supporters in March 1981 to protest the death of the young people and the failure of the police to conduct a proper investigation.

There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God.
