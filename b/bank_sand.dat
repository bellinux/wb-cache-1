Using highresolution sequence stratigraphy and geostatistical analysis, I developed a geologic model that may improve the ultimate recovery of oil from this field. In this study, I assessed sequence stratigraphic concepts for continental settings and extended the techniques to analyze low-accommodation alluvial systems of the Cut Bank and Sunburst members of the lower Kootenai formation (Cretaceous) in Cut Bank field. Identification and delineation of five sequences and their bounding surfaces led {{to a better understanding}} of the reservoir distribution and variability. Recognition of stacking patterns allowed for the prediction of reservoir rock quality. Within each systems tract, the best quality reservoir rocks are strongly concentrated in the lowstand systems tract. Erosional events associated with falling baselevel resulted in stacked, communicated (multistory) reservoirs. The lowermost Cut Bank sandstone has the highest reservoir quality and is a braided stream parasequence. Average net-to-gross ratio value (0. 6) is greater than in other reservoir intervals. Little additional stratigraphically untapped oil is expected in the lowermost Cut Bank sandstone. Over most of the SCCBSU, the Sunburst and the upper Cut Bank strata are valley-fill complexes with interfluves that may laterally compartmentalize reservoir sands. Basal Sunburst sand (Sunburst 1, average net-to-gross ratio ~ 0. 3) has better reservoir quality than other Sunburst or upper Cut Bank sands, but its reservoir quality is significantly less than that of lower Cut <b>Bank</b> <b>sand.</b> Geostatistical analysis provided equiprobable representations of the heterogeneity of reservoirs. Simulated reservoir geometries resulted in an improved description of reservoir distribution and connectivity, as well as occurrences of flow barriers. The models resulting from this study can be used to improve reservoir management and well placement and to predict reservoir performance in Cut Bank field. The technical approaches and tools from this study can be used to improve descriptions of other oil and gas reservoirs in similar depositional systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Authie is {{a rapidly}} {{infilling}} macrotidal (mean estuary-mouth spring tidal range = 8. 5 m) estuary in Picardy, northern France, whose mouth {{is affected by}} strong tidal currents and wind waves generated in the English Channel. The estuary cuts across a major sand dune barrier and has been sourced by sand derived from offshore and alongshore, {{as well as from}} recycling of the aeolian dunes lining its north <b>bank.</b> <b>Sand</b> released by the severe erosion of these north bank dunes is temporarily stored on the beaches. A small fraction of the sand is back-cycled into the dunes via blowouts. The rest is transported towards the inner estuary where it forms longitudinal aeolian dune ridges and sand sheets that are ultimately recycled into sandy-muddy intertidal flats that develop into salt marshes. The erosion of the dunes lining the north bank of the estuary represents a morphodynamic adjustment to concentration f the tidal flux against his north bank by massive accretion and progradation of a south-bank sand platform. This erosion contributes in g ving a funnel-shaped stuary mouth and probably in accommodating the tidal prism following large-scale reclamation of the inner estuary. The cstuary-ward recycling of aeolian dune sand enhances overall accretion f the estuary whose ultimate fate is complete silting up i...|$|E

40|$|Ecological network {{analysis}} (ENA) is a helpful tool to study complex ecosystem processes. The diverse species interactions {{are described as}} flows of energy providing a simplified representation of the natural system based on attributes and features. In the Wadden Sea, a unique ecosystem along the coastline of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, physical forces form the vast intertidal areas to diverse habitat types that differ in their species composition and abundance. Those habitats are important foraging areas for top predators such as birds. In the present study the food web of six habitats characteristic for the Wadden Sea (cockle field, razor clam field, mud flat, mussel <b>bank,</b> <b>sand</b> flat and seagrass meadow) were analyzed in a modelling approach. The functional and structural properties of the food webs were compared to assess differences and similarities in the system functioning. Although all systems revealed a good balance between their degree of organization and their robustness against external perturbations, they differed in their detailed features. The cockle field and the mussel bank both exhibited a strong dependence of their efficiency on external imports.

The mud flat system was characterized by a high use of microphytobenthos and appeared to be not fully developed yet.

40|$|Grey dune {{ecosystems}} in Europe show {{a decrease}} in area and quality. Lacks of natural dynamics and increased eutrophication have led to grass encroachment and increased shrub cover. Policy {{to improve the quality}} of these dry dune systems has been developed but the efficacy of measures for ecological restoration is not always clear. In this research the efficacy of sod cutting and increased aeolian sand dynamics as restoration measures to improve the quality and increase the area of grey dune is researched. To this purpose articles in international scientific literature and management reports from the Netherlands are reviewed. The restoration measures are not often discussed in scientific literature and restoration measures are often not sufficiently monitored. Much of the literature on the effects of increased aeolian sand activity is mainly geomorphological. Scientific knowledge on the long term effects of restoration measures in grey dunes or comparable systems is scarce. However from the reviewed studies a few general trends became obvious. Sod cutting and the increase of aeolian sand dynamics can be an effective way to increase both the quality and the area of grey dune ecosystems. Dependent on how the measures are performed both measures can have a beneficial effect on pioneer stages as well as species rich dune grasslands. Points of interest are the effect on SOM, the soil seed <b>bank,</b> <b>sand</b> deposition and pH, as well as the scale of the measures. These factors are crucial in the establishment of target communities. Future research should focus on the effects of recovery measures on soil processes, soil biota and on the effects on the longer term. Effects of the restoration measures on species rich grey dune grasslands on the longer term are uncertain. Recovery in lime-rich sites seems to be slower while in acid dunes the grass encroachment is a bigger problem. Ecosystem managers should monitor recovery measures and report the results of these monitoring studies to improve the knowledge on ecosystem restoration and improve future management...|$|E

40|$|The Wadden Sea is {{a unique}} coastal {{ecosystem}} and of outstanding importance for millions of coastal birds which use the intertidal area as a major food source. In this study the importance of habitat diversity {{and the influence of}} avian predators on the intertidal food web was determined using Ecological Network Analysis. Similarities and differences of the food web structure were analyzed for six different intertidal habitats (i. e. cockle field, razor clam field, mud flat, mussel <b>bank,</b> <b>sand</b> flat, seagrass meadow). All systems were in a good trade-off between their degree of order and their redundancy implying a sustainable system structure and resistance in front of perturbations. But the habitats differed in their detailed features. The cockle field and the mussel bank were characterized by a complex and diverse flow structure while being simultaneously strongly dependent on external phytoplankton imports. Razor clam fields were revealed to be simple but very efficient systems. The studied mud flat appeared to be vulnerable to perturbations due to short and simple pathways and little recycling. The sand flat and the seagrass meadow showed a complex and redundant flow structure and a high recycling indicating independence and resistance. Habitat diversity appears to be an important trait for the Wadden Sea food web as each habitat has a distinct role in the whole ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, the diverse habitats are of great importance for foraging bird which might be specialized to one of the habitats. Birds induce a large impact on the Wadden Sea food web. Due to their various direct and indirect influences, it is likely that changes in the bird population also cause changes in the whole system functioning. A decline in birds results in a decrease of pathway length and a less redundant and diverse flow structure. Birds therefore {{play an important role in}} stabilizing the intertidal food web. The holistic approach of Ecological Network Analysis provides fundamental insight in the Wadden Sea food web structure. Results of this thesis are a useful basis to develop management tools and strategies for assessing the ecological state and the health of this unique ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin and}} morphodynamic {{evolution}} of linear <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> {{have been widely}} studied in recent years. Several investigations {{have been carried out}} {{in order to understand the}} influence of tide-related parameters, bathymetry and Coriolis force on <b>sand</b> <b>bank</b> formation and maintenance. However, the effect of waves on the net flux of sediments over the <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> has often been neglected on grounds of the short duration of significant wave activity compared to that of tidal cycles. Nevertheless, the interaction between wave activity and tidal currents leads to a high increase of bottom shear stress, especially at the <b>sand</b> <b>bank</b> crests and, as a consequence, to an increase of sand tranport. This paper investigates the effects of wave activity on the morphology and morphodynamics of the Kwinte Bank (Belgian shelf). Numerical simulations were carried out under different wave conditions to assess wave influence on <b>sand</b> <b>bank</b> evolution. Model verification involved analysis and comparison with field data collected during two different periods. The study shows that wave activity is not only responsible for a large increase in sediment transport but also for a change in direction of the net flux of sediments.

40|$|A fully {{three-dimensional}} model is {{proposed for the}} generation of tidal sand waves and <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> from small bottom perturbations of a flat seabed subject to tidal currents. The model predicts the conditions leading to the appearance of both tidal sand waves and <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> and determines their main geometrical characteristics. A finite wavelength of both sand waves and <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> is found around the critical conditions, thus opening the possibility of performing a weakly nonlinear stability analysis able to predict the equilibrium amplitude of the bottom forms. As shown by previous works on the subject, the sand wave crests {{turn out to be}} orthogonal to the direction of the main tidal current. The present results also show that in the Northern Hemisphere <b>sand</b> <b>bank</b> crests are clockwise or counter-clockwise rotated with respect to the main tidal current depending on the counter-clockwise or clockwise rotation of the velocity vector induced by the tide. Only for unidirectional or quasi-unidirectional tidal currents are <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> always counter-clockwise rotated. The predictions of the model are supported by comparisons with field data. Finally, the mechanisms leading to the appearance of sand waves and <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> are discussed {{in the light of the}} model findings. In particular, it is shown that the growth of <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> is not only induced by the depth-averaged residual circulation which is present around the bedforms and is parallel to the crests of the bottom forms: a steady drift of the sediment from the troughs towards the crests is also driven by the steady velocity component orthogonal to the crests which is present close to the bottom and can be quantified only by a {{three-dimensional model}}. While the former mechanism appears to trigger the formation of counter-clockwise <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> only, the latter mechanism can give rise to both counter-clockwise and clockwise rotated <b>sand</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Large barchan-shaped sand {{deposits}} {{have been}} observed in the north west of Torres Strait. These deposits share characteristics of both subaerial barchan dunes and subaqueous <b>sand</b> <b>banks.</b> A study of satellite imagery indicate that the deposits migrate in the direction indicated by their horns (10 – 15 m west per year), and that sediment is shed from their horns, features that are characteristic of barchan dunes. However the orientations of sand dunes superimposed upon the <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> indicate the presence of mutually-evasive channels and circulation of sediment around the <b>sand</b> <b>bank,</b> a characteristic of subaqueous <b>sand</b> <b>banks.</b> The presence of mutually-evasive channels is the criteria used to categorise the deposits as <b>sand</b> <b>banks.</b> Barchan forms are known to exist in regions with limited sediment supply and unidirectional current or wind regimes. In the Torres Strait both these criteria are met. Previous work has demonstrated {{the presence of a}} net westward current through the Torres Strait that is driven by the southeast trade winds. The relatively high displacement of the wind-driven currents during the trade wind season relative to the monsoon appears to provide the necessary 'unidirectional' regime to form barchans. The low, and typically eastwards, displacement of the residual monsoon season current appears to have a negligible affect on the barchan form. While seasonal wind-driven currents appear to maintain the barchan shape of the <b>sand</b> <b>banks,</b> tidal currents actively maintain mutually-evasive channels observed by variations in dune orientation on the <b>sand</b> <b>banks.</b> A sediment starved environment combined with bedload transport attributed to both wind driven and tidal currents is concluded to create a unique hydrodynamic environment where <b>sand</b> <b>banks</b> can attain a barchan form...|$|R
