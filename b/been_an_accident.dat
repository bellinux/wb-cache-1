In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E
5|$|In September 1989 the Navy {{announced}} that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion could have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. Forced by the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli {{in charge of the}} new inquiry.|$|E

5|$|Later, in an on-air {{phone call}} from {{his office at the}} CNN New York bureau, CNN {{vice-president}} of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet had hit the World Trade Center. Eventually, other television networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President George W. Bush was arriving at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida.

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time.

Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E

5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{several of}} hide's {{friends and colleagues}} stated that they {{believed}} the auto-strangulation to have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. This notion {{is supported by the}} fact that no suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography, that at the night of his death, hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from continuous use of a shoulder strap. The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of a towel and a door knob or handle. According to Taiji, hide may have fallen asleep in his intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself.|$|E

25|$|The Godhra train burning was an {{incident}} that occurred {{on the morning of}} 27 February 2002, in which 59 people died in a fire inside the Sabarmati Express train near the Godhra railway station in the Indian state of Gujarat. The victims included Hindu pilgrims who were returning from the city of Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the disputed Babri Masjid site. The commission set up by the Government of Gujarat to investigate the train burning spent 6 years going over the details of the case, and concluded that the fire was arson committed by a mob of 1,000 to 2,000 people. A commission appointed by the central government, whose appointment was later held to be unconstitutional, stated that the fire had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> A court convicted 31 Muslims for the incident and the conspiracy for the crime, although the actual causes of the fire have yet to be proven conclusively.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Abbas {{was given}} {{sanctuary}} in Iraq by Saddam Hussein. Abbas (born in a Syrian refugee camp) made {{his new home}} in Gaza (after being given amnesty in 1996 {{in line with the}} 1993 signing of the Oslo peace accords). He became a representative of the Palestine National Council. The administration of President Bill Clinton aware of Abbas' resurfacing neither asked for his extradition nor requested he be turned over to Italy who had found him guilty in absentia. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution 99-0 asking Clinton to request Abbas' extradition to the USA. The Congressional Research Service held that the statute of limitations and not expired because Abbas was a fugitive from justice. Clinton's critics also pointed out that the US was not a signatory to the Oslo accords, and that they make no mention of the USA's ability to prosecute anyone. Throughout the 1990s Abbas moved back and forth from Baghdad to the West Bank, secretly recruiting more Palestinians to join the PLF, while he told the news media that he was reformed and that the Achille Lauro hijacking had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b>|$|E
25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera.

A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E

500|$|A {{red flag}} is shown when there has <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> or the track {{conditions}} are poor {{enough to warrant}} the race being stopped. The flags are displayed by the marshals at various points around the circuit. A Global Positioning System (GPS) marshalling system was introduced in 2007. It involves a display of flag signals in the driver's cockpit, which alerts them to the accident. Following a red flag being shown, the exit of the pit lane is closed and cars must proceed to the pit lane slowly without overtaking, lining up at the pit exit. From 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane. Previously, the race was restarted in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown. If a race is unable to be resumed, [...] "the results will be taken {{at the end of}} the penultimate lap before the lap during which the signal to suspend the race was given". If 75 per cent of the race distance has not been completed and the race cannot be resumed, half points are awarded. No points are awarded if the race cannot be restarted and less than two laps have been completed.|$|E
