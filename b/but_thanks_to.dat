25|$|Although the South started {{early to}} build railways, it {{concentrated}} on short lines linking cotton regions to oceanic or river ports {{and the absence}} of an interconnected network was a major handicap during the Civil War. The North and Midwest constructed networks that linked every city by 1860. In the heavily settled the Midwestern Corn Belt, over 80 percent of farms were within 10 miles of a railway, facilitating the shipment of grain, hogs and cattle to national and international markets. A large number of short lines were built, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> a fast developing financial system based on Wall Street and oriented to railway bonds, the majority were consolidated into 20 trunk lines by 1890. State and local governments often subsidized lines, but rarely owned them.|$|E

Finally, in Game 4, Jon Lester took Tim Wakefield's spot in the rotation and gave the Sox an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. The Rockies threatened, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> World Series MVP Mike Lowell and aided by a pinch-hit home run by outfielder Bobby Kielty, Papelbon registered another save as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games. The Red Sox captured their second title in four years.|$|E
25|$|The Pompeians then {{attempted}} to flee over land, constantly pursued and harassed by Caesarian forces. In {{course of the}} flight, Pompeius the Younger was once more wounded, {{this time in the}} shoulder and left leg, so that his men had to carry him on a litter. The Pompeians eventually took refuge at a well defendable wooded hill near the town of Lauro, but they were discovered by a local, who reported them to the Caesarians. As result, Pompeius and his men were surrounded. The Caesarians, under command of Lucius Caesennius Lento, began to attack the Pompeian positions, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> the natural conditions, the defenders were able to repulse multiple assaults. Thus thwarted, Lento's forces settled down to besiege and starve out the Pompeians. Recognizing this, the defenders resolved to try to break through the siege.|$|E
