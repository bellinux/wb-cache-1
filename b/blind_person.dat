MacIntyre is the first legally <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> to audition for American Idol. MacIntyre began practicing music at the age of six. Home-schooled until the age of fourteen, he later attended Arizona State University's Barrett Honors College and Herberger College of the Arts soon afterwards. In 2005, USA Today named him one of its twenty College Academic All-Stars. He obtained his master's degree at Royal Holloway, University of London and the Royal College of Music, where he studied on a Marshall Scholarship. MacIntyre produced his first CD when he was eleven, and has recorded five more CDs since then. He was accepted to both Oxford University and Cambridge University for further graduate-level education.|$|E
25|$|On another occasion, after {{becoming}} upset by some accounts, or {{to run the}} Sultanate {{from the center of}} India by other accounts, Muhammad bin Tughlaq ordered the transfer of his capital from Delhi to Devagiri in modern-day Maharashtra (renaming it to Daulatabad), by forcing the mass migration of Delhi's population. Those who refused were killed. One <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> who failed to move to Daulatabad was dragged for the entire journey of 40 days - the man died, his body fell apart, and only his tied leg reached Daulatabad. The capital move failed because Daulatabad was arid and did not have enough drinking water to support the new capital. The capital then returned to Delhi. Nevertheless, Muhammad bin Tughlaq's orders affected history as a large number of Delhi Muslims who came to the Deccan area did not return to Delhi to live near Muhammad bin Tughlaq. This influx of the then-Delhi residents into the Deccan region led to a growth of Muslim population in central and southern India. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's adventures in the Deccan region also marked campaigns of destruction and desecration of Hindu and Jain temples, for example the Swayambhu Shiva Temple and the Thousand Pillar Temple.|$|E

In an interview by Elmo, she answered questions about how a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> can learn to use other senses to get along in the world. In 1998, she was a special guest on [...] "Ray Charles in Concert", {{a benefit for the}} Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. [...] She performed at Carnegie Hall in a tribute to Irving Berlin in 1988, and again in 1996 in a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. Schuur gave a performance in 1999 to honor Stevie Wonder at The Kennedy Center Honors. She sang [...] "I Just Called to Say I Love You" [...] arranged and accompanied by Herbie Hancock. Entertainment writer Jake Elyachar rated this {{as one of the top}} 20 best performances ever given on the Kennedy Honors series. Wonder was visibly emotionally moved by the performance. She was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind in 2000. Late in 2003, Schuur released Midnight, featuring original songs written by Barry Manilow for the album. Manilow's long-time songwriting team, which included co-producer Eddie Arkin, and lyricists Marty Panzer, Bruce Susan, and Adrienne Anderson, contributed to the project. Manilow produced the album and also performed on it. The guest artists were Brian McKnight and Karrin Allyson and it was backed by Tony-winner Bill Elliott and the Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra. Her second live album, Diane Schuur: Live In London, was recorded at Ronnie Scott's, a historic jazz club in London's Soho District. Scott's is the site of previous live albums by Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone.|$|E

2500|$|Ileana Sánchez {{invented a}} book for the blind that brings {{together}} art and braille. Ms. Sanchez used a new technique called TechnoPrint and TechnoBraille. Rather than punch through heavy paper to create the raised dots of the Braille alphabet for the blind, these techniques apply an epoxy to the page to create not only raised dots, but raised images with texture. The epoxy melds with the page, becoming part of it, so that you can't scrape it off with your fingernail. The images are raised so that a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> can feel the artwork and in color, not just to attract the sighted family who will read the book with blind siblings or children, {{but also for the}} blind themselves.

2500|$|When the princes grow up, Dhritarashtra {{is about}} to be crowned king by Bhishma when Vidura {{intervenes}} and uses his knowledge of politics to assert that a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> cannot be king. This is because a blind man cannot control and protect his subjects. The throne is then given to Pandu because of Dhritarashtra's blindness. Pandu marries twice, to Kunti and Madri. Dhritarashtra [...] marries Gandhari, a princess from Gandhara, who blindfolds herself so that she may feel the pain that her husband feels. Her brother Shakuni is enraged by this and vows to take revenge on the Kuru family. One day, when Pandu is relaxing in the forest, he hears the sound of a wild animal. He shoots an arrow {{in the direction of the}} sound. However the arrow hits the sage Kindama, who curses him that if he engages in a sexual act, he will die.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} {{barriers in}} utilisation of community based rehabilitation (CBR) services for incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> in rural South India. Methods: A community-based rehabilitation programme for incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> was initiated in Theni district of southern Tamil Nadu in south India. After door-to-door enumeration and preliminary ocular screening by trained {{workers at the}} village, identified <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> were categorised as either curable or incurable by an ophthalmologist. Trained workers provided rehabilitation, including mobility training (OM), training to perform {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), and economic rehabilitation for the incurably blind in their respective villages. Results: Of the 460, 984 persons surveyed, 400 (0. 09 &#x 0025;) were certified as incurably blind including 156 (39. 00 &#x 0025;) <b>persons</b> <b>blind</b> from birth. Social rehabilitation was provided for 268 (67. 00 &#x 0025;) incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons.</b> Economic rehabilitation was provided to 96 persons, and integrated education to 22 children. Nearly one-fifth (n= 68, 17. 00 &#x 0025;) of incurably <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> refused the services provided. The major reasons for refusal included old age and other illnesses (41. 18 &#x 0025;), and multiple handicaps (19. 12 &#x 0025;). Twenty-seven (6. 75 &#x 0025;) persons had either migrated or died, and 29 (7. 25 &#x 0025;) persons were already able to function independently. Conclusion: Although CBR programmes provide useful services to the incurably blind, a better understanding of barriers is required to improve service utilisation. Developing a standardised data collection format for every CBR programme can result {{in the creation of a}} national database of ophthalmic diseases...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the impact of community-based rehabilitation {{on the quality of}} life of <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> in a rural south Indian population. We performed a population-based survey followed by clinical examinations to identify <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> in a rural south Indian population. Pre-and-post rehabilitation quality of life of 159 <b>blind</b> <b>persons</b> aged 15 years or above was ascertained through a questionnaire previously validated for use in this population. Post-rehabilitation quality-of-life scales showed some improvement for 151 (95. 0 &#x 0025;) subjects. The additional benefit from rehabilitation was greatest for the self-care and mobility subscales, ranging from 24. 6 &#x 0025; to 30. 0 &#x 0025; for the self care subscale and 37. 6 &#x 0025; to 44. 3 &#x 0025; for the mobility subscale with effect sizes of 21. 5 and 2. 38 respectively. Overall quality of life scores were not significantly different between those who did and did not receive economic rehabilitation (P = 0. 1). <b>Blind</b> <b>persons</b> in this rural population benefited considerably from rehabilitation services even if economic rehabilitation is not provided.

60|$|It was {{one o'clock}} on Christmas morning, or more. Hours ago Morris had gone though his rites, the ritual {{that he had}} invented or discovered--in its essence, simple and pathetic enough--whereby he strove to bring himself to the notice of the dead, and to fit himself to see or hear the dead. Such {{tentative}} mysticism as served his turn need not be written down, but its substance can be imagined by many. Then, through an exercise of his will, he had invoked the strange, trance-like state which has been described. The soft waves flowing from an unknown source had beat upon his brain, and with them came the accustomed phenomena; the sense of some presence near, impending, yet impotent; suggesting by analogy and effect the misdirected efforts of a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> seeking something in a room, or the painful attempt of one almost deaf, striving to sift out words from a confused murmur of sounds. The personality of Stella seemed to pervade him, yet he could see nothing, could hear nothing. The impression might be from within, not from without. Perhaps, after all, it {{was nothing but a}} dream, a miasma, a mirage, drawn by his own burning thought from the wastes and marshes of his mind peopled with illusive hopes and waterlogged by memories. Or it might be true and real; as yet he could not be certain of its origin.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} that in 1748 Réaumur couched {{the eyes of}} a girl who had been born blind. Diderot sought to be admitted to the operation, but the favour was denied him, and he expressed his resentment in terms which, as we shall see, cost him very dear. As he could not witness the experiment, he began to meditate upon the subject, and the result was the Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who See. published in 1749--the date, it may be observed in passing, of another very important work in the development of materialistic speculation, David Hartley's Observations on man, his frame, his duty, and his expectations. Diderot's real disappointment at not being admitted to the operation was slight. In a vigorous passage he shows the difficulties in the way of conducting such an experiment under the conditions necessary to make it conclusive. To prepare the born-blind to answer philosophical interrogatories truly, and then to put these interrogatories rightly, would have been a feat, he declares, not unworthy of the united talents of Newton, Descartes, Locke, and Leibnitz. Unless the patient were placed in such conditions as this, Diderot thinks there would be more profit in questioning a <b>blind</b> <b>person</b> of good sense, than in the answers of an uneducated person receiving sight for the first time under abnormal and bewildering circumstances.[63] In this he was undoubtedly right. If the experiment could be prepared under the delicate conditions proper to make it demonstrative evidence, it would be final. But the experiment had certainly not been so prepared in his time, and probably never will be.[64] ...|$|E
