5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, Cleveland {{adopted a}} <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Monroe Doctrine {{that not only}} {{prohibited}} new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested. British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government, having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded {{the bulk of the}} disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, and at the same time, the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E

25|$|He argued, foremost, {{that the}} Supreme Court should {{have heard the}} case rather than dismissing it. Thereafter, he {{indicated}} his support for a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the due process clause. On {{the basis of this}} interpretation, Harlan concluded that the Connecticut statute violated the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Elections in Lithuania {{have been}} {{assessed}} as generally {{free and fair}} by domestic and international monitors, although voting irregularities and allegations of vote-buying have occurred, although OSCE highlight the overly <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of a definition of vote-buying as a possible explanation of the scale of allegations.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} position taken by Swedlund in 1957 brought the nuclear question {{into the realm}} of public policy debates in Sweden. Initially, the center-right politicians and the media were mostly positive while the social democrats were largely split. During the events that followed, the Government tried again to avoid taking an explicit position {{despite the fact that the}} defense position was laid out based on the Swedlund's position from 1957 and tensions were increasing globally. The pragmatic solution was to not directly invest into the development of Swedish nuclear weapons, but to provide increased funding for defense research in nuclear weapons, and to give the term “nuclear weapons” a very <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The SWANCC {{decision}} {{continues the}} efforts of the five Supreme Court justices generally regarded as conservative to limit federal regulatory power. In 1995 and 2000, the same five justices found that Congress had exceeded Commerce Clause limits in enacting legislation dealing with possession of guns in school zones and violence against women. To be sure, the Supreme Court in SWANCC did not reach the constitutional question, but rather disposed of the case on purely statutory grounds. Nonetheless, its analysis of the CWA has, as noted, a strong undercurrent of the same Commerce Clause and federalism concerns. In not addressing the constitutional issue, SWANCC resembles another recent Commerce Clause decision in which, as in SWANCC, the Court used the possibility of Commerce Clause issues being raised by a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of a federal statute to support its adoption of a narrow reading. The Court did not grant a petition for certiorari in a similar Commerce Clause challenge to the Endangered Species Act.|$|E
25|$|In his 1825 annual {{message to}} Congress, Adams {{presented}} a comprehensive and ambitious agenda. He called for major investments in internal improvements {{as well as}} the creation of a national university, a naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. Noting the healthy status of the treasury and the possibility for more revenue via land sales, Adams argued for the completion of several projects that were in various stages of construction or planning, including a road from Washington to New Orleans. He proposed the establishment of a Department of the Interior as a new cabinet-level department that would preside over these internal improvements. Adams's programs faced opposition from various quarters. Many disagreed with his <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the constitution, and favored stronger state governments {{at the expense of the}} federal government. Others disliked any government interference and were opposed to central planning. Some in the South feared that Adams was secretly an abolitionist and that he sought to suborn the states to the federal government.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 February 2017, the {{majority}} of the German Bishops' Conference published guidelines which were considered to be the <b>broadest</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Amoris Laetitia and stated that it allowed communion for the divorced and remarried in only certain cases which involved difficult situations.|$|R

500|$|The {{amendment}} passed narrowly after heavy pressure {{exerted by}} Lincoln himself, along with offers of political appointments from the [...] "Seward lobby". Allegations of bribery {{were made by}} Democrats; Stevens stated [...] "the greatest measure {{of the nineteenth century}} was passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America." [...] The amendment was declared ratified on December 18, 1865. Stevens continued to push for a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of it that included economic justice in addition to the formal end of slavery.|$|E
500|$|Speaking anonymously, {{a senior}} foreign diplomat in Hong Kong {{revealed}} {{that at least}} six countries had expressed their concern and asked for information regarding the disappearances as at 23 January 2016. Reuters revealed that fifteen ambassadors or consuls {{were concerned about the}} <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Chinese nationality, and that the denial of consular access to a Swedish and a British passport holder was a violation of international treaties. Eight countries including the US, UK, Sweden, Canada, Japan, Australia and Germany had privately expressed concerns about the apparent breach of [...] "One country, two systems".|$|E

Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amyloid.|$|R
50|$|Within a {{very short}} time after {{rendering}} these two decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court would shift toward a far <b>broader</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the First Amendment.

500|$|The dispute {{had become}} a {{diplomatic}} crisis in 1895 when Venezuela's lobbyist William L. Scruggs sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C. to pursue the matter. Then US President Grover Cleveland adopted a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Doctrine that did not just forbid new European colonies but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere. [...] British prime minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged the importance the American government placed on the dispute, prolonging the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration of the entire territory.|$|E
500|$|Justice Harlan {{advocated}} a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected {{a wide range}} of fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution. (See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, [...] "no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field'." [...] Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by [...] "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms".|$|E
500|$|On 6 September 1997 The West Australian {{published}} a Dean Alston cartoon entitled Alas Poor Yagan, which {{was critical of}} the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity. The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage. The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians, and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 because it was [...] "an artistic work" [...] that was published [...] "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt. This ruling was upheld on appeal by the Federal Court of Australia, Some academic commentators have since expressed concern that the protections offered under the act have been undermined by the ruling's <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the exemptions.|$|E
50|$|In its narrowest sense, the Central Plain covers modern-day Henan, the {{southern}} part of Hebei, {{the southern}} part of Shanxi, and the western part of Shandong province. A <b>broader</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Central Plain's extent would add the Guanzhong plain of Shaanxi, the northwestern part of Jiangsu, and parts of Anhui and northern Hubei.|$|R

500|$|Scholar Jacob W. Landynski called Stewart's opinion [...] "the most {{thorough}} and convincing analysis {{in favor of}} the exclusionary rule to be found in any opinion of the Court". In giving a rationale for a <b>broader</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision set the stage for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.|$|R
500|$|Harlan {{is often}} {{characterized}} {{as a member of}} the conservative wing of the Warren Court. He advocated a limited role for the judiciary, remarking that the Supreme Court should not be considered [...] "a general haven for reform movements". In general, Harlan adhered more closely to precedent, and was more reluctant to overturn legislation, than many of his colleagues on the Court. He strongly disagreed with the doctrine of incorporation, which held that the provisions of the federal Bill of Rights applied to the state governments, not merely the Federal. At the same time, he advocated a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, arguing that it protected a wide range of rights not expressly mentioned in the United States Constitution. Harlan is sometimes called the [...] "great dissenter" [...] of the Warren Court, and has been described as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the twentieth century. Justice Harlan was gravely ill when he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971. He died from spinal cancer three months later, on December 29, 1971. After Harlan's retirement, President Nixon appointed William Rehnquist to replace him.|$|E
500|$|Jurisdictions such as India, Malaysia and the United States {{interpret}} the same term {{in their respective}} constitutions broadly. In the United States Supreme Court case Munn v. Illinois (1877), Justice Stephen Johnson Field stated that the term life means more than mere animal existence. Rather, the definition extends to all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. His rationale was that the term should not be [...] "construed in any narrow or restricted sense". Indian courts have likewise adopted a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of life in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to mean more than mere existence – instead, it includes the right to livelihood {{and the right to}} a healthy environment. Subsequently, in Samatha v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1997), the meaning of life was expanded to include the right to live with human dignity; and to the provision of minimum sustenance, shelter, and those other rights and aspects of life that make life meaningful and worth living. Similarly, Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati held in Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984) that the expression life included the right to be free from exploitation, and to the basic essentials of life included in the Directive Principles of State Policy that appear in the Indian Constitution.|$|E
500|$|On one account, {{sustainability}} [...] "concerns the {{specification of}} a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption, wealth, utility, or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons". Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics represents: [...] "...a <b>broad</b> <b>interpretation</b> of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective. Social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis." [...] However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins. At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other, environmental damage and resource depletion.|$|E
50|$|Although {{computed}} in {{the same}} fashion as Goodman and Kruskal's gamma, it has a slightly <b>broader</b> <b>interpretation</b> because the distinction between nominal and ordinal scales becomes a matter of arbitrary labeling for dichotomous distinctions. Thus, whether Q is positive or negative depends merely on which pairings the analyst considers to be concordant, but is otherwise symmetric.|$|R
50|$|The Prudent Man Rule in its <b>broader</b> <b>interpretations</b> {{implies that}} the {{fiduciary}} should perform enough due diligence {{to ensure that the}} company meets the investment needs of the investors.

5000|$|Modern Constitutional {{interpretation}} also divides {{on these}} lines. Currently, Living Constitution scholars advocate a [...] "spirit"-esque interpretative strategy, although one {{grounded in a}} spirit that reflects broad powers.
