500|$|Though it was optimistic, the Restudy noted, It is {{important}} to understand that the 'restored' Everglades of the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. While it certainly will be vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system. This is not possible, in light of the irreversible physical changes that have made (sic) to the ecosystem. It will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successfully restored Everglades, because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which defined the [...] original Everglades, and which made it unique among the world’s wetland systems. It will become a place that kindles the wildness and richness of the former Everglades.|$|E

2500|$|The XP-47B {{was very}} heavy {{compared}} with contemporary single-engined fighters, {{with an empty}} weight of 9,900lb (4,490kg), or 65% more than the YP-43. Kartveli said, [...] "It will be a dinosaur, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dinosaur with good proportions." [...] The armament was eight [...]50 caliber (12.7mm) [...] "light-barrel" [...] Browning AN/M2 machine guns, four in each wing. The guns were staggered to allow feeding from side-by-side ammunition boxes, each with a 350-round capacity. All eight guns gave the fighter a combined rate of fire of approximately 100 rounds per second.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{proponents of}} nuclear power argue that [...] nuclear power has killed by far the fewest number of people per {{terawatt}} hour of any type of power generation, {{and it has a}} very small effect on the environment with effectively zero emissions of any kind. And this even taking into account the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents, in which few people were killed directly and few excess cancers will be caused by releases of radioactivity to the environment. Some proponents acknowledge that most people will not accept this sort of statistical argument nor will they believe reassuring statements from industry or government. [...] Indeed, the industry itself has created fear {{of nuclear power}} by pointing out that radioactivity can be dangerous. [...] Improved communication by industry might help to overcome current fears regarding nuclear power, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difficult task to change current perceptions in the general population.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{south of}} the Zihuatanejo Airport {{there is a large}} archeological site at La Soledad De Maciel and the small town of La Chole. While {{artifacts}} have been found there since the 1930s, excavations were only started between 2000 and 2010. The site was occupied from 3000 BCE to the early 600s CE when it was destroyed by a tsunami. It was occupied by three different cultures and was an important trading city for both Teotihuacan and the Olmec. At its height it had a large population with the site possibly covering a 10 km2 area. Only {{a small part of the}} site has been excavated because most of it is owned by the local farmers who grow fruit trees, vegetables, coconuts for copra and tobacco that they roll into cigars. The Mexican government is in the process of buying back the site <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> slow process. Still, what has been uncovered is worth seeing.|$|E

2500|$|Mullaney {{made his}} {{first-class}}, listA, and Twenty20 debuts for Lancashire in 2006. His first team cricket with Lancashire in 2006–2009 was limited, {{and in that}} time he played 4first-class matches, 7listA matches, and three Twenty20 matches. In April 2007, Mullaney scored his maiden first-class century. Playing against Durham University, his innings of 165not out (165*) came at quicker than a run a ball and allowed Lancashire to win the match. His first hundred runs came off 92balls and the next 65 from 26 and included 10sixes. It beat his previous highest score of 44. In the 2007 cricket season, Mullaney played for Northern Cricket Club, in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, averaging 70 with the bat and taking over 30wickets. After he spent the winter of 2007/08 playing grade cricket for McKinnon in the Victorian Turf Cricket Association, Mullaney signed a professional contract with Atherton Cricket Club in the Bolton Association {{at the start of the}} 2008 season. Speaking of his move from Northern to Atherton, Mullaney said [...] "Northern was the turning point in my career, and I have left on really good terms to try and better myself. The league [...] will not be quite as good, and the wickets aren't quite as good, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> new challenge" [...] and that [...] "I think getting into the pro-ing side of things is an added pressure– but it is a pressure I am really looking forward to". He set his sights on establishing himself in Lancashire's second team in the 2008 season and then force his way into the first team.|$|E
