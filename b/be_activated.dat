5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, {{so that it would}} also <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are polyphyodonts {{and able}} to replace each of their {{approximately}} 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35 to 75-year lifespan. They are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets. Next to each full-grown tooth {{there is a small}} replacement tooth and an odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina in standby, which can <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> when required. Tooth replacement slows significantly and eventually stops as the animal grows old.|$|E

50|$|Early in World War II {{numerous}} temporary {{buildings were}} again constructed {{to accommodate the}} rapid mobilization of men and equipment. The 2nd Battalion and two additional batteries of the 11th Coast Artillery <b>were</b> <b>activated</b> on 1 July 1939. Another battery <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> 1 August 1940, with a searchlight battery on 10 February 1941. The 242nd Coast Artillery <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> on 16 September 1940.|$|R
50|$|Both {{receptor}} types <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> {{by specific}} neurotransmitters. When an ionotropic receptor <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> it opens a channel that allows ions such as Na+, K+, or Cl− to flow. In contrast, when a metabotropic receptor <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> {{a series of}} intracellular events are triggered that can also result in ion channels opening but must involve a range of second messenger chemicals.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "cause and effect" [...] or [...] "programming", mapping {{is the process}} of {{activating}} outputs depending on which inputs have <b>been</b> <b>activated.</b> Traditionally, when an input device <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> a certain output device (or relay) <b>is</b> <b>activated.</b> As time has progressed, more and more advanced techniques have become available, often with large variations in style between different companies.|$|R
5|$|The {{lineage of}} the 18th Engineer Brigade {{can be traced}} to 29 July 1921, when its predecessor, the 347th Engineers (General Service), was {{constituted}} as an Organized Reserves unit. The 347th Engineers would not <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> for almost twenty years, until the military buildup after the United States entered World War II. The unit was ordered into active military service on 6 May 1942 at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E

5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> to block access to intruders.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Fort Lewis, Washington was {{notified}} {{of a major}} change of structure. A corps headquarters was to <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> in March 1982. I Corps was formally activated on 1 October 1981, much earlier than expected. On 1 August 1983, the corps expanded its operational control of active Army units outside Fort Lewis, to include the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord, California, and the 172nd Infantry Brigade in Alaska, which then {{became part of the}} 6th Infantry Division. In 1988, the distinctive unit insignia was approved for the corps. This was the fourth design held by the corps, with previous versions being approved then retracted in 1942, 1970, and 1982.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E

It returned to reserve duty in December 1952, but it <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in 1954.

5|$|In the game, players use a {{slingshot}} {{to launch}} birds at pigs stationed in or around various structures {{with the goal}} of destroying all the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game new types of birds become available, some with special abilities that can <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by the player. Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July 2009, Costa {{was sold}} to Real Valladolid {{as part of the}} deal that sent goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo in the {{opposite}} direction, with the transfer including a €1million buy-back option that could <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by Atlético at the end of the season. García Pitarch confessed that there was a verbal agreement that Costa would definitely return at the end of the campaign, and that the deal had been made to look permanent in order to give Costa more commitment to his new club.|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} and actions {{are controlled by}} the Force Gauge, an energy meter which determines how long special skills can be active. Once drained, the skill cannot <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> until the meter refills, which it does during battles. Four skills can be equipped for each character. After battles, characters earn Enhancement Points (EP), {{which can be used}} to strengthen equipped armor, weapons and accessories, instead of using Gald (the in-game currency) as with previous Tales titles. EP can be transferred between weapons. An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single-player and multiplayer matches: in both modes, players need to defeat an enemy team (either AI-controlled enemies or an opposing team) within a time limit.|$|E

5000|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore regions within the brain that <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> during working memory tasks in males versus females. Four different tasks of increasing difficulty were given to 9 males and 8 females. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure brain activity. The lateral prefrontal cortices, the parietal cortices and caudates <b>were</b> <b>activated</b> in both genders. [...] With more difficult tasks, more brain tissue <b>was</b> <b>activated.</b> The left hemisphere <b>was</b> predominantly <b>activated</b> in females' brains, whereas there was bilateral activation in males' brains.|$|R
