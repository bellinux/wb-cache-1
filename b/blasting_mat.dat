50|$|A <b>blasting</b> <b>mat</b> is a mat {{usually made}} of sliced-up rubber tires bound {{together}} with ropes, cables or chains. They are used during rock blasting {{to contain the}} blast, prevent flying rocks and suppress dust.|$|E
50|$|When {{charges are}} used to dig foxholes, an improvised <b>blasting</b> <b>mat</b> made from whole tires tied {{together}} with rope to reduce noise and fly rock, is recommended in the A Soldiers Handbook (United States). A tarp may {{also be used as}} a blasting blanket.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{materials}} {{are used for}} making blasting mats and new materials with different properties are constantly being introduced into this field. The most common materials are strips of old tires held together by steel cables, mats woven from manila rope or wire cables, logs or conveyor belts. Layers of wire netting can also be used. Several methods of assembling a <b>blasting</b> <b>mat</b> are patented.|$|E

50|$|Knowledge of {{the proper}} use of <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> is {{required}} in order to obtain a blaster's certificate issued by organizations such as the WorkSafeBC.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> {{is integrated}} with the mining industry and many companies specialize in making mats, especially those made from recycled tires.|$|R
50|$|During operation, <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> {{may be used}} {{to contain}} the blast, {{suppress}} dust and noise, for fly rock prevention and sometimes to direct the blast.|$|R
50|$|Although {{designed}} to prevent accidents, as <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> weigh between 3000 and 6000 lb, they have also caused injuries when falling on workers on construction sites.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>mats</b> {{that can}} be {{retrofitted}} {{to the floor of}} military vehicles are considered {{to reduce the risk of}} injury from under‐vehicle explosions. Anthropometric test devices (ATDs) are validated for use only in the seated position. The aim of this study was to use a traumatic injury simulator fitted with 3 different <b>blast</b> <b>mats</b> in order to assess the ability of 2 ATD designs to evaluate the protective capacity of the mats in 2 occupant postures under 2 severities. Tests were performed for each combination of mat design, ATD, severity and posture using an antivehicle under‐belly injury simulator. The differences between mitigation systems were larger under the H‐III compared to the MiL‐Lx. There was little difference in how the 2 ATDs and how posture ranked the mitigation systems. Results from this study suggest that conclusions obtained by testing in the seated position can be extrapolated to the standing. However, the different percentage reductions observed in the 2 ATDs suggests different levels of protection. It is therefore unclear which ATD should be used to assess such mitigation systems. A correlation between cadavers and ATDs on the protection offered by <b>blast</b> <b>mats</b> is required in order to elucidate this issue...|$|R
50|$|<b>Blasting</b> <b>mats</b> {{made from}} used tires can serve a double purpose as road stabilizers, or road surface, in {{locations}} where roads {{leading to the}} blasting site are unstable or nonexistent, or {{in areas where the}} surface needs to be protected from heavy machinery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blasting</b> <b>mats</b> {{made from}} rope woven on wires were first {{used during the}} {{construction}} of the IRT Third Avenue Line in New York City in the early 1900s. They were used to protect the surrounding buildings and were favored since they prevented fly rock but vented gasses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blasting</b> <b>mats</b> {{are often}} used in {{combination}} with blasting blankets as an additional layer over the mats. The blankets are larger than the mats designed to retain the fragments that have managed {{to pass through the}} <b>mat.</b> <b>Blasting</b> blankets are used for both horizontal and vertical blasting. Blasting blankets consist of a fine-mesh strong net or industrial felt from paper mills. Both mats and blankets are designed to let air and gasses from the explosion pass through the cover and retain fragments.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of {{incidents}} with fatal outcomes {{have been caused by}} fly rock. In most of these, <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> were not used or they were placed over the blasting face in an incorrect manner. Such an incident occurred in August 2015, in Cape Ray, Newfoundland and Labrador when a 7 kg fly rock travelled about 250 m from the blast siteand crashed through the kitchen ceiling of a nearby house.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blasting</b> <b>mats</b> {{are used}} when {{explosives}} are detonated {{in places such}} as quarries or construction sites. The mats are placed over the blasting area to contain the blast, suppress noise and dust as well as prevent high velocity rock fragments called fly rock (or flyrock) from damaging structures, people or the environment in proximity to the blast site. The amount of fly rock can be reduced by proper drilling in the bedrock for the charges, but in practice it is hard to avoid.|$|R
50|$|Construction materials. Entire homes can be {{built with}} whole tires by ramming them full of earth and {{covering}} them with concrete, known as earthships. They are used in civil engineering applications such as sub-grade fill and embankments, back-fill for walls and bridge abutments, sub-grade insulation for roads, landfill projects, and septic system drain fields. Tires are also bound together and used as different types of barriers such as: collision reduction, erosion control, rainwater runoff, <b>blasting</b> <b>mats,</b> wave action that protects piers and marshes, and sound barriers between roadways and residences.|$|R
40|$|Public concern {{regarding}} {{the effects of}} noise generated by the detonation of excess and obsolete explosive munitions at U. S. Army demolition ranges is a continuing issue for the Army's demilitarization and disposal groups. Recent concerns of citizens living near the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant (MCAAP) in Oklahoma have lead the U. S. Army Defense Ammunition Center (DAC) to conduct a demonstration and evaluation of noise abatement techniques that {{could be applied to}} the MCAAP demolition range. With the support of the DAC, MCAAP, and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), three types of noise abatement techniques were applied: aqueous foams, overburden (using combinations of sand beds and dirt coverings), and rubber or steel <b>blast</b> <b>mats.</b> Eight test configurations were studied and twenty-four experiments were conducted on the MCAAP demolition range in July of 2000. Instrumentation and data acquisition systems were fielded for the collection of near-field blast pressures, far-field acoustic pressures, plant boundary seismic signals, and demolition range meteorological conditions. The resulting data has been analyzed and reported, and a ranking of each technique's effects has been provided to the DAC...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{mitigating}} blast {{pressures and}} fragments {{from a large}} steel tank filled with 630 lbs of Otto fuel were investigated experimentally. Methods for mitigating the debris threat caused by the breakup of a reinforced concrete bay that housed the fuel tank were also investigated. The Otto fuel was assumed to have a TNT equivalency of 1. 0. Several mitigation techniques were investigated during a one-fifth scale test series including: sand fill around the Otto fuel tank and concrete bay, a steel plate catch system for fragments and debris, a high strength fiber wrap {{on the walls of}} the bay, and <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> around the bay. All the concepts included some amount of sand fill around the tank. Substantial reductions in blast overpressure hazards were measured in all cases, but concrete debris throw distances were not reduced to acceptable distances. A case where the fuel tank was located in a large sand berm outside the bay was modeled in a subsequent one-third scale test series and acceptable reductions in both blast overpressure and fragment hazards were measured. The reduction in the peak pressure and impulse measured during both test series was found to be a function of the scaled radius of the sand placed around the charge and scaled standoff distance.

5000|$|As a {{professional}} wrestler, Don Sebastian did not excite onlookers {{in his early}} career. [...] "The opening match between Tony Morelli and Don Sebastian that went to a draw with each winning a fall was a complete frost and was virtually <b>blasted</b> from the <b>mat</b> by the disapproval of fans." [...] But by 1958, billed as “heavyweight champion of Spain,” Don Sebastian {{had learned how to}} wrestle.|$|R
40|$|The New York State Department of Transportation {{recently}} commenced highway widening {{and drainage}} improvement projects in Clarence and Amherst, NY. Drainage improvements including {{the installation of}} storm sewer lines required excavation {{to a depth of}} 2. 5 m (8. 2 ft). In September 2002, NYSDOT stopped further blasting when 800 ppm CO was detected {{in the basement of a}} house near the blasting site. At the insistence of NYSDOT, the general contractor developed a new blast plan with the assistance of an environmental consultant. The plan provided for the installation of multi-gas monitors in buildings of special concern and/or with basements and residential type CO monitors in all other buildings within 100 m (330 ft) of the blast. The multi-gas monitors would be remotely monitored. The plan provided action levels which would ensure public safety. The blast design was also modified to allow for better venting of CO. Blasts were limited to 20 ft lengths. The overburden was to be removed from the rock and <b>blasting</b> <b>mats</b> put in place to prevent flyrock. Approximately twenty feet of trench adjacent to the blast was left open to allow ground movement and gas release. The use of CO monitors was effective to alert occupants of a building to the presence of CO. The most effective appeared to be the residential type CO alarms with digital readouts. They were simple and easy to use and allowed the public to participate in the process. False alarms were repeatedly received with the more sophisticated instrumentation. Residential type CO monitors are preferable to warn people near blast sites. More sophisticated instrumentation should be avoided unless personnel are experienced in its use. A general overview of the blasting and monitoring is presented and discussed. The use and effectiveness of residential type CO monitors and multi-gas monitors are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Set in {{the near}} future and narrated by Jo, a Victim Rights Advocate, the story begins as Jo arrives at the Hi-Tec thirty-three million dollar holding cell where Lissy is being held. Jo is there to {{interview}} Lissy Tomer, a twenty-one-year-old woman who was beaten up by her abusive husband. The holding cell is state of the art with CCTV, microwave eyes, pressure <b>mats,</b> <b>blast</b> doors, laser blinds, eight different kinds of gas, and Vulcan mini cannons form the Helipad three floors above.|$|R
40|$|The improvised {{explosive}} device (IED) has been the characteristic weapon of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under-vehicle explosions result in rapid floor deformation, transmitting short duration, high amplitude loading to the occupant’s foot and ankle. Current operational vehicles are subjected to full-scale explosions to assess the level of protection they offer their occupants. The decision to pass or fail a vehicle design is made through assessing the axial force transmitted through the lower extremity of a ‘dummy’ which {{has been designed to}} behave like a human. This thesis investigates the ability of combat boots to reduce the severity of injuries during under-vehicle explosions. Both experimental and numerical techniques were used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the behaviour of the combat boot under high rate loading. Initially, drop rig experiments were conducted to assess the shock absorbing capacity of the two combat boot designs most commonly used by UK troops. Following on, more complex experiments were conducted using an anti-vehicle under-belly injury simulator (AnUBIS) which was designed, developed and characterised to simulate floor displacement during an under-vehicle explosion. AnUBIS was used to compare the response of cadaveric specimens against two dummy designs; the Hybrid-III and the MiL-Lx. The MiL-Lx was found to be more biofidelic than the Hybrid-III. Finite element models of both the MiL-Lx and a combat boot were developed and used to investigate the sensitivity of the materials and geometry of the combat boots in reducing the force transmitted to the MiL-Lx during an under-vehicle explosion. Finally, two commercially available <b>blast</b> <b>mat</b> designs were assessed using AnUBIS and both the MiL-Lx and Hybrid-III. The two ATDs ranked the mats in the same order; however, the percentage reduction in peak force was different. The experimental and numerical approach used in this thesis has developed a greater understanding of both the biofidelity of current ATDs and the capacity of current mitigating technologies. This approach can be used to develop and assess mitigation technologies for use in future conflicts where under-vehicle explosions are a significant threat. Open Acces...|$|R
50|$|Mats {{can be used}} singly or {{in layers}} {{depending}} on the size of the blast charge, the type of mat and the amount of protection needed. They can be used horizontally on the ground or vertically hanging from cranes or attached to structures. In the vertical capacity the mats are sometimes referred to as blasting curtains. When used in <b>blasting</b> tunnels the <b>mats</b> can be placed in patterns designed to let the mats stabilize each other and to direct the discharge from the explosion out of the tunnel.|$|R
