25|$|After the 1964 season, Chuck Fairbanks, an {{assistant}} coach at Houston, was offered a job at Tennessee. He wanted to accept, {{but it was the}} middle of the summer and unusually late for a coaching move, so he decided to stay loyal to Houston and remained there. After the next season, he was offered a position as {{an assistant}} on Mackenzie's staff at Oklahoma, a position he felt was a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>than</b> the Tennessee position. Immediately after the 1965 season, Fairbanks was offered a job at Missouri with the promise that he would be the head coach within four years. He declined and stayed at Oklahoma. Four months later, Coach Mackenzie died and Fairbanks was named head coach. It did not take long for Fairbanks to turn the team around. In his first season in 1967, his squad went 10–1. They entered their sixth game with a 5–1 record (their only loss was a two-point loss to rival Texas) and unranked and beat ninth ranked Colorado, 23–0. This propelled Fairbanks's team to a number eight ranking. They continued their romp through the season and beat #2 Tennessee 26–24 in the Orange Bowl. They finished the season ranked number three in the country.|$|E

However, the results found by these authors differ regarding gender.

Also, when gender was entered alone in the moderation model, it {{did not result in}} any significant effect on the job performance. On the other hand, Lauring and Selmer (2014) determined that female SIEs have <b>better</b> <b>job</b> performance <b>than</b> male SIEs.

He is desperate to get cash, and will do almost anything to get it. Gorgonzola also loves to play Sniffleball, as seen in the episode Sniffleball. Despite his unpleasant and boastful attitude to Chowder, Chowder sees him as a close friend, which irritates him even more. Gorgonzola is an apprentice to Stilton, who is a candle holder, hence why both characters have burning candles on their heads.|$|E

The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people aren't particularly complex, that {{the full range of}} their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the TV.

The job never provided an easy route into understanding the di Marcos' characters…The most visible jobs tend to be taken by the strongest, most vivid characters. Confined to their restaurant, the di Marcos could only become involved in Walford life when other characters came over to eat a carbonara. And how often do working-class East End people do that? If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they weren't working. Transforming Giuseppe's into a daytime sandwich bar, and sending Teresa onto the market were bold rescue attempts, but they came too late. The viewers had already decided they didn't much care…Because of their jobs, the di Marcos became a largely self-contained unit…" ...|$|E
