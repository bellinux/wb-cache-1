25|$|Limnology is {{the study}} of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the {{littoral}} zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or <b>benthic</b> <b>zone,</b> where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems.|$|E
500|$|Marine {{habitats}} include brackish water, estuaries, bays, {{the open}} sea, the intertidal zone, the sea bed, reefs and deep water zones. Further variations include rock pools, sand banks, mudflats, brackish lagoons, sandy and pebbly beaches, and seagrass beds, all supporting their own flora and fauna. The <b>benthic</b> <b>zone</b> or seabed provides {{a home for}} both static organisms, anchored to the substrate, and for a large range of organisms crawling on or burrowing into the surface. Some creatures float among the waves {{on the surface of}} the water, or raft on floating debris, others swim at a range of depths, including [...] organisms in the demersal zone close to the seabed, and myriads of organisms drift with the currents and form the plankton.|$|E
500|$|Queen conch embryos hatch 3–5 {{days after}} spawning. At {{the moment of}} hatching, the [...] protoconch (embryonic shell) is {{translucent}} and has a creamy, off-white background color with small, pustulate [...] markings. This coloration is different from other Caribbean Lobatus, such as Lobatus raninus and Lobatus costatus, which have unpigmented embryonic shells. Afterwards, the emerging two-lobed veliger (a larval form common to various marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) spend several days developing in the plankton, feeding primarily on phytoplankton. Metamorphosis occurs some 16–40 days from the hatching, when the fully grown protoconch is about 1.2mm high. After the metamorphosis, L.gigas individuals {{spend the rest of}} their lives in the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone</b> (on or in the sediment surface), usually remaining buried during their first year of life.|$|E

25|$|In the ocean, {{the seals}} {{apparently}} live alone. Most females dive in pelagic zones for foraging, while males dive in both pelagic and <b>benthic</b> <b>zones.</b> Individuals will return annually {{to the same}} hunting areas. Due to the inaccessibility of their deep-water foraging areas, no comprehensive information has been obtained about their dietary preferences, although some observation of hunting behavior and prey selection has occurred.|$|R
2500|$|Fish have a {{range of}} {{physiological}} tolerances that are dependent upon which species they belong to. [...] They have different lethal temperatures, dissolved oxygen requirements, and spawning needs that are based on their activity levels and behaviors. [...] Because fish are highly mobile, they are able to deal with unsuitable abiotic factors in one zone by simply moving to another. [...] A detrital feeder in the profundal zone, for example, that finds the oxygen concentration has dropped too low may feed closer to the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone.</b> [...] A fish might also alter its residence during different parts of its life history: hatching in a sediment nest, then moving to the weedy <b>benthic</b> <b>zone</b> to develop in a protected environment with food resources, and finally into the pelagic zone as an adult.|$|E
2500|$|Bottom {{trawling}} is trawling (towing a trawl, {{which is}} a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is {{also referred to as}} [...] "dragging". The scientific community divides bottom trawling into benthic trawling and demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Aquatic plants live in {{both the}} benthic and pelagic zones and can be grouped {{according}} to their manner of growth: [...] 1) emergent = rooted in the substrate but with leaves and flowers extending into the air, 2) floating-leaved [...] = rooted in the substrate but with floating leaves, 3) submersed = growing beneath the surface and 4) free-floating macrophytes = not rooted in the substrate and floating on the surface. These various forms of macrophytes generally occur in {{different areas of the}} <b>benthic</b> <b>zone,</b> with emergent vegetation nearest the shoreline, then floating-leaved macrophytes, followed by submersed vegetation. [...] Free-floating macrophytes can occur anywhere on the system’s surface.|$|E
2500|$|Aquatic {{plants are}} more buoyant than their {{terrestrial}} counterparts because freshwater {{has a higher}} density than air. [...] This makes structural rigidity unimportant in lakes and ponds [...] (except in the aerial stems and leaves). [...] Thus, the leaves and stems of most aquatic plants use less energy to construct and maintain woody tissue, investing that energy into fast growth instead. In order to contend with stresses induced by wind and waves, plants must be both flexible and tough. [...] Light, water depth and substrate types {{are the most important}} factors controlling the distribution of submerged aquatic plants. [...] Macrophytes are sources of food, oxygen, and habitat structure in the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone,</b> but cannot penetrate the depths of the euphotic zone and hence are not found there.|$|E
2500|$|Lentic {{systems are}} diverse, {{ranging from a}} small, {{temporary}} rainwater pool a few inches deep to Lake Baikal, which has a maximum depth of 1740 m. The general distinction between pools/ponds and lakes is vague, but Brown states that ponds and pools have their entire bottom surfaces exposed to light, while lakes do not. [...] In addition, some lakes become seasonally stratified (discussed in more detail below.) [...] Ponds and pools have two regions: the pelagic open water zone, and the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone,</b> which comprises the bottom and shore regions. [...] Since lakes have deep bottom regions not exposed to light, these systems have an additional zone, the profundal. These three areas can have very different abiotic conditions and, hence, host species that are specifically adapted to live there.|$|E

50|$|There {{are over}} 125 extant species of choanoflagellates {{distributed}} globally in marine, brackish and freshwater environments from the Arctic to the tropics, occupying both pelagic and <b>benthic</b> <b>zones.</b> Although most sampling of choanoflagellates has occurred between 0 m and 25 m, {{they have been}} recovered from as deep as 300 m in open water and 100 m under Antarctic ice sheets. Many species are hypothesized to be cosmopolitan {{on a global scale}} Diaphanoeca grandis, while other species are reported to have restricted regional distributions.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s the European Union {{introduced}} a Cod Recovery Plan which covers the North Sea (incl. the Eastern English Channel and the Kattegat), the Irish Sea and waters to the West of Scotland where cod {{has continued to}} decline. It is broadly accepted that the plan has been a failure and has not delivered its objective of recovering the cod stocks in these areas because of the plan’s over reliance on effort (days-at-sea) that created an indiscriminate ‘race to fish’ which in fact increased fishing mortality on the biomass for cod, on other demersal species and had a destructive impact on the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone</b> of the seabed where it is intensely fished. [...] On the other hand, conservation initiatives undertaken by fishermen working in cooperation with government, such catch-quota management, have made a very meaningful contribution to the recovery of cod in the central and northern North Sea. [...] The biomass of cod in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland remains depleted. [...] A temporary cod plan that excludes a days-at-sea regime will apply from 1 January 2017 before this is superseded by new multi-species plans for individual sea basins; e.g. the North Sea multi-annual plan which was proposed by the European Commission in August 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Zooplankton {{are tiny}} animals {{suspended}} {{in the water column}}. [...] Like phytoplankton, these species have developed mechanisms that keep them from sinking to deeper waters, including drag-inducing body forms and the active flicking of appendages such as antennae or spines. Remaining in the water column may have its advantages in terms of feeding, but this zone’s lack of refugia leaves zooplankton vulnerable to predation. [...] In response, some species, especially Daphnia sp., make daily vertical migrations in the water column by passively sinking to the darker lower depths during the day and actively moving towards the surface during the night. Also, because conditions in a lentic system can be quite variable across seasons, zooplankton have the ability to switch from laying regular eggs to resting eggs when {{there is a lack of}} food, temperatures fall below 2°C, or if predator abundance is high. [...] These resting eggs have a diapause, or dormancy period that should allow the zooplankton to encounter conditions that are more favorable to survival when they finally hatch. The invertebrates that inhabit the <b>benthic</b> <b>zone</b> are numerically dominated by small species and are species rich compared to the zooplankton of the open water. [...] They include Crustaceans (e.g. crabs, crayfish, and shrimp), molluscs (e.g. clams and snails), and numerous types of insects. These organisms are mostly found in the areas of macrophyte growth, where the richest resources, highly oxygenated water, and warmest portion of the ecosystem are found. [...] The structurally diverse macrophyte beds are important sites for the accumulation of organic matter, and provide an ideal area for colonization.

Leaf decomposition was much faster in the circumneutral stream, both in the hyporheic and <b>benthic</b> <b>zones</b> (k = 0. 0068 and 0. 0534 d− 1, respectively), than in the most acidic one (k = 0. 0016 and 0. 0055 d− 1, respectively), and correlated well with the acidic gradient in both compartments. Interestingly, leaf litter decomposition was less affected by acidification in hyporheic compared to benthic compartments, likely due to the relatively low sensitivity of fungi, which were the main decomposers of buried coarse particulate organic matter.
