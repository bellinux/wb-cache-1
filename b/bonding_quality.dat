The induced energy cost {{has opened the}} way to develop alternatives processes with low energy/ carbon materials such as Warm Mix (WMA). Their manufacturing requires specifics techniques to achieve similar performances to those of Hot Mix (HMA). However, the manufacturing temperature reduction can locally lead to imperfect bonding between bitumen and aggregates, although <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> measurement remains a challenge. This paper deals with mechanical performance of some mixes manufactured according to WMA processes in comparison to HMA. In addition, bitumen was extracted from the mixes and its rheological properties were studied. In a second step, the <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> was assessed by studying the heat fluxes exchanged between hot bitumen and warm aggregate in asphalt mix manufacturing conditions.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{preparation}} of the surfaces to be bonded {{is critical to the}} success of composite bonds. Peel ply surface preparation is attractive from a manufacturing and quality assurance standpoint, but is a well known example of the extremely system-specific nature of composite bonds. This study examined the role of the surface energy, morphology, and chemistry left by peel ply removal in resulting <b>bond</b> <b>quality.</b> It also evaluated the use of contact angle surface energy measurement techniques for predicting the resulting <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> of a prepared surface. The surfaces created by preparing three aerospace fiber-reinforced composite prepregs were compared when prepared with a nylon vs a polyester peel ply. The prepared surfaces were characterized with contact angle measurements with multiple fluids, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray electron spectroscopy. The laminates were bonded with aerospace grade film adhesives. <b>Bond</b> <b>quality</b> was assessed via double cantilever beam testing followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces. The division was clear between strong bonds (GC of 600 - 1000 J/m 2 and failure in cohesion) and weak bonds (GC of 80 - 400 J/m 2 and failure in adhesion). All prepared laminates showed the imprint of the peel ply texture and evidence of peel ply remnants after fabric removal, either through SEM or XPS. Within an adhesive system, large amounts of SEM-visible peel ply material transfer correlated with poor <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> and cleaner surfaces with higher <b>bond</b> <b>quality.</b> The both sides of failed weak bonds showed evidence of peel ply remnants under XPS, showing that at least some failure is occurring through the remnants. The choice of adhesive was found to be significant. AF 555 adhesive was more tolerant of peel ply contamination than MB 1515 - 3. Although the <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> results varied substantially between tested combinations, the total surface energies of all prepared surfaces were very similar. Single fluid contact angle measurements/water break tests were therefore not predictive of <b>bond</b> <b>quality,</b> and are recommended against. The multiple fluids used allowed the construction of wettability envelopes, a more detailed look at the surface energy profile. The envelopes of nylon and polyester prepared systems were noticeably different, but while potentially useful for detecting changes or errors in surface {{preparation of}} known systems, they were not valid for predicting <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> in new systems.

In ultrasonic transducers good diffusion bond means good acoustic coupling of piezoelement to the protector and this coupling must withstand high temperatures. <b>Bond</b> <b>quality</b> tests comprise piezoelement electrodes adhesion issues as well.

40|$|Purpose - This work aims to {{evaluate}} the influence of rheological properties of building materials on the <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> and ultimate tensile strength in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, through the investigation of parts printed by semi-crystalline and amorphous resins. Little information is currently available {{about the influence of}} the crystalline nature on FDM-printed part quality. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-crystalline polyamide 12 and amorphous acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were used to assess the influence of rheological properties on <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> and the tensile strength, by varying three important process parameters: materials, liquefier temperature and raster orientation. A fractography of both tensile and freeze-fractured samples was also investigated. Findings - The rheological properties, mainly the melt viscosity, were found to have a significant influence on the <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> of fused filaments. Better <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> and higher tensile strength of FDM parts printed with semi-crystalline PA 12, as compared with amorphous ABS, are suggested to be a result of higher initial sintering rates owing to the lower melt viscosity of PA 12 at low shear rates. Near-full dense PA 12 parts were obtained by FDM. Originality/value - This project provides a variety of data and insight regarding the effect of materials properties on the mechanical performance of FDM-printed parts.
