40|$|Abstract—A {{huge amount}} of surplus soil and muddy soil was {{produced}} from the construction earth works in Japan. To reuse these soils in the construction sites, the soil improvements by mixing with cement or lime were sometime adopted. Recently, the {{case in which the}} improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted was supposed. As the improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted, it was necessary to evaluate the strength of the improved soil. However, the strength of stabilized soil was decreased by repetition of excavation, refill <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes.</b> In this paper, the deterioration of strength of the lime-stabilized soil subjected to the repetition of crush <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> was discussed. A series of unconfined compression tests were carried out to evaluate the deterioration of strength of the stabilized soil by repeating crush <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes.</b> As a result, it is found that the strength was decreased by repetition of crush <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> from that without the crush <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> However, the deteriorated strength of the stabilized soil which was repeatedly crushed and compacted had similar strength to that of the soil with one-time of crush and comaction process.

30|$|Recent {{studies of}} active Californian faults {{allow us to}} {{investigate}} the mechanisms of fluid flow and crack sealing along faults and to model fluid pressure evolution during earthquake cycles. The model is first based on the observation that fluids flow from depth along active faults (stables isotopes and traces elements analyses). The model is also based {{on the study of}} mechanisms of deformation of rocks near and within active faults at depth. Sampling was performed in faults that have been recently uplifted. Studies on thin sections of rocks produce evidence of the mechanisms of crack sealing <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> of fractured zones as transient processes after each earthquake. We found that pressure solution creep and crack sealing are likely to control deformation and permeability change during inter-seismic period. Crack sealing <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> are modeled to give the kinetics of these processes. Then numerical modeling of fluid pressure and transfer around active faults have been performed by integrating slow changes in permeability by crack sealing, gouge <b>compaction</b> <b>and</b> fluid flow from depth. This modeling shows that location and evolution of fluid overpressure varies during the inter-seismic period depending on the heterogeneity of the faults (nature of minerals and fluids, spacing between micro-fractures, thermodynamic and kinetics parameters).|$|R
30|$|Left {{ventricular}} non-compaction (LVNC) is a myocardial disorder {{characterized by}} prominent and excessive trabeculations and deep intratrabecular recesses. These recesses {{communicate with the}} ventricular cavity rather than the coronary circulation [78]. Chin et al. [79] were the first group {{to use the term}} LVNC in their review of eight cases in 1990. Left ventricular non-compaction is postulated to arise from an abnormality of the normal myocardial maturation process. The early fetal myocardium has deep recesses between loosely interwoven fibres, which communicate with the ventricular cavity. The trabeculations provide oxygenation exchange by creating a larger surface for direct exchange diffusion from the cardiac lumen. In the 5 th– 8 th weeks of fetal life, the coronary circulation develops. obviating the need for direct exchange transfusion and in a normal fetus the loosely interwoven fibres undergo compaction [80]. The severity of LVNC will depend on the timing of the arrest in the myocardial maturation <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Compaction</b> moves from base to apex, from epicardium to endocardium and from the septal to the lateral wall. This process of maturation explains why the apex and midventricular lateral segments are more commonly involved in LVNC [81]. Histology demonstrates that ventricular endothelium lines the recesses and is in continuity with the ventricular cavity [82]. Other histopathological characteristics include focal ischemic necrosis within the trabeculations and endocardial layer, compensatory hypertrophy of the myocardium, interstitial fibrosis and scarring reflecting focal replacement fibrosis [83].|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility {{was done on}} Aptian–Albian sediments from the Basque–Cantabrian basin. Samples were collected from 39 sites in the halokinetic sequences of the Bakio, Bermeo, Guernica and Mungia diapirs; 28 sites were sampled close to diapirs, and 11 sites were far from the diapir edges. The magnetic foliation is parallel to bedding, suggesting it reflects depositional <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes,</b> whereas the orientation of magnetic lineation varies. Far from the diapir edges, the magnetic lineation is interpreted as being related to the regional Pyrenean compression. Close to diapir edges, the observed behaviour shows that diapirs, predominantly formed by rigid ophites, have acted as buttresses, with shadow areas at their northern faces being protected from the Pyrenean compression. The high sensitivity of AMS makes it a very useful tool to distinguish deformation in halokinetic sequences related to diapir growth from that related to subsequent compression.

40|$|Iron ore {{is a major}} mineral {{resource}} and mining is a primary industry and {{a major contributor to}} Australian economy. In the iron ore industry, the size of iron ore products are required to be within the proper range for better handling, transportation and storage. Grinding <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> are widely used for size reduction and aggregation of raw iron ore. Both processes are capital- and energy-intensive. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} grinding <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> are properly designed and operated at optimum operating conditions. Grinding is a common process to reduce particle size. Improving grinding energy efficiency, however, represents a significant challenging problem in research community for years. The phenomena involved in grinding are very complicated and multi-scaled. Correspondingly, the control and optimisation of a grinding process is better developed at the particle scale. The grinding performance of a grinding circuit depends on the grinding environment as well as and the 'grindability' ofthe feed particles. To test the grindability of particles, two types of experiments can be conducted. One is to test the bulk grindability of particles (e. g. the Bond index). Another is to investigate the breakage behaviour of individual particles. The single or individual particle approach can overcome this problem by generating information that can be generally used for the evaluation of the breakage behaviour of particles under a given condition. Compaction is an economical and efficient processing method to transform loose powders into a dense compact. Density and mechanical strength are two main characteristics of the product and they change during the <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> The performance of compaction is affected by <b>compaction</b> condition <b>and</b> properties of particles, including compaction load, particle size, mixture, moisture and lubricant.

The <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> is modeled by a discrete element method while using elastic and plastic loading, elastic unloading and adhesion at contacts. Paper A investigates the dynamic compaction of a one-dimensional chain of homogenous particles. The development of the elasto-plastic shock waves, its propagation and influence on the <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> are examined. Simulations yield information on the contact behavior, velocity of the particle and its deformation during dynamic compaction. Effects of changing loading parameters on the <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> are also discussed. Paper B addresses the non-homogeneity in a chain having; particles of different sizes and materials, voids between the particles and particles with/without adhesion between them. Simulations show transmission and reflection of elasto-plastic shock wave during <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> The particle deformation during incident and reflected shocks and particle velocity fluctuations due to voids between particles are simulated. The effects of adhesion on particles separation during unloading stage are also discussed. Paper C develops a simulation model for a high-velocity <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> with auxiliary pistons, known as relaxation assists, in a compaction assembly. The simulation results reveals that the relaxation assists offer; smooth compaction during loading stage, prevention of  the particle separation during unloading stage and conversion of  higher kinetic energy of hammer into particles deformation.  Furthermore, the influence of various loading elements on <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> is investigates. These results support the findings of experimental work. Paper D further extends the one-dimensional case of Paper A and B into two-dimensional assembly of particles while adding friction between particles and between particles and container walls. Three particular cases are investigated including closely packed hexagonal, loosely packed random and a non-homogenous assembly of particles of various sizes and materials. Consistent with the one-dimensional case, primary interest is the linking of particle deformation with the elasto-plastic shock wave propagation. Simulations yield information on particle deformation during shock propagation and change in overall particles compaction with the velocity of the hammer. The force exerted by particles on the container walls and rearrangement of the loosely packed particles during dynamic loading are also investigated. Finally, the effects of presence of friction and adhesion on both overall particles deformation <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> are simulated. QC 2011031...|$|R

Automation of the spreading and compacting processes of a landfilling operation using an autonomous compactor can reduce exposure of workers to the harmful environment, and thereby lead to improved safety of workers. This paper describes a computer-integrated operations planning system that facilitates (1) the design of landfill cells and (2) the generation of area-covering path plans for spreading <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> by the autonomous compactor. The partitioning of a given landfill site into three-dimensional cells is accomplished by a recursive spatial decomposition technique in which the cell sizes are determined using a probabilistic model for waste generation. A recursive sub-division of each cell into monominoes facilitates the system to automatically deal with any differences between the actual amount of waste generated on a particular day and the amount predicted by the probabilistic model. The partitioned configuration of the landfill site is used to generate the path plan for the autonomous compactor using three motion models, namely straight-up, straight-down, and zig-zag. The computer-integrated system is implemented using PHIGS graphics standard and MOTIF toolkit with C-program binding. ...|$|R

For geotechnical engineers that are designing these types of engineered fill systems, it is useful to have an understanding of the engineering behavior of these mixtures {{as a function of the}} soil mixture <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> that is utilized. This study investigated the effects of various soil mixtures <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> conditions on the strength and compressibility characteristics of compacted clay/sand mixtures. The factors investigated include the: clay mineral type, clay content, dry unit weight, <b>compaction</b> moisture content, <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> energy. To simulate the field <b>compaction</b> <b>process,</b> representative Proctor specimens were prepared for each of the clay/sand mixtures at low, standard, <b>and</b> modified Proctor <b>compaction</b> energy levels. Unconsolidated-undrained triaxial strength tests were conducted at various confining pressures on test specimens prepared from each of the compacted Proctor specimens. One dimensional compression tests were also performed on test specimens prepared from each of the compacted Proctor specimens, to determine the compressibility behavior of each of the compacted soil mixtures. The experimental findings showed that the undrained strength of samples compacted at the same energy level decreased with increasing compaction moisture content. Additionally, the undrained strength increased with increasing confining pressure <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> energy. The results also indicated that the angles of shearing resistance increased with decreasing moisture content, and were largest for specimens compacted at a very low water content with high compaction energy. The values of the cohesion intercept increased with increasing dry density, clay content, and plasticity of the clay fraction. Due to their differences in soil mineral characteristics and as-compacted soil fabric, kaolinite/sand mixtures exhibited higher φ values and lower c values than bentonite/sand mixtures at the same water content relative to the optimum water content. The values of Young's modulus measured in the triaxial test at 50 % of the strength increased with clay content and were higher for dry-ofoptimum specimens. The compression test results further showed that a large percentage of compression occurred tended to occur within the first minute of loading. The compaction moisture content was found to have a more significant effect on a given mixture's compressibility behavior for samples having a high clay content.

40|$|Porous flow of buoyant liquid through {{partially}} {{molten rock}} {{is regarded as}} the initial transport process leading to magma segregation in the mantle. Recent work has identified the importance of matrix deformation <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> in this <b>process.</b> We present finite-difference calculations based on a generalized form of Darcy's law that includes matrix deformation, in two-dimensional Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. We emphasize the existence of solitary wave solutions, called magmons. These waves are regions of locally high porosity that ascend through regions of low, uniform porosity. They differ from diapirs, where the liquid and matrix ascend together. The one-dimensional waves that were previously reported are found to be unstable in two dimensions, breaking down to form two-dimensional waves of circular cross section. Both the development of the instability and the form of the two-dimensional waves are supported by theoretical analysis. Numerical experiments in which two-dimensional waves collide show that {{the extent to which they}} are conserved after collision depends on the lateral offset of the waves. The conservation can be very good; in other cases, larger waves appear to grow at the expense of smaller waves. Although the quantification of the relevant permeability and rheological parameters remains uncertain, geophysically plausible estimates suggest wavelengths of kilometers and velocities of centimeters per year. In our preliminary assessment of the relevance of these results to igneous processes, we find that magmons are unlikely to be important in regions of broad upwelling, such as beneath spreading centers. Here the transport of liquid adjusts to match the supply by melting, <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> are not important. If liquid is supplied from below to a stable partially molten region of the asthenosphere, it is expected to ascend in magmons. This may occur beneath oceanic volcanic centers or in subcontinental mantle. It is possible that magma ascent in magmons leads to spatial and temporal episodicity of volcanic activity, if higher level processes do not obscure this influence. The waveform of a magmon ascends faster than the liquid within the magmon, so new liquid is taken in from above, while original liquid is lost from below. Consequently, magmons can mobilize small degrees of partial melt and deliver it rapidly to the surface...|$|R

Filamentous bulking is typically caused by an overabundance of filamentous organisms that interfere with the settling <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> This phenomenon can be studied and related with settling parameters by automated image analysis using different microscopy acquisitions. However, by using these standard image analysis procedures some relevant information {{about the state of}} the sludge is enclosed.

This study is more complex, taking also the <b>compaction</b> into account <b>and</b> a Fette MP 120 press is used instead of a model. The factors which were confirmed to affect the final shape of the inserts were the fill-shoe velocity, the geometry of the die, the morphology of the powder and if a shaking motion {{was added to the}} fill-shoe or not. It was proven that to minimize the shape irregularities, really high fill-shoe velocities should be avoided. Since different powders have different flow rates, the fill-shoe velocity should be changed depending on which powder is being used. The fill-shoe velocity should also be lower for narrow die geometries since they are harder to fill. Finally, it is good to add a shaking motion to the fill-shoe because it increases the fill density. A different type of powder filling was tested called suction filling. This method turned out to take longer, give the same weight variations between the inserts as the regular filling method and is only able to be used for {{less than half of the}} inserts produced at Sandvik because it can only fill negative geometries...|$|R

A multiple melting peaks thermograms were observed for untreated and most compacted samples indicating differences between crystallites sizes. The compaction treatment involves an increase of PET crystallites size because of molecular bonds rearrangement among the polymeric chains. With DRX, we have showed crystallites size increases for compacted samples when compared with untreated samples. This increase is particularly important in perpendicular direction to (010) crystallographic plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of biomimetic hydroxyapatite-collagen composites is desirable {{from the perspective}} of graft elimination and load-bearing support when treating damaged or diseased bone. Bone is an organized network of carbonated hydroxyapatite mineralized collagen, whose strength and toughness is dependent on the organized array of mineralized collagen fibers that align with applied physiologic stresses. The apatitic calcium phosphate phase, hydroxyapatite, is promising for the biomimetic mineralization of collagen. Hydroxyapatite-collagen composites are osteoconductive and resorbable. However, the mechanical properties of these composites are one or more orders of magnitude less than bone. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce a bone-like hydroxyapatite-collagen composite with an induced collagen fiber alignment in order to improve the mechanical properties of the composite. In this study, environmental and temporal effects on the {{synthesis of}} a hydroxyapatite-collagen composite were characterized and compared to bone. Three dimensional hydroxyapatite-collagen composite scaffolds were fabricated by a combined extrusion <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> producing three different levels of collagen fiber alignment, which were quantified and correlated to the resultant mechanical properties. The levels of collagen fiber alignment corresponded to an expected random alignment, low longitudinal alignment, and high longitudinal alignment. The results showed that a bone-like hydroxyapatite-collagen composite is best synthesized in physiologic to alkaline pH (7. 4 - 8. 0) and allowed to react for 6 hours. Composite scaffolds fabricated with the low longitudinal alignment method produced the highest degree of alignment among the fabrication methods. Degree of collagen alignment produced the best strain <b>and</b> toughness responses. <b>Compaction</b> aided strength related mechanical properties. This study gives proof of concept for a collagen fiber alignment process and indicates that the mechanical properties of a three dimensional HAp/C composite scaffold fabricated by this process are dependent on the degree of collagen fiber alignment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. ERS- 1 /ERS- 2 {{synthetic}} aperture radar interferometry was used to study the 1997 eruption of Okmok volcano in Alaska. First, we derived an accurate digital elevation model (DEM) using a tandem ERS- 1 /ERS- 2 image pair and the preexisting DEM. Second, by studying changes in interferometric oherence {{we found that the}} newly erupted lava lost radar coherence for 5 - 17 months after the eruption. This suggests changes in the surface backscattering characteristics and was probably related to cooling <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>processes.</b> Third, the atmospheric delay anomalies in the deformation interferograms were quantitatively assessed. Atmospheric delay anomalies in some of the interferograms were significant and consistently smaller than one to two fringes in magnitude. For this reason, repeat observations are important o confidently interpret small geophysical signals related to volcanic activities. Finally, using two-pass differential interferometry, we analyzed the preeruptive inflation, coeruptive deflation, and posteruptive inflation and confirmed the observations using independent image pairs. We observed more than 140 cm of subsidence associated with the 1997 eruption. This subsidence occurred between 16 months before the eruption and 5 months after the eruption, was preceded by-• 18 cm of uplift between 1992 and 1995 centered in the same location, and was followed by • 10 cm of uplift between September 1997 and 1998. The best fitting model suggests the magma reservoir esided at 2. 7 km depth beneath the center of the caldera, which was- 5 km from the eruptive vent. We estimated the volume of the erupted material to be 0. 055 km 3 and the average thickness of the erupted lava to be [...] - 7. 4 m. 1...|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} {{pharmaceutical}} products are being developed and manufactured is changing as the focus is shifting to understand the link between material properties and manufacturing processes on critical quality attributes. However, with the increased cost of developing new products companies {{are looking for ways}} to expedite the development process while using less active pharmaceutical ingredient. In order to accomplish the desired state of development and manufacture, the use of material sparing techniques is on the rise. In addition, the use of process analytical technologies allow for real-time monitoring and control of critical material properties to ensure critical quality attributes of the product is met. Through the use of surrogate samples and near infrared spectroscopy it is possible to develop a robust <b>and</b> repeatable roller <b>compaction</b> <b>process</b> using the concepts of quality by design. ^ This study investigates the use of surrogate compacts to develop robust and accurate near infrared spectroscopic chemometric models to predict roller compacted ribbon density. Also, the use of near infrared spectroscopy to identify and monitor the causes of the three dimensional density distribution of roller compacted ribbons in real-time using a multipoint fiber optic probe. Next, this study uses surrogate compacts to understand the impact of compact density on milled granule particle size distribution, granule bulk density, and final tablet tensile strength. The surrogate compact data is then used to predict the impact of the observed three dimensional roller compacted ribbon density distribution on these critical material attributes. Finally, this study discusses the future of pharmaceutical manufacturing in the desired state using the findings from the three studies to develop a robust <b>and</b> repeatable roller <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{changes in}} {{lifestyle}} (e. g., terrestrial vs. aquatic habits) influence tetrapod limb morphology. Similar evolutionary trends in osteogenetic sequences (order of bone ossification) and bone microstructure are often shared in extant tetrapods with similar habit preferences: such data are sometimes available from extinct taxa. The pachypleurosaurids from Monte San Giorgio (Switzerland, Italy) are Triassic marine reptiles with high quality, complete ontogenetic series. We studied osteogenesis and bone histology {{in the four}} species from this locality, comparing these with data from Recent terrestrial lizards and secondarily aquatic reptiles {{in order to determine}} if the osteogenetic sequences of pachypleurosaurids were similar to either the hypothesized plesiomorphic condition for terrestrial eureptilians or those of Recent aquatic reptiles. Pachypleurosaurian limb osteogenesis occurs in two steps: (1) developmental sequences of ossification during embryology and/or in early neonates, (2 a) additional primary periosteal <b>compaction</b> <b>processes,</b> <b>and</b> (2 b) additional primary <b>and</b> secondary endosteal <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> during neonate ontogeny. Taphonomic patterns reveal information on the order of the initiation and termination of these steps, which are (A) onset of ossification, (B) onset of additional <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> (early phase), <b>and</b> (C) termination of additional <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> (final phase). An event pairing analysis found that ossification of forelimb elements in pachypleurosaurids precedes that of the hind limb elements in all osteogenetic stages except for initiation of ossification (A). The order of their early phase <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> is similar to the hypothesized plesiomorphic eureptilian condition, whereas their final phase <b>compaction</b> <b>processes</b> varies among pachypleurosaurids, with S. mirigiolensis showing minor heterochronic shifts and N. edwardsii showing many heterochronic shifts relative to the hypothesized ancestral condition. Pachypleurosaurids from Monte San Giorgio increase the number of heterochronic shifts with decreasing stratigraphic age, showing a transition from more ‘terrestrial’ to more ‘aquatic’ osteogenetic sequences in comparison to data on ossification sequences of Recent aquatic reptiles...|$|R

40|$|Powder {{compaction}} is {{a fundamental}} method for size-enlargement, which is widely applied in many industrial fields. The mechanical strength of a compact is a critical property, which is strongly affected by particle property <b>and</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>process.</b> Thus, better understanding of compact strength under different compaction conditions is of great importance to both fundamental understanding and optimization of engineering practice. This work {{was to develop a}} numerical model based on the finite element method (FEM) to investigate powder compaction. The Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) constitutive equations were adopted in the model. Experiments were also conducted to obtain the values of the parameters in the model. The model was firstly developed to simulate the die compaction of iron ore powders. Low density area was observed at the lower corner where compacts tend to be damaged during handling and transport. During the unloading stage, there was a higher shear stress area located from the top edge to the centre, which is the reason for the capping phenomenon. The model was then coupled with a nonlinear crack model to predict the compact tensile strength through diametrical compression. The effect of compact shape was also investigated. The stress analysis showed there was a higher shear stress area located from top edge to the centre during unloading. With increasing curvature of compact surface, the responses of the compacts changed from brittle to ductile. The predicted bulk loading response was in a good agreement with experimental results in terms of hardening and softening stress-strain responses. The strength decreased as the friction coefficient increased. However, the failure mode did not vary with friction condition The FEM model was then applied to modelling a continuous briquetting of powders. Detailed analysis was carried out to show the material flow behaviour and failure pattern inside the pellets. The cause of crack formation was investigated. A parametric study further demonstrated that material properties and operational conditions all contributed to the bulk behaviour of the formed pellets. The output unit was influenced by friction coefficient and input pressure...|$|R
