40|$|Worldwide the {{prevalence}} of preeclampsia (PE) ranges from 3 to 8 % of pregnancies. 8. 5 million cases are reported yearly, but this is probably an underestimate {{due to the lack}} of proper diagnosis. PE is the most common cause of fetal and maternal death and yet no specific treatment is available. Reliable <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> for prediction and diagnosis of PE would have a great impact on maternal health and several have been suggested. This review describes PE <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> in general and first trimester PE <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> specifically. The main categories described are angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors, placental proteins, free fetal hemoglobin (HbF), kidney markers, ultrasound and maternal risk factors. The specific <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> discussed are: PAPP-A, s-Flt- 1 /PlGF, s-Endoglin, PP 13, cystatin-C, HbF, and α(1) -microglobulin (A 1 M). PAPP-A and HbF both show potential as predictive <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> in the first trimester with 70 % sensitivity at 95 % specificity. However, PAPP-A is not PE-specific and needs to be combined with Doppler ultrasound to obtain the same sensitivity as HbF/A 1 M. Soluble Flt - 1 and PlGF are promising <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> that together show high sensitivity from the mid-second trimester. PlGF is somewhat useful from the end of the first trimester. Screening pregnant women with <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> for PE can reduce unnecessary suffering and health care costs by early detection of mothers at increased risk for PE, thus avoiding unnecessary hospitalization of pregnant women with suspect or mild PE and enabling monitoring of the progression of the disease thereby optimizing time for delivery and hopefully reducing the number of premature births...|$|R

5000|$|This gene encodes a {{secreted}} metalloproteinase which cleaves insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding proteins (IGFBPs). PAPPA's proteolytic function is activated upon collagen binding. It {{is thought to}} be involved in local proliferative processes such as wound healing and bone remodeling. Low plasma level of this protein has been suggested as a <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> for pregnancies with aneuploid fetuses (fetuses with an abnormal number of chromosomes). [...] For example, low PAPPA may be commonly seen in prenatal screening for Down syndrome. [...] Low levels may alternatively predict issues with the placenta, resulting in adverse complications such as intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, placental abruption, premature birth, or fetal death.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Mabel became {{interested}} in the biochemistry of the brain, or neurochemistry, and, as a full professor, led the Laboratory for Neurochemistry Research in the Department of Psychiatry in the University of Wisconsin Medical School, which was conveniently located in the same building as the physiological chemistry, pharmacology, and anatomy departments, where her colleagues worked and from which she drew graduate students. She delved into undergraduate teaching at one point, teaching a course on drugs and the mind in the early 1970s, but her primary teaching activity was guiding graduate students and teaching graduate biochemistry courses. Unlike her earlier research, which exclusively employed animal tissues, Mabel also studied blood samples from humans, including mentally ill patients, and contributed {{to the understanding of the}} biochemical basis of mental illness, showing the first <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> for one of the major psychoses.

40|$|<b>Biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of bone {{metabolism}} {{are divided into}} two groups: formation and resorption markers. Bone turnover is a dynamic process, which increases in postmenopausal period.

Therefore, they may be very useful for the prediction of subsequent bone mineral density changes after HRT in menopausal women. Both oral and transdermal routes of HRT are efficacious in decreasing the levels of <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers.</b> However, markers do not replace bone mineral density measurement. Collagen type I cross linked N-telopeptide, collagen type I cross linked C-telopeptide, and osteocalcin are the most promising markers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Currently used {{clinical}} and radiological findings of particularly mild {{traumatic brain injury}} have limited diagnostic and prognostic value. Methods and results: We conducted a systematic review of selected primary clinical studies on <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of traumatic brain injury in the last 10 years, using an electronic search of the National Library of Medicine’s database MEDLINE. The most explored and clinically relevant <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of acute brain injury are protein S 100 B, neuron-specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition, novel markers such as spectrin breakdown product, c-tau and amiloid-b are presented. Based on clinical trials, the rationale for their use {{in the context of}} severity of traumatic brain injury is outlined. Conclusions: Measurement of <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of brain injury should be introduced in the clinical management of mild traumatic brain injury. The predictive value of current {{clinical and}} radiological findings can be markedly improved by the determination of <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> in mild and severe traumatic brain injury...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 a study {{identified}} {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) as an accurate salivary biomarker of ovulation in females. Researchers measured various hormones in the saliva throughout the menstrual cycle {{and found that}} salivary luteinizing hormone was reliably elevated during the ovulatory period and, for that reason, “salivary LH level is a reliable way to determine ovulation.” [...] A 1983 study of various salivary steroid assays showed that daily salivary progesterone measurements “provides a valuable means of assessing ovarian function”. [...] A 2001 study involved performing daily saliva collection from healthy subjects and plotting these over the entire menstrual cycle. The researchers determined that salivary estradiol and progesterone curves corresponded to the daily profiles normally observed in blood, although of lesser amplitude. [...] In 1999 researchers determined that ELISA-based saliva testing “can serve as a reliable method for estriol determination.” [...] A 2007 article reported that the free testosterone measurement, including via saliva assay, represents “the most sensitive <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> supporting the diagnosis of PCOS.” [...] In 1990 Vuorento, et al., found that luteal phase defects, wherein progesterone levels decline prematurely within the menstrual cycle, were identified with high frequency using salivary progesterone testing among women suffering from unexplained fertility.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{biochemical}} markers, {{especially in}} the assessment of toxic effects and modes of action, under controlled laboratory conditions has increased. However, transposing their use to in situ monitoring or risk assessment evaluations has encountered barriers, mainly related to the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of biochemical variation. In this work, we aimed at understanding if <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> activities (cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase) can be used to monitor the health status of natural populations of fish (Gambusia affinis) and daphnids (Daphnia magna). For that, two ponds with different water properties were chosen as study sites, and organisms collected at four sampling periods along the year. The pattern of <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> responses was not the same in the two species, showing higher integrated <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> response values in the winter for G. affinis and in the autumn for D. magna, suggesting specificities that {{must be taken into account}} in biomonitoring programmes by including representative species of several trophic levels. In the case of G. affinis, the differences in key physicochemical parameters between the two ponds (especially dissolved oxygen levels) did not seem to affect <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> levels as if organisms were already perfectly adapted to their environment. In general, seasonal variation of water quality seems to have an important role on <b>biochemical</b> <b>marker</b> responses. Several parameters above Environmental Quality Standards were identified such as dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia, nitrites, sulphides and metals, but eventual responses to these stressors could not be discriminated from natural variation except for particular cases...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to explore the {{mechanisms}} underlying the association of birth weight with later body mass index (BMI) from the <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> related to metabolism and the Apa I polymorphism in IGF-II gene. Methods: A total of 300 children were selected randomly from the Macrosomia Birth Cohort in Wuxi, China. The height and weight were measured and blood samples were collected. Plasma concentrations of 8 <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> were detected. Apa I polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymor­phism (PCR-RFLP). Results: <b>Biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> were detected for 296 subjects and 271 subjects were genotyped for the Apa I polymorphism. No association was found between birth weight and 8 <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers.</b> In boys, the BMIs of AA, AG and GG genotypes were 16. 10 ± 2. 24 kg/m 2, 17. 40 ± 3. 20 kg/m 2, 17. 65 ± 2. 66 kg/m 2. And there was statistical difference among the three genotypes. But in girls, there was no statistical difference. The birth weights of AA, AG and GG genotypes were 3751. 13 ± 492. 43 g, 3734. 00 ± 456. 88 g, 3782. 00 ± 461. 78 g. And there was no statis­tical difference among the three genotypes. Conclusion: <b>Biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> are not associated with birth weight. Apa I polymorphism may be related to child­hood BMI, but it may be not associated with birth weight. Therefore, <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> and Apa I polymorphism might not play a role in the association of birth weight and BMI...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hyperthyroidism is {{accompanied}} by osteoporosis with higher incidence of fracture rates. The present work aimed to study bone status in hyperthyroidism and to elucidate the impact of severity, duration, and etiology of hyperthyroidism on <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD). Methods Fifty-two male patients with hyperthyroidism, 31 with Graves' disease (GD) and 21 with toxic multinodular goiter (TNG), with an age ranging from 23 to 65 years were included, together with 25 healthy euthyroid men with matched age as a control group. In addition to full clinical examination, patients and controls were subjected to measurement of BMD using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometery scanning of {{the lower half of}} the left radius. Also, some <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of bone turnover were done for all patients and controls. Results <b>Biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of bone turnover: included serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, carboxy terminal telopeptide of type l collagen also, urinary deoxypyridinoline cross-links (DXP), urinary DXP/urinary creatinine ratio and urinary calcium/urinary creatinine ratio were significantly higher in patients with GD and TNG compared to controls (P 0. 05). BMD was significantly lower in GD and TNG compared to controls, but the Z-score of BMD at {{the lower half of the}} left radius in patients with GD (- 1. 7 ± 0. 5 SD) was not significantly different from those with TNG (- 1. 6 ± 0. 6 SD) (> 0. 05). There was significant positive correlation between free T 3 and free T 4 with <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of bone turnover, but negative correlation between TSH and those <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of bone turnover.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} systemic autoimmune disease associated with potentially debilitating joint inflammation, {{as well as}} altered skeletal bone metabolism and co-morbid conditions. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment to control disease activity offers the highest likelihood of preserving function and preventing disability. Joint inflammation is characterized by synovitis, osteitis, and/or peri-articular osteopenia, often accompanied by development of subchondral bone erosions, as well as progressive joint space narrowing. <b>Biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> of joint cartilage and bone degradation may enable timely detection and assessment of ongoing joint damage, and their use in facilitating treatment strategies is under investigation. Early detection of joint damage may be assisted by the characterization of <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> that identify patients whose joint damage is progressing rapidly and who are thus {{most in need of}} aggressive treatment, and that, alone or in combination, identify those individuals who are likely to respond best to a potential treatment, both in terms of limiting joint damage and relieving symptoms.

METHODS: This study included 112 patients with PBC who underwent a complete clinical investigation. We analyzed the correlation (Spearman's test) between ten <b>biochemical</b> <b>markers</b> and their ratios with different stages of PBC. The discriminative values were compared using areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The mean age of patients included in the study was 53. 88 ± 10. 59 years, including 104 females and 8 males. We found a statistically significant correlation between PBC stage and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to platelet ratio (APRI), ALT/platelet count, AST/ALT, ALT/AST and ALT/Cholesterol ratios, with the values of Spearman’s rho of 0. 338, 0. 476, 0. 404, 0. 356, 0. 351 and 0. 325, respectively.
