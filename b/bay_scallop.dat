25|$|The scallop shell symbol {{found its}} way into {{heraldry}} as a badge of those who had been on the pilgrimage to Compostela, although later it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general. Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales' family, the Spencer family coat of arms includes a scallop, as well as both of Diana's sons Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry's personal coats of arms; also Pope Benedict XVI's personal coat of arms includes a scallop; another example is the surname Wilmot and also John Wesley's (which as a result the scallop shell is used as an emblem of Methodism). However, charges in heraldry do not always have an unvarying symbolic meaning, and there are cases of arms in which no family member went on a pilgrimage and the occurrence of the scallop is simply a pun on the name of the armiger (as in the case of Jacques Coeur), or for other reasons. In 1988, the State of New York in the US chose the <b>bay</b> <b>scallop</b> (Argopecten irradians) as its state shell.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the east}} coast of the United States, over the last 100 years, the populations of bay {{scallops}} have greatly diminished due to several factors, but probably is mostly due to reduction in sea grasses (to which <b>bay</b> <b>scallop</b> spat attach) caused by increased coastal development and concomitant nutrient runoff. Another possible factor is reduction of sharks from overfishing. [...] A variety of sharks used to feed on rays, which are a main predator of bay scallops. [...] With the shark population reduced – this apex predator in some places almost eliminated – the rays have been free to feed on scallops to the point of greatly decreasing their numbers.|$|E
40|$|In May 1989 a {{previously}} unidentified apicomplexan parasite {{was found in}} brookstock <b>bay</b> <b>scallops</b> Argopecten irradians from {{the east coast of}} Canada. Host tissue responses ranged from focal hemocytic encapsulation to the formation of abscesses containing necrotic hemocytes, parasites and ceroid. <b>Bay</b> <b>scallops</b> held for 6 mo in closed-system, artificial seawater at 22 to 24 degree C produced detectable infections much earlier than specimens grown in estuarine waters. Additionally, the lesions in experimentally held <b>bay</b> <b>scallops</b> showed less phagocytosis and encapsulation than those found in field-sampled <b>bay</b> <b>scallops.</b> Transmission of the parasite appears to be direct, having occurred during the brief exposure of the spat generation to infected broodstock.

2500|$|The scallop {{family is}} unusual in that {{some members of the}} family are {{dioecious}} (males and females are separate), while other are simultaneous hermaphrodites (both sexes in the same individual), and a few are protoandrous hermaphrodites (males when young then switching to female). Red roe is that of a female, and white, that of a male. [...] Spermatozoa and ova are released freely into the water during mating season, and fertilized ova sink to the bottom. [...] After several weeks, the immature scallops hatch and the larvae, miniature transparent versions of the adults called spat, drift in the plankton until settling to the bottom again (an event called spatfall) to grow, usually attaching by means of byssal threads. Some scallops, such as the Atlantic <b>bay</b> <b>scallop</b> Argopecten irradians, are short-lived, while others can live 20 years or more.

40|$|In recent decades, hatchery-growout {{culture of}} oysters, Crassostrea virginica, and {{northern}} quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, has been commercially successful in Atlantic United States and oysters in Atlantic Canada. Culturists {{have not had}} success, as yet, with northern <b>bay</b> <b>scallops,</b> Argopecten irradians irradians. Large mortalities occur during the culture process, mainly because the scallops are relatively delicate and some die when handled. In addition, too little edible meat, i. e. the adductor muscle, is produced for the culture operation to be profitable. However, three companies, one in Massachusetts, one in New Brunswick, and one on Prince Edward Island, Canada, have discovered that they can produce <b>bay</b> <b>scallops</b> successfully by harvesting them when partially-to fully-grown and selling them whole.

40|$|Poor {{growth and}} {{survival}} of scallops is often reported during early developmental stages. Stage- and species-specific dietary requirements have been identified, but the mechanisms responsible for these differences remain largely unknown. Dietary success depends on food biochemical properties, digestive and/or assimilative capacity, {{as well as the}} animal's specific nutritional demands, which can vary over development and between species. The present study examines developmental changes in the activities of key digestive enzymes in larval and postlarval <b>bay</b> <b>scallops</b> Argopecten irradians and sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus raised on a mixed algal diet until 4 to 5 mm in shell height (SH) and sampled at intervals encompassing major transitions in feeding organ development. Colorimetric assays measured general protease, lipase (esterase) and carbohydrase (3 ̆b 1 -amylase, cellulase and laminarinase) activities. The most pronounced changes in enzymatic activity occurred prior to scallops attaining 1. 2 mm SH in both scallop species. The esterase:protease ratio exhibited similar ontogenetic patterns in both scallop species, decreasing sharply between larval and immediate postlarval stages before increasing to an intermediate level and stabilizing around 1. 2 mm SH. In contrast, mean carbohydrase activities measured over the experimental duration differed between species, with <b>bay</b> <b>scallops</b> exhibiting higher specific activities of 3 ̆b 1 -amylase and cellulase but much lower activities of laminarinase than sea scallops. These findings have implications for understanding scallop utilization of the food supply in nature, as well as developing targeted diets that could enhance their {{growth and survival}} in culture.
