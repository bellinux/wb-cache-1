Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star.

Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually <b>be</b> <b>directly</b> downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E

To answer the problem, the study uses path analysis. The results of this study found that responsiveness, competency, courtesy and credibility <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> giving a significant impact to public satisfaction; whereas real evidence, test power and easiness of accessing <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> not giving significant impact to public trust. The variable of responsiveness and credibility <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> giving significant effect toward public trust; meanwhile, the real evidence, test power, competence, courtesy, and easiness of accessing <b>were</b> <b>directly</b> giving significant impact toward public trust. The public <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> giving no significant impact on trust of satisfaction.

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known.

The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E
