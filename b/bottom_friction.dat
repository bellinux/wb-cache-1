40|$|International audienceBottom {{friction}} is {{an important}} sink {{of energy in the}} ocean. Indeed, high-resolution ocean models need <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> to achieve a satisfactory kinetic energy level at equilibrium. However, <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> has also subtle and discriminating effects on the different energy transfers and therefore on the 3 D structure of the flow, some of which have to be clarified. In this study, those effects on an unstable baroclinic jet are reexamined using a primitive equation model.

The new result is that <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> yields a significant space-scale selection.

40|$|Increased marine activities, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} off-shore exploitation and coastal development, have created an urgent need for improved knowledge of wave conditions in the shallow near-shore regions. In this work, objectives {{have been made to}} investigate the effects of <b>bottom</b> <b>friction,</b> depth-induced wave breaking, and tidal motions on the wave evolution in shallow water, and to apply the wave model (WAM Cycle 4) to the Belgian coastal waters. Firstly, the effects of different <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> formulations on the energy balance equation were quantitatively investigated for fetch-limited shallow water conditions. It was found that the formulation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation has a quite significant effect on the energy balance at shallower water depths. Among the five original formulations for the <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation investigated (i. e., an empirical expression based on the JONSWAP experiment (Hasselmann et al., 1973), three expressions based on the drag law turbulent friction model (Hasselmann and Collins, 1968; Collins, 1972; Madsen et al., 1988 a) and one based on the eddy viscosity friction model (Weber, 1991 a), a difference as big as 70 % for the total energy was reported for a water depth of 15 m and a wind friction velocity of 0. 71 msÂ¯Â¹. It is revealed that the whitecapping dissipation is dominant in shallow water. The contribution of <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> varies clearly with depth, and also from formulation to formulation. The role of <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation becomes more significant as the water becomes shallower. Secondly, it has been proven mathematically and numerically that in shallow water cases, the scaling ability of the energy growth curves with the air friction velocity is model-dependent. The growth curves from the drag law models with a fixed dissipation coefficient CÆ, scale with the air friction velocity U a *. The drag law model with a dynamically changing friction factor, the empirical formulation and eddy viscosity model do not scale with the wind friction velocity U a *. It is concluded that the shallow water data which are presented in dimensionless form (scaled with the air friction velocity) cannot be used to evaluate different model results. Thirdly, the equivalent <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation coefficients are developed so that all five <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation formulations give almost the same growth curves for the total energy and the peak frequency. The equivalent coefficients for the empirical formulation and the three drag law models were obtained and referred to the bottom roughness height in th eddy viscosity model for three different wind velocities and a nondimen sional water depth of 300. The introduced error for other water depths is estimated to be of the order of 5 %. The validity of using equivalent coefficients in real circumstances was tested in the southern North Sea. It is concluded that the use of the empirical JONSWAP formulation with the proper equivalent coefficients is, for many practical operational applications, not only computationally efficient, but should also produce results with the same order of accuracy as the more sophisticated models for the <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation. Finally, wave conditions along the Belgian coast are hindcasted by using the Cycle 4 version of the WAM model for the period from October 1992 to March 1993. The hindcast results have been validated by ERS-l satellite data and buoy data and by the cross comparison with the mu-WAVE model hindcasts. The Cycle 4 version of the WAM model has been extended with inclusion of the depth-limited wave breaking source term and with a choice for the <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> dissipation source term, i. e., the empirical JONSWAP formulation, the drag law expression or the eddy viscosity model.

Significant wave heights, periods, and directions were estimated from dynamic pressure time-series (P; near bottom) and horizontal current velocities (U, V). Surface wave spectra were calculated from the pressure time-series and fitted to the empirical shallowwater Texel, Marsen, and Arsloe wave spectrum. The mean shape parameters used to define the TB wave spectra were:alpha = 0 : 016, gamma = 4 : 26, sigma-a = 0 : 063, sigma-b = 0 : 089. Waves heights were also hindcast using empirical and numerical models. The empirical formulas were derived from fetch-limited shallow water observations and follow the current proposed asymptotic limit to wave growth in shallow depth. The depth range for this empirical formulation is extended from 0. 5 ? 2 m out to 3. 5 m. The model does not work for wind speeds less than 1 m/s and during rapid wind direction changes.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} nonhydrostatic model using idealized sill topography is used {{to examine}} the influence of <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> upon unsteady lee wave generation and flow in the region of a sill. The implications of changes in shear and lee wave intensity in terms of local mixing are also considered. Motion is induced by a barotropic tidal flow which produces a hydraulic transition, associated with which are convective overturning cells, wave breaking, and unsteady lee waves that give rise to mixing on the lee side of the sill. Calculations show that, as <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> is increased, current profiles on the shallow sill crest develop a highly sheared bottom boundary layer. This enhanced current shear changes the downwelling of isotherms downstream of the sill with an associated increase in the hydraulic transition, wave breaking, and convective mixing in {{the upper part of the}} water column. Both short and longer time calculations with wide and narrow sills for a number of sill depths and buoyancy frequencies confirm that increasing <b>bottom</b> <b>friction</b> modifies the flow and unsteady lee wave distribution on the downstream side of a sill.
