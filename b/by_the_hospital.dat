Stans again claims that the mysterious figure will not let him die.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} {{occupied}} the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building was designed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital {{consisted of a}} range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road, with a central entrance under a portico.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1914, the Australian Voluntary Hospital {{moved to}} Wimereux, where it {{established}} a 200-bed hospital. The hospital was well equipped, with motor ambulances donated by organisations in Australia, a pathology laboratory {{and the only}} X-ray unit in the area. A day after it opened on 29 October, it began receiving patients from the First Battle of Ypres. Much of the unit's tents which accommodated the male personnel of the hospital were lost in a blizzard on 11 November 1914, and the men moved to the Golf club house of the Hôtel du Golf et Cosmopolite in Wimereux, which was eventually leased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> and became its officers' mess.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Emma, Henry and Mary Margaret stop <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> to see him, only to {{discover}} that the patient has left on his own and might be bleeding. Regina and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) have also shown up, since Regina is the emergency contact for John Doe. She claims that she had found him {{on the side of the}} road unconscious without any memory of what or who he was. As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy (Lee Arenberg), and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job (since he is actually Sleepy). Emma and the others discover that John Doe went out into the woods.|$|E
5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending {{that she was not}} herself, her mother took her to a physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Sibu Heritage Trail was {{launched}} in 2012 to include 9 landmarks in Sibu, which are: Sibu Heritage Centre, Sibu Old Mosque (Masjid Al-Qadim, built in 1883), Warriors Memorial Site (present burial site of Rosli Dhobi, near An-Nur Mosque), oldest Muslim cemetery, Lau King Howe Hospital Memorial Museum, Hoover Memorial Square, Tua Pek Kong Temple, and Sibu Central Market. All the 9 landmarks {{can be reached by}} 2 kilometres of walking distance from each other. Sibu Heritage Centre is housed in a former Sibu Town Hall. It displays the early beginnings of Sibu, Iban and Malay cultures, with Chinese porcelain and clay vases which can be dated back to the era of Imperial China. Tua Pek Kong Temple is a Buddhist and Taoist Temple which was established in 1870. The 7-storey Guanyin Pagoda (Goddess of Mercy) was built in the 1980s. The Lau King Howe Hospital Memorial Museum is the only medical museum in Malaysia. It displays dental, surgical, and obstetric services offered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> from the 1950s to 1990s. Sungai Merah (Red River) Heritage Walk is the landmark of the earliest settlement of Foochow Chinese in Sibu in 1901.

5|$|The {{building}} remained substantially unchanged until vacated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in 1930. After the freehold {{was purchased}} by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 {{the ground floor of}} the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.|$|E

25|$|To {{respond to}} {{fluctuating}} {{needs in the}} short term, health care industries have used float pool nurses and agency nurses. Float pool nurses are staff employed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> to work in any unit.

Similar to other professionals, both types of nurses can only work within their licensed scope of practice, training, and certification.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its reputation of spending lavishly on food, St. Anthony's was famous for its grammar school, choir and pigs, which roamed freely among the streets identified by bells. Pigs on sale in London, which were considered by officials to be unfit for food were handed over to St. Anthony's. The pigs were fed through charity or by scavenging and later, when their condition improved, they were then taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for use as food for the poor or sick.|$|E

25|$|The {{more mundane}} and secular {{activities}} in the background, {{as evidenced by the}} image of the city crane used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> to measure and fill wine barrels, place the altarpiece's spiritual vision in a worldly context. The measuring of wine was a lucrative concession given to the hospital by the city authorities during the mid-1300s and in the 1470s the hospital secured the right to fish in the Reye river – both activities shown in the far background. The figure of the hospital brother has been variously identified as Jan Floreins or Josse Willems; both held the position of the hospital's wine measurer and so were associated with the crane.|$|E
