5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|With no way {{of knowing}} where the <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, {{supported}} by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode as an example of papal tyranny.|$|E

In 1743 John Roberts and Huw Bedward from Y Rhiw {{were found}} guilty {{of the murder of}} two shipwrecked sailors on the beach at Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742, and hanged; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife thrust into the nape of his neck, and Edward Halesham, described as a <b>boy,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> choked to death. A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Gacy's {{father was}} {{informed}} that his son and another <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> caught sexually fondling a young girl. As a punishment, Gacy was whipped by his father with a razor strop. The same year, Gacy himself was ostensibly molested by a family friend, a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck, then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid his father would blame him.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 10 KLA militants. The Yugoslavs reported suffering no casualties. The KLA claimed two Kosovo Albanian civilians—an eight-year-old boy and a man—were killed in the clashes, and six injured. Yugoslav authorities confirmed that an eight-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed in shelling near the town. By 1 July, the mine was reportedly back in operation.

25|$|Septimius Severus {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic {{language}} fluently and possibly the Berber language too, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent.

25|$|While Astro <b>Boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{well known}} for decades in Japan, the North American release was delayed to {{coincide}} with the premiere of the Astro Boy TV series in 2004. During this delay, Treasure made some game improvements to the North American version of the game. The game received positive reviews from critics, with strong praise focused on the game's visuals, and limited criticism on level design. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.|$|E
25|$|Allen Crum, a 40-year-old retired Air Force tail gunner, was {{a manager}} at the University Book Store Co-Op.

25|$|Although {{intended}} as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in Adventure Comics #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning <b>Boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> renamed Lightning Lad, and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books. The Legion's popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in Adventure Comics, Action Comics, and other titles edited by Mort Weisinger {{over the next few}} years. The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at in those first two stories, was filled with new heroes such as Chameleon Boy, Invisible Kid, Colossal Boy, Star Boy, Brainiac 5, Triplicate Girl, Shrinking Violet, Sun Boy, Bouncing Boy, Phantom Girl, and Ultra Boy. Even Supergirl was recruited as a member.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August, Chikatilo {{killed a}} 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, {{to the banks}} of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a {{shortcut}} to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal. Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth. Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl. Within two weeks an 11-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, in Rostov before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.|$|E
25|$|Save Rock and Roll debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 154,000 copies in the United States, {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan.

Initially, industry sources had forecast both albums to sell around 150,000, but Save Rock and Roll pulled ahead {{by the end of the}} tracking week. The arrival of Save Rock and Roll posted the quartet's then-third biggest sales week, and earned the band its second career {{number one on}} the chart. The album also debuted at number one on Billboard Top Rock Albums and Top Alternative Albums charts. In its second week, it fell to number five on the Billboard 200 with 36,000 sales, a 76% decline. As of January 2015, Save Rock and Roll has sold over 670,000 copies. The week ending April 4, 2015 marked its 100th chart week at No. 95.|$|E

[...] At Lat's request, Berita Publishing hired his friend, Zainon Ahmad, to translate the graphic novel into Malay. [...] This version was published under the title Budak Kampung. [...] By 2008, The Kampung <b>Boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> reprinted 16times, and translated into various languages such as Portuguese, French, and Japanese.

500|$|On February 17, 1840, a {{boy from}} a Greek Orthodox family in Rhodes {{went for a}} walk and did not return. [...] The next day his mother {{reported}} the disappearance to the Ottoman authorities. The island's governor, Yusuf Pasha, ordered a search, but several days' efforts proved fruitless. The European consuls pressed the governor to solve the case: the boy's family was Christian, though without foreign protection. [...] The Greek Christian population of Rhodes, meanwhile, had no doubts that the <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered by the Jews for ritual purposes. An eyewitness reported: [...] "It was firmly believed that the child in question was doomed to be sacrificed by the Jews. The whole island was agitated {{from one end to the}} other." [...] The assurance of the local Christians having been impressed upon the Ottoman authorities, they began searching the Jewish quarter, again in vain.|$|E

[...] Librarian George Galuschak liked the book for its detailed crowd scenes and its diverse cast of charactersboth animal and human. [...] The [...] "energy" [...] in Lat's drawings reminded him of Sergio Aragonés and Matt Groening. [...] Laurel Maury, a reviewer for the Los Angeles Times, likened the book to a Peanuts cartoon, but without the melancholy typical of Charles M. Schulz's work. [...] She said that Lat delivered a [...] "rollicking" [...] world and that his characters' interactions made the story unpretentious and heart-warming. [...] Although Spurgeon believed any single scene in Town Boy was superior to any book from a lesser cartoonist, he preferred the narrower scope of The Kampung Boy; he felt the tighter focus of Lat's first book gave a more personal and deeper insight into the author's growth as a young boy. [...] Town Boy, with its quicker pace, felt to him like a loose collection of heady first-time experiences that failed to explore all possibilities of the encounters.|$|E

500|$|The pilot commences with Dexter {{driving through}} Miami, summarizing, in a monologue, that {{something}} is to occur on that night. After a choir performance at a bandstand, Dexter kidnaps Mike Donovan (Jim Abele), a pastor who rapes and murders young boys, takes him to a remote cabin in the Everglades, and forces him {{to look at the}} bodies of his victims. Before sedating him, Dexter explains that he could never kill a child, because he abides by a moral code. Later, Donovan awakes to find himself strapped to a table. Dexter makes an incision in Donovan's cheek with a scalpel and collects his blood in a slide, and then proceeds to kill him. Dexter, returning from dumping Donovan's remains, narrates that he is not sure why he feels the need to kill, and speaks of his adoptive parents, Harry and Doris Morgan, both of whom are dead. He also believes himself to be emotionally detached from other people. [...] At his apartment, Dexter stores Donovan's blood in a case containing the blood of his other victims. Dexter explains that he kills according to a code taught to him by his foster father who, as a Miami police officer, instructed Dexter on how to avoid being caught, and to kill only those who [...] "deserve it". Flashbacks throughout the episode reveal that Harry first decided to impart these [...] "lessons" [...] upon Dexter after discovering that the <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killing neighborhood pets.|$|E
