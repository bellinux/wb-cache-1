40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} hand function {{problems and}} the reasons for choosing a specific <b>finger</b> <b>splint</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and swan neck deformities. Methods: A qualitative study was performed alongside a randomized, controlled cross-over trial comparing the effectiveness of two types of <b>finger</b> <b>splints</b> (the silver ring splint [SRS] and the prefabricated thermoplastic splint [PTS]) in 50 patients with RA and swan neck deformities. Questions on the patients' main hand function problem and reasons for choosing a specific splint type were performed at baseline and after using each splint. The qualitative analyses included the identification of meaning units and (sub) concepts related to hand function problems and splint preferences. Results: RA patients with swan neck deformities experience problems with flexion initiation, painful proximal interphalangeal joint hyperextension, grip activities and comprehensive hand function activities. Reasons for preferring or not preferring a specific type of <b>finger</b> <b>splint</b> included: effect, ease of use, appearance, comfort and side effects. Apart from the splint slipping off and a negative attitude towards the appearance of the splint, which appeared to be more frequently mentioned in connection with the SRS, no clear pattern of positive or negative appreciation of either type of splint could be distinguished. Conclusion: RA patients with swan neck deformities experience a variety of problems, including impairments in functions and limitations in daily activities. With the prescription of <b>finger</b> <b>splints,</b> a substantial number of potentially positive and negative consequences of their use need to be taken into account.

40|$|Abstract】Objective: Interphalangeal joint con-tracture is a {{challenging}} complication of hand trauma, which reduces the functional {{capacity of the}} entire hand. In this study we evaluated the results of soft tissue distraction with no collateral ligament transection or volar plate removal in comparison with traditional operation of contracture re-lease and partial ligament transection and volar plate removal. Methods: In this prospective study, a total of 40 pa-tients in two equal groups (A and B) were studied. Patients suffering from chronic flexion contracture of abrasive trau-matic nature were included. Group A were treated by soft tissue distraction using pentagonal frame technique and in Group B the contracture release was followed by <b>finger</b> <b>splinting.</b> Results: Analyzed data revealed a significant differ-ence {{between the two groups}} for range of motion in the proximal interphalangeal joints (P 0. 05). There was not {{a significant difference in the}} degrees of flexion contracture between groups (P> 0. 05). Regression analysis showed that using pentagonal frame technique significantly increased the mean improvement in range of motion of proxi-mal interphalangeal joints (P< 0. 001), while the higher the preoperative flexion contracture was observed in proximal interphalangeal joints, the lower improvement was achieved in range of motion of proximal interphalangeal joints after intervention (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Soft tissue distraction using pentagonal frame technique with gradual and continuous collateral liga-ment and surrounding joint tissues distraction combined with skin Z-plasty significantly improves the range of mo-tion in patients with chronic traumatic flexion deformity of proximal and/or distal interphalangeal joints.

Methods Commercial orthosis have been characterized using a universal INSTRON 5565 machine. A computational simulation of the proposed design has been conducted, reproducing its performance and using a model "ad hoc" for the NiTi material. Once the parameters have been adjusted, the design is validated using the same type of test as those carried out on commercial orthosis. Results and Discussion For commercial splint the recovering force falls to excessively low values as the angle increases. Angle curves for different lengths and thicknesses of the proposed design have been obtained, with a practically constant recovering force value over a wide range of angles that vary between 30 ° and 150 ° in every case. Then the whole treatment is possible with only one splint, and without the need of progressive replacements as the joint recovers. Conclusions A new model of splint based on NiTi alloy has been designed, simulated and tested comparing its behaviour with two of the most regularly used splints. Its uses is recommended instead of other dynamic orthosis used in orthopaedics for the PIP joint.

40|$|A new splint is {{described}} {{for the treatment}} of mallet <b>finger</b> deformity.

The period of treatment is s~o~t~r~ The deformity resulting from rupture or avulsion of the extensor insertion at the distal interphalangeal joint has two components: loss of active extension at the DIP joint, and tightening of the extensor insertion at the PIP joint, leading to swan-neck deformity when laxity of the volar plate allows it to develop. Most splints in current use hold the distal joint in extension and leave the proximal joint free. Previous attempts to combine this with splintage of the PIP joint have employed rigid immobilisation, with the risk of producing a flexion contracture. To avoid this, we have designed a dynami...|$|R
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 17 -year-old female {{presented}} with a chief complaint of right fifth finger pain. The patient reported that she was playing volleyball when she blocked an opponent’s shot and sustained an injury to her right fifth finger. Significant findings: Physical exam revealed an open dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) of the right fifth digit. X-ray confirmed dislocation and revealed no fractures. The patient received a tetanus booster, Cefazolin, and the dislocation was then washed out and reduced. Multiple reduction attempts were made and were only successful once the metacarpophalangeal joints were held in 90 degree flexion, which relaxed the lateral bands and enabled the finger to be reduced. Discussion: PIP dislocations result in more complications than those of distal interphalangeal joints (DIP). 1 Dorsal dislocations of the PIP are more common than volar dislocations and usually cause injury to the volar plate and the collateral ligaments. 2 Dislocations are typically reduced with hyper-extension of the middle phalanx followed by longitudinal traction of the distal portion of the finger, and then gentle flexion or palmar force. 1, 2 The <b>finger</b> is then <b>splinted</b> in 20 - 30 degrees of flexion. Open dislocations and fracture dislocations should be evaluated for hand surgery. 1 If left untreated or incompletely reduced, dorsal dislocations of the PIP may lead to swan neck deformities. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: A {{number of}} {{different}} goniometers are designed to measure the range of motion of finger joints. They are frequently used in hand rehabilitation {{in order to measure}} the effect of treatment. The validity and reliability of these goniometers is not always known. During the last decade digital equipment is developed which facilitates processing of (digital stored) data. The question remains if the use of this equipment is reliable and can be compared with measuring joint mobility in the traditional (analogue) way. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the convergent validity, interchangeability and intra-observer reliability of two frequently applied hand-held goniometers. The measurements were taken in normal hands of healthy subjects in order to exclude influence of patient related bias like pain and edema. METHODS: This study was an instrumental study. The goniometers used in the study were the plastic analogue DeVore goniometer (Hand Therapy Devices, Tucson, USA) and the computer linked N 300 (E-link ®, Biometrics, Belgium). Both instruments are used in the Isala Hand Centre in Zwolle, the Netherlands. Measurements with two goniometers were obtained by one observer on both hands of 32 subjects, 6 male and 26 female, 4 were left and 28 right handed. The mean age was 38 years (20 - 58). The thumb and index <b>finger</b> were <b>splinted</b> in two different positions. The metacarpophalangeal joints and the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the thumb and index finger were measured three times with each goniometer. Measurements were performed following a standardized procedure. Convergent validity was assessed by the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The interchangeability was assessed with the limits of agreement in a Bland-Altman plot. The intra-observer reliability was calculated using the intra class coefficient and the mean standard deviations of the repeated measurements. RESULTS: The measurements of the N 300 and the DeVore goniometers revealed a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0, 97. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the upper and lower limits of agreement of the measurements taken with the N 300 and the DeVore were + 6 o and - 7 o. The intra-observer reliability of the N 300 and the DeVore was 0, 99 (ICC) for both instruments. Mean standard deviations of the three repeated measurements showed that 95 % of all repeated measurements fell within 3, 2 o (DeVore) and 3, 9 o (N 300) of each other. CONCLUSIONS: The convergent validity between the N 300 and the DeVore goniometers was high. This means that the measurements of the two goniometers were highly correlated. However, because of the difference between the measurements with the two instruments (± 6 o) it is recommended that the two goniometers should not be used interchangeably when recording results of treatment. The intra-observer reliability was high for both instruments (N 300 3, 9 o, DeVore 3, 2 o). ...|$|R
40|$|Reduced passive {{range of}} motion (PROM) of the {{interphalangeal}} joints of the hand is a common consequence after a traumatic injury. Although mobilizing splinting has become a rehabilitative approach widely accepted by therapists to improve PROM, limited empiricalevidence is available to guide in its prescription. This study investigates the effect of corrective splinting on flexion contracture of thefinger proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) after a traumatic injury of the hand. Seventeen patients with finger flexion contracture of thePIP {{as a result of}} an industrial accident participated in the experimental study. The passive {{range of motion}} of the PIP joint was measuredwith a finger goniometer and patients were randomly allocated to one of two splint programs. Subjects in group A were given dynamicextension splints, and subjects in group B were given static splints. PROM was re- assessed with a goniometer once the patient wasdischarged and started working again. Results indicated significant improvement in both groups in the correction of the finger flexioncontracture (p< 0, 05). Patients with dynamic <b>finger</b> extension <b>splints</b> did not differ significantly from those with static splints in extensiongains. Both types of splints can be recommended for flexion contractures of 35 degrees or less in the PIP joint after a traumatic injury. La pérdida de rango de movimiento pasivo (PROM) en las articulaciones interfalángicas de la mano es una secuela común tras lesiones traumáticas.

El presente estudio investiga el efecto del uso de férulas correctoras en contracturas en flexión de la articulación interfalángica proximal (IFP) de los dedos de la mano tras una lesión traumática. Diecisiete pacientes con una contractura en flexión de la IFP tras una lesión traumática como consecuencia de un accidente laboral participaron en este estudio experimental.
