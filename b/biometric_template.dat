Rather than exposing sensitive biometric authentication data to the internet, user credentials are stored locally and tokenized - preventing malicious 3rd parties from re-using compromised credentials. By combining the user experience of biometric tokenization with the strength of public key cryptography, HYPR provides a decentralized biometric authentication scheme to replace the use of centralized password-based systems.|$|E

They are used to encrypt and authenticate users records, with biometric inputs as a key. Historically, the first biometric system of this kind was designed by Juels and Wattenberg and was called [...] "Fuzzy commitment", where the cryptographic key is decommitted using {{biometric data}}. [...] "Fuzzy", in that context, implies that the value close to the original one can extract the committed value. Later, Juels and Sudan came up with Fuzzy vault schemes which are order invariant for the fuzzy commitment scheme but uses a Reed-Solomon code. Codeword is evaluated by polynomial and the secret message is inserted as the coefficients of the polynomial. The polynomial is evaluated for different values of a set of features of the biometric data. So Fuzzy commitment and Fuzzy Vault were per-cursor to Fuzzy extractors.Fuzzy extractor is a biometric tool to authenticate a user using its own <b>biometric</b> <b>template</b> as a key.
