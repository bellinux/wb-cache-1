During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers.

25|$|Starting {{from the}} Ising model and repeating this {{iteration}} eventually changes all the couplings. When {{the temperature is}} higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated. But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.|$|E

25|$|His {{captaincy}} improved <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> {{with every}} game in all formats. On 16 July 2017, in the one-off test against Sri Lanka at R Premadasa Stadium, Cremer took his maiden test five-wicket haul. With that, Cremer {{became the first}} Zimbabwe captain to take a five-wicket haul as well. However, Zimbabwe lost the match by 4 wickets, where Sri Lanka successfully chased 388 runs to post highest ever run-chase in Asia in tests. Cremer took 9 wickets in the match for 275 runs, which was recorded as best by a Zimbabwe captain in Tests.|$|E
25|$|Habitats and biota do {{frequently}} change. Therefore, {{it follows}} that the process of adaptation is never finally complete. Over time, it may happen that the environment changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E
25|$|This series {{marked the}} return of Billy Murdoch as Australia’s leader, and pitched him against The Champion, WG Grace. The Australian side was good, {{but they were still}} without some of their best players. 1890 was a wet summer, and the rain {{affected}} all of the three planned Tests. The first Test was the most eagerly anticipated match of the English summer, with 30,279 spectators watching it over the 3 days, though Stoddart and Briggs did not play. Rain on the 2 days before the match left the pitch slow, but it got steadily <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better,</b> and was at its best on the last day, when England scored 137 to win by 7 wickets, with Grace, who was out for a duck in the first innings, scoring 75 not out. The second Test at the Oval was particularly tense, partly, no doubt, because Andrew Stoddart (an amateur) chose to play for Middlesex, whilst Peel and Ulyett (professionals) were claimed by Yorkshire. Rain before the first day’s play contributed to 22 wickets falling for 197 runs on day 1. On day 2, England only needed 95 to win, they lost eight wickets to Charles Turner and Ferris before getting them, with the winning run being scampered as Australia missed a clear run out chance. A planned third Test match at Old Trafford, Manchester was washed out, thereby becoming the first Test to be abandoned entirely because of the weather.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} of the single-player mode received mixed reactions. Paul Mallinson of PC Zone {{stated that}} [...] "Mysteries Of The Sith starts off brilliantly and gets <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> the further {{you get into}} it. The progressive nature of the constantly evolving storyline sees to that." [...] In contrast, Michael E. Ryan of GameSpot stated that the game is uneven and the challenging levels are only at the end. This adversely affects the gameplay by creating a steep change in how the game must be played. General aspects of the gameplay were seen as improvements, such as the artificial intelligence.|$|E

500|$|Her {{arguments}} were rebutted in a rejoinder by Collon (2007), noting {{in particular that}} the whole relief was created in one unit, i.e. there is no possibility that a modern figure or parts of one might {{have been added to}} an antique background; she also reviewed the iconographic links to provenanced pieces. In concluding Collon states: [...] " [...] believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better.</b> [...] Over the years [...] has indeed grown <b>better</b> <b>and</b> <b>better,</b> and more and more interesting.
