The relationship of dermatophyte enzymatic activities and presence/absence of skin lesions has also been investigated. A total of 260 isolates of T. mentagrophytes and 25 isolates of M. canis sampled both from healthy and lesioned skin of rabbits, as well as from air samples of positive farms were examined. The results showed that T. mentagrophytes and M. canis from rabbits produce different enzymes. However, only elastase and gelatinase were linked to the appearance of lesions in T. mentagrophytes infections, whereas lipase in those by M. canis...|$|E

Here's a visual way to learn the jargon and {{the basic principles of}} Mendelian inheritance while playing a fast-paced card game using rabbit coat color genetics.

The {{aim of the}} study was to find out seroprevalence of parasite T. gondii in domestic rabbits, to recognize risk factors of infection and hygienic risk of toxoplasmosis from consummation of rabbit meat. Blood samples from 260 apparently healthy <b>breeding</b> <b>rabbits</b> were collected on 13 commercial rabbit farms in Northern Italy, region Veneto (four provinces of Padova, Rovigo, Treviso and Verona). The does were divided into categories according their age (2 – 30 months), number of births (0 – 15), breed (Hyla, Hycole, Grimaud and Hybrid), province (Padova, Rovigo, Treviso and Verona) and size of farms (small farms with < 1000 does and large farms with ≥ 1000 does). The samples were tested for antibodies against T. gondii using method indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT); samples with titer ≥ 50 were considered positive. Antibodies against T. gondii was found in 38 (14. 6 %) does. Statistically significant difference (p-value < 0. 05) in prevalence was found only between different breeds and provinces.

Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an {{infrequent}} {{condition of}} animals {{characterized by the}} existence of numerous thin-walled, gas-filled cystic structures within the intestinal wall and adjacent lymph nodes.

This report describes a case of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis in a rabbit doe from an organic farm where 20 rabbit does were fed ad libitum with a natural diet consisting of whole barley, pea beans, alfalfa hay, and a pelleted vitamin–mineral blend.
