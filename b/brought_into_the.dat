5|$|In the 197778 season Villa {{reached the}} quarter-final of the UEFA Cup {{where they went}} out 43 on {{aggregate}} against Barcelona. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his team {{in the summer of}} 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board. Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. Allan Evans, Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> defence and Des Bremner was <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans. Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership. When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United in the summer of 1980, Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years.|$|E

That status is crucial for surviving periods of host colony stress such as food shortage.|$|E

There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E

Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were <b>brought</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.|$|E
