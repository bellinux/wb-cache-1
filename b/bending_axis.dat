40|$|We report multi-responsive and double-folding bilayer {{hydrogel}} sheet actuators, whose directional bending {{response is}} tuned by modulating the solvent quality and temperature and where locally crosslinked regions, induced by ionoprinting, enable the actuators to invert their <b>bending</b> <b>axis.</b> The sheets are made multi-responsive by combining two stimuli responsive gels that incur opposing and complementary swelling and shrinking {{responses to the}} same stimulus. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) can be tuned to specific temperatures depending on the EtOH concentration, enabling the actuators to change direction isothermally. Higher EtOH concentrations cause upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) gel networks, which can induce an amplifying effect during bilayer bending. External ionoprints reliably and repeatedly invert the gel bilayer <b>bending</b> <b>axis</b> between water and EtOH. Placing the ionoprint at the gel/gel interface can lead to opposite shape conformations, but with no clear trend in the bending behavior. We hypothesize that {{this is due to}} the ionoprint passing through the neutral axis of the bilayer during shrinking in hot water. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the actuators to achieve shapes unique to the specific external conditions towards developing more responsive and adaptive soft actuator devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new elastic and elastic plastic {{finite element}} solutions of the J-integral for a pipe containing off-center through-wall cracks under pure bending. The analysis {{is based on}} a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element method and small-strain theory. One hundred and five analyses were performed using the ABAQUS commercial code {{for a wide variety of}} crack sizes, off-center crack angles, and material hardening exponents. The results from these analyses show that the J-integral values at the two crack fronts of an off-center crack are unequal due to the loss of symmetry with respect to the bending plane of the pipe. In addition, the J-integral is larger, and hence, critical at the crack front which is farther away from the <b>bending</b> <b>axis</b> of the pipe. This is because, at that crack front, the tensile stress is larger and the component of the applied bending moment about the crack centerline has a further crack-opening effect. Also at this crack front, the J values can be lower or slightly higher than those of a symmetrically centered crack, depending on the crack size and off-centered angle. For the crack front that is closer to the <b>bending</b> <b>axis,</b> the J values are always lower than those of a symmetrically centered crack. This implies that the load-carrying capacity of a pipe is usually larger for an off-center crack than that for a symmetrically centered crack. Finally, based on these finite element solutions, new analytical expressions of J-integral were developed for fracture analysis of pipes containing off-center cracks. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Samples of {{fine-grained}} Al alloy {{reinforced with}} SiC particles {{were subjected to}} in situ deformation in four-point bending, and multiple-peak diffraction patterns were collected along a line traversing the sample <b>bend</b> <b>axis,</b> using time-of-flight neutron diffraction at the ISIS pulsed source, at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxford. The patterns were analysed {{in order to determine}} the average macroscopic lattice (elastic) strain, and also the so-called anisotropy strain. It was assumed that the deformation condition in the sample corresponded to a simple uniaxial stress state, and that the entire composite plastic strain was accommodated by matrix plasticity. This allowed comparisons to be made with the prediction of some models, namely, a simple two-phase uniform strain (Voigt) model, and an elasto-plastic self-consistent polycrystalline deformation model. A direct correlation is observed between the matrix plastic strain and the anisotropy strain determined from the diffraction spectra.

40|$|Sixteen intermolecular {{vibrational}} {{levels of}} the S 0 state of the fluorobenzene-Ar van der Waals complex have been observed using dispersed fluorescence. The levels range up to - 130 cm− 1 in vibrational energy. The vibrational energies have been modelled using {{a complete set of}} harmonic and quartic anharmonic constants and a cubic anharmonic coupling between the stretch and long <b>axis</b> <b>bend</b> overtone that becomes near ubiquitous at higher energies. The constants predict the observed band positions with a root mean square deviation of 0. 04 cm− 1. The set of vibrational levels predicted by the constants, which includes unobserved bands, has been compared with the predictions of ab initio calculations, which include all vibrational levels up to 70 – 75 cm− 1. There are small differences in energy, particularly above 60 cm− 1, however, the main differences are in the assignments and are largely due to the limitations of assigning the ab initio wave-functions to a simple stretch, bend, or combination when the states are mixed by the cubic anharmonic coupling. The availability of these experimental data presents an opportunity to extend ab initio calculations to higher vibrational energies to provide an assessment of the accuracy of the calculated potential surface away from the minimum. The intermolecular modes of the fluorobenzene-Ar 2 trimer complex have also been investigated by dispersed fluorescence. The dominant structure is a pair of bands with a - 35 cm− 1 displacement from the origin band. Based on the set of vibrational modes calculated from the fluorobenzene-Ar frequencies, they are assigned to a Fermi resonance between the symmetric stretch and symmetric short <b>axis</b> <b>bend</b> overtone. The analysis of this resonance provides a measurement of the coupling strength between the stretch and short <b>axis</b> <b>bend</b> overtone in the dimer, an interaction that is not directly observed.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} non-steady {{magnetic}} reconnection during quasi-steady solar wind driving we employed high resolution global MHD model BATSRUS with non-MHD corrections in diffusion regions around the reconnection sites. To clarify {{the role of}} small-scale non-MHD effects on the global magnetospheric dynamic we performed simulations with different models of dissipation. We found that magnetopause surface is not in steady state even during extended periods of steady solar wind conditions. The so-called tilted reconnection lines become unstable due to formation of pressure bubbles, strong core field flux tubes, vortices, and traveling magnetic field cavities.

The aim was to identify whether an adhesive interface (a chemically cured resin–cement) would influence the biaxial flexure strength (BFS) and slow-crack growth in a machinable dental ceramic. MethodsMonolithic and adhesively laminated (with a chemically cured dimethacrylate resin–cement) feldspathic ceramic discs of identical dimensions were fabricated. BFS testing {{was performed on the}} Group A monolithic specimens (n= 20), on Group B laminated specimens with the adhesive interface positioned below the neutral <b>bending</b> <b>axis</b> (n= 20) and Group C laminated specimens with the adhesive interface positioned above the neutral <b>bending</b> <b>axis</b> (n= 20). To study subcritical crack growth additional laminated specimens received controlled indentations and were exposed to thermo-mechanical fatigue. BFS data was analysed using parametric statistics (α= 0. 05). Fractographic analyses were qualitatively assessed. ResultsNo significant differences between the mean BFS data of Groups A and B were observed (p= 0. 92) but the mean BFS of Group C was slightly reduced (p< 0. 01). Lamination reduced the stiffness of the structure and fractographic analysis demonstrated that energy consuming crack deflection occurred. Thermo-mechanical fatigue caused subcritical extension of radial cracks associated with indentations adjacent to the adhesive interface. Crack growth was limited to parallel to the interface and was arrested or deflected in a direction normal to the interface. ConclusionsCeramic lamination increased the damage tolerance of the structure and could limit or arrest subcritical crack growth at regions near the ‘interlayer’. Clinical SignificanceLamination of a dental ceramic with a polymeric ‘interlayer’ could offer toughening effects which could potentially delay or arrest sub-critical crack growth at regions near the interface and thereby improve restoration longevity...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} design of steel beams considers that any deformation {{of a member}} due to applied load must {{be a combination of}} the four rigid body modes (axial deformation, major <b>axis</b> <b>bending,</b> minor <b>axis</b> <b>bending</b> and twisting) i. e. the member retains its cross sectional shape without distortion. In a hot rolled member the warping stresses which arise due to violation of the assumption that plane sections remain plane can often be neglected. In thin walled sections, however, these warping stresses are typically of the same order of magnitude as the primary bending stresses induced in the member by the applied loading and therefore cannot be neglected. In addition, if plane sections do not remain plane, the cross section distorts when a load is applied. The first part of this Thesis presents a method of analysis for any open unbranched thin walled section which considers both rigid body movement and cross section distortion (including local buckling). The method is such that the four rigid body modes are automatically identified and separated from the remaining cross section distortion modes. The second part of this Thesis develops a finite difference method of analysis, in conjunction with the theory of part I, to consider the behaviour of a member subject to any arbitrary loading condition and end restraint. Both first order linear problems and second order elastic critical buckling problems are solved, including the interaction of local buckling, overall buckling and cross section distortion...|$|R
