40|$|Abstract-We present here {{an exact}} method for {{analyzing}} the queueing behavior of packet-switched {{data in a}} new <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> user-network <b>interface</b> of ISDN. The new interface of ISDN in this paper adopts statistical multiplexing for providing integrated voice and data services. In order to properly represent the arrival of multirate data service, this interface assumes that the data packet input process is in batch Poisson. Furthermore, it is modeled by a multiple synchronous servers with priority queues and finite waiting mom with complete rejection strategy. The analytical method, with an application of the residue theorem in complex variable, can accurately obtain the performance measures of data. I...|$|R

50|$|Gift Aid {{increases}} {{the value of}} donations by allowing charities and Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) to reclaim <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> tax on gifts.

25|$|For example: In Pennsylvania {{there are}} two <b>rates,</b> <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> and reissue <b>rate.</b> The <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> would apply if {{it has been more}} than ten years since the last policy was issued. If less than ten years, the reissue rate applies. The reissue rate offers a {{discount}} of approximately ten percent off of the <b>basic</b> <b>rate.</b> If the transaction is a refinance, the savings can be as much as thirty percent off of the reissue rate. These rates and applicable discounts are filed with and approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission.|$|R
