5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded Man. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were {{stepping out of the}} bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Falmouth, England, after a {{crossing}} under filthy conditions, Allen {{and the other}} prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall. At first his treatment was poor, but Allen wrote a letter, ostensibly to the Continental Congress, describing his conditions and suggesting that Congress treat the prisoners it held the same way. Unknown to Allen, British prisoners now included General Prescott, captured trying to escape from Montreal, and the letter came {{into the hands of}} the British cabinet. Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America, King George decreed that the men should <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to America and treated as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Sheriff's deputies order Ambrose {{to release}} Sophie into {{protective}} custody, presumably to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to Malawi. Ambrose unsuccessfully seeks help from Lang, her former boyfriend, but he advises to let Sophie {{return to the}} wild. Lang later goes to see Ambrose at the warehouse where Sophie is being prepped for shipping, but finds her cage empty. He is then mysteriously killed by a falling crate. Scully finds that Lang was struck with a cattle prod and suspects Ambrose of killing him, but she claims that Meecham is responsible. Mulder goes to arrest Meecham, who is keeping an angered Sophie at another warehouse near Boise. Meecham suddenly locks Mulder in Sophie's room, where the enraged gorilla attacks and injures him.|$|E
5|$|An Octopus card may be {{returned}} to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining credit stored on it. A handling fee may be charged for the refund — HK$7 for an anonymous On-Loan card {{that had been in}} use for fewer than three months, and HK$10 for a Personalised On-Loan card that was issued on or after 1 November 2004. A refund is immediately provided at the time an anonymous On Loan card is returned, unless it has more than HK$500 stored on it. A Personalised On-Loan card or an anonymous On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a Personalised On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an anonymous On-Loan card would be available in five days. If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.|$|E
5|$|Having {{finished}} his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905–06 season. The team {{was not particularly}} strong—before the tour, critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side. The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players. As {{the youngest member of}} the team, Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> home during the tour. When the team played in Worcester during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa. The 1906 Wisden carried the same story; in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he would do so for England or South Africa. The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his uncle, who had left South Africa five years before.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{a crisis}} erupted in Albania after the {{collapse}} of several massive pyramid schemes, which resulted in social deterioration and violence in the country. An imposition of a curfew and a state of emergency on 2 March provoked a popular rebellion, causing concern in Italy, which feared another large-scale migration flow. Albanian migration to Italy reached its peak {{in the latter half of}} March, bringing great pressure to Italian accommodation centers and provoking a strong reaction in Italian public opinion. Italy had been operating under a bilateral agreement with Albania to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered starting on 3 April 1997 and Albanian would-be migrants going to Italy would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to Albania, in exchange for Italian financial, police, and humanitarian assistance to the country. A military Operation White Flags was established in the international waters of the Strait and implemented a de facto naval blockade.|$|E
5|$|In the story, Booster Gold {{is charged}} by Rip Hunter {{to go back}} in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the {{carnival}} shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the Joker torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to Booster that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian Johannes Maria Hubert von Spee {{was born}} in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 22 June 1861, though {{he was raised in}} the Rhineland in Germany, where his family had an estate. He joined the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in 1878 and {{initially}} served in the main German naval base at Kiel. He was commissioned an officer at the rank of Leutnant zur See (Lieutenant at Sea), and was assigned to the gunboat , which was sent to western Africa. During this voyage, the Germans signed treaties with local rulers in Togo and Cameroon, creating the colonies of Togoland and Kamerun, respectively. In 1887, Spee was transferred to Kamerun where he commanded the port at Duala. He contracted rheumatic fever while there, and had to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to Germany to recover, though he occasionally suffered from rheumatism {{for the rest of his}} life. After returning to Germany in 1889, he married his wife, Margareta Baroness von der Osten-Sacken. With her he had two sons–Otto, born on 10 July 1890, Heinrich, born on 24 April 1893–and one daughter, Huberta, born on 11 July 1894.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1911, Scott {{revealed}} {{his plans for}} the South Pole march. Sixteen men would set out, using the two remaining motor sledges, ponies and dogs for the Barrier stage of the journey, which would bring them to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point the dogs would return to base and the ponies would be shot for food. Thereafter, twelve men in three groups would ascend the glacier and begin the crossing of the polar plateau, using man-hauling. Only one of these groups would carry on to the pole; the supporting groups would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> at specified latitudes. The composition of the final polar group would be decided by Scott during the journey. For the return journey, Scott ordered that the dogs teams set off again from the base camp to replenish depots and meet the Polar party between latitude 82 and 82.30 on 1 March to assist the party home.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{brings the}} fat men {{back to his}} home to protect them, but after {{learning}} from Brian that Patrick is the killer, a chase between the fat men and Patrick ensues. Brian, still at the house, shows Patrick's room to Lois, where several of his victims are either deceased or had been left for dead, and photographic evidence of Patrick killing them. Lois continues to make crazy excuses, still wanting to believe her brother is a sane person, but ultimately she snaps out of her denial and realizes that Patrick is dangerous. Lois and Brian pursue Patrick and Peter into the woods, where Patrick is strangling Peter. Patrick quickly releases Peter after Lois threatens to stab Marion, his imaginary wife. Patrick apologizes, telling Lois that he never meant to hurt her, and the two agree he should <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> to the mental hospital, where Lois and the family plan to visit him once a month.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel. The British {{requested}} that the ex-Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex-Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Omar of supporting Wan Ahmad. Wan Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using Kemaman as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks. The Siamese agreed to British request, but {{they have yet to}} follow through with their agreement. The Strait Settlements Governor, Sir Orfeur Cavenagh sent three ships, HMS Scout, HMS Coquette and a steamer Tonze to Kuala Terengganu, under the command of Captain Corbett, accompanied by Major MacPherson. They were sent with orders to compel the ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>back</b> by the British to Siam, and to call upon the Sultan to cease supporting Wan Ahmad. After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex-Sultan to the British, the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu. The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex-Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment. The ships then returned to Singapore. Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in 1882. The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings, including Green Palace (Istana Hijau), the Sultan’s palace. Maziah Palace (Istana Maziah) was later built to replace the destroyed palace.|$|E
