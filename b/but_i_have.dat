5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
60|$|Marriage, paternity, householding, {{during these}} years unquestionably {{put the brakes on}} my work as a writer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no desire to return to bachelorhood. Undoubtedly <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lost something, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gained more. As a human being I was enriched beyond my deserving by a wife and a child.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{lost two}} hours and a half; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned a fact worth four.|$|R
60|$|Wetherill was {{pointing}} and explaining, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not grasped all he said.|$|R
5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. I wanted to show the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to admit that the}} later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
60|$|It sounded {{modestly}} {{enough in}} words. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my own doubts, nevertheless.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already {{discussed}} it with him, I confessed; and so, <b>I</b> thought, <b>had</b> Mr. Woodcourt.|$|R
60|$|Just. I thank you, my dear friend, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{rather see}} it myself.|$|R

25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, you understand, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to admit that I like what he's doing.|$|E
60|$|LORD LOAM (rather white). I'm {{sorry for}} him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be firm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sudden indeed. When I {{left him}} he was not well, certainly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> said {{that he might have}} lived for twenty years. Poor old man! I can hardly say why it was so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken a liking to him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen. Yes; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{seen more}} than that. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen Captain West's face a {{transparent}} white, while his eyelids fluttered down and his lips moved noiselessly. Then the eyelids raised, the lips set again with their habitual discipline, and the colour slowly returned to his face. It {{was as if he}} had been away for a time and just returned. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen, and guessed her secret.|$|R
25|$|I {{respect the}} jury's verdict. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{concluded}} that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby's sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison.|$|E
25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. They are {{all right}} now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to work on them for months.|$|R
60|$|I {{watched him}} {{narrowly}} the while, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some notion he might run me through. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> misjudged him.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> turned in, <b>I</b> don't know why, to {{the little}} store across the way.|$|R
25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
60|$|Laughter {{came into}} her eyes, and I knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not vexed her. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> spoken stupidly, and I reddened.|$|R
60|$|I {{think this}} letter {{has turned into}} a sermon, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing {{interesting}} to talk about.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> turned away, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{scarcely}} gone {{half a dozen}} paces {{before she}} called me back.|$|R
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{intended}} to express {{anger at the}} draft, the protests deteriorated into [...] "a virtual racial pogrom, with uncounted numbers of blacks murdered on the streets". The conditions in the city were such that Major General John E. Wool stated on July 16, [...] "Martial law ought to be proclaimed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not a sufficient force to enforce it".|$|E
500|$|Radcliffe {{has also}} been quoted as saying: [...] "I'm an atheist, and a militant atheist when {{religion}} starts impacting on legislation", but in a separate interview, he stated, [...] "I'm very relaxed about [...] I don't preach my atheism, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a huge amount of}} respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do. Anything he does on television, I will watch".|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> schooled myself {{beforehand}} to say more, and I {{was going}} to say it too.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> no resentment against him, {{no desire}} for vengeance. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a burning wish to free myself from this environing mystery.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> no {{definite}} {{idea in the}} matter, you understand; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> vague {{notions of}} finding the bankers' receipt for the half-million francs.|$|R
