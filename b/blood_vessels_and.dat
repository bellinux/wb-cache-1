5|$|The <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> lymph {{vessels are}} considered, the valves of the heart, and the {{separate}} functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions {{as that of}} the epiglottis could not have formed gradually (as by evolution).|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
50|$|The corneal {{scarring}} is the {{end result}} of the initial invasion of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> into the corneal stroma as part of the inflammatory response. Since normal corneal tissue should be avascular (no <b>blood</b> <b>vessel)</b> <b>and</b> therefore clear to allow light to pass, the presence of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> the infiltration of cells as part of the inflammatory process results in scarring or hazing of the cornea.|$|R
50|$|One of Fogarty’s most {{successful}} products is the Stent-Graft. This {{dealt with the}} difficult problem of abdominal aortic aneurysms, which is a term referring to a weakened <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> but Fogarty’s idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> A catheter transports the stent to the weakened <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> <b>and</b> once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands {{to the size of}} the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> flows normally.|$|R

5|$|In {{other parts}} of the body, {{circulation}} in the lymphatic vasculature clears extracellular waste products from the cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed. Newer studies from two laboratories have shown the presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive {{at the base of the}} brain where they exit with the cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels)</b> <b>and</b> {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E

In October2003, Icos partnered with Protein Design Labs to manufacture their M200 antibody.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clear evidence}} of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164 million {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones {{in the front of the}} upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon. Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.|$|E
5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown.

50|$|Calcium: Calcium {{is needed}} for <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> muscle movement, for the {{secretions}} of certain hormones and enzymes, and for sending messages through the nervous system. Consumption of alcohol can cause a loss of calcium through urinary excretion.|$|R
5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E

The proposed regional segmentation model is capable of distinguish physiological <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> area from areas of calcification spots. On the base of this procedure, we obtain a model reflecting whole <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> second model reflecting only the calcifications. This <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> feature selection procedure serves as a solid basis for extraction parameters for objectification of the calcification amount.|$|R
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E
5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows. The scutes contain <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E

5|$|When a {{mosquito}} carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin {{together with the}} mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible {{for many of the}} symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E

Endarterectomy is still considered safer though, as percutaneous treatments can lead to accidental dislodging of plaque or even arterial rupturing.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE. Vascular ectasia in port wine stain birthmarks (PWS) {{might result}} from reduced {{innervation}} with loss of autonomic stimulation. We investigated this theory and evaluated nerve <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density, <b>and</b> mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> size in untreated and treated PWS skin. METHODS. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from uninvolved skin, untreated PWS, PWS with a good response to laser treatment and PWS with a poor response to laser treatment. Confocal microscopy was performed to determine nerve <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density, <b>and</b> mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> size. RESULTS. Nerve density was significantly decreased in all PWS sites compared to uninvolved skin. Mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> diameter was larger in untreated compared to treated PWS. PWS with a good response to treatment had decreased nerve density but <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density <b>and</b> mean diameter was relatively normal. PWS with a poor response to treatment had decreased nerve density but increased <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density <b>and</b> mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> diameter compared to normal skin. CONCLUSION. Nerve density was decreased in all evaluated PWS sites {{and this may be}} a factor in lesion pathogenesis. PWS <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> size correlated with pulsed dye laser response and may prove to be a useful prognostic indicator of therapeutic outcome...|$|R
