5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not <b>boiling,</b> <b>water</b> for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, {{bows and}} arrows, and large flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up for storage. Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into <b>boiling</b> <b>water,</b> it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly {{a dog or}} a cat, was feared {{to become one of}} the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.|$|E
5|$|Utensils {{used for}} non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even {{otherwise}} kosher food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, {{depending on the}} material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> or by {{the application of a}} blowtorch. Food prepared in a manner that violates the Shabbat (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> {{over the}} grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire {{could also be}} killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E

Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for <b>boiling</b> <b>water,</b> a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} nuclear reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors, with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary nuclear reactors. The main LWR types are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and <b>Boiling</b> <b>Water</b> Reactors (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's Nuclear Division.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} system for temperature of <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> {{is a critical}} task in industry. In this paper we designed and implemented a PIC micro controller based <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> temperature {{measurement system}} using PIC 18 F 452 and national semiconductors LM 35 temperature sensor. The designing system is {{used to measure the}} tank I <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> temperature value. If the temperature value reaches the set value high temperature relay board becomes ON to control the solenoid valve. The high temperature of the <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> which flows through the metal pipe I is lowered by spraying the cool water using control valves. The valves are controlled by manually depends upon the requirement of temperature. Thus the output is obtained by reducing high temperature. Low temperature water is collected in tank III. Here, after comparing the reduced temperature value water with programming of temperature set value, the collected cooling water is ready for supplying to various purposes in the industry plants...|$|R

5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954. He had the control rods removed {{to demonstrate that the}} reactor would shut down without trouble, and it immediately blew up with a loud bang and a tall column of dark smoke, a turn of events that he had not anticipated. He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E
5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> and oil on attackers.|$|E

5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
5|$|Carmella {{admits she}} {{arranged}} {{the sale of}} her cousin Teresa's (Hannah Greenwood) unwanted baby. A fellow nun suggests that she takes time off from the convent. She complies and leaves {{her role as a}} nun behind. Teresa has a breakdown and throws a saucepan of <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> at Carmella, who is left with severe facial scarring and becomes increasingly secluded. She is convinced by Will Griggs (Christian Clark) to have plastic surgery to lessen the scarring. Ned tells Carmella that he loves her, but Carmella has fallen in love with Will. Soon thereafter, Will leaves the country without notice. His younger brother Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin) arrives, and explains that Will had a double identity. Carmella has short-lived relationships with Oliver and teenager Ringo Brown (Sam Clark). She becomes addicted to prescription drugs, and later discovers that she is pregnant with Oliver's baby, and may have harmed the baby through her addiction.|$|E

Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
