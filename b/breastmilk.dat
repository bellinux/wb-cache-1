5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their <b>breastmilk.</b> It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline crosses into <b>breastmilk.</b> The {{adverse effects}} on teeth and long bones of {{children}} directly administered tetracycline antibiotics is documented, but these effects have not been recorded in infants exposed through <b>breastmilk.</b> Although the dose an infant would receive through breastfeeding would likely be minimal, a theoretical risk exists.|$|E
25|$|Babies {{who are not}} breastfed {{are almost}} six {{times more likely to}} die by the age of one month than those who receive at least some <b>breastmilk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fear of {{exposure}} to environmental contaminants: Certain environmental pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, can bioaccumulate in the food chain and {{may be found in}} humans including mothers' <b>breastmilk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Infants {{exposed to}} {{erythromycin}} are {{at increased risk}} for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life and possibly in late pregnancy and through <b>breastmilk</b> in {{the first two weeks of}} life.|$|E
25|$|In Australia for {{children}} born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada {{for children}} born in 2005-06, more than 50% were only breastfed {{and more than}} 15% received both <b>breastmilk</b> and other liquids, {{by the age of}} 3 months.|$|E
25|$|Adequate supply, but not excess vitamin A, is {{especially}} important for pregnant and breastfeeding women for normal fetal development and in <b>breastmilk.</b> Deficiencies cannot be compensated by postnatal supplementation. Excess vitamin A, which is most common with high dose vitamin supplements, can cause birth defects and therefore should not exceed recommended daily values.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{medicines}} {{pass into}} <b>breastmilk</b> in small amounts. Some {{have no effect}} on the baby and can be used while breastfeeding. Women with hypothyroidism may be unable to produce milk. Alcohol use during pregnancy carries a significant risk of serious birth defects, but consuming alcohol after the birth of the infant is considered safe.|$|E
25|$|Other {{assumptions}} {{may help}} to explain this resistance to FCoV infections by kittens. In the first weeks of life, APN could be immature because highly manno-glycosylated. The spikes of CoV could then not be bound. Factors in <b>breastmilk</b> may inhibit the synthesis of fANP by enterocytes, as already described with fructose or sucrose.|$|E
25|$|Safety of the {{medication}} during breastfeeding is unclear. It {{has been reported}} that because only low levels are found in <b>breastmilk</b> and {{the medication}} has also been used in young children, it is unlikely that breastfed infants would suffer adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the drug be used with caution during breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{can occur}} {{as either a}} primary or a secondary deficiency. A primary vitamin A deficiency occurs among children and adults who do not consume an adequate intake of provitamin A carotenoids from fruits and vegetables or preformed vitamin A from animal and dairy products. Early weaning from <b>breastmilk</b> can also {{increase the risk of}} vitamin A deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin diffuses {{easily into}} tissues and body fluids. Penetration {{into the central}} nervous system {{increases}} in meningitis. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into <b>breastmilk</b> in small quantities. It is excreted into the urine and metabolized by the liver. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults.|$|E
25|$|A {{mother can}} express (produce) her milk for storage and later use. Expression occurs with massage or a breast pump. It {{can be stored}} in freezer storage bags, {{containers}} made specifically for <b>breastmilk,</b> a supplemental nursing system, or a bottle ready for use. Using someone other than the mother/wet nurse to deliver the bottle maintains the baby's association of nursing with the mother/wet nurse and bottle feeding with other people.|$|E
25|$|The {{females of}} all mammal species can by {{definition}} produce milk, but cow's milk dominates commercial production. In 2011, FAO estimates 85% of all milk worldwide was produced from cows. Human milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially; however, human milk banks collect donated human <b>breastmilk</b> and redistribute it to infants who {{may benefit from}} human milk for various reasons (premature neonates, babies with allergies, metabolic diseases, etc.) but who cannot breastfeed.|$|E
25|$|Rosuvastatin has {{multiple}} contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with rosuvastatin, including hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any {{component of the}} formulation, active liver disease, elevation of serum transaminases, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Rosuvastatin must not be taken while pregnant as it can cause serious harm to the unborn baby. In the case of breastfeeding, it is unknown whether rosuvastatin is passed through <b>breastmilk,</b> but due to the potential of disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism, patients should not breast feed while on rosuvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{of breast}} milk's {{properties}} are understood, but its nutrient content is relatively consistent. Breast milk {{is made from}} nutrients in the mother's bloodstream and bodily stores. Breast milk has an optimal balance of fat, sugar, water, and protein that is needed for a baby's growth and development. Breastfeeding triggers biochemical reactions which allows for the enzymes, hormones, growth factors and immunologic substances to effectively defend against infectious diseases for the infant. The <b>breastmilk</b> also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development.|$|E
25|$|Baby is {{considered}} {{at risk for}} malnutrition: In certain circumstances infants {{may be at risk}} for malnutrition, such as due to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies (e.g. vitamin D which may be less present in <b>breastmilk</b> than needed at high latitudes where there is less sun exposure), or inadequate nutrition during transition to solid foods. Risks can often be mitigated with improved diet and education of mothers and caregivers, including availability of macro and micronutrients. For example, in Canada, marketed infant formulas are fortified with vitamin D, but Health Canada also recommends breastfed infants receive extra vitamin D {{in the form of a}} supplement.|$|E
25|$|The CST3 gene {{is located}} in the cystatin locus and {{comprises}} 3 exons (coding regions, as opposed to introns, non-coding regions within a gene), spanning 4.3 kilo-base pairs. It encodes the most abundant extracellular inhibitor of cysteine proteases. It is found in high concentrations in biological fluids and is expressed in virtually all organs of the body (CST3 is a housekeeping gene). The highest levels are found in semen, followed by <b>breastmilk,</b> tears and saliva. The hydrophobic leader sequence indicates that the protein is normally secreted. There are three polymorphisms in the promoter region of the gene, resulting in two common variants. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with altered cystatin C levels.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{nutrition}} {{are some of}} the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding. In young children, providing food (in addition to <b>breastmilk)</b> between six months and two years of age improves outcomes. There is also good evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world. To get food to people who need it most, both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective. Simply feeding students at school is insufficient. Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods is possible much of the time. In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended. This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature, addressing dehydration, and gradual feeding. Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection. Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices, reducing poverty, improving sanitation, and the empowerment of women.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} global risks posed by <b>breastmilk</b> {{specifically}} is the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases. Breastfeeding by an HIV-infected mother poses a 5–20% chance of transmitting HIV to the baby. However, if a mother has HIV, she {{is more likely to}} transmit it to her child during the pregnancy or birth than during breastfeeding. A 2012 study conducted by researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine showed reduced HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice, due to components in the breast milk. Cytomegalovirus infection poses potentially dangerous consequences for pre-term babies. Other risks include mother's infection with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 (viruses that could cause T-cell leukemia in the baby), herpes simplex when lesions are present on the breasts, and chickenpox in the newborn when the disease manifested in the mother within a few days of birth. In some cases these risks can be mitigated by using heat-treated milk and nursing for a briefer time (e.g. 6 months, rather than 18–24 months), and can be avoided by using an uninfected woman's milk, as via a wet-nurse or milk bank, or by using infant formula and/or treated milk.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, {{the debate}} over Nestlé's {{unethical}} marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written {{an open letter to}} the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. In November 2011, Bureau Veritas was commissioned by Nestlé S.A. to provide independent assurance of Nestlé Indochina’s compliance with the Nestlé policy for the implementation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (1981). There was no significant evidence that indicated Nestlé Indochina was systematically operating in violation of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree in Lao PDR. The presence of promotional materials in retail units constituted a non-conformance, and Bureau Veritas recommended that the Nestlé’s Policy and Procedures Manual on the Marketing of <b>breastmilk</b> substitutes be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency against the more stringent requirements of the Lao PDR Decree. Ernest W. Lefever and the Ethics and Public Policy Center were criticized for accepting a $25,000 contribution from Nestlé while the organization {{was in the process of}} developing a report investigating medical care in developing nations which was never published. It was alleged that this contribution affected the release of the report and led to the author of the report submitting an article to Fortune Magazine praising the company's position.|$|E

2500|$|Some breast {{pumps are}} {{designed}} {{to be part of a}} [...] "feeding system" [...] so that the milk storage portion of the pump is the baby bottle used to feed the infant.

2500|$|In infants, {{frequent}} diaper {{change can}} prevent anal fissure. [...] As constipation {{can be a}} cause, making sure the infant is drinking enough fluids (i.e. <b>breastmilk,</b> proper ratios when mixing formulas) is beneficial. In infants, once an anal fissure has occurred, addressing underlying causes is usually enough to ensure healing occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Hepatitis B, {{hepatitis}} C, and hepatitis D {{are transmitted}} when blood or mucous membranes {{are exposed to}} infected blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal secretions. Viral particles have also been found in saliva and <b>breastmilk.</b> [...] However, kissing, sharing utensils, and breastfeeding do not lead to transmission unless these fluids are introduced into open sores or cuts.|$|E
2500|$|DHA is {{the most}} {{abundant}} omega-3 fatty acid {{in the brain and}} retina. [...] DHA comprises 40% of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the brain and 60% of the PUFAs in the retina. Fifty percent of the weight of a neuron's plasma membrane is composed of DHA. [...] DHA is richly supplied during breastfeeding, and DHA levels are high in <b>breastmilk</b> regardless of dietary choices.|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{issued an}} updated {{breastfeeding}} policy {{which states that}} soldiers must be given space to pump <b>breastmilk,</b> and the space must be [...] "a private space, other than a restroom, with locking capabilities for a soldier to breastfeed or express milk", and must {{have a place to}} sit, a flat surface other than the floor to place the pump, an electrical outlet and access to a [...] "safe water source" [...] near the pumping area. The updated policy also states that although breastfeeding soldiers will still be required to take part in field training or deployment, commanders must give them time and space to pump and, if needed, discard <b>breastmilk</b> just as they would in garrison. It also instructs commanders to give soldiers [...] "adequate time" [...] to express milk, while further clarifying that time requirements may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the age of the baby. This updated policy supersedes a rule from September 29, 2015; prior to that September rule, the Army was the only service without an established, service-wide standard governing female soldiers and breastfeeding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diaphragm}} in {{a closed}} system eliminates the possibility of milk being able to overflow into the pump tubing. Because milk is not exposed to the pump motor, closed collection systems are marketed as [...] more hygienic than open collection systems. It is important to clean the diaphragm as condensation or milk may reach this part causing bacterial contamination. If the diaphragm is contaminated this may defeat {{the purpose of the}} closed system. The barrier {{in a closed}} collection system breast pump is marketed as preventing outside air from contaminating the expressed <b>breastmilk</b> in the collection bottle, which preserves the milk’s purity. The diaphragm may limit the amount of air/suction {{that can be used to}} extract milk from the breast. It may also not be able to compensate for larger shield sizes as well. There are no studies comparing the open versus closed system design. Most information is marketing materials without studies to back them up.|$|E
2500|$|The diet {{requires}} restricting or eliminating foods high in Phe, such as soybeans, egg whites, shrimp, chicken breast, spirulina, watercress, fish, nuts, crayfish, lobster, tuna, turkey, legumes, and lowfat cottage cheese. Starchy foods, such as {{potatoes and}} corn are generally acceptable in controlled amounts, but {{the quantity of}} Phe consumed from these foods must be monitored. A food diary is usually kept to record the amount of Phe consumed with each meal, snack, or drink. An [...] "exchange" [...] system {{can be used to}} calculate the amount of Phe in a food from the protein content identified on a nutritional information label. Lower-protein [...] "medical food" [...] substitutes are often used in place of normal bread, pasta, and other grain-based foods, which contain a significant amount of Phe. Many fruits and vegetables are lower in Phe and can be eaten in larger quantities. Infants may still be breastfed to provide all of the benefits of <b>breastmilk,</b> but the quantity must also be monitored and supplementation for missing nutrients will be required. [...] The sweetener aspartame, present in many diet foods and soft drinks, must also be avoided, as aspartame contains phenylalanine.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{published}} in the Lancet has highlighted a lower risk of HIV transmission with exclusive breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers (4 percent risk), compared to mixed feeding (10-40 percent risk). Research on the timing of HIV transmission in 2000 revealed that a [...] "substantial transmission occurs early during breastfeeding," [...] concluding that 75% of all breast milk transmission had occurred within the first 6 months during a randomized control trial in Kenya. This research is of particular importance in developing countries where infant formula is not widely available or safe to prepare. In fact, the World Health Organization recommended breastfeeding in 1987 and 1992 for seropositive and seronegative women in areas where malnutrition and infectious diseases are the major cause of infant mortality. In 1996 UNAIDS issued a recommendation that women in developing countries consider {{the risks and benefits}} of each feeding practice on an individual level; they recommended women make an informed choice about infant feeding. [...] In the days before the AIDS epidemic was clearly understood, some researchers pointed to the need to increase breastfeeding rates and pointed to the risks of formula feeding, citing increased rates of marasmus and diarrhea. D. Jelliffe and E. Jelliffe also criticized the marketing of infant formulas by U.S. companies to resource-poor countries, something they termed [...] "comerciogenic malnutrition." [...] A more recent article from 1992 describes how the health of an infant can be compromised by water, which in many resource-poor countries holds the risk of environmental pathogens that are not present in <b>breastmilk.</b>|$|E
