40|$|This {{report is}} a {{preliminary}} cost {{analysis of the}} <b>biophotolysis</b> of water and was prepared {{as part of the}} work of Annex 10 of the IEA Hydrogen agreement. <b>Biophotolysis</b> is the conversion of water and solar energy to hydrogen and oxygen using microalgae. In laboratory experiments at low light intensities, algal photosynthesis and some <b>biophotolysis</b> reactions exhibit highlight conversion efficiencies that could be extrapolated to about 10 % solar efficiencies if photosynthesis were to saturate at full sunlight intensities. The most promising approach to achieving the critical goal of high conversion efficiencies at full sunlight intensities, one that appears within the capabilities of modern biotechnology, is to genetically control the pigment content of algal cells such that the photosynthetic apparatus does not capture more photons than it can utilize. A two-stage indirect <b>biophotolysis</b> system was conceptualized and general design parameters extrapolated. The process comprises open ponds for the CO{sub 2 }fixation stage, an algal concentration step, a dark adaptation and fermentation stage, and a closed tubular photobioreactor in which hydrogen production would take place. A preliminary cost analysis for a 200 hectare (ha) system, including 140 ha of open algal ponds and 14 ha of photobioreactors was carried out. The cost analysis was based on prior studies for algal mass cultures for fuels production and a conceptual analysis of a hypothetical photochemical processes, as well as the assumption that the photobioreactors would cost about $ 100 /m(sup 2). Assuming a very favorable location, with 21 megajoules (MJ) /m{sup 2 } total insolation, and a solar conversion efficiency of 10 % based on CO{sub 2 } fixation in the large algal ponds, an overall cost of $ 10 /gigajoule (GJ) is projected. Of this, almost half is due to the photobioreactors, one fourth to the open pond system, and the remainder to the H{sub 2 } handling and general support systems. It must be cautioned that these are highly preliminary, incomplete, and optimistic estimates. <b>Biophotolysis</b> processes, indirect or direct, clearly require considerable basic and applied R and D before a more detailed evaluation of their potential and plausible economics can be carried out. For example, it is not yet clear which type of algae, green algae, or cyanobacteria, would be preferred in <b>biophotolysis.</b> If lower-cost photobioreactors can be developed, then small-scale (< 1 ha) single-stage <b>biophotolysis</b> processes may become economically feasible. A major basic and applied R and D effort will be required to develop such <b>biophotolysis</b> processes...|$|E

The most commonly used techniques of biohydrogen production, including direct <b>biophotolysis,</b> indirect <b>biophotolysis,</b> photo-fermentation and dark-fermentation, conventional or "modern" techniques are examined in this review. The main limitations inherent to biochemical reactions for hydrogen production and design are the constraints in reactor configuration which influence biohydrogen production, and these have been identified.

Atmospheric oxygen tension was found to be slightly inhibitory to acetylene reduction of both slowly growing and exponentially growing cultures. Nonsterile continuous cultures, which were conducted to test problems of culture maintenance, could be operated for 2 months without any significant decrease in nitrogenase activity or contamination by other algae.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{renewable}} energy sources, biohydrogen is gaining {{a lot of}} traction as it has very high efficiency of conversion to usable power with less pollutant generation. The various technologies available {{for the production of}} biohydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass such as direct <b>biophotolysis,</b> indirect <b>biophotolysis,</b> photo, and dark fermentations have some drawbacks (e. g., low yield and slower production rate, etc.), which limits their practical application. Among these, metabolic engineering is presently the most promising for the production of biohydrogen as it overcomes most of the limitations in other technologies. Microbial electrolysis is another recent technology that is progressing very rapidly. However, it is the dark fermentation approach, followed by photo fermentation, which seem closer to commercialization. Biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass is particularly suitable for relatively small and decentralized systems and it can be considered as an important sustainable and renewable energy source. The comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass and its comparison with other biofuels can be a tool for policy decisions. In this paper, we discuss the various possible approaches for producing biohydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass which is an globally available abundant resource.

Electrons mainly derive from mobilization of internal reserves or from water through <b>biophotolysis.</b> However, the exact mechanisms triggering this process are still unclear. Our hypothesis was that, once a proper redox state has been achieved, H- 2 production is eventually observed. To avoid nutrient depletion, which would result in enhanced fermentative pathways, we aimed to induce long-lasting H- 2 production solely through a photosynthesis:respiration equilibrium. Thus, growing cells were incubated in Tris Acetate Phosphate (TAP) medium under low light and high chlorophyll content. After a 250 -h acclimation phase, a 350 -h H- 2 production phase was observed. The light-to-H- 2 conversion efficiency was comparable to that given in some reports operating under sulphur starvation. Electron sources {{were found to be}} water, through <b>biophotolysis,</b> and proteins, particularly through photofermentation. Nonetheless, a substantial contribution from acetate could not be ruled out. In addition, photosystem II (PSII) inhibition by 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU) showed that it actively contributed to maintaining a redox balance during cell acclimation. In appropriate conditions, PSII may represent the major source of reducing power to feed the H- 2 evolution process, by inducing and maintaining an ideal excess of reducing power...|$|E

The electrogenic activity of cyanobacteria may represent a form of overflow metabolism to protect cells under high-intensity light [70, 129].

40|$|The growing {{interest}} for hydrogen utilization {{in the energy}} sector can be explained when considering that H 2; 1) is a carbon-free energy carrier, 2) could be used either as a natural gas or, {{in order to maximize}} the energy efficiency, in combination with fuel cells and 3) can be generated by fossil fuels {{and a variety of other}} sources, so that a reduction of the dependence on fossil fuels - as well as a decrease of CO 2 emissions during the H 2 generation phase - could be attained. Promising options for H 2 generation thus include <b>biophotolysis,</b> indirect <b>biophotolysis,</b> photofermentation, electrolysis and dark fermentation, being fossil fuels not used as H 2 sources. Among those options, dark fermentation of the organic fraction of municipal (or agro-industrial) wastes represents an attractive process as the H 2 production can be integrated to CH 4 generation and coupled with wastes stabilization in view of utilization or final disposal. Biological hydrogen production from organic residues is strongly dependent on a variety of operating parameters such as pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time, inoculum pre-treatment, substrate biodegradability and composition, hydrogen partial pressure and microbial actors as hydrogen producing bacteria, hydrogen consumers and metabolic competitors (like sulfate reducing bacteria, nitrate reducing bacteria, methane producing bacteria and homoacetogenic bacteria). The present paper shows the preliminary results on hydrogen production through dark fermentation of OFMSW achieved using lab-scale batch stirred tank reactors.

In photosynthetic hydrogen production research, there are currently two main efforts: (1) Direct photoevolution of hydrogen and oxygen by photosynthetic water splitting using the ferredoxin/hydrogenase pathway; (2) Dark hydrogen production by fermentation of organic reserves such as starch that are generated by photosynthesis during the light period.

40|$|Biologically-produced {{hydrogen}} (H 2) or ?biohydrogen? is one promising {{source of}} renewable energy. A number of microorganisms are being studied as potential producers of biohydrogen through <b>biophotolysis,</b> indirect <b>biophotolysis,</b> photo-fermentations or dark-fermentations. Microorganisms produce H 2 by {{the activity of}} either hydrogenases or nitrogenases: Hydrogenase enzymes catalyze the reaction: 2 H+ + 2 e- ? H 2 whereas nitrogenases catalyze the reduction N 2 with the following limiting stoichiometry: N 2 + 8 H+ + 8 e- ? H 2 + 2 NH 3. In this work, we have coordinated aspects of both pathways to develop optimized biocatalysts for hydrogen overproduction using the following steps: 1. Engineering a hydrogen responsive genetic circuit in the purple non-sulphur nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus SB 1003 : R. capsulatus carries nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzymes able to produce H 2. It also carries a system to detect H 2 that is composed of three proteins: a H 2 -sensor hydrogenase (HupUV), a histidine kinase (HupT) and a response regulator (NtrC-like transcription factor, HupR) (Vignais et al., 2005). In the presence of H 2, this sensor triggers expression of hydrogenase structural and biosynthetic genes. Taking advantage of this system, we have introduced a reporter gene {{under the control of}} hupS promoter and removed the uptake hydrogenase, generating a new biological-sensor strain capable of accumulating and detecting the presence of both exogenous H 2 and the H 2 produced by its own nitrogenase. This biotechnological tool allows us to obtain a measurable and proportional signal when H 2 is present in the cell. 2. Generating variants of the molybdenum nitrogenase structural genes nifH, nifD and nifK: we are using in vitro evolution techniques to perform random mutagenesis in these genes with a controlled mutation rate. The resulting variants were cloned under nifH promoter control into a broad-host-range vector (Kovach et al., 1995) optimized for diazotrophic conditions. Libraries obtained (around 4 x 106 clones) were introduced and expressed in the strain carrying the modified biological hydrogen sensor. The suitable combination of both tools results {{in the development of a}} genetic circuit for the high-throughput screening of H 2 overproducing nitrogenase variants thus allowing detection and isolation of clones that present a significant signal increased, through the use of cell-sorting cytometry. Thus far, around 1500 clones have been successfully selected by this method, confirming the possibility of using the designed system to select hydrogen-overproducing enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen-starved {{cultures}} of the alga Anabaena cylindrica 629 produced hydrogen and oxygen continuously for 7 to 19 days. Hydrogen production attained a maximum level after 1 to 2 days of starvation and {{was followed by a}} slow decline. The maximum rates were 30 ml of H 2 evolved per liter of culture per h or 32 mul of H 2 per mg of dry weight per h. In 5 to 7 days the rate of H 2 evolution by the more productive cultures fell to one-half its maximum value. The addition of 10 (- 4) to 5 X 10 (- 4) M ammonium increased the rate of oxygen evolution and the total hydrogen production of the cultures. H 2 -O 2 ratios were 4 : 1 under conditions of complete nitrogen starvation and about 1. 7 : 1 after the addition of ammonium. Thus, oxygen evolution was affected by the extent of the nitrogen starvation. Thermodynamic efficiencies of converting incident light energy to free energy of hydrogen via algal photosynthesis were 0. 4 %.

Our motivation to compile this review was to quantify and comprehensively report strains and process performance of dark fermentative BHP. This review summarizes the work done on pure and defined co-culture dark fermentative BHP since the year 1901. Qualitative growth characteristics and quantitative normalized results of H 2 production for more than 2000 conditions are presented in a normalized and therefore comparable format to the scientific community. Statistically based evidence shows that thermophilic strains comprise high substrate conversion efficiency, but mesophilic strains achieve high volumetric productivity. Moreover, microbes of Thermoanaerobacterales (Family III) have to be preferred when aiming to achieve high substrate conversion efficiency in comparison to the families Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. The limited number of results available on dark fermentative BHP from fed-batch cultivations indicates the yet underestimated potential of this bioprocessing application.

40|$|For {{hydrogen}} to be {{a viable}} energy carrier, it is important to develop hydrogen generation routes that are renewable like biohydrogen. Hydrogen can be produced biologically by <b>biophotolysis</b> (direct and indirect), photo-fermentation and dark-fermentation or by combination of these processes (such as integration of dark- and photo-fermentation (two-stage process), or biocatalyzed electrolysis, etc.). However, production of hydrogen by these methods at commercial level is not reported in the literature and challenges regarding the process scale up remain. In this scenario net energy analysis (NEA) can provide a tool for establishing the viability of different methods before scaling up. The analysis {{can also be used to}} set targets for various process and design parameters for bio-hydrogen production. In this paper, four biohydrogen production processes (dark-fermentation, photo-fermentation, two-stage process and biocatalyzed electrolysis) utilizing sugarcane juice as the carbon source, are compared with base case method steam methane reforming (SMR) on the basis of net energy ratio, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It was found that when by-products are not considered, the efficiencies of biological hydrogen processes are lower than that of SMR. However, these processes reduce GHG emissions and non-renewable energy use by 57 - 73 % and 65 - 79 %, respectively, as compared to the SMR process. Efficiencies of biohydrogen processes increase significantly when by-products are considered hence by-products removal and utilization is an important issue in biological hydrogen production.

40|$|Today?s global energy {{requirements}} are mostly dependent on fossil fuels, {{the utilization of}} which are causing global climate change as well as leading to the foreseeable depletion of these limited non-renewable energy sources (Jean-Baptiste, 2003). As a result of growing concern over environmental impacts and depletion of existing fossil fuels, the interest in developing renewable, sustainable ways of energy generation has greatly increased. Among the different renewable energy types, the so-called biofuels {{are one of the}} most promising and studied forms of energy generation. There is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bioenergy conversion using a range of biofuels, which are becoming cost-wise competitive with fossil fuels (Demirbas, 2007). Some of these biologically based fuels which are considered or developed as renewable replacements for fossil fuels are ethanol, various next generation liquid transportation additives, or gases such as hydrogen (H 2) or methane (CH 4). The reason for the selection of hydrogen as the model biofuel is that the amount of energy produced during hydrogen combustion is higher than that released by any other fuel on a mass basis, with a low heating value (LHV) 2. 4, 2. 8 and 4 times higher than that of methane, gasoline and coal, respectively. Furthermore, hydrogen has a major advantage as a fuel because of the absence of CO 2 emissions, as well as other pollutant emissions (thermal NOx) if it is employed in low temperature fuel cells. This is especially important for the transportation sector, which is responsible for 18 % consumption of primary energy worldwide (Marban, 2007). Hydrogen can be produced by a number of processes, including electrolysis of water, thermocatalytic reformation of hydrogen-rich organic compounds, and biological processes. Currently hydrogen is produced, almost exclusively, by electrolysis of water or by steam reformation of methane, which involves fossil fuel consumption for hydrogen production, thereby minimizing the energy benefits of this technology. Biological production of hydrogen (bio-hydrogen), using microorganisms, is an exciting 2 area of technology development that offers potential production of usable hydrogen from a variety of renewable resources. Biological systems provide a wide range of approaches to generate hydrogen, and include direct <b>biophotolysis,</b> indirect <b>biophotolysis,</b> photo-fermentations, and dark fermentations (Levin, 2004). Among these systems, photo-fermentation is especially advantageous because photosynthetic bacteria can provide significant biologically-derived hydrogen as several species are able to generate large amounts of this fuel using energy from sunlight and renewable nutrients. More specifically, photoheterotrophic bacteria, which have the ability to simultaneously use energy derived from light and organic compounds to drive H 2 production, can be used to develop solar-driven biofuel production processes for the utilization of renewable organic substrates in a biofuel economy (Kapdan, 2006). The objective of this work was to study the electron partitioning of the photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, under different environmental conditions (i. e., different growth rates). Quantifying the contribution of networks that impact solar powered hydrogen production can then be used for the development of a genome-scale metabolic network model of R. sphaeroides (Saheed et al, submitted). Previous research investigated the electron partitioning in batch cultures of R. sphaeroides (Yilmaz et al., 2010). However, for the purpose of metabolic model development, quantitative analysis of electron partitioning is needed on continuous steady-state R. sphaeroides cultures. The establishment and design of the metabolic model will increase the feasibility of using bio-hydrogen as an alternative fuel and will provide insights for practical applications in the future...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{hydrogen}} production from waste biomass has both terrestrial and Martian advanced life support applications. On earth, biological {{hydrogen production}} is being explored as a greenhouse neutral form of clean and efficient energy. In a permanently enclosed space habitat, carbon loop closure {{is required to}} reduce mission costs. Plants are grown to revitalize oxygen supply and are consumed by habitat inhabitants. Unharvested portions must then be recycled for reuse in the habitat. Several biological degradation techniques exist, but one process, <b>biophotolysis,</b> {{can be used to}} produce hydrogen from inedible plant biomass. This process is two-stage, with one stage using dark fermentation to convert plant wastes into organic acids. The second stage, photofermentation, uses photoheterotrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria with the addition of light to turn the organic acids into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Such a system can prove useful as a co-generation scheme, providing some of the energy needed to power a larger primary carbon recovery system, such as composting. Since butyrate is expected as one of the major inputs into photofermentation, a characterization study was conducted with the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides SCJ, a novel photoheterotrophic non-sulfur purple bacteria, to examine hydrogen production performance at 10 mM- 100 mM butyrate concentrations. As butyrate levels increased, hydrogen production increased up to 25 mM, and then decreased and ceased by 100 mM. Additionally, lag phase increased with butyrate concentration, possibly indicating some product inhibition. Maximal substrate conversion efficiency was 8. 0 %; maximal light efficiency was 0. 89 %; and maximal hydrogen production rate was 7. 7 Umol/mg/cdw/hr (173 ul/mg cdw/hr).

40|$|Predicted {{increases}} in greenhouse gas emissions, depleting fossil fuel supplies, global conflicts, and energy security are major factors driving {{the search for}} renewable energy supplies. Based on future energy demand projections, biofuels production is expected to increase. However, this increase represents {{a small fraction of}} this growing demand because the land area required to grow sufficient biofuels crops is unavailable. Hence, fulfilling the growing energy demand after attaining peak fossil fuel production will include using a combination of energy sources such as renewables, wind, geothermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and coal. Current and potential feedstocks include grains, grasses, root crops, oil seeds, algae, and lignocellulosics. Grains, sugar crops, and lignocellulosics are the main feedstocks used in full-scale first- and second-generation ethanol processes. While first-generation biodiesel is produced mainly from corn, soybeans, canola oil, rapeseed, palm oil, Jatropha, and coconut oil, second-generation fuels are produced from lignocellulosics. Third-generation technology employs several processes to produce a variety of biofuels from algae while fourth-generation technologies, a developing concept, is intended to employ genetically modified terrestrial or aquatic plants. In another concept, fourth-generation technologies can be configured with CO 2 sequestration and storage. First-generation biobutanol is produced from corn or molasses and from sugar beet as well as sugarcane, while second-generation production processes utilize lignocellulosics such as corn stover, rice straw, corn fiber, switchgrass, alfalfa, reed canary grass, sugarcane bagasse, Miscanthus, waste paper, dry distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), and soy molasses. A variety of technologies, based on the enzyme systems, are currently under investigation for producing biohydrogen. Biohydrogen production routes are divided into <b>biophotolysis</b> (direct/indirect), dark fermentation, and photofermentation. Increasing global demand is expected to drive increasing bioethanol and biobutanol production using food and nonfood feedstocks.

Various biological and thermochemical processes of biomass are taken into consideration to find the most economical method of hydrogen production. Biohydrogen generated by <b>biophotolysis</b> method, photo-fermentation and dark fermentation is studied with respect to various feedstocks in Malaysia. The fermentation approaches of biohydrogen production have shown great potential to be a future substitute of fossil fuels. Dark fermentation method is a simple biological hydrogen production method that uses a variety of substrate and does not require any light as a source of energy. A promising future for biohydrogen production is anticipated by this process both industrially and commercially. Feasibility of hydrogen production from pyrolysis and water gasification of various biomass feedstock confirm that supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass is the most cost-effective thermochemical process. Highly moisturized biomass could be employed directly in SCWG without any high-cost drying process. Indeed, a small amount of energy is required to pressurize hydrogen in the storage tank because of highly pressurized SCWG process. The cost of hydrogen produced by SCWG of biomass is about US$ 3 /GJ (US$ 0. 35 /kg), which is extremely lower than biomass pyrolysis method (in the range of US$ 8. 86 /GJ to US$ 15. 52 /GJ) and wind-electrolysis systems and PV-electrolysis systems (US$ 20. 2 /GJ and US$ 41. 8 /GJ, respectively). The best feedstock for biomass-based hydrogen production is identified based on the availability, location of the sources, processes required for the preparation of the feedstock and the total cost of acquiring the feedstock. The cheapest and most abundantly available biomass source in Malaysia is the waste of palm industry. Hydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent and palm solid residue could {{play a crucial role in}} the energy mix of Malaysia. Malaysia has this great capability to supply about 40 % of its annual energy demand by hydrogen production from SCWG of palm solid waste. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has {{the ability}} to produce {{molecular}} hydrogen (H 2) through the <b>biophotolysis</b> of water under anaerobic conditions. The aim of this thesis was to improve our understanding of the growth and H 2 production of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in order to develop a continuous and practical biophotolytic H 2 production process. A novel flat-plate photobioreactor was designed to facilitate green algal growth and H 2 production at the laboratory scale and to measure key process parameters under controlled conditions. Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry was developed to measure H 2 production rates in situ. In order to achieve effective H 2 production, it was necessary to grow dense and healthy Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures. Favourable algal growth conditions included a temperature of 25 °C, continuous illumination at 5 - 100 W·m- 2 and photomixotrophic growth conditions. Optimum photoautotrophic growth was measured at a carbon dioxide concentration of 11 %. Photosaturation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii occurred at 273 W·m- 2 and photoinhibition at 600 W·m- 2. A reactor-independent nutrient control technique was developed by optimising the sulphate and acetate concentrations in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth medium. It enabled a fully grown algal culture to spontaneously achieve anaerobic H 2 production. A maximum H 2 production rate of 1. 52 mlH 2 ·l- 1 ·h- 1 and a H 2 yield of 119. 8 mlH 2 ·l- 1 were measured. The sulphur dilution technique proved effective at encouraging cyclic H 2 production, resulting in alternating Chlamydomonas reinhardtii recovery and H 2 production stages. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures produced H 2 at an average rate as high as 0. 4 mlH 2 ·l- 1 ·h- 1 under a series of consecutive 95 % dilutions. These complementary approaches have demonstrated that engineering advances can lead to improvements in the scalability and affordability of biophotolytic H 2 production, giving increased confidence that H 2 can fulfil its potential as a sustainable fuel of the future.

40|$|With {{increasing}} global {{populations and}} demand for energy, greater strain {{is placed on the}} limited supply of fossil derived fuels, which in turn drives the need for development of alternative energy sources. The discovery of <b>biophotolysis</b> in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{and the development of a}} spectral-selective photosystem I activating/photosystem II deactivating light (PSI-light) method provides a promising platform for commercial hydrogen production systems. The PSI-light method allows electrons to pass through the photosynthetic electron transport chain while reducing radiation available for photosynthetic oxygen evolution that inactivates hydrogenase. Exploring the physiology of photohydrogen production using the PSI-light method can provide insight on how to optimize conditions for maximum hydrogen production. Through the use of photosynthetic mutant strains of C. reinhardtii, it was possible to suppress photosynthetic oxygen evolution further than using photosystem I light alone to extend photohydrogen production longevity and total yield. A preliminary investigation of an iterating light treatment revealed that longevity and yield could be increased further by providing a period of darkness to allow cells to consume evolved oxygen and resynthesize hydrogenase. Work with these mutants provided understanding that a balance of radiation was required to provide electrons to hydrogenase while limiting oxygen evolution, and that when no light was provided, fermentation of stored starch was the major contributor of electrons to hydrogen production. To determine the role of starch during hydrogen production, wild type cells were exposed to different media and light treatments and monitored for starch consumption and hydrogen production. The results indicated that starch was required for hydrogen production in the dark, but for photohydrogen production, starch likely played a minor role in contributing electrons to hydrogenase. The experiments also showed the importance of acetate in the medium during the hydrogen production phase to allow any significant photohydrogen production. The role of acetate was further investigated as a growth medium constituent that stimulates metabolic activity while reducing photosynthetic oxygen evolution when added to cells grown auto- or mixotrophically. By exposing cells to CO₂ during growth, photohydrogen production was significantly increased over cells grown only in the presence of acetate...|$|E
40|$|One {{free energy}} source that is {{sustainable}} and renewable is the hydrogen gas. The most interesting fact about this gas is when used on vehicles or fuel cells, {{it is more}} efficient than the conventional internal combustion engines. When these compounds react with air, the by-product is just water. Because of these advantages, the hydrogen gas {{is known as a}} low-carbon energy source. This is one solution for modern society, so that the dependence on fossil fuels can be minimized. Other advantage of the hydrogen gas is that it can be produced from various surrounding sources such as water, natural gas, biomass and organic waste. When viewed in terms of the economy, the selection of hydrogen fuel as a source of alternative energy is very appropriate. There are several alternative technologies for the production of biohydrogen process namely <b>biophotolysis,</b> photofermentation, dark fermentation and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC). However, MEC is known to be an attractive alternative technology that is environmentally friendly and can be used for hydrogen production. It involves a bioelectrochemical process using microorganisms as catalysts. MEC process has advantages compared with other processes because the microorganisms are capable of oxidizing all organic substrates to produce hydrogen gas which cannot be extracted by microorganisms through the photo or dark fermentation process. Microorganisms in the reactor are able to catalyze the oxidation or reduction reaction at the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively. By increasing the cathode potential in the MEC reactor, it is possible to continuously produce hydrogen electron exchange assisted by the bacteria. This method greatly decreases the amount of energy needed to produce hydrogen from organic matter compared to hydrogen production from water via electrolysis. Hydrogen production process in the MEC is a highly nonlinear and complex due to the microbial interactions. Its complexity makes MEC system difficult to operate and control under optimal conditions. However, these problems can be alleviated using an integrated process system engineering approach, which involves process modeling, optimization and control complementing each other. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) {{is one of the most}} effective and powerful technique to be used to model such complex processes and unknown systems. ANN is able to cope with non-linear process between input and output variables without the requirement of explicit mathematical representation. In the process control system, ANN has been widely used when conventional control techniques failed to give good performance. In this work, various schemes including ANN for controlling the current and voltage of MEC were studied i. e. Direct Inverse Neural Network, Hybrid PID-Neural Network and Internal Model-based Control schemes. A comparative study has been carried out under optimal condition for the production of hydrogen gas where the controller output are based on the correlation of optimal current and voltage to the MEC system. Various simulation studies involving multiple set-point changes and disturbances rejection have been evaluated and the performances of both controllers are discussed. On-line model validation of MEC system and closed loop control for online system are also presented in this work...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{production in the}} green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was evaluated {{by means of a}} detailed physiological and biotechnological study. First, a wide screening of the hydrogen productivity was done on 22 strains of C. reinhardtii, most of which mutated {{at the level of the}} D 1 protein. The screening revealed for the first time that mutations upon the D 1 protein may result on an increased {{hydrogen production}}. Indeed, productions ranged between 0 and more than 500 mL hydrogen per liter of culture (Torzillo, Scoma et al., 2007 a), the highest producer (L 159 I-N 230 Y) being up to 5 times more performant than the strain cc 124 widely adopted in literature (Torzillo, Scoma, et al., 2007 b). Improved productivities by D 1 protein mutants were generally a result of high photosynthetic capabilities counteracted by high respiration rates. Optimization of culture conditions were addressed according to the results of the physiological study of selected strains. In a first step, the photobioreactor (PBR) was provided with a multiple-impeller stirring system designed, developed and tested by us, using the strain cc 124. It was found that the impeller system was effectively able to induce regular and turbulent mixing, which led to improved photosynthetic yields by means of light/dark cycles. Moreover, improved mixing regime sustained higher respiration rates, compared to what obtained with the commonly used stir bar mixing system. As far as the results of the initial screening phase are considered, both these factors are relevant to the hydrogen production. Indeed, very high energy conversion efficiencies (light to hydrogen) were obtained with the impeller device, prooving that our PBR was a good tool to both improve and study photosynthetic processes (Giannelli, Scoma et al., 2009). In the second part of the optimization, an accurate analysis of all the positive features of the high performance strain L 159 I-N 230 Y pointed out, respect to the WT, it has: (1) a larger chlorophyll optical cross-section; (2) a higher electron transfer rate by PSII; (3) a higher respiration rate; (4) a higher efficiency of utilization of the hydrogenase; (5) a higher starch synthesis capability; (6) a higher per cell D 1 protein amount; (7) a higher zeaxanthin synthesis capability (Torzillo, Scoma et al., 2009). These information were gathered with those obtained with the impeller mixing device to find out the best culture conditions to optimize productivity with strain L 159 I-N 230 Y. The main aim was to sustain as long as possible the direct PSII contribution, which leads to hydrogen production without net CO 2 release. Finally, an outstanding maximum rate of 11. 1 ± 1. 0 mL/L/h was reached and maintained for 21. 8 ± 7. 7 hours, when the effective photochemical efficiency of PSII (ΔF/F'm) underwent a last drop to zero. If expressed in terms of chl (24. 0 ± 2. 2 µmoles/mg chl/h), these rates of production are 4 times higher than what reported in literature to date (Scoma et al., 2010 a submitted). DCMU addition experiments confirmed the key role played by PSII in sustaining such rates. On the other hand, experiments carried out in similar conditions with the control strain cc 124 showed an improved final productivity, but no constant PSII direct contribution. These results showed that, aside from fermentation processes, if proper conditions are supplied to selected strains, hydrogen production can be substantially enhanced by means of <b>biophotolysis.</b> A last study on the physiology of the process was carried out with the mutant IL. Although able to express and very efficiently utilize the hydrogenase enzyme, this strain was unable to produce hydrogen when sulfur deprived. However, in a specific set of experiments this goal was finally reached, pointing out that other than (1) a state 1 - 2 transition of the photosynthetic apparatus, (2) starch storage and (3) anaerobiosis establishment, a timely transition to the hydrogen production is also needed in sulfur deprivation to induce the process before energy reserves are driven towards other processes necessary for the survival of the cell. This information turned out to be crucial when moving outdoor for the hydrogen production in a tubular horizontal 50 -liter PBR under sunlight radiation. First attempts with laboratory grown cultures showed that no hydrogen production under sulfur starvation can be induced if a previous adaptation of the culture is not pursued outdoor. Indeed, in these conditions the hydrogen production under direct sunlight radiation with C. reinhardtii was finally achieved for the first time in literature (Scoma et al., 2010 b submitted). Experiments were also made to optimize productivity in outdoor conditions, with respect to the light dilution within the culture layers. Finally, a brief study of the anaerobic metabolism of C. reinhardtii during hydrogen oxidation has been carried out. This study represents a good integration to the understanding of the complex interplay of pathways that operate concomitantly in this microalga...|$|E
