5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia <b>breathing</b> <b>circuit,</b> bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
25|$|To flush the machine, first remove or disable the vaporizers {{and then}} flush the machine with 10 L/min or greater fresh {{gas flow rate}} for at least 20 minutes. While {{flushing}} the machine the ventilator should be set to periodically ventilate a new <b>breathing</b> <b>circuit.</b> The soda lime should also be replaced. After machine preparation, anesthesia should be induced and maintained with non-triggering agents. The time required to flush a machine varies for different machines and volatile anesthetics. This prevention technique was optimized to prepare older generation anesthesia machines. Modern anesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anesthetics, and should be flushed for 60 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|The core {{instrument}} in an inhalational anesthetic delivery system is an anesthetic machine. [...] It has vaporizers, ventilators, an anesthetic <b>breathing</b> <b>circuit,</b> waste gas scavenging system and pressure gauges. The {{purpose of the}} anesthetic machine is to provide anesthetic gas at a constant pressure, oxygen for breathing and to remove carbon dioxide or other waste anesthetic gases. [...] Since inhalational anaesthetics are flammable, various checklists {{have been developed to}} confirm that the machine is ready for use, that the safety features are active and the electrical hazards are removed. Intravenous anesthetic is delivered either by bolus doses or an infusion pump. There are also many smaller instruments used in airway management and monitoring the patient. [...] The common thread to modern machinery in this field is the use of fail-safe systems that decrease the odds of catastrophic misuse of the machine.|$|E

Although fires have only been reported in association with sevoflurane exposed to desiccated Baralyme® (Allied Healthcare/Chemetron, withdrawn from the market), there is significant evidence that potentially toxic products can be produced upon exposure of volatile anesthetics to other desiccated absorbents containing strong bases, particularly potassium and sodium hydroxide.

In children, flow rates are greater than 6 L/min [1] and may be up to 20 to 30 L/min [15],[32], thus closer to 1 L/kg/min. FiO 2 is set to achieve target saturation between 92 % and 97 %. The gas temperature is set around 37 °C {{in order to reach}} optimal humidification [33],[34].

40|$|End tidal {{carbon dioxide}} (ETCO 2) {{monitoring}} is the non-invasive measurement of exhaled CO 2. The Intensive Care Society guidelines include (ETCO 2) monitoring {{as one of}} the objective standards required for monitoring patients in transport, and the American Heart Association recommends that all intubations must be confirmed by some form of ETCO 2 measurement. The physiological principles and technology underlying ETCO 2 measurement and the clinical indication for its use in the prehospital environment are reviewed. ETCO 2 monitoring has been widely established in the prehospital environment and is of particular use for verification of endotracheal tube placement.

40|$|Long {{duration}} space {{missions are}} becoming highly probable, {{and with them}} arise new challenges. Maintaining the long term health of astronauts and developing the appropriate equipment for advanced medical interventions suitable for space becomes incredibly important. Surgical interventions especially are a problematic scene given the complexity {{and size of the}} required equipment for general anesthesia. As a result, creating advanced inhalational anesthetic devices that are small and light weight is needed for these long duration space missions. The past decade has brought a host of advances that would allow the development of smarter, smaller, lighter, and more efficient machines. These include pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-dynamic models to create feedback delivery systems, better sensing technologies to meter precise gas delivery, and closed <b>breathing</b> <b>circuits</b> that conserve anesthetic agents. However, despite these advances, anesthetic machines and devices still remain incredibly heavy and bulky, and ill-suited for space travel.

50|$|Inhalation will {{decrease}} the bellows angle, which reduces the spring loading, {{and the internal}} pressure in the dosage chamber will lift the diaphragm against the spring, opening the dosage outlet valve and allowing the gas to flow into the <b>breathing</b> <b>circuit</b> until the pressure in the dosage chamber is matched by the spring force, and the diaphragm is pushed back against the outlet valve to close it.|$|E
40|$|Breathing in mammals {{relies on}} {{permanent}} rhythmic and bilaterally synchronized contractions of inspiratory pump muscles. These motor drives emerge from interactions between critical sets of brainstem neurons whose origins and synaptic ordered organization remain obscure. Here, we show, using a virus-based transsynaptic tracing strategy from the diaphragm muscle in the mouse, {{that the principal}} inspiratory premotor neurons share V 0 identity with, and are connected by, neurons of the preBötzinger complex that paces inspiration. Deleting the commissural projections of V 0 s results in left-right desynchronized inspiratory motor commands in reduced brain preparations and breathing at birth. This work reveals {{the existence of a}} core inspiratory circuit in which V 0 to V 0 synapses enabling function of the rhythm generator also direct its output to secure bilaterally coordinated contractions of inspiratory effector muscles required for efficient breathing. The developmental origin and functional organization of the brainstem <b>breathing</b> <b>circuits</b> are poorly understood. Here using virus-based circuit-mapping approaches in mice, the authors reveal the lineage, neurotransmitter phenotype, and connectivity patterns of phrenic premotor neurons, which are a crucial component of the inspiratory circuit...|$|R

25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open <b>circuit</b> <b>breathing</b> set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open <b>circuit</b> <b>breathing</b> sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage flow control valve where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|R
