5000|$|Translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli: The {{wisdom of}} this work, like unto an {{instrument}} of applying collyrium, hath opened {{the eyes of the}} inquisitive world blinded by the darkness of ignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its discourses on religion, profit, pleasure and final release, dispel the ignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expandeth the buds of the water-lily, so this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti hath expanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which destroyeth the darkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is properly and completely illuminated.This work is a tree, of which the chapter of contents is the seed; the divisions called Pauloma and Astika are the root; the part called Sambhava is the trunk; the <b>books</b> <b>called</b> Sabha and Aranya are the roosting perches; the <b>books</b> <b>called</b> Arani is the knitting knots; the <b>books</b> <b>called</b> Virata and Udyoga the pith; the book named Bhishma, the main branch; the <b>book</b> <b>called</b> Drona, the leaves; the <b>book</b> <b>called</b> Karna, the fair flowers; the book named Salya, their sweet smell; the books entitled Stri and Aishika, the refreshing shade; the <b>book</b> <b>called</b> Santi, the mighty fruit; the <b>book</b> <b>called</b> Aswamedha, the immortal sap; the denominated Asramavasika, the spot where it groweth; and the <b>book</b> <b>called</b> Mausala, is an epitome of the Vedas and held in great respect by the virtuous Brahmanas. The tree of the Bharata, inexhaustible to mankind as the clouds, shall be as a source of livelihood to all distinguished poets."Sauti continued, [...] "I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful productions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant taste and not to be destroyed even by the immortals."
