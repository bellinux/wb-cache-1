This effect is particularly important when countries can re-optimise their power plant park within the joint system and when high shares of renewables require substantial <b>back-up</b> <b>capacities.</b> Furthermore, connecting countries with strongly differing profiles of renewable energy feed-in is exceptionally beneficial. And third, we demonstrate that the value of interconnections have started to increase again.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{penetration of}} intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} has an important impact on the operation and planning of power systems. On the one hand the short-term variability and limited predictability challenges system security, resulting in an increased need for operational flexibility.

An alternative is the use of the flexibility provided by long-term demand response. Such demand response can shift demand over longer periods of time, and as such is able to structurally lower demand during periods of low energy availability. This work quantifies the impact of such demand response on the investment planning of a conceptual power system following the integration of large shares of intermittent renewable generation. Simulations show that a limited amount of long-term demand response flexibility can have an important impact on the total system cost and the investments in generation and storage capacity.

40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} {{and wind}} power are increasingly contributing to electricity supply in Europe and worldwide. Due to their intermittent nature, questions of balancing power demand, system stability and the interconnection of electricity, heat and transport sector {{have become a}} major focus of energy system research. REMix is a high resolution multi-sectoral energy system model using a linear optimization approach. It has been developed with the aim of providing a powerful tool for the development and assessment of future energy supply scenarios. Model applications range from cost-minimum green-field capacity expansion analysis to validation of long-term supply scenarios and impact assessment of different storage and balancing options on renewable energy integration. The optimization in REMix is set up in a modular structure and currently comprises around 20 technology modules, describing power generation technologies, heat production technologies or balancing options. The latter include storage, demand response, transmission grids, as well as fuel cell and electric vehicles. Using REMix, the impact of different technologies on the overall system is studied. Model results are presented that show the importance of the interconnection between different demand sectors. Demand response, flexible hydrogen production for industry and transport sector and enhanced coupling between power and heat supply can provide notable amounts of balancing power and energy.

40|$|By 2050, the European Union aims {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gases {{by more than}} 80 %. The EU member states have therefore declared to strongly increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES-E) in the next decades. Given a large deployment of wind and solar capacities, {{there are two major}} impacts on electricity systems: First, the electricity system must be flexible enough to cope with the volatile RES-E generation, i. e., ramp up supply or ramp down demand on short notice. Second, sufficient <b>back-up</b> <b>capacities</b> are needed during times with low feed-in from wind and solar capacities. This paper analyzes whether {{there is a need for}} additional incentive mechanisms for flexibility in electricity markets with a high share of renewables. For this purpose, we simulate the development of the European electricity markets up to the year 2050 using a linear investment and dispatch optimization model. Flexibility requirements are implemented in the model via ramping constraints and provision of balancing power dependent of current renewables feed-in. We find that an increase in fluctuating renewables has a tremendous impact on the volatility of the residual load and consequently on the flexibility requirements. However, any market design that incentivizes investments in least (total system) cost generation investment does not need additional incentives for flexibility. The main trigger for investing in flexible resources are the achievable full load hours and the need for backup capacity. In a competitive market, the cost-efficient technologies that are most likely to be installed, i. e. gas-fired power plants or flexibel CCS plants, provide flexibility as a by-product. Under the condition of system adequacy, flexibility never poses a challenge in a cost-minimal capacity mix. Therefore, any market design incentivizing investments in efficient generation thus provides flexibility as an automatic complement...|$|R

I develop a dynamic economy-wide model of Taiwan with a detailed set of technology options in the power sector to examine the implications of adopting different nuclear power policies on CO 2 emissions and the economy. Absent a carbon mitigation target, limiting nuclear power has a small economic cost for Taiwan, but CO 2 emissions may increase by more than 3. 5 % by 2035 when nuclear is replaced by fossil-based generation. With a low-carbon target of a 50 % reduction from year 2000 levels by 2050, if the nuclear option and carbon sequestration are not viable, gas-fired power would provide almost 90 % of electricity output due to the limited renewable resources. In particular, wind power would account for 1. 6 % to 4. 9 % of that output, depending on how it relies on other <b>back-up</b> <b>capacities.</b> With both non-nuclear and low-carbon policies, deploying carbon sequestration on fossil-based generation can significantly reduce the negative GDP impact on the economy.

This thesis is based on research which set out to identify factors that contribute to the resilience of homestead garden systems – their capacity to withstand or recover from a disturbance. The study was carried out in three districts of Sri Lanka following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. The field research focussed on homestead garden cultivation in Matara, Hambantota and Ampara districts. The approach included interviews with growers, a plot walk where possible, and interviews and discussion with organisations working on post-tsunami agricultural rehabilitation. Although the original aim of the research was to focus on the impact of agronomic practices on resilience, many of the results indicated the importance of wider livelihood, social and political issues. Four key themes were identified. Firstly agro-ecological practices, such as integrated crops and living fences, were important to the resistance of the homestead gardens to the impact of the wave. Secondly, a diversity of livelihood options contributed to the resilience of whole household systems by providing a <b>back-up</b> income. Human <b>capacities,</b> on both individual and community levels, were also fundamental to households’ ability to recover following the disaster. Finally, processes of policy and development bore an overarching impact on many different aspects of the resilience of households surveyed. The research approach was found to have {{a significant}} impact on the results and their emphasis on the impact of broader social and political aspects on the resilience of homestead garden systems. The findings and research experience highlight both the challenges of carrying out crossdisciplinary research, and the importance of such approaches to explore the wider contexts of resilience. The research found that agroecological approaches did enhance the resilience of homestead growers, although there was a level of impact above which recovery was not helped by the approach to cultivation. Tree and shrub cover stabilised the soil and broke the force of the water, reducing the impact on the cultivated area and infrastructure. Many trees also survived the Tsunami and enabled growers to gain an income. Diverse livelihoods, with income options such as agro-processing or non-farm work were also found to contribute to the resilience of homestead garden households, providing an alternative income when cultivation was not possible. Community support through family and community networks was also found to be central to the recovery of many households. National and international approaches to development were found to {{have a significant}} impact on the resilience of households, in terms of its influence on agronomic practices, natural resource management, and the economic viability of homestead cultivation...|$|R

This approach should help avoiding any a priori opinion to favor long term investments in storage systems. Indeed, future electricity systems will face challenges such as significant increases in variability and intermittency of generation, the rapid growth of distributed energy/power resources including distributed generation, the penetration of electric vehicles and controllable demand, deployment of smart appliances enabling active demand response. A growing interplay between transmission and distribution levels will then be given rise. Future power systems will therefore need a properly designed, market-based system architecture allowing for decarbonisation while ensuring system reliability and security of supply.

This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is ‘translated’ into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results.

The results show that wind {{can play an important}} role to meet near term renewable electricity targets, accounting 22 % of the total generation in 2020 with an installed capacity of 21 GW, and long-term climate change mitigation target, with installed capacities of 33 GW and 49 GW in 2035 and 2050 respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that, when there is no CCS, wind is crucial to meet the long-term climate policy and can supply up to 50 % the UK electricity demand in 2050, with an installed capacity of 90 GW. Since wind is an intermittency source, the UK electricity system needs an installed capacity of about 56 GW of gas plants as a <b>back-up</b> <b>capacity</b> in 2050...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper presents partial {{findings of a}} doctoral research into approaching urban resilience in post-conflict settings using Iraq as a case study. The literature in this area points out that understanding regulatory frameworks of urban management is important for approaching resilience through sector-specific reconstruction in post-conflict cities, and as a framework within which the enablement of citizens that are building homes within a post-conflict setting can be examined and assessed. Approaching resilience in post-conflict settings in this way, {{in the case of}} Iraq in the period after the 2003 war, provides an insight into resilience processes. Fieldwork has revealed that house-owners are using their own adaptive capacity in housing supply to maintain survival and urban growth within urban neighborhoods, in spite of experiencing chronic stresses and acute shocks {{as a result of the}} ongoing transition from conflict to peace. Initial data analysis has shown that a reformation of urban management structures in post-conflict Iraq could enable and support alternative key actors in the private and public and the voluntary sectors as partners in urban development. Here, citizens' enablement in a bottom-up approach to reconstruction can offer a <b>back-up</b> <b>capacity</b> in acute times to sustain cities' functioning and competitiveness in urban development and long term resilience...|$|E
40|$|Germany changed {{renewable}} remuneration {{for wind}} power from a fixed Feed-In Tariff (FIT) to a floating Market Premium Scheme (MPS) in 2012. One {{aim of this}} adjustment was to better align the supply of generated wind electricity with the demand for it, e. g. through more system-friendly wind turbine technology choices. In energy systems with a high share of variable renewable energies, such turbines produce a higher share of their production at lower wind speeds and thus can {{reduce the need for}} alternative flexibility options like <b>back-up</b> <b>capacity,</b> storage, grid extensions and demand side measures. However, based on a wind power investment model, I show that the MPS fails to convey strong enough incentives to project developers to significantly alter their investment decisions as long as these base their investments on current electricity market price profiles and are limited by their access to risk-averse project finance. One reform proposal to support the installation of system-friendly turbines is a change in the production volume-based benchmark approach which plays an integral part in both the fixed FIT and the MPS. The investment model indicates that such a revised policy can incentivize the deployment of moderately more system-friendly wind power technologies at some locations. An alternative option is to shift to a production value-based benchmark approach. It directly reflects the future additional market value of system-friendly turbines in today's remuneration structure. Thus, this approach sets incentives also for investors without perfect foresight - or with financing constraints - to deploy more systemfriendly turbines that meet the requirements of power systems with increasing shares of wind power...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the major}} {{benefits}} {{and challenges of}} electricity demand side management (DSM) {{are discussed in the}} context of the UK electricity system. The relatively low utilisation of generation and networks (of about 50 %) means that there is significant scope for DSM to contribute to increasing the efficiency of the system investment. The importance of the diversity of electricity load is discussed and the negative effects of DSM on load diversity illustrated. Ageing assets, the growth in renewable and other low-carbon generation technologies and advances in information and communication technologies are identified as major additional drivers that could lead to wider applications of DSM in the medium term. Potential benefits of DSM are discussed in the context of generation and of transmission and distribution networks. The provision of <b>back-up</b> <b>capacity</b> by generation may not be efficient as it will be needed relatively infrequently, and DSM may be better placed to support security. We also present an analysis of the value of DSM in balancing generation and demand in a future UK electricity system with significant variable renewable generation. We give a number of reasons for the relatively slow uptake of DSM, particularly in the residential, commercial and small business sectors. They include a lack of metering, information and communication infrastructure, lack of understanding of the benefits of DSM, problems with the competitiveness of DSM when compared with traditional approaches, an increase in the complexity of system operation and inappropriate market incentives.

40|$|Balancing of {{intermittent}} {{power generation}} from renewable energy (RE) {{is one of}} the central challenges within the system transformation towards a more sustainable supply. This talk addresses the potential role of flexible electric loads and power-controlled operation of combined heat and power (CHP) plants in meeting increasing balancing needs in Germany. It relies on an enhancement and application of the cross-sectoral REMix model, which is designed for the assessment of energy supply scenarios based on a system representation in high spatial and temporal resolution. The analysis is composed of three fundamental parts. The first part is dedicated to the quantification of theoretical potentials for demand response (DR) and CHP in Europe. In the second part, the linear optimization model within REMix is extended by DR and the heating sector. In the third part, REMix is applied to assess the future energy supply in Germany. Least-cost dimensioning and operation of DR capacities, as well as heat supply systems are evaluated for different scenarios for the year 2050. According to the REMix results, the application of DR is mostly limited to short time peak shaving of the residual load. This implies that its focus is on the provision of power, not energy. In contrast, power-controlled heat supply has proven to be an effective measure to increase RE integration. It is achieved by a modified operation pattern of CHP and heat pumps enabled by thermal energy storage on the one hand, and utilization of surplus power for heating purposes on the other. The model application reveals that DR and power-controlled CHP operation are not competing but complementary measures in the realization of higher RE integration and lower <b>back-up</b> <b>capacity</b> demand. It can be concluded that both are important elements in a future German energy system mainly relying on renewable sources...|$|E
