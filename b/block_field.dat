50|$|A blockfield (also spelt <b>block</b> <b>field)</b> felsenmeer, boulder {{field or}} stone field is a surface covered by boulder- or block-sized angular rocks usually {{associated}} with alpine and subpolar climates and periglaciation. Blockfields differ from screes and talus slope in that blockfields do not apparently originate from mass wastings. They {{are believed to be}} formed by frost weathering below the surface. An alternative theory suggests that modern blockfields may have originated from chemical weathering that occurred in the Neogene when the climate was relatively warmer. Following this thought the blockfields would then have been reworked by periglacial action.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, problem-oriented {{policing}} {{has become a}} central strategy for policing. In a number of studies, problem-oriented policing {{has been found to}} be effective in reducing crime and disorder. However, very little is known about the value of problem-oriented interventions in controlling violent street crime. The National Academy of Sciences 2 ̆ 7 Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior suggests that sustained research on problem-oriented policing initiatives that modify places, routine activities, and situations that promote violence could contribute much to the understanding and control of violence. This study evaluates the effects of problem-oriented policing interventions on urban violent crime problems in Jersey City, New Jersey. Twenty-four high-activity, violent crime places were matched into 12 pairs and one member of each pair was allocated to treatment conditions in a randomized <b>block</b> <b>field</b> experiment. The results of the impact evaluation support the growing body of research that asserts focused police efforts can reduce crime and disorder at problem places without causing crime problems to displace to surrounding areas...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{studied the}} {{productivity}} of plant and ratoon cane in soils with different physical, chemical and mineralogical particulars submitted to phosphate fertilization. Randomized <b>block</b> <b>field</b> experi- ments were located at Japungu Distillery (Paraíba State), at Sugar Cane Experimental Station of Carpina (Pernambuco State) and at Bom Jesus Sugar Cane plant (Pernambuco State), from where Argisoils of sandy, mid and clayey textures were selected respectively. The doses of 0, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 200 kg ha - 1 P 2 O 5 were applied {{at the bottom of}} the furrow (fertilization foundation). In the subsequent ratoon cane were applied 0 and 40 kg ha - 1 P 2 O 5 (topdressing) for each of the doses applied at the planting.

The ratoon cane only responded nicely to phosphorus coverage in the less weathered medium texture Argisoils; Phospho- rus fertilization of ratoon sugarcane coverage in clay and weathered Argissolos did not promote increased productivity, restricting its recommendation in Argissolos with these characteristics...|$|E
30|$|New {{detailed}} swath bathymetry and Sidescan Sonar {{data collected}} on the submerged flanks of Stromboli, integrated with seismic data and seabed sampling indicate that repeated lateral instability processes occurred on the eastern flank of the volcano, although no debris avalanche deposits were known before the high resolution exploration of the seabed (Romagnoli et al. 2009). This flank of the island is opposite to the north-western side, affected by repeated flank collapses and this setting is evident of a structurally-controlled instability of the flanks of the volcanic edifice. Two large scale lateral collapses are evidenced by a <b>block</b> <b>field,</b> cropping out on the middle-lower eastern submerged slope and by a chaotic unit actually embedded within the volcaniclastic sequence {{at the foot of}} the submerged flank. A morphological continuity can be envisaged between this submerged scar and the inferred subaerial one. A spatial and temporal reconstruction of possible events is also proposed. The chaotic debris avalanche unit, buried within the volcaniclastic apron at the slope base and partially reworked in its distal part within the Stromboli canyon floor is thought to be the result of a lateral collapse event. The megablock field can instead result from a more superficial debris avalanche (Romagnoli et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Preceding crops as {{a source}} of organic matter are {{important}} sources of micronutrient and can {{play an important role in}} the soil fertility and soil cycling of micronutrients. In addition to the role of the organic matter in increasing the concentration of micronutrients in soil solution, attention should be also paid to the role of the kind and the quantity of the root’s exudates released in response to the incorporation of different plant residues in the rhizosphere. Present research was conducted with the objective of studying the effect of the kind of preceding crops: Trifolium (Trifolium pretense L) and Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L) on chemical forms of copper (Cu) in solid phases of a calcareous soil in a completely randomized <b>block</b> <b>field</b> experiment with split plot (3 m × 5 m) arrangement, consisting of 3 replications and 3 treatments. After incorporation of the residue, wheat (genotype back cross) was planted. After harvesting the wheat, soil samples were collected from root zone of wheat. Selected soil properties and chemical forms of Cu were de-termined in the solid phases of the soil samples. Incorporation of plant residues significantly increased the concentration of DTPA-extractable Cu, in the soil. The highest effect was obtaine...|$|E

40|$|In 2005 {{the damage}} caused by onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) on a {{susceptible}} hybrid of early cabbage (cv. ‘Parel’) was studied in a <b>block</b> <b>field</b> experiment. The cabbage was grown in four treatments: 1) on non-mulched surfaces, 2) on surfaces mulched with barley straw, 3) on surfaces mulched with hay and 4) on surfaces mulched with black PE mulch. The trial consisted of two parts: the first part included plots that were mulched as indicated from the very beginning (normal), while in the second part the soil was first covered with black PE mulch for about one month, than this was removed and replaced either by organic mulches or left non-mulched (postponed). In this way, we wanted to diminish the yield loss because of low temperatures and abundant precipitation. Under cold and wet conditions in spring which led to late appearance and low levels of the pest, the growing of cabbage under black PE mulch proved most effective and these plants exhibited the greatest head mass as well as the greatest net mass, although they also suffered most damage from the pest. The cabbage {{in the second part of}} the experiment exhibited higher head mass as well as higher net head mass compared to the first part...|$|E
