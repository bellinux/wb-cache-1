5|$|Individuals with {{breathing}} difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing {{the ability to}} stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations {{must be given to}} potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 2008, MNS and SP workers {{indulged in}} street {{fighting}} after the former tried {{to attack the}} latter, who were proceeding to Shivaji Park, Dadar, in Mumbai to attend a rally organised by the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA), the ruling coalition party of India, of which the SP is a member. The rally was to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and other prominent members of the UNPA and SP. Police arrested 73MNS and 19SP workers after these clashes on charges of rioting.|$|E

5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> decreasing welding speed, {{increasing the}} current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects {{can make the}} weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are harvested {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E

5|$|The 747 was {{conceived}} while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, {{led by the}} enormous popularity of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by Juan Trippe, president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), {{one of their most}} important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>by</b> a larger new aircraft.|$|E
