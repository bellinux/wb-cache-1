50|$|The major {{types of}} {{conifers}} cultivated, pines, Douglas-firs, true firs, and spruce trees, are all affected by {{some types of}} insect pests. Douglas-firs are most vulnerable to the Cooley spruce gall adelgid. The true firs are most susceptible to insects such as the balsam gall midge (Paradiplosis tumifex), and the <b>balsam</b> <b>twig</b> <b>aphid.</b> Species of spruce trees face assault from insects such as the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi), Cooley spruce gall adelgid, and the pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae). The final category of Christmas trees, pines, are commonly susceptible to insect infestation and damage from the pine root collar weevil (Hylobius radicis), Zimmerman pine moth (Dioryctria zimmermani), pine needle scale, and white pine weevil.|$|E
40|$|Utah, and Arizona provenances of whitC Eir (Abies covicolor [Gord. Br Glen&] Lindl.) to crown injury {{caused by}} <b>balsam</b> <b>twig</b> <b>aphid</b> (MLukrrur abierinus Koch.) was {{assessed}} in an experimental plantation {{in the central}} Sierra Nevada in California. Bud phenology was obsewed to explore relationships between flushing times and crown injury. Highest susceptibiiity occurred in the Oregon provenances, which represented natural populations intermediate between A. cmolm and grand fir (A. grandis lj 30 ug. l Lindl). Least susceptibility occurred in provenances from northern and central California, southern Wornia, and western Arizona, representing A. concolor var. Iowiana or var. concolor, or their intermediates. Moderate susceptibility occurred in var. concolor provenances from eastern Nevada and western Utah. Flushing times of provenances varied, but evidence that they influenced susceptibility to the aphid was scant. Retrieval Terms: susceptibility, resistance, white fir, injury, insects hite fir (Abies concolor [Gord. & Glend. ] Lindl.) is a widely disaibuted montane forest species, and an impormt Christmas tree, in western North America.

5000|$|<b>Balsam</b> <b>twig</b> <b>aphids</b> (Mindarus abietnus) {{are another}} type of tree pest which affects fir and spruce trees in the spring. The aphids can cause stunted growth in trees with heavy infestations {{rendering}} badly damaged trees unsellable. Other species of adelgids also infest fir trees, those include the pine bark adelgid, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), and the {{eastern spruce gall adelgid}} (Adelges abietis). Another serious pest are bagworms. These pests can defoliate a tree completely if present in large enough numbers. Additionally, the damage caused by the silk of bagworms can last years.|$|R
40|$|A {{multimedia}} geochemical data set, {{collected in}} SW Cape Breton Island, was spatially and statistically analyzed {{to enhance the}} geochemical understanding and to evaluate the mineral potential of the area. The data sets, which include stream water and <b>balsam</b> fir <b>twig</b> surveys, along with the bedrock geology and the topography with drainage, were integrated and spatially analyzed in a geographic information system. Although stream sediment geochemistry is a well-established sample media in mineral exploration, little work on the statistical analysis of stream water {{has been done to}} determine the controls of the geochemistry of the water and to aid mineral exploration. Yule's coefficient was used in two attempts, each with different zones of influence, to compare the stream water and the <b>balsam</b> fir <b>twig</b> survey. The weights of evidence technique is a probability based approach for locating mineral potential using the spatial distribution of known mineral occurrences. The explanatory variables used to produce a mineral potential map included the underlying bedrock geology, copper residuals from the stream water geochemical survey and the proximity to structural faults. This approach calculates a weight for each class in the multi-class catchment basin maps for copper. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was much}} to do to the hut. The absence of {{anything}} but stunted and impoverished timber and the limitation of time, had forbidden a log hut, and their home was really only a double framework, rammed tight between inner and outer frame {{with a mixture of}} earth and boughs and twigs of willow, pine and balsam. The floor was hammered earth carpeted with <b>balsam</b> <b>twigs</b> and a caribou skin. Outside and within wall and roof were faced with coarse canvas--that was Trafford's idea--and their bunks occupied two sides of the hut. Heating was done by the sheet-iron stove they had brought with them, and the smoke was carried out to the roof by a thin sheet-iron pipe which had come up outside a roll of canvas. They had made the roof with about the pitch of a Swiss ch√¢let, and it was covered with nailed waterproof canvas, held down by a large number of big lumps of stone. Much of the canvassing still remained to do when the men went down, and then the Traffords used every scrap of packing-paper and newspaper that had come up with them and was not needed for lining the bunks in covering any crack or join in the canvas wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue spruce}} is {{attacked}} by {{two species of}} Adelges, an aphid-like insect that causes galls to form. Nymphs of the pineapple gall adelgid form galls {{at the base of}} twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the Cooley's spruce gall adelgid cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the spruce budworm eat the buds and growing shoots while the spruce needle miner hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white scale insect, the pine needle scale feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the <b>twigs</b> and <b>aphids</b> also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles. Another insect pest is the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) which bores under the bark. It often first attacks trees which have blown over by the wind and when the larvae mature two years afterwards, a major outbreak occurs and vast numbers of beetles attack nearby standing trees.|$|R
