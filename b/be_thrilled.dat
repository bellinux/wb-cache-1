Ivan Sulic of IGN praised the graphics, sound, general Star Wars setting, and online mode, but was {{very critical of}} both the AI and the single-player mode. [...] "This is a multiplayer-centric third and first-person shooter, [...] means players who opt to stick to single player will have something to do, but won't <b>be</b> <b>thrilled</b> enough to desire extended play." [...] He cited three major issues with the game's single player element: its easy difficulty, its lack of cohesion, and poor AI teammates and enemies. Of the AI, Sulic stated [...] "Everyone is an idiot. The game appears to use a sort of context sensitive AI, meaning bots in the right positions will do stuff (like use turrets and vehicles and lay down cover fire), but those not immediately engaged in combat will idly stand around helping themselves to an endless breather." ...|$|E
