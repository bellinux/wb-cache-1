40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies {{characterize}} AS-level topology of the Internet by exploiting connectivity information contained in BGP routing tables. In this paper, we present an alternative method for discovering AS connectivity by inferring individual AS connections from the Internet's router-level topology. This methodology has several advantages over using BGP routing tables. First, {{it allows us to}} obtain AS-level connectivity information at a finer granularity (e. g., multiple connections between a pair of ASs); second, we can discover ASs aggregated in BGP routing tables; and third, we can identify AS <b>border</b> <b>routers,</b> which may allow us to further characterize inter-AS connections. <b>Border</b> <b>routers</b> have multiple interfaces, each with an address in a potentially different AS. A major challenge of our approach is then to properly map <b>border</b> <b>routers</b> to their corresponding ASs.

40|$|Abstract—Existing routing {{protocols}} for sensor networks either exclusively focus on collection-based traffic, or optimize for point-to-point traffic in a homogeneous network. As these networks become more general, {{a mix of}} these workloads in a heterogeneous setting is expected, while still abiding by the resource constraints of low-power and lossy networks (L 2 Ns). Our design leverages the predominantly two-tiered topology of L 2 N deployments, with capable <b>border</b> <b>routers</b> supplementing resource-starved in-network nodes, and optimizes for the typical traffic workloads consisting mainly of collection based traffic with specific instances of point-to-point traffic. We present Hydro, a hybrid routing protocol that combines local agility with centralized control.

50|$|Path vector routing is {{used for}} inter-domain routing. It is similar to {{distance}} vector routing. Path vector routing assumes that one node (there can be many) in each autonomous system acts {{on behalf of the}} entire autonomous system. This node is called the speaker node. The speaker node creates a routing table and advertises it to neighboring speaker nodes in neighboring autonomous systems. The idea is the same as distance vector routing except that only speaker nodes in each autonomous system can communicate with each other. The speaker node advertises the path, not the metric, of the nodes in its autonomous system or other autonomous systems.Path vector routing is discussed in RFC 1322; the path vector routing algorithm is somewhat similar to the distance vector algorithm in the sense that each <b>border</b> <b>router</b> advertises the destinations it can reach to its neighboring router. However, instead of advertising networks in terms of a destination and the distance to that destination, networks are advertised as destination addresses and path descriptions to reach those destinations. A route is defined as a pairing between a destination and the attributes of the path to that destination, thus the name, path vector routing, where the routers receive a vector that contains paths to a set of destinations.The path, expressed in terms of the domains (or confederations) traversed so far, is carried in a special path attribute that records the sequence of routing domains through which the reachability information has passed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the {{standard}} protocol for exchanging routing information between <b>border</b> <b>routers</b> of Autonomous Systems (ASes) in today’s Internet. Within an AS, <b>border</b> <b>routers</b> exchange externally-learned BGP route advertisements via Internal-BGP (I-BGP) peerings. Naive solutions for these I-BGP peering sessions (e. g., based on full-mesh topologies) simply cannot scale to the sizes of modern AS networks. Carefully designed route-reflector configurations can drastically reduce the total number and connection cost of the required I-BGP sessions. Nevertheless, no principled algorithmic approaches exist for designing such configurations, and current practice relies on manual reflector selection using simple, ad-hoc rules. In this paper, we address the novel and challenging optimization problems involved in designing effective BGP route-reflector configurations for AS networks. More specifically, we consider the problems of selecting route reflectors in an AS topology to minimize: (1) the total connection cost of all I-BGP peering sessions, and (2) the average distance traversed by route advertisements within the AS. We present N P-hardness results that establish the intractability of these problems, and propose several polynomial-time approximation algorithms (based on LP-rounding and combinatorial techniques) with guaranteed (constant-factor or logarithmic) bounds {{on the quality of}} the approximate solution. Our simulation results validate our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of our configuration algorithms over a wide range of network topologies. I...|$|R
