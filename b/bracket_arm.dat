50|$|By 1985, the MBTA {{was finally}} in a {{position}} to retire its PCCs from the Green Line as the issues plaguing the Boeings were resolved to a point where a majority of the cars operated reliably and the MBTA placed an order for additional light rail cars from Kinki Sharyo, which were delivered the following year. With the PCC cars retired, the Green Line operating fleet had become exclusively pantograph equipped, eliminating the need for the wire frogs that were used to guide the trolley poles' current collectors at switches. The overhead catenary received additional upgrades, the first of which used primarily span wire support from the existing line poles.

50|$|The Dening Hall is {{the main}} hall of the temple, and was built in 1270 during the Yuan Dynasty. The hall is fronted by a massive {{platform}} known as a yuetai (月台, literally moon platform), which measures 25 by 20 meters. Built on a very high platform itself, the Dening Hall can be accessed by either a center front staircases or one of two side staircases attached to the yuetai. Enclosing {{the perimeter of the}} platform is a white marble balustrade capped by lions. The hall itself measures seven by four bays and is surrounded by a covered arcade. According to the Yingzao Fashi, a Song Dynasty architectural treatise, the Dening Hall has 6th puzuo type column bracketing to support its roof. This type of bracketing has three transverse and three horizontal <b>bracket</b> <b>arms.</b> The 6th puzuo brackets are the most complex that survive from the Yuan Dynasty. Based on the complex bracketing, the marble balustrade and the height of the platform, Steinhardt identifies the Dening Hall as one of the two most eminent and important extant wooden halls that date from the Yuan period. These characteristics also closely match descriptions of the architecture at the capital, meaning that Dening Hall is representative of the architecture at the Yuan dynasty capital of Dadu (currently Beijing).|$|R

50|$|The planned {{community}} of Riverton was being developed in West Henrietta, New York by Henry Hamlin and William Morris. The cornerstone {{of this new}} project was a proposed light rail line that was to connect Riverton with downtown Rochester constructed along the former Erie Railroad Rochester Division right of way. A small trolley museum was envisioned as a natural outgrowth of the planned light rail line. With the knowledge that several Rochester area streetcars were preserved at the Magee Transportation Museum, Hamlin and Morris made a visit to see what could be salvaged from the shuttered museum.Before his untimely death, Harry Magee had expressed hope that the Rochester streetcars in his collection could one day be returned to New York State to be restored and operate once again. The first car acquired was former Elmira, Wavery and Corning Railway car 107, {{as well as a}} stock of <b>bracket</b> <b>arms</b> and other stock to construct overhead wire. New York State Railways Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway car 157 was also acquired in the same deal. Lease of a recently abandoned dairy barn on state agricultural lands in West Henrietta was acquired by Hamlin to house the two cars. Temporary tracks were laid and car 157 was placed inside the barn on October 5, 1973, with car 107 following a month later. Rochester Transit Corporation sand car 0243 and Rochester City and Brighton Railroad horse car 55 were brought to the barn site, on loan from the Rochester Museum and Science Center. A provision charter was issued in 1975, bringing formal organization to the New York Museum of Transportation.|$|R

This proceeded as a volunteer project, including the building of a signal box. However, prior to commissioning, the project was abandoned in 2001. The trackwork (apart for the siding off the Up Loop) remained in situ. In June 2002, the loop was once again used to run trains around as part of the 2002 Gala to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the restoration of services to Blaenau Ffestiniog.

25|$|In {{semaphore}} areas, junctions are signalled using {{a series}} of between 2 and 5 stop signal <b>arms</b> on one <b>bracket</b> or gantry, known as splitting signals. Each arm (usually) has its own post ("doll") on the <b>bracket,</b> and each <b>arm</b> applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the dolls usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, {{although there is no}} definite standard. In some cases, the tallest doll applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided – {{a series of}} side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which doll on the following stop signal was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large speed reduction is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which signal arm applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast.|$|R

40|$|Moan&# 39; {{noise in}} a vehicle is known to cause {{discomfort}} and anxiety to passengers. This abnormal noise is generated by a stick-slip phenomenon between the brake pad and the disc during breaking. The exciting force from the brake system is transmitted to a coupled torsion beam axle module through the brake pad, the caliper and an extra bracket. In this study, moan noise is reproduced during the vehicle&# 39;s operating test, and {{the parts of the}} coupled torsion beam axle module generating moan noise are identified. Further, it is verified that the resonance of the coupled torsion beam axle module due to the exciting force of the brake system is the main cause of moan noise. Coherence analysis and transfer path analysis were conducted to identify how the vibrations from the coupled torsion beam axle module are related to moan noise in the passenger compartments of vehicles. In the coherence analysis, the vibration accelerations of the brake pad, the caliper, the spindle <b>bracket,</b> the trailing <b>arm</b> and the V-beam are set as the inputs, and the output is the noise at the driver&# 39;s ear level. In terms of the frequency response, the results from a modal analysis of the coupled torsion beam axle module under the vehicle&# 39;s test conditions agreed well with those from a finite element modal analysis in which the boundary conditions of the vehicle were taken into consideration. The dynamic characteristics of the response from the coupled torsion beam axle module were identified using the exciting-force transfer mechanism of the brake system. The locations producing a large strain were determined by calculating the modal strain energy, and an improvement scheme with design modification was proposed for moan noise reduction...|$|R
40|$|To be {{published}} in the Aug. 1996 issue of the Astronomical Journal I present sensitive high resolution VLA B, C, and D array observations of the almost edge-on Scd galaxy NGC 4244 in the 21 -cm spectral line of neutral atomic hydrogen. The gas layer of NGC 4244 is rather symmetric in all respects, i. e. the surface density distribution, flaring and warping. This symmetry allows for a reliable determination of the rotation curve, {{despite the fact that the}} galaxy is close to edge-on. The rotation curve rises slowly in the inner 6 kpc, is roughly constant at 100 km s − 1 out to 10 kpc, and decreases in Keplerian fashion by 15 % at the last measured point at 14 kpc. The rotation curve constrains the stellar mass-to-light ratio to lie between 50 and 100 % of the “maximum-disk ” value. A new technique is presented to determine simultaneously the inclination and the thickness of the gas layer from high resolution H I observations. This procedure uses the apparent widths at many azimuths (many channels) and can be used at inclinations as low as 60 o. Kinematic information is used to separate flaring from warping. The inclination of the unwarped disk is about 84 o. 5, while the small warp coincides with a decreasing inclination (to 82 o. 5 ± 1 o). The data indicates that at large radii the disk warps back to the plane defined by the inner disk. The measured gaseous velocity dispersion is roughly constant within the optical disk (8. 5 ± 1 km s − 1) and increases slightly beyond. On both sides of the galaxy the thickness of the gas layer increases gradually from ∼ 400 pc at 5 kpc to ∼ 1. 5 kpc at the last measured point (at 13 kpc).

40|$|Glass façade {{systems in}} {{buildings}} {{are subject to}} racking action due to inter storey drift caused by earthquake and wind actions. The performance of façade systems {{is dependent on the}} amount of imposed drift and the interaction of the glass panels with the façade structural support frames. There are two major concerns related to the glass façade system performance during and immediately after a seismic event, hazards to people from falling glass and cost associated with building down time and repair. Glass façade systems can be classified into two types namely, framed glass façade system (FGFS) and point fixed glass façade system (PFGFS). It was observed that the damage to glass façade systems resulting from in-plane racking actions mainly earthquakes is increasingly common and yet there have been limited number of published research work available in this field. The research conducted to date mainly focused on traditional framed glass façade systems. However, the seismic performance of PFGFS is likely to be quite different from conventional framed systems. Therefore, the aim of the research presented in this thesis is to assess the inplane racking performance of PFGFS which is gaining popularity worldwide. Two unique full scale in-plane racking laboratory tests (Test # 1 and Test # 2) on typical PFGFS with different types of spider <b>arms</b> (<b>brackets</b> to connect the glass and the structural support frame) were conducted. Detailed 3 -D finite element models were developed and validated against the experimental test results to interpret the racking behaviour of PFGFS. Specific racking mechanisms were attributed to the drift capacity in each test. Further detailed FE analyses were conducted to evaluate the individual drift contributions of each racking mechanism such as rigid body translation at the built-in standard gaps, spider arm rotation and spider arm deformation. It was found that most of the drift capacity is attributed to the rigid body translation at the built-in standard gaps. The FE models were then used to predict the racking performance of PFGFS with different configurations. The seismic assessment of glass façade systems requires an estimate of the likely drift demand from the building. Codified provisions for in-plane drift limits on glass façade systems {{can be used as a}} conservative option. Analysis results presented in this thesis indicated that the inter-storey drift demand is much less than the 1. 5 % limit specified in AS 1170. 4 (2007) for most buildings in Australia for a 500 year return period seismic event except for soft storey structures. Standard seismic assessment procedures can be used to estimate the optimum in-plane seismic drift demands from the buildings. Based on that some rapid inter storey drift assessment methods were presented with example calculations. Conservatively, the in-plane racking capacity of PFGFS resulting from the rigid body translation of the glass panels at the built-in standard gaps can be used as the design in-plane drift capacity. If required, the drift capacity can be increased by introducing special articulation features at the bolted connections. Care should be taken at the boundary conditions of the perimeter glass panels to achieve the racking capacity of the PFGFS from the rigid body translation at the built-in gaps. In order to assist façade engineers, particularly at the conceptual design stage, a quick selection guide is presented to identify the structural components of PFGFS which can increase the racking performance of the façade system...|$|R
