5|$|Stark {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison. Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E

5|$|The President {{was coming}} into {{increasing}} conflict with Congress on {{the handling of}} the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or raised questions about the appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone—a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.|$|E
5|$|The rebels had {{multiple}} sources for arms, {{but did not}} possess heavy weaponry, {{with the exception of}} two artillery pieces. Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia, Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled Mauser rifles to the rebels that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I, weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British-Arab offensive in 1918, and raids against French arms warehouses. The rebels' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and Turkish five-shooters, as well as sabres and daggers. According to Khoury, the rebels also possessed twelve light machine guns. Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920, the Turks became the main arms suppliers of the rebels. The rebels distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans, who the rebels viewed negatively, <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in the struggle against French occupation.|$|E

25|$|For {{the biblical}} authors the {{chronology}} was theological in intent, functioning as prophecy {{and not as}} history. Biblical literalism, however, does not treat it this way, because literalists have a profound respect for the Bible as the word of God. This way of thinking had its origins in Christian fundamentalism, an early 20th century movement which opposed then-current non-supernatural interpretations {{of the life of}} Jesus <b>by</b> <b>stressing,</b> among other things, the verbal inspiration of scripture. The underlying concept, or fear, was that if everything in the Bible were not true, everything would collapse.|$|E

The second President of Russia Vladimir Putin inherited these problems when he took office, and during his election campaign in 2000, the new president won popular support <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> the need to restore law and order and to bring {{the rule of law}} to Russia as the only way of restoring confidence in the country's economy.|$|E

A girl named Deisuit is cured of blindness after being taken to Ninian's shrine (chapter fourteen), while two lepers are cured by Ninian's intervention after bathing at his well (chapter fifteen).

25|$|At the time, NASA was {{becoming}} {{more sensitive to the}} strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning Cassini–Huygens attempted to correct this trend <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the Soviet Union, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose Cassini–Huygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his second}} Gubernatorial term, Kean was named President of Drew University, a small liberal arts {{university}} in Madison, New Jersey. Kean's considerable standing as a popular former governor of the state was helpful as he undertook an upgrading of the university's campus and academic programs <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> the primacy of teaching, the creative use of technology in the liberal arts, and the importance of international education. During Kean’s presidency, applications to Drew increased by more than 40 percent; the endowment nearly tripled; and more than $60 million was committed to construction of new buildings and renovation of residence halls and other older buildings. Kean was extremely popular among the student body; he would frequently eat lunch unannounced with students in the dining hall, and was a regular spectator at Drew sporting events. Kean served as Drew's President until 2005, teaching a highly selective political science seminar.|$|E
25|$|After this {{recommendation}} {{was published}} the Cardiff Corporation attempted {{to secure the}} location of the college as Cardiff, and on 12 December 1881 formed a University College Committee to aid the matter. A competition arose between Swansea and Cardiff about where the college should be located and on 12 March 1883, after a period of arbitration, the location was set as Cardiff. The case for Cardiff was strengthened <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> the need to take account of the interests of Monmouthshire, at that time not legally considered part of Wales, as well as the greater sum of money received by Cardiff in support of the college, through a public appeal that raised £37,000, and a number of private donations, notably from the Lord Bute and Lord Windsor. In April Lord Aberdare was appointed as the College's first president. The possible locations considered for the college included Cardiff Arms Park, Cathedral Road or Moria Terrace, Roath, before the site of the Old Royal Infirmary buildings on Newport Road was chosen.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{agitation}} applied as periodic {{seismic stress}} (shaking) reduced stem elongation, leaf expansion, and biomass accumulation by vegetative soybeans. Level of photon flux (PPF) influenced {{the type and}} extent of plant response to mechanical stress. Plant parts responded differently as PPF varied between 135 and 592 micromoles m- 2 s- 1. Stem length was significantly reduced <b>by</b> seismic <b>stress</b> at 135 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 but this effect was insignificant at higher PPFs. Reduced stem length resulted from an inhibition of internode elongation. Stem diameter was unaffected <b>by</b> <b>stress</b> at the PPFs tested. In contrast to effects on stem elongation, leaf area was insensitive to stress treatments at 135 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 but was progressively inhibited <b>by</b> <b>stress</b> as PPF increased. Statistically significant reductions in shoot f. wt and d. wt <b>by</b> seismic <b>stress</b> occurred only at 295 micromoles m- 2 s- 1. Root biomass accumulation was not affected <b>by</b> seismic <b>stress</b> at any PPF used in this study...|$|R

25|$|Ryerson's major {{contribution}} {{was as a}} Marxist historian and {{it was here that}} Ryerson was to find his voice. The Canadian bourgeoisie's dismissal of Communism generally states that it is an alien importation and as such has no basis within Canadian society. <b>By</b> <b>stressing</b> the progressive nature of the Canadian past, the CPC hoped to prove the validity of its existence within Canadian society. During this period, numerous articles and pamphlets were published by the CPC, {{but it was not until}} the 1937 publication of Stanley Ryerson's 1837-The Birth of Canadian Democracy, that the full Marxist analysis of the on the 1837 Rebellions would appear. 1837 should be viewed as a work of Marxist historiography written for a working-class audience and not for academia; since Ryerson wrote this book so it could be used as a weapon in the struggle of working people to build a qualitatively different and better world. Ryerson's rationale for writing this book, as was the rationale for all his works, can be best summarised as an exploration of Canadian history with the hopes of educating the working-class, in a sense it was an exercise in the raising of class consciousness.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, at the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), those Christian Churches that {{favored a}} denominational structure, {{wished to be}} more ecumenical, and also {{accepted}} more of the modern liberal theology of various denominations, adopted a new [...] "provisional design" [...] for their work together, becoming the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Those congregations that chose not {{to be associated with}} the new denominational organization continued as undenominational Christian churches and churches of Christ, completing a separation that had begun decades before. [...] The instrumental Christian Churches and Churches of Christ in some cases have both organizational and hermeneutical differences with the Churches of Christ discussed in this article. [...] For example, they have a loosely organized convention and view scriptural silence on an issue more permissively, but they are more closely related to the Churches of Christ in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with the Disciples of Christ denomination. Some see divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, with the a cappella Churches of Christ and Christian churches and churches of Christ resolving the tension <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> Bible authority, while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension <b>by</b> <b>stressing</b> ecumenism.|$|E
