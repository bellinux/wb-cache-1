500|$|In 1984, {{a review}} {{carried out on}} behalf of the Arts Council by the {{journalist}} William Rees-Mogg opined that England lacked [...] "a great eastern symphony orchestra", and suggested that the RPO should move to Nottingham. [...] Another contemporaneous Arts Council report recommended that the RPO should supplement the LSO as resident orchestra at the Barbican Centre; neither proposal came to fruition. During the 1980s, the British government imposed strict constraints on public spending; {{to make up for lost}} revenue, the RPO, along with the other self-governing London orchestras, was forced into increased reliance on <b>business</b> <b>sponsorship</b> as a primary source of funds. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, recording this, comments, [...] "Such sponsorship is, however, subject to changing circumstances and thus less secure in the long term." ...|$|E

50|$|In North America, semi-professional {{athletes and}} teams {{were far more}} common in the early and mid-20th century than they are today. There are many benefits, such as collegiate {{eligibility}} and the attendant scholarships, in maintaining amateur status (unlike the Amateur Athletic Union, the NCAA forbids any sort of compensation outside of scholarships, including job offers tied to their playing). Eligibility for participation in the Olympics in some sports is still dependent upon maintaining a purely amateur status (although far less so than was previously the case), and such athletes may be supported by government money, <b>business</b> <b>sponsorships,</b> and other systems. At the same time, professional sports have become such a massive and remunerative business that even many low-level feeder teams can afford to have fully professional athletes.|$|R

This would allow entrepreneurs to have chances to sponsor or co-sponsor sport events to increase their exposure rate, brand image, and brand equity through constant media reports.

The questionnaire was used to collect data from two sport events. The results show that <b>business</b> sport <b>sponsorship</b> is a significant impact on brand image, the brand image is positive influence to the brand equity, and the mediating effect of sport sponsorship on brand image and brand equity is supported...|$|R
