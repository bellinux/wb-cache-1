25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic block signal system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate <b>bidirectional</b> <b>operation,</b> one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E

The southern branch of the Geneva RER, the CEVA will be electrified to 25 kV 50 Hz, so the 1.5 kV DC electrification of the Geneva to Bellegarde section is a third voltage for regional trains. To alleviate these two problems, two engineering projects have started, the first being to modify the double and single lines between Cornavin and the junction to the airport for <b>bidirectional</b> <b>operation</b> on all three tracks with either 25 or 15 kV, {{and the second is}} to reelectrify the Bellegarde to Geneva section to 25 kV AC.

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} risks and benefits of the double-switch operation using a hemi-Mustard atrial switch procedure and the <b>bidirectional</b> Glenn <b>operation</b> for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. To avoid complications associated with the complete Senning and Mustard procedures and to assist right-heart hemodynamics, we favor a modified atrial switch procedure, consisting of a hemi-Mustard procedure to baffle inferior vena caval return to the tricuspid valve in conjunction with a <b>bidirectional</b> Glenn <b>operation.</b> MethodsBetween January 1994 and September 2009, anatomic repair was achieved in 48 patients. The Rastelli–atrial switch procedure was performed in 25 patients with pulmonary atresia and the arterial–atrial switch procedure was performed in 23 patients. A hemi-Mustard procedure was the atrial switch procedure for 70 % (33 / 48) of anatomic repairs. ResultsThere was 1 in-hospital death after anatomic repair. There were no late deaths or transplantation. At a median follow-up of 59. 2 months, 43 of 47 survivors are in New York Heart Association class I. <b>Bidirectional</b> Glenn <b>operation</b> complications were uncommon (2 / 33), limited to the perioperative period, and seen in patients less than 4 months of age. Atrial baffle–related reoperations or sinus node dysfunction have not been observed. Tricuspid regurgitation decreased from a mean grade of 2. 3 to 1. 2 after repair (P = . 00002). Right ventricle–pulmonary artery conduit longevity is significantly improved. ConclusionsWe describe a 15 -year experience with the double-switch operation using a modified atrial switch procedure with favorable midterm results. The risks of the hemi-mustard and <b>bidirectional</b> Glenn <b>operation</b> are minimal and are limited to a well-defined patient subset. The benefits include prolonged conduit life, reduced baffle- and sinus node–related complications, and technical simplicity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Collections are omnipresent within models: {{collections}} of references can represent relations between objects, and {{collections of}} values can represent object attributes. Consequently, manipulating models often consists of performing operations on collections. For example, transformations create target collections from given source collections. Similarly, constraint evaluations perform computation on collections. Recent research works focus on making such transformations or constraint evaluations active (i. e. incremental, or live). However, they propose their own {{solutions to the}} issue {{by the introduction of}} specific languages and/or systems. This paper proposes a mathematical formalism, centered on collections and independent of languages and systems, that describes how the implementation of standard operations on collections can be made active. The formalism also introduces a reversed active assignment dedicated to <b>bidirectional</b> <b>operations.</b> A case study illustrates how to use the formalism and its Active Kermeta implementation for creating an active transformation. ...|$|R

50|$|Previously, {{the section}} of the line east of Acton had an older {{signalling}} system which permitted operations in one direction on each track, which prevented express trains from passing locals and limited schedule density.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in graphics hardware {{enable us to}} handle not only simple polyhedral shapes but complicated smooth shapes in CAD systems. Since the CAD systems represent such smooth surfaces by extending conventional simplicial representation, there are several problems in handling the smooth surface shapes that have no intuitive polyhedral approximations. The first {{problem is that the}} design of smooth surfaces requires a large amount of user interactions because of the complexity of the shapes. Secondly, none of the design operations characteristic of smooth surfaces are taken into account in contemporary CAD systems. Furthermore, they cannot provide the users with any efficient keys for shape databases {{due to the lack of}} information about smooth surface features. To remedy such problems, hierarchical representations of smooth surfaces based on the shape features are necessary. This thesis presents a new feature-based modeling method for smooth surfaces. In particular, the aim of this thesis is to implement <b>bidirectional</b> <b>operations</b> between object shapes and shape features for smooth surfaces, i. e., design by features and feature extraction.

40|$|ObjectiveDespite {{improved}} {{survival and}} neurodevelopmental outcome, children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome {{and other forms}} of univentricular heart remain at increased risk for cognitive, motor, and other neurologic deficits. MethodsWe examined 27 children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome or other forms of univentricular heart at a median age of 5. 70 years (range 4. 99 – 7. 51 years) and performed brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging on 20. Possible risk factors were correlated with outcome. ResultsMean full-scale IQ among patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was 86. 7; that among patients with other forms of univentricular heart was 89. 1, with both differing significantly from the expected population mean (P =. 015 and P =. 029, respectively). Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 1 of 7 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 2 of 20 with other forms of univentricular heart. Brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging revealed ischemic changes and infarcts or atrophy in 5 of 8 patients who had undergone the Norwood procedure and in 2 of 12 of those who had not (P =. 062). Abnormal computed tomographic findings correlated significantly with lower full-scale IQ (P =. 045) and verbal IQ (P =. 02). In the multiple linear regression model, diuresis the third day after the primary operation and cardiopulmonary bypass time in the <b>bidirectional</b> Glenn <b>operation</b> correlated significantly with the primary outcome of full-scale IQ.

40|$|ObjectivesDespite recent {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} children with univentricular heart, their neurodevelopmental outcome remains a major concern. MethodsThis prospective follow-up study evaluated the neurodevelopmental outcome of 23 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, 14 with other forms of univentricular heart, and 46 healthy control subjects at a median age of 12. 2 months. The Griffiths Developmental Scale and Alberta Infant Motor Scale served for developmental evaluation. ResultsThe mean Griffiths developmental quotient of children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was significantly less (91. 6) than that of control children (106. 8, P <. 001). Patients with univentricular heart scored significantly lower than control subjects only in the gross motor domain (P =. 001) but not in overall development (100. 6). Alberta Infant Motor Scale scores were significantly lower in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (37. 5, P <. 001) and univentricular heart (43. 5, P =. 011) than in control subjects (53. 3). In linear regression a diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (P =. 016), a clinical history of seizure (P =. 002), and the highest plasma lactate level after the <b>bidirectional</b> Glenn <b>operation</b> (P =. 045) were significantly associated with the developmental quotient. ConclusionsAt age 1 year, the level of development of children with univentricular heart was significantly lower than for control subjects only in motor skills, whereas children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome had a more widespread developmental delay.

Mean pulmonary vascular resistance was 2. 2 +/- 0. 2 Wood U (range 0. 5 to 7. 3) and mean pulmonary artery area Nakata index was 318 +/- mm 2 /m 2 (range 80 to 821). Additional procedures were performed in 17 patients, including pulmonary artery reconstruction in 15 (29 %) and bilateral caval anastomoses in 5 (10 %). There were 4 hospital deaths (8 %).

MÉTODOS: Operados 59 pacientes, entre março 1990 e dezembro 1995, com idades entre 2 e 132 meses (média 32, 7 ± 33, 6). Todos submetidos a exames clínico, laboratorial, ecocardiograma contrastado com microbolhas e cateterismo cardíaco. RESULTADOS: Nos 54 pacientes sobreviventes as FAVPs ocorreram em 20 (37, 0 %). A idade desses pacientes variou de 2 a 132 meses (média 29, 6 ± 29, 7). A atresia tricúspide em 10 (50, 0 %) e o coração univentricular em 8 (40, 0 %), foram as cardiopatias prevalentes. Em 13 (65 %) a operação de Glenn bidirecional foi realizada à direita, em 2 (10,%), à esquerda e em 5 (25 %) foi bicaval. O tempo de seguimento dos pacientes FAVPs, variou de 4 a 84 meses (média 32, 4 ± 21, 65), e nos sem fístulas de 1 a 77 meses (média de 23, 4 ± 18, 8), com valor de p= 0, 04, com significância estatística. O diagnóstico de FAVPs foi feito pelo ecocardiograma contrastado com microbolhas nos 20 casos, sendo considerado positivo, ao se detectar retorno de microbolhas pelas veias pulmonares. A angiografia pulmonar mostrou alterações compatíveis com FAVPs em 16, demonstrando sensibilidade de 80 %. CONCLUSÃO: A incidência de FAVPs pós-operação de Glenn bidirecional foi alta (37 %), e o intervalo de tempo decorrido após a operação de Glenn bidirecional, foi a única variável independente que se correlacionou de forma significativa com o aparecimento das FAVPs (p= 0, 04); o ecocardiograma com microbolhas foi o método padrão de diagnóstico; a angiografia pulmonar se revelou um método com sensibilidade de 80, 0 %.

METHODS: From March 1990 to December 1995, 59 patients were operated upon. Their ages ranged from 2 to 132 months (mean, 32. 7 ± 33. 6). All underwent clinical and laboratory examinations, microbubble contrast echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: Of the 54 survivors, 20 (37. 0 %) had PAVFs.
