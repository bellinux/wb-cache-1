On 19 August 2013, the protesters observed two minutes of silence. In the subsequent days, a donation box was also set up in order to collect funds for the injured people. A woman from a nearby store (also among those who had sustained injuries) had previously offered products to the protesters at a discount. On 15 October 2013, in the 14th minute of the World Cup qualifier between Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, part of the supporters in the stadium erupted with chants [...] "Resignation!" [...] followed by the calling of then manager Luboslav Penev's name (to indicate that the coach was not {{the target of the}} fans' dissatisfaction). 'The protester' received the most votes for politician of the year 2013 in Bulgaria, while the anti-Oresharski protests were singled out as the event {{of the year in the}} country, based on the annual survey of Darik Radio. Between 10 September and 30 November 2014, the international festival Fotofabric took place in Sofia and included two main exhibitions at different locations in the city - [...] "the protester" [...] (an assortment of photo reports from recent protests around the world) and [...] "the human and his states [...] " [...] (consisting of artistic representations from the [...] "Alcobendas" [...] collection in Spain). Photos from the anti-Oresharski demonstrations that had been selected by Vasil Garnizov were also featured as part of the first exhibit.|$|E
40|$|Chinyere Nnenne Pedro-Egbe, Chibuike Sydney Ejimadu, Henrietta NwachukwuDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt, NigeriaBackground: Eye {{injuries}} and subsequent {{loss of vision}} from the glass and caps of exploding pressurized bottled drinks have been well reported, {{and as a result}} most developed countries now use mainly plastic bottles. In Nigeria, however, most drinks are still sold in glass bottles and ocular injuries from this source are therefore not uncommon. Aim: To retrospectively analyze ocular injuries resulting from exploding glass-bottled Coca-Cola&reg; and propose ways of eliminating such injuries in future. Setting: Eye Clinic, University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Materials and methods: The medical records of all cases of ocular injury that presented at the Eye Clinic of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over a 5 -year period (January 2006 to December 2010) were retrieved and relevant data including age, sex, occupation, events surrounding <b>bottle</b> <b>explosion,</b> and type of ocular injury sustained were extracted. Results: A total of 426 cases of ocular injuries was seen during the period under review. There were 335 (78. 6 %) males and 91 (21. 4 %) females. Six patients had ocular injury from exploding glass-bottled Coca-Cola&reg;, giving an incidence of 1. 4 %. The presenting visual acuities (VA) were light perception (2 cases), counting fingers (2 cases), and 1 VA of 6 / 24 and 1 VA of 6 / 12. There were 4 (66. 7 %) cases of corneoscleral laceration with uveal prolapse and 1 case of total hyphema. Conclusion: Because pressurized glass-bottles can explode with normal handling, legislation to ban the use of glass containers for bottling carbonated drinks {{will go a long way}} to reducing ocular morbidity from this source. Plastic bottles should be introduced as an alternative. Keywords: ocular injuries, exploding glass-bottled drin...|$|E

More policemen appeared, but {{were forced to}} {{withdraw}} under the heavy [...] "artillery barrage" [...] of rocks and <b>bottles.</b> An <b>explosion</b> {{set fire to the}} police bus that blocked the entry to the square. The police left and the square was occupied. At the truck barricade on Onești street a bus was set on fire. At the balcony of the Geology College (Facultatea de Geologie), Marian Munteanu, head of the Student League from the University of Bucharest, announced that the students were on strike and would barricade themselves in the building until their arrested colleagues were released. Shortly thereafter, the main HQs of the Bucharest Police, Interior Minister and SRI were attacked. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails, started fires, conducted various acts of violence, destroyed documents and objects, and took people hostage. There were rumours that trains full of miners were heading for Bucharest.|$|R

In addition, Montenier also holds US Patent No. 2,642,313 for the [...] "Unitary container and atomizer for liquids." [...] This was developed in 1947 when Montenier, working with engineers from the Plax Corporation, invented a commercial use for the plastic bottle. His innovation was for “Stopette,” an underarm deodorant dispensed by squeezing the bottle. This one <b>bottle</b> created an <b>explosion</b> in the industry for the plastic bottle.

40|$|The gushing of carbonated {{beverages}} {{is defined as}} a spontaneous wild and uncontrolled overfoaming upon opening of non-shaken bottles. As overfoaming is detected after bottling this results in significant economic and image losses to the producer. A mechanism referred to as secondary gushing is well understood and is due to the presence of external inorganic material or technical shortcomings. On the other hand, the very disastrous primary gushing mechanism is still under discussion although it is known it is related to the presence of fungal proteins, the Class II hydrophobins. Despite 25 years of research, several parts of the puzzle are still missing. Recent reviews on the phenomenon indicate that hydrophobins may stabilize gaseous CO 2 bubbles without explaining however how this occurs and how coated bubbles are made and gain stability. We studied how the two main factors, Class II hydrophobins and CO 2 interact to induce gushing. Class II hydrophobin HFBI was extracted from the mycelium of Trichoderma reesei MUCL 44908 with a Tris/HCl buffer, purified by RP-HPLC, detected by MALDI-TOF and identified by Edman amino acid sequencing. Sparkling water was used as source of CO 2. Considering the physico-chemical properties of both Class II hydrophobins and CO 2 and by performing molecular dynamics simulation, it was observed that CO 2 molecules interact with the hydrophobic patch of Class II hydrophobin and a detailed mechanism formation of coated CO 2 bubbles, the stabilized nanobubbles, was proposed. It occurs in several steps : migration of hydrophobins to the liquid-gas interface, contamination by contact with pure CO 2 atmosphere, concentration followed by crystallization, shaking causing imbalance of Henrys equilibrium in the closed recipient, re-equilibrium resulting in the nanobubble formation by closing due to the lateral forces (Young-Laplace forces). Finally, the closed bottle contains gaseous CO 2 nanobubbles stabilized by a crystalline layer of Class II hydrophobin. These solid structures are characterized by a consistent geometric value as their volume is determined by the critical diameter of CO 2 at the pressure in the <b>bottle.</b> The <b>explosion</b> of the bubble, i. e. the nanobomb effect, can be described by Avogadros law and even by Boyle-Mariottes law since temperature has a small influence. Nevertheless, primary gushing behavior in function of temperature does not fit with this theory in practice. Indeed, much more liquid than could be predicted is expelled from the bottle by increasing the liquid temperature at the opening. This indicates that beside the chemical binding, a lot of CO 2 is linked by low energy bonds that can be broken just by agitation energy. Since Class II hydrophobins are able to stabilize gaseous CO 2 bubbles, which must have a critical diameter at atmospheric pressure a method based on the dynamic light scattering was developed. This novel method allows to distinguish primary (hydrophobin) from secondary (kieselghur) gushing. It is based on the presence of 100 nm particles which areformed in the overfoamings after rest under saturated CO 2 (1 bar) only when hydrophobins are present. The 100 nm diameter corresponds to the critical diameter of CO 2 at atmospheric pressure. The method clearly indicates whether the gushing of bottled beer is either primary or secondary. This method was also applied to predict the gushing potential of barley and malt and can distinguish contaminated from non-contaminated raw materials. The target is to further propagate this method in order to confirm at industrial scale the good results obtained. Finally, the work describes some suggestions in order to prevent and/or to cure primary gushing.
