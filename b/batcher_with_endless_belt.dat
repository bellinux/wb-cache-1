50|$|As {{the gun was}} {{originally}} designed, ammunition could be fed by a 5-round clip, a 15-round link belt, or a non-disintegrating 30-round <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> magazine.

50|$|When an <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> {{does not}} fit the need, jointed and link V-belts may be employed. Most models offer the same power and speed ratings as equivalently-sized <b>endless</b> <b>belts</b> and do not require special pulleys to operate. A link v-belt is a number of polyurethane/polyester {{composite}} links held together, either by themselves, such as Fenner Drives' PowerTwist, or Nu-T-Link (with metal studs). These provide easy installation and superior environmental resistance compared to rubber belts and are length-adjustable by disassembling and removing links when needed.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army Air Corps {{decided the}} <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> {{computer}} {{cost too much}} to manufacture, so later in 1937 Dalton morphed it to a simple, rigid, flat wind slide, with his old Model B circular slide rule included on the reverse.

Usually, the tunnel is filled to a height of 1.8 – 2  m. If this height is exceeded, an effect of anaerobiosis by compaction of compost can be provoked. On the other hand, when this height is lower than 1.6  m, the tunnel probably does not reach the temperature values required and the injection of steam is necessary.|$|R

5000|$|A {{paternoster}} ( [...] , , or [...] ) or paternoster lift is {{a passenger}} elevator {{which consists of}} a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. The same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store large amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts. The much smaller belt manlift which consists of an <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> <b>with</b> steps and rungs but no compartments is also sometimes called a paternoster.|$|R

Field tests in different water approach velocities, with the screen traveling at various rates, proved that such a facility can be operated efficiently.

60|$|The {{appearance}} of day brought all on board on deck again; and, as is usual with adventurers on the water, the opening horizon was curiously examined, as objects started {{out of the}} obscurity, and the panorama brightened under the growing light. East, west, and north nothing was visible but water glittering in the rising sun; but southward stretched the <b>endless</b> <b>belt</b> of woods that then held Ontario in a setting of forest verdure. Suddenly an opening appeared ahead, and then the massive walls of a chateau-looking house, with outworks, bastions, blockhouses, and palisadoes, frowned on a headland that bordered the outlet of a broad stream. Just as the fort became visible, a little cloud rose over it, and the white ensign of France was seen fluttering from a lofty flagstaff.|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{horizontal}} {{vacuum belt filter}} was used to dewater smuts mud and to filter cane mud. The filter gave good results on smuts dewatering, offering several advantages over the existing system, {{including the fact that}} no flocculant is required. Large scale units of this type are to be used at the Maidstone and Felixton II mills for smuts dewatering. The performance on cane mud filtration was encouraging. Filtercake of the same or better quality as produced by the rotary drum filters could be obtained.
