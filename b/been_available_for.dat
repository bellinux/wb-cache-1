5|$|The {{popularity}} of the Baths of Zeuxippus was very great among the citizens, despite the numerous number of baths that had <b>been</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> public access {{at the time in}} Constantinople, and therefore, the great competition that existed in that commercial area. Even the likes of clergy and monks were seen there, despite the insistence by their superiors that the baths were places of impious behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog has <b>been</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> {{all three}} major seventh-generation video game consoles. It {{was part of}} the Wii Virtual Console at the service's 2006 introduction, and was {{released}} for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards. The game was released for the iPod Classic, iPod video, and video-capable iPod Nano models in 2007 and for Apple's iOS in April 2009. Sonic the Hedgehog became available on GameTap in September 2009. In October 2010, it was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam. The game was ported to Android and released in December 2012. Additionally, the game is an unlockable reward in the console versions of Sonic Generations. The game was also made available on the Sega Forever service on iOS and Android in June 2017.|$|E

5|$|Specimens {{that have}} been {{identified}} by morphology as Beringian wolves (C.lupus) and radiocarbon dated 25,800–14,300 YBP {{have been found in}} the Natural Trap Cave {{at the base of the}} Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, in the western United States. The location is directly south of what would at that time have been a division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan direct competitors of the dire wolf, which were also adapted for preying on megafauna, to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°Nlatitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have <b>been</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is not known. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as did the dire wolf.|$|E
5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because it would not have <b>been</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E
5|$|Most modern {{smartphones}} {{are capable}} of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video. Not all of YouTube's videos {{are available on the}} mobile version of the site. Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have <b>been</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone. In July 2010, the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5, avoiding the need to use Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls. The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform. In September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system. According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Beringian wolves {{have been found}} in Alaska and as far eastward as the Yukon in Canada. Specimens that have been {{identified}} by their skull morphology to be Beringian wolves {{have been found in}} the Natural Trap Cave {{at the base of the}} Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, United States. These were radiocarbon dated to between 25,800 and 14,300YBP, and this location is directly south of what would at that time have been the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. This suggests that a temporary channel existed between the glaciers from 25,800YBP until the advance of the ice sheets 16,000-13,000YBP. The migration of the Beringian wolf southwards is assumed to have been the result of pursuing prey species, as this cave also contained specimens of steppe bison that had migrated from Beringia and would have been prey for wolves, and muskox that is known to be an important prey species of the Beringian wolf. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°N latitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have <b>been</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> Beringian wolves to expand southwards. There is no evidence of expansion beyond this region.|$|E
