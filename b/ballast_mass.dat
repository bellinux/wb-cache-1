40|$|As {{climate change}} seems {{to become more}} and more of a serious issue, a sudden surge of {{interest}} in clean and renewable energy sources is inevitable. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), or the process of harnessing energy from the temperature difference between the warm upper ocean layer and the cold bottom ocean layer, is one of these renewable energy production methods. In order to pump up this cold water, a large diameter pipe of a length in the order of 1000 m is deployed. A pipe of such large properties will indubitably suffer from problems related to production, installation and drag forces. Up till now these problems have all largely been evaluated. One phenomenon that has been explored less frequently is VIV in OTEC, and this is therefore the main scope of this research. Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) are the vibrations that occur when a current flows past a cylinder, shedding vortices at higher Reynolds numbers, leading to an asymmetrical pressure distribution. For this research, the pipe is modelled as a slender Euler-Bernoulli beam conveying fluid, with gravity and ambient flow considered. The model is discretised and rewritten into state-space representation, {{in order to make it}} suitable for Python’s odeint ordinary differential equation-solver. A wake oscillator model is introduced to model the VIV phenomenon, and the complete model is used to evaluate multiple scenarios to evaluate the influence of variables as pipe diameter, <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> and current velocity. A typical cold water pipe is made of a light material as for example HDPE, has a length in the order of 1000 m and a diameter of around 2. 5 m, kept under tension by a <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> in the order of magnitude of 350 tonnes. For this research, this typical cold water pipe is taken as a starting point and subjected to a uniform current flow of 0. 4 m/s. The VIV response of the pipe is then evaluated with a range of different variables. First, the pipe is evaluated in steel, FRP and HDPE to establish which material is most suitable. HDPE shows the best fatigue resistance, and is therefore chosen as the material in which the further research will be conducted. The pipe diameter is varied between 2. 0 and 6. 0 m, the diameter to wall thickness ratio between 12 and 26, the effect of the magnitude of the <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> is evaluated and the inflow velocity is changed between 1. 0 and 6. 0 m/s. Finally, the current flow is varied between a uniform current of 0. 1 m/s and 0. 8 m/s and a location specific sheared current profile is applied, in order to check whether VIV in the OTEC cold water pipe might occur in a realistic setting. Depending on the chosen variables, in general the pipe will experience a maximum cross-flow displacement per diameter ranging between 0. 6 and 1. 0. Furthermore, for each set of variables the pipe will vibrate in a different normal mode, which might lead to the fact that a pipe with less maximum displacement will still experience more fatigue damage. Pipes in larger diameters will definitely suffer from a higher fatigue, however the maximum experienced damage per year was in the order of 10 - 15, meaning that this is insignificant. The wall thickness will not have a lot of effect. The <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> however, can better be chosen high since it prevents vibrations at a high mode and it seems that HDPE is strong enough in terms of yield strength to survive a large mass. Finally, when the pipe is subdued to high currents, it seems as if in-line displacement will become a larger problem then VIV, as the in-line bending reaches dangerously high levels when subjected to a current of 0. 8 m/s. It has to be noted however that certain measures can be taken against this displacement. It is very likely that VIV occurs in a cold water pipe of an OTEC plant as it is subjected to certain current flows, but in the case HDPE is used, this does not seem a large concern.

40|$|Space Test Program Mission S 26 (STP-S 26) was {{a complex}} multi-payload mission {{launched}} from Kodiak Launch Complex, Alaska on November 20, 2010. A Minotaur-IV launch vehicle placed ten objects into two different orbits. The Stage 4 rocket motor placed four Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) -class satellites and two CubeSats into the primary orbit. A Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System (HAPS) then delivered two test <b>ballast</b> <b>masses</b> into a secondary orbit as a technology demonstration to prove dual-orbit {{capability of the}} Minotaur-IV. In addition, a CubeSat, ejected {{from one of the}} free-flying ESPA-class satellites on January 20, 2011, and one of the ESPA-class satellites (FASTRAC) separated into two satellites on March 22, 2011. Multi-payload missions always present unique challenges and STP-S 26 was no exception. Through the use of a “lessons learned” database, the STP-S 26 program office was able to leverage the experiences gained from previous multi-payload missions. One previous mission in particular was the STP- 1 mission launched on an Atlas V in March 2007. STP- 1 separated four ESPA-class satellites and a larger satellite pair into two orbits. This paper will review the key challenges and lessons learned from the STP-S 26 mission pertaining to multi-payload integration and launch. Lessons were derived from requirements and interface management, technical, logistical, and managerial aspects of the mission. Some of the areas reviewed in the paper include: Unique requirements for multi-payload missions and verification of those requirements; Mechanical fit checks; Procedures for integrated operations such as multi-satellite mate; Integrated tip off and separation analysis; Multi-payload coupled loads analysis; Meeting environmental, debris, and de-orbit requirements; Logistic scheduling of payload arrival and pre-launch checkout in a shared processing facility; Efficient 2 ̆ 6 timely communication across teams; Finite Element Model and mass properties early requirement definition; Risk Management Process; Interface Control Document verifications; and Space Debris Assessment Report (SDAR), Launch Conjunction Assessment Support Package (LCASP), and policy exception processes. The number of multi-payload missions is expected to grow with the trend toward smaller spacecraft.

Associations between these two groups of variables were determined by the Hotteling's biorthogonal canonical correlation analysis and, consequently, {{a large number of}} significant canonical pairs were obtained. In the present study only the first pair of canonical dimensions obtained has been interpreted because of limited space, and because the first pair exhausted the largest portion of variability due to the method applied.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of pachyostosis, pachyosteo‐sclerosis, and osteosclerosis {{may be to}} act as ballast, not so much (as previously suggested) to neutralise the buoyancy of existing lungs, but to allow enlargement of the lungs. Enlarged lungs cause an animal to lose buoyancy more rapidly with depth. They also provide a larger oxygen store. These features are useful for slow swimmers and shallow divers, such as feeders on benthic plants and invertebrates. Examples are sirenians, primitive sauropterygians ("not‐hosaurs"), placodonts, and the sea otter Enhydra. These last two show convergent evolution of adaptations to feeding on hard‐shelled invertebrate prey in shallow water. Mesosaurids are problematical. Bone <b>ballast</b> uses body <b>mass</b> and volume less efficiently than other buoyancy control strategies. Theoretical analysis predicts that bone ballast should not occur in semiaquatic forms, fast swimmers or deep divers. It does not usually occur in such organisms. Marine iguanas of the Galápagos, desmostylians, and the aquatic sloth Thalassocnus are all littoral feeders and all lack bone ballast as predicted. Plesiosaurs adopted varied strategies: some used bone ballast, and others used gastroliths. Biomechanical considerations lead to the prediction that a new marine tetrapod clade will typically evolve bone ballast {{as part of its}} adaptation to life in water. Slow swimmers and grazers on sessile food, like sirenians and placodonts, develop it more strongly, but active predators like ichthyosaurs and cetaceans secondarily lose this character. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{autonomous}} hybrid-driven underwater glider {{presented in}} this thesis combines {{the concept of a}} buoyancy-driven underwater glider and a conventional autonomous underwater vehicle. It is classified as a new kind of autonomous underwater glider. The existing buoyancy-driven gliders have proven to be powerful tools in oceanographic applications. This is because they are inexpensive, high-endurance and energy-efficient. However, they still have weaknesses in terms of speed and manoeuvrability due to the under-actuated system; relatively slow; limited propulsion forces; and limited external control surfaces. Furthermore, it is difficult to control the glider because of the high nonlinearity and complexity of the glider dynamics, coupled with the underwater environments and disturbances. Thus, the main objective of this research is to design and develop a controller algorithm that is able to make the glider adaptive despite facing these constraints. A robust and reliable homeostatic-inspired controller system has been designed for this purpose. The controller is able to adapt efficiently to the dynamically changing conditions and is able to compensate the disturbance from water currents. The controller algorithm has been designed based on the human innate control mechanism by integrating three artificial systems: the artificial neural network (ANN), artificial endocrine system (AES), and artificial immune system (AIS). According to simulation results of control methods benchmarking, the homeostatic controller was able to achieve the desired pitch angle at the fastest settling time, which was 12. 5 seconds faster than the xxix model predictive control (MPC); 9 seconds faster than the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR); 6. 5 seconds faster than the neural network (NN) controller; and 3. 75 seconds faster than the neuroendocrine controller. In addition, the homeostatic controller was able to optimise the <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> and distance of the sliding mass in order to achieve the desired pitch angle by shortening the sliding mass distance up to 53. 7 % and reducing the <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> up to 17. 7 % when compared with the LQR and MPC. Overall, the homeostatic controller has achieved the best performance compared with the LQR, MPC, NN and neuroendocrine controllers. Furthermore, the validation analyses between the simulation and experimental results have shown that the homeostatic control system produces very satisfactory performance, with the homeostatic controller able to achieve the desired angle...|$|E
40|$|Due to its higher {{capacity}} factor and proximity to densely populated areas, {{offshore wind power}} with integrated energy storage could satisfy > 20 % of U. S. electricity demand. Similar results could also be obtained {{in many parts of}} the world. The offshore environment can be used for unobtrusive, safe, and economical utility-scale energy storage by taking advantage of the hydrostatic pressure at ocean depths to store energy by pumping water out of concrete spheres and later allowing it to flow back in through a turbine to generate electricity. The storage spheres are an ideal complement to energy harvesting machines, such as floating wind turbines (FWTs). The system could provide near-base-load-quality utility-scale renewable energy and do double duty as the anchoring point for the generation platforms. Analysis indicates that storage can be economically feasible at depths as shallow as 200 m, with cost per megawatt hour of storage dropping until 1500 m before beginning to trend upward. The sweet spot occurs when the concrete wall thickness to withstand the hydrostatic pressure provides enough <b>ballast</b> <b>mass,</b> and this will depend on the strength of used concrete and reinforcement. In addition, the required concrete would use significant amounts of fly ash from coal-fired power plants, and the spheres can serve as artificial reefs. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method was}} developed to investigate the vertical dynamic behaviour of a railway track subjected to the loading of a moving train. The numerical simulations are {{carried out in the}} time-domain with what is known as a moving mass model. This doctoral thesis emphasises especially the influence on the train-track dynamics of the <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> (giving rise to inertia forces when a train passes), the influence of the non-linear characteristics of the railpad and of the sleeper support, and the part played by scatter in some track structure properties, such as varying railpad stiffness, varying ballast stiffness and varying sleeper spacing. Full-scale measurements in the field sometimes reveal a track resonance at low frequency (somewhere in the region of 20 to 150 Hz). This resonant behaviour cannot be modelled unless the ballast-subgrade inertia is included in the track model, which is done here. Both laboratory and full-scale field measurements have shown that the load deflection behaviour of the railpad and the sleeper support are non-linear. In a realistic demonstration example, the influence of a state dependent railpad on railpad compression and rail wear was investigated. It was shown that, for a weakly state dependent railpad, the difference in results compared with those obtained for a linear model is negligible. Measurements have also shown that track parameter values are not constant along the track. In fact, very dissimilar properties have been observed even between neighbouring sleepers. It is concluded that, if one wants to investigate the mean values and variations of selected track parameters, a method that does not restrict the variation and distribution of the stochastic variables is, while not necessary, certainly preferable...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Chemistry) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2008. This work {{is aimed at}} {{experimental}} verification of the theory about {{the advantages of the}} two-step sample vapour release in a fast-heated ballast furnace. The term “ballast” was introduced earlier in electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry, as an alternative to a platform to describe a compact body of refractive material loosely located on the bottom of a tube furnace atomiser. The thermal behaviour of the ballast furnace {{is similar to that of}} the platform, but without restriction created by the platform area. Compared with the flat or concave platform, a compact <b>ballast</b> of similar <b>mass</b> to the platform should have less impact on gas temperature because of the smaller surface area. The theoretical predictions concerning atomisation efficiency in the fast-heated ballast furnace were examined by the determination of metals in organic and inorganic matrices using a Quantum Z. ETA atomic absorption spectrometer. The instrument provided fast heating of the tube atomizer, 10 K ms- 1. It is shown that in the employed ballast furnace the vapour released into the gas phase occurs after interim condensation on the ballast. For the samples of tetraethyllead, base oil and aqueous solutions of various metals, analytical signals are observed after stabilisation of tube temperature, independent of volatility of the analyte and level of temperature setting. For those samples, a high gas phase temperature provides complete recovery of the analyte without involvement of chemical modifiers and the reduction of spectral interferences from chloride matrices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The dynamic impact forces caused bywheel defects {{such as a}} flat {{have been}} of primary concern for freight trains {{operating}} at high speeds. A pitch plane model of a railway vehicle cou-pled with a comprehensive three-layer track system model is developed to study impact forces generated at the wheel–rail (W–R) interface {{in the presence of}} wheel flats. The W–R interaction is described by the non-linear Hertzian contact spring, while the rail is represented by a contin-uous Euler beam. The Rayleigh–Ritz method is used to solve the coupled partial and ordinary differential equations of the vehicle–track system. An idealized haversine wheel flat with the rounded corner is included in the W–R contact model. The W–R interface forces are evaluated under single or multiple flats on a single as well as multiple wheels. The forces transmitted to the bearings, pads, and the ballast are also evaluated under impacts due to single as well as multiple wheel flats. The results obtained through parametric analyses are discussed in view of a desirable design and operating condition to reduce the magnitude of impact loads. The results suggest that the rail mass, rail pad stiffness and damping, bending stiffness of rail, and <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> affect the W–R impact force considerably, apart from the flat size and vehicle speed. The influence of phase between the multiple flats on the resulting magnitudes of impact forces is also evaluated. The results suggest that the impact loads due to two flats are comparable with those due to a single flat when the spacing between the two flats exceeds 45 ◦. Furthermore, the magnitude of impact force due to a single wheel flat could be greater than that due to in-phase flats on both wheels, which {{can be attributed to the}} pitch dynamics of the bogie...|$|E
40|$|Electrodynamic tethers {{provide a}} very {{promising}} propulsion system for de-orbiting of spent upper stages or LEO satellites. In this application, the Lorentz force {{generated by the}} interaction between the current in the wire and the geomagnetic field produces an electrodynamic drag leading to a fast orbital decay. The attractiveness of tether system lies especially in their capability to operate with uncontrollable satellites and in the modest mass requirement. The need for significant along-track forces leads however to the onset of an undesirable torque which, if not controlled, may drive the system into a dangerous instability. The electrodynamic torque determines in-plane and out-of-plane librations whose amplitude depends upon the current in the wire, mass distribution and system dimensions. Even more important, this torque is modulated along the orbit due to the changing magnetic field and ionospheric plasma density, giving rise to forced oscillations. The counteracting (and stabilizing) gravity grad ient torque is generally to small to ensure stability in typical, strongly non-symmetrical mass distributions, where a massive satellite or upper stage is attached at the lower end and a light electron collecting device (or passive <b>ballast</b> <b>mass)</b> is deployed a few kilometers above. Reducing the electron current or increasing the mass at the upper end are both unattractive solutions. In this paper we show how the electrodynamic torque pumps energy into the system (finally leading to large librations angles) and indicate that many proposed configurations are intrinsically unstable. Our results point out the need for a control strategy. Fortunately, the librations amplitudes can be bruited by acting on the current flowing in the wire Our model of a rigid, conductive tether shows that a control based upon nmely current switch-off, using energy criteria, is indeed effective and simple to implement. The resultant dutycycles are satisfactory and affect only marginally the deorbiting times. © 2001 International A stronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
