50|$|MORM {{syndrome}} is a genetic disorder obtained through inheritance. The main method for testing individuals showing symptoms of MORM {{syndrome is}} sequence {{analysis of the}} entire coding region. When performing a sequence analysis of the entire coding region the gene INNP5E is targeted. Sequence analysis is the <b>biotechnological</b> <b>process</b> in which the structure and sequence of DNA, RNA, or protein sequence is determined {{through the use of}} technology. The sequence can then be analyzed to determine mutations or abnormalities in that particular region. When testing for MORM syndrome, sequence analysis of the region of the genome which contains the gene INPP5E is targeted and examined to look for mutations.|$|E

At an estimated annual global use for cosmetics of about 2000 tons (2016), this would mean millions of sharks {{would be required to}} satisfy global demand. Due to environmental concerns, olive oil and sugarcane as non-animal sources have been developed and commercialized. Other plant sources yielding commercial supply are sunflower [...] and rice, although the latter source only gives mediocre purity (75%). In a <b>biotechnological</b> <b>process,</b> farnesene is produced from fermentation of sugarcane sugars using genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains. Farnesene is then dimerized to isosqualene and then hydrogenated to squalane.|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} development {{can be achieved}} by deepening into more effective and eco-friendly products and technologies. From this point of view, the development of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> to increase the environmental protection could be included in the best available techniques reference documents, the so-called BREFs, that cover, as far as practicable, the industrial activities to achieve an integrated pollution prevention and control. Members of the European Union are required to take these documents into account when determining the best available techniques, generally or in specific cases under the European Commission Directives. In order to include <b>biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> into the BREFs, for example, for obtaining food and pharmaceutical additives, these products have to be cost competitive with those synthesized by chemical ways. <b>Biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> are advantageous compared to the chemical ones since various metabolites can be obtained simultaneously in the same process, and these metabolites are more eco-friendly than their chemical counterparts. Additionally, this feature also matches the increasing demand of consumers for natural products, which has intensified the biotechnological production of natural additives. This special issue reports advances in the use of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> for the treatment of contaminated soil or water as well as the revalorization of agroindustrial residues through the production of valuable metabolites such as biosurfactants or antioxidants, with applications in biomedicine, food industry, pharmaceutical industry, or environmental bioremediation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:Modelling of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> is {{generally}} difficult and time consuming. In order to generate mathematical models of a studied reaction {{system in a}} short time period a new modelling technique for the optimisation of structures, based on the principles of evolution, was developed. This method generates transparent and comprehensi-ble dynamic models in a data driven manner. In addition it is able to automatically refine sub-models or to verify model ideas. The transparent mathematical form of the generated models is a major advantage giving the user the opportunity to interpret the model and to influence the modelling process interactively. The article at hand presents two examples of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> for which this new method was successfully applied. ...|$|R

Concurrently granular and suspended sludge were shaped and attributed to 85 % and 15 % respectively ofthe total sludge. Both sludge types showed equal product distributions and contributed similarly to MCFAproduction.

40|$|The present {{paper was}} aimed at showing that {{advanced}} modeling techniques, based either on artificial neural networks or on hybrid systems, might efficiently predict the behavior of two <b>biotechnological</b> <b>processes</b> designed for the obtainment of second-generation biofuels from waste biomasses.

Research is being done towards a green chemistry process to obtain natural vanillin.

Students evaluated its purity with SDS-PAGE and a purification table and measured its kinetic parameters UV-vis spectrophotometry.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{advanced}} state estimation algorithms for estimation of biomass concentration and specific growth rate {{in a typical}} fed-batch <b>biotechnological</b> <b>process.</b> This <b>biotechnological</b> <b>process</b> was represented by a nonlinear mass-balance based process model. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) was used to estimate the unmeasured state variables from oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and base consumption (BC) measurements. To obtain more general results, a simplified process model was involved in EKF and PF estimation algorithms. This model doesn’t require any special growth kinetic equations and could be applied for state estimation in various bioprocesses. The focus {{of this investigation was}} concentrated on the comparison of the estimation quality of the EKF and PF estimators by applying different measurement noises. The simulation results show that Particle Filter algorithm requires significantly more computation time for state estimation but gives lower estimation errors both for biomass concentration and specific growth rate. Also the tuning procedure for Particle Filter is simpler than for EKF. Consequently, Particle Filter should be preferred in real applications, especially for monitoring of industrial bioprocesses where the simplified implementation procedures are always desirable...|$|E
