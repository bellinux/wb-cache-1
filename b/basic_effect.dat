The same <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E

5000|$|This offset also {{produces}} a discontinuity in {{the leading edge}} (referred to as a notch), which results in other interesting effects. For example, recent calculations using a CFD code based on the Navier-Stokes equations, has shown that this [...] "notch" [...] actually helps to further reduce the strength of shock waves on the blade. Thus, an unexpected by-product of the notch {{over and above the}} <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> of sweep is to help to reduce compressibility effects even further.|$|E
50|$|Soon afterwards, the P.1101 {{was taken}} to the United States for study at Bell Aircraft, but because of missing {{documentation}} and structural damage, Bell decided against completing it. Instead, a close copy was constructed which featured wings that could adjust sweep angle in flight. One problem discovered while testing the Bell X-5 was that as the wing pivoted rearward, the lift vector also moved to the rear, pushing the nose down. A system to compensate for this <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> had to be added for any such design to be viable.|$|E

5000|$|In the Cole-Ohanian model {{there is}} a slower than normal {{recovery}} which they explain by New Deal policies which they evaluated as tending towards monopoly and distribution of wealth. The key economic paper looking at these diagnostic sources {{in relation to the}} Great Depression is Cole and Ohanian’s work. Cole-Ohanian point at two policies of New Deal: the National Industrial Recovery Act and National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the latter strengthening NIRA’s labor provision. According to Cole-Ohanian New Deal policies created cartelization, high wages, and high prices in at least manufacturing and some energy and mining industries. Roosevelts policies against the severity of the Depression like the NIRA, a “code of fair competition” for each industry were aimed to reduce cutthroat competition in a period of severe deflation, which was seen as the cause for lowered demand and employment. The NIRA suspended antitrust laws and permitted collusion in some sectors provided that industry raised wages above clearing level and accepted collective bargaining with labor unions. The effects of cartelization {{can be seen as the}} <b>basic</b> <b>effect</b> of monopoly. The given corporation produces too little, charges too high of a price, and under-employs labor. Likewise, an increase in the power of unions creates a situation similar to monopoly. Wages are too high for the union members, so the corporation employs fewer people and, produces less output. Cole-Ohanian show that 60% of the difference between the trend and realized output is due to cartelization and unions. Chari, Kehoe, McGrattan also present a nice exposition that’s in line with Cole-Ohanian[...]|$|E
