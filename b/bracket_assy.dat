40|$|PT Padma Soode Indonesia. is {{a company}} that engaged in {{precision}} metal stamping, plastic injection and precision assembly activities part became a sub assembly/final assembly. Currently Padma Soode Indonesia PT. is facing a problem of quality. Incompatibility product is high enough where the discrepancies of products causing product failure. The failure of a product ideally detected on line products but the products haven't been fully detected. The failure of the product after product used by a consumer, it will bring up an action claim. The current repairs done only company analyze the cause of the failure and then do the repair for problems that occur. Repairs that are done are still the same so corrective failure can happen. Therefore, required a sustainable improvement plan. This type of claim be stuck on the printer motor occur due to some failure mode process so that the repair process done with the redesign process. Please note the priority factors of improvement against the failure of a process with use analysis FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) to eliminate potential failure. In doing the repair quality, seen with the calculation {{of the value of the}} RPN (Risk Piority Number). The value of the RPN is based on a factor of severity, occurrence, and detection. Note the value of the RPN membrane stator of 210, NG Burry of 45 CM and Welding of 30. The draft repeated the production process may reduce the value of the RPN each failure mode in the form of the addition process appearance check and washing at the end <b>bracket</b> <b>assy</b> process. In addition, the repair is carried out with the addition of the supporting tools such as indicators on each heater, turn the basket so that the components to each other and not turn into 2 micron filter. Improvements to produce the value estimation based on the opinions of the experts. Improvements on an ongoing basis is done by looking at the factors which have not been examined.
