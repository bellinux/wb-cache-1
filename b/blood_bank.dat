40|$|Background: Since 1997, {{legislations}} {{pertaining to}} safe blood transfusion (SBT) have evolved considerably in Pakistan. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the SBT practices in the <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> of Pakistan. Methods: Twenty-three <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> were randomly selected from a list of registered 40 in Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan. To evaluate the SBT practices in the selected <b>blood</b> <b>banks,</b> a questionnaire and a checklist were administered during 2007 - 2008. Results: Of the 23 <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> surveyed, 4 (17 %) were affiliated with government or a semi-government institution, 16 (70 %) <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> had a healthy donor recruitment program and 2 (9 %) of the <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> agreed that they recruited remunerated (paid) blood donors. Donors were screened for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and syphilis by all 23 <b>blood</b> <b>banks,</b> whereas malaria was screened by all <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> but one. Conclusion: SBT practices in Karachi have improved since 1995, an active role by the government in policy-making has proven effective...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Blood</b> <b>banks</b> play a {{key role}} in health care {{delivery}} system. Several changes have taken place in the last two decades in the running of <b>blood</b> <b>banks.</b> Newer developments in science and technology such as the cord <b>blood</b> <b>banking</b> system, <b>blood</b> substitutes and so on have emerged in the light of treating certain diseases and to overcome the shortage of greater demands of blood and its components. In order to ensure safe and quality <b>blood</b> <b>banking,</b> a standard setting has been prescribed. It is necessary that all the medical students and the other medical personnel involved in health care should have a sound knowledge of the working of the <b>blood</b> <b>banks.</b> It was a worthwhile elective program for us and we recommend that it must be made mandatory for the medical students to be posted in the <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> for a reasonable period of time to be well equipped with the <b>blood</b> <b>banking</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Objectives : The aims of {{this study}} were to develop {{reportable}} event codes that are applicable to the national hemovigilance systems for hospital <b>blood</b> <b>banks,</b> and to present expansion strategies for the <b>blood</b> <b>banks.</b> Materials and Methods : The data were obtained from a literature review and expert consultation, followed by adding to and revising the established hemovigilance code system and guidelines to develop reportable event codes for hospital <b>blood</b> <b>banks.</b> The Medical Error Reporting System-Transfusion Medicine developed in the US and other codes of reportable events were added to the Korean version of the Biologic Products Deviation Report (BPDR) developed by the Korean Red Cross Blood Safety Administration, then using these codes, mapping work was conducted.

Results : We developed reportable event codes that were applicable to hospital <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> and could cover blood safety - from blood product safety to blood transfusion safety - and also presented expansion strategies for hospital <b>blood</b> <b>banks.</b> Conclusion : It was necessary to add 10 major categories to the blood transfusion safety stage and 97 reportable event codes to the blood safety stage.

40|$|Legal issues play a {{vital role}} in {{providing}} a framework for the Indian blood transfusion service (BTS), while ethical issues pave the way for quality. Despite licensing of all <b>blood</b> <b>banks,</b> failure to revamp the Drugs and Cosmetic Act (D and C Act) is impeding quality. Newer techniques like chemiluminescence or nucleic acid testing (NAT) find no mention in the D and C Act. Specialised products like pooled platelet concentrates or modified whole blood, therapeutic procedures like erythropheresis, plasma exchange, stem cell collection and processing technologies like leukoreduction and irradiation are not a part of the D and C Act. A highly fragmented BTS comprising of over 2500 <b>blood</b> <b>banks,</b> coupled with a slow and tedious process of dual licensing (state and centre) is a hindrance to smooth functioning of <b>blood</b> <b>banks.</b> Small size of <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> compromises <b>blood</b> safety. New <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> are opened in India by hospitals to meet requirements of insurance providers or by medical colleges as this a Medical Council of India (MCI) requirement. Hospital based <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> opt for replacement donation as they are barred by law from holding camps. Demand for fresh blood, lack of components, and lack of guidelines for safe transfusion leads to continued abuse of blood. Differential pricing of blood components is difficult to explain scientifically or ethically. Accreditation of <b>blood</b> <b>banks</b> along with establishment of regional testing centres could pave the way to blood safety.
