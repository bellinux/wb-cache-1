Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned to be a large elaborate festive event, however as the court was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E

The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage.|$|E
5|$|Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard {{have been}} posthumously {{diagnosed}} with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative {{disease of the}} brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E
5|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, {{hoping to find}} the warriors who were {{responsible}} for raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by the gruesome murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Delawares (mostly women and children) had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops they {{had been forced to}} leave behind. Accusing the Christian Indians of having aided hostile raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians murdered them all by hammer <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the head. The Gnadenhutten massacre, as it came to be called, would have serious repercussions for the next American expedition into the Ohio Country.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim was cut by a chain saw while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} thresher, the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that {{has been known to}} leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the back of the head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
5000|$|Many teens {{engage in}} extracurricular {{activities}} including sports {{which can be}} risky. Some sports at specific risk include basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football. For example, football accounts for 45.8% of total reported head injuries for high schools in Missouri (MSHSAA 10). The Sports Concussion Institute states a concussion “can be caused either by a direct <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the head, or an indirect <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the body, causing neurological impairments that may resolve spontaneously”. The <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the body causes a series of reactions in the brain which cause a variety of symptoms associated with disruption of the brain.|$|R

5|$|Some {{authors have}} stated that heavy losses in {{carriers}} and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully {{have stated that}} the heavy losses in veteran aircrew (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling to the Japanese naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew {{at the start of}} the Pacific war. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the Japanese carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E

In many of these cases, it is not the celiac plexus itself being referred to, but rather the region where it is located. A <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the stomach can upset this region. This can cause the diaphragm to spasm, resulting in difficulty in breathing—a sensation commonly known as [...] "getting the wind knocked out of you". A <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> this region can also affect the celiac plexus itself, possibly interfering with the functioning of the viscera, as well as causing great pain.|$|R
