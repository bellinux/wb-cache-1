40|$|Two-dimensional {{recursive}} digital {{filters are}} widely used in signal processing and image processing, as well as divers communication systems. The main objective of this thesis has been to propose a new technique of designing 2 -D recursive digital filters from an analog <b>Bridged-T</b> <b>network.</b> Starting from transfer function of a <b>Bridged-T</b> <b>network</b> in the analog domain which is VSHP, 2 -D recursive digital filters can be obtained {{through the application of}} the double generalized bilinear transformations with the coefficients in their specified ranges. The impedance values of the transfer function of the <b>Bridged-T</b> <b>network</b> are obtained with compare to the fourth order Butterworth polynomial. For different impedance values of the <b>Bridged-T</b> <b>network</b> we get different types of filter output [...] all pass filter, band pass filter, band stop filter and low pass filter. The manner how each coefficient of generalized bilinear transformation affects each kind of 2 -D recursive digital filter is investigated in details...|$|E

A β-network of a feed-back loop consists of an RLC <b>bridged-T</b> <b>network.</b> The high Q is attained by using of a high-Q inductance coil in the β-network.

To perform a {{reliable}} clamp or to analyze the intracellular potential distribution, any external series resistance in the artificial node {{must be taken into account}} for it induces an instability in the external potential as soon as a current develops. A circuit was designed to compensate for this error, it has been found effective on an analog model and on experimental uni- or multicellular preparations. The attenuation in series resistance frequently causes ringing in the step response. This behavior was studied theoretically and also simulated with analog models where a selective <b>bridged-T</b> <b>network</b> was found to represent the electrical characteristics of the preparation when associated with the chamber and control electronics. A residual series resistance was found and is considered to be a part of the preparation. Characteristics necessary to obtain best results are proposed, for a preparation to be studied in experiments utilizing the double sucrose gap technique with external series resistance compensation...|$|E

50|$|Network Synthesis is {{the process}} of {{deriving}} a circuit to match a chosen transfer function. Not all transfer functions can be realized by physical networks, but for those that can, the lattice network is always a solution. In other words, if a symmetrical two-terminal pair network is realizable at all, it is realizable as a lattice network. This is because the lattice structure is the most general form of a network, with fewer constraints than, say, T, П or <b>bridged-T</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new design procedure for low-sensitivity and low-noise filter biquads which have a symmetrical <b>bridged-T</b> passive-RC <b>network.</b> They are also low-power circuits, in that they use only one operational amplifier (opamp). The new design concept {{is based on the}} recently introduced “impedance tapering ” method which was applied to allpole filters in [1], whereas in this paper it is extended to the design of filters with finite zeros. Thus, it is applied to two commonly used filter sections suitable for the realization of band-rejection and all-pass filters with low and medium pole-Q factors. In the new design procedure, the topology and component count remain the same; we just judiciously select the component values in order to reduce component tolerance sensitivity and improve noise performance. The sensitivity analysis is examined analytically and double-checked using PSpice Monte Carlo runs. In the PSpice noise analysis, a macro-model of the uA 741 opamp is used. It is found that the minimum-sensitivity and minimum-noise filters coincide. I...|$|R
