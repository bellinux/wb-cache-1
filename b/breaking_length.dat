40|$|This study introduced, for {{the first}} time worldwide, {{molasses}} as an additive in papermaking. The introduction of molasses as an additive in papermaking resulted in paper composites with greater <b>breaking</b> <b>length</b> and remarkably higher water retention value (WRV), compared with paper that does not have molasses as an additive. Previous studies have shown that incorporating the cell wall microstructure of cellulose fibers with sucrose greatly enhanced the <b>breaking</b> <b>length</b> and WRV. It is well established in the literature that using gums (including starch) as additives in papermaking enhances paper strength. Molasses, which contains sucrose and gums (including starch) is a byproduct of the sugar industry and is cheaper than sucrose. Mercerization of pulp fibers before loading them with molasses was shown to greatly enhance the positive effects produced by loading with molasses. Application: Paper composites produced using molasses as an additive are useful as specialty absorbent paper...|$|E

Results of chemical pulping process indicated that pulp screen yield in a range of 32. 70 - 47. 71 %, alkali consumption 12. 20 - 15. 50 %, permanganate number 9. 75 - 20. 70, <b>breaking</b> <b>length</b> value 2. 60 - 4. 40 km, bursting factor 27. 51 - 51. 27, tearing factor 74 - 132, and folding endurance 4. 5 - 59. 5 df.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a shift scheduling problem that includes {{different forms of}} flexibility in terms of shift starting times, <b>break</b> <b>lengths</b> and <b>break</b> placement. Two particular forms are studied: fractionable breaks and work stretch duration restrictions. For some instances the use of fractionable breaks results in considerable labor savings. In addition, imposing work stretch duration restrictions is a very convenient approach to place multiple breaks within a shift. In this context, we show the merits of using so-called forward and backward constraints to model work stretch duration restrictions. We also introduce a new formulation of the forward and backward constraints and demonstrate that it considerably reduces {{the density of the}} constraint matrix of both models...|$|R

Pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) and Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) are the primary species that interact with longline gear. Logistic regression was used to assess the environmental and gear characteristics that influence interaction rates. Pilot whale inter-actions were correlated with warm water temperatures, proximity to the shelf <b>break,</b> mainline <b>lengths</b> greater than 20 nautical miles, and damage to swordfish catch. Similarly, Risso’s dolphin interactions were correlated with geographic location, proximity the shelf <b>break,</b> the <b>length</b> of the mainline, and bait type.

40|$|The present work {{shows for}} the first time {{worldwide}} that sucrose can be easily placed by simple techniques within the micropores or nanostructure of the mercerized non-dried cotton linter fibers to create a low-cost cellulose substitute. Such sucrose-containing nanocomposites find suitable use as specialty absorbent paper. Relative to the sucrose-free paper, the sucrose-containing counterparts exhibit greater <b>breaking</b> <b>length</b> and remarkably high water uptake (WRV) up to a sucrose content of 8 – 15 % w/w. Mercerization of cotton linters before incorporating them with sucrose greatly enhanced the retention of sucrose in the prepared paper nanocomposites as compared to the case of unmercerized cotton linters. We assume that regions of the cell wall lamellae, {{on both sides of the}} sucrose spacers, are stressed during drying because the sucrose spacers hinder them to relax. This leads to a strain, which makes some microfibrils partially released and protrude out of the fiber. Thus, a sort of fiber beating takes place.
