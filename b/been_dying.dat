25|$|A Yat accent, is a creole {{accent and}} is {{considered}} an identity marker of white, metropolitan {{people who have been}} raised in the greater New Orleans area. Speakers with a New Orleans accent are typically proud of their accent as it organically stems from the historical mixing of language and culture. This distinctive accent has <b>been</b> <b>dying</b> out generationally in the city due to white flight of the city, but remains very strong in the suburbs. However, the creole Yat dialect does survive in the city in several areas, notably Mid-city, Lakeview, parts of Gentilly and Uptown.|$|E

500|$|F.E.A.R. was {{announced}} at an E3 2004 pre-show, though its existence as an untitled project was revealed {{prior to this}} announcement. The game's first trailer later premiered at E3 2004 and was well received by critics. During the E3 2004 showing, F.E.A.R.s lead designer, Craig Hubbard, stated that the game [...] "... evolved out of a concept we started developing right after [...] that we've <b>been</b> <b>dying</b> to work on." [...] Monolith Productions' director of technology, Kevin Stephens, later elaborated that this concept was [...] "... to make an action movie in a first-person shooter, where you really feel like an action star." [...] To this effect, the team focused on immersing the player, using elements like a silent, nameless protagonist with an unknown background, and allowing the player to see the protagonist's body when looking down or sideways.|$|E
500|$|Davies' {{scriptwriting}} {{was affected}} {{by the development of}} a head cold and overrunning script constraints; he was annoyed that he had written [...] "dialogue [...] <b>been</b> <b>dying</b> to write" [...] with a [...] "faint heart" [...] because he would have to cut it. Because he was behind schedule, he was forced to cancel plans to attend Piper's wedding and almost cancelled plans to celebrate the New Year with his boyfriend. These problems affected his first draft of the Doctor's conversation with his companions and encounter with Davros; he dismissed it as [...] "lame shit" [...] which would waste licence-payers' money, and replaced it with a different version hours later. The conversation features all of the Doctor's companions simultaneously talking to the Doctor; Tate, Tennant, and director Graeme Harper made the creative decision to have the Doctor ignore any mention of the Daleks because they thought the Doctor's joviality in the scene would be otherwise inappropriate. He eventually finished the script at 1am on New Year's Eve. Cook reviewed the last pages of the script and suggested that the episode should air without a trailer; Davies agreed by noting that [...] " [...] never send out preview discs of the last episode" [...] and that any advertisements for [...] "Journey's End" [...] could [...] "just show lots of Daleks and a repeat of [...] "I'm regenerating" [...] The episode was officially submitted on : the preparation date for [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End".|$|E

2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{gave the}} episode a {{moderate}} review, saying the episode [...] "delivered on the Frozen storyline front {{and brought the}} reunion we've <b>been</b> <b>dying</b> to see, but some scenes seemed created to fill time. They stretched to make connections with Blackbeard and spent too much energy trying to make Hans seem dangerous. However, characters such as Regina and Snow White had some nice dialogue and development. It would be a pleasant change to see the story turns back towards them instead of the villain of the moment." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 6.7 rating out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Sascha Segan of PC Magazine said in 2008 that [...] "Usenet has <b>been</b> <b>dying</b> for years". Segan {{said that}} some people pointed to the Eternal September in 1993 as the {{beginning}} of Usenet's decline. Segan believes that when pornographers and software crackers began putting large (non-text) files on Usenet by the late 1990s, Usenet disk space and traffic increased correspondingly. Internet service providers questioned why they needed to host space for pornography and unauthorized software. [...] When the State of New York opened an investigation on child pornographers who used Usenet, many ISPs dropped all Usenet access or access to the alt.* hierarchy.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{social work}} has been {{historically}} defined by these institutionalized and deinstitutionalized periods, informal community design programs have always existed. In fact, informal community-based programs predate human service applications of this approach. In 1990, Bernice Harper illustrated {{this point in the}} book Social Work Practice with Black Families: A Culturally Specific Perspective in regards to African American communities, by writing that: Blacks have always cared for the sick at home, yet it was never labeled 'home care.' Blacks have <b>been</b> <b>dying</b> at home and receiving care in the process, yet it was never called 'hospice care.' Blacks have relieved each other from the caring and curing processes, yet it was never seen as 'respite care.' Blacks have cared for each other in their homes, in their neighborhoods, and throughout their communities, yet it was never referred to as 'volunteerism.' ...|$|E
