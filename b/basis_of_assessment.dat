50|$|The human single-nucleotide {{polymorphism}} (SNP) map {{has revealed}} large regional variations in heterozygosity, {{more so than}} can be explained {{on the basis of}} (Poisson-distributed) random chance. In part, these variations could be explained on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> methods, the availability of genomic sequences, and possibly the standard coalescent population genetic model. Population genetic influences could have a major influence on this variation: some loci presumably would have comparatively recent common ancestors, others might have much older genealogies, and so the regional accumulation of SNPs over time could be quite different. The local density of SNPs along chromosomes appears to cluster in accordance with a variance to mean power law and to obey the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution. In this model the regional variations in the SNP map would be explained by the accumulation of multiple small genomic segments through recombination, where the mean number of SNPs per segment would be gamma distributed in proportion to a gamma distributed time to the most recent common ancestor for each segment.|$|E

The paper draws on archival material in Victoria, and the evidence of interventions in Aboriginal populations focuses on the removal of Aboriginal children from their communities in various parts of the state during this period. 'Race' comes to be constructed in terms that allow legislators and administrators to make discriminations within Aboriginal populations in order to manage them...|$|R

They argue that disproportionality is a reality in England, as in the United States, though it cannot be understood simply in relation to racial minorities. Nor, within a non-disability-based system, does it arise principally from the misidentifi-cation of students as having disabilities. Instead, it reflects broad educational and social inequalities. Disproportionality research, therefore, needs to concern itself with these inequalities...|$|R
