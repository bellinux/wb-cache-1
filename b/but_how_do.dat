I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
500|$|Minear {{initially}} {{had trouble}} conceptualizing his idea, noting that [...] "it {{might be a}} good idea for a short story, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you make the whole thing work visually?" [...] To combat this issue, Minear decided to make the remote viewer blind. He sought to make the blind woman [...] "not Audrey Hepburn", a reference to the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, in which Hepburn played the part of an innocent but terrorized blind woman. He later said, [...] "I wanted to make [...] a bitch, because the fact is that disability doesn't necessarily ennoble a person." [...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{selected}} Michael Kaplan {{to design}} the costumes because {{he had not seen}} any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original color-coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them. Kirk wears only the undershirt because he is a cadet. Kaplan modelled the uniforms on Kelvin on science fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s, to contrast with Enterprise-era uniforms based on the ones created in the 1960s. For Abrams, [...] "The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to take something that's kind of silly and make it feel real. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?" ...|$|E

500|$|His next film, {{entitled}} How Do You Know, {{was released}} December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars Reese Witherspoon {{as a professional}} softball player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in [...] "the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they {{may not even be}} aware." [...] He created Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson's characters for this concept. Filming finished in November 2009, although Brooks later reshot the film's opening and ending. The New York Times described it as [...] "perhaps the most closely guarded of Columbia's movies this year." [...] Brooks was paid $10 million for the project, which cost $100 million. The film was negatively received. Patrick Goldstein wrote in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "the characters were stick figures, the jokes were flat, the situations felt scarily insular." [...] He felt the film showed Brooks had [...] "finally lost his comic mojo" [...] concluding [...] "his films used to have a wonderfully restless, neurotic energy, <b>but</b> <b>How</b> <b>Do</b> You Know feels like it was phoned in from someone resting uncomfortably on his laurels." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge also felt the film showed Brooks had lost his [...] "spark". Richard Corliss of Time was more positive, writing [...] "without being great, it's still the flat-out finest romantic comedy of the year," [...] while [...] "Brooks hasn't lost his gift for dreaming up heroes and heroines who worry amusingly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} anthrax toxin, there are still several missing details in the action of anthrax toxin. These missing details leave questions about the molecular actions inside the cell. What role does EF play in hindering the immune system? Does it work with LF for its effect? How do the enzymes refold after translocation? Is there a chaperonin? Two proteins: KIF1C and the proteasome have shown a contribution to the effect of lethal toxin, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> they contribute? Does LF target certain MAPKKs with a greater specificity? Does LF target other molecules too? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1718, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, a renowned dog lover, also criticized Hales' work. In {{conversation}} with his friend, Joseph Spence, Pope reportedly said of Hale: [...] "He commits {{most of these}} barbarities {{with the thought of}} its being of use to man. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> we know that {{we have a right to}} kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?". Pope, however was also a close friend of Hales [...] and considered him the model of the man who loves his God.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, The Tom Leykis Show {{was briefly}} heard on an {{irregular}} basis in New York City on WNEW. Leykis {{was moved to}} afternoons from nights to replace the recently fired Opie and Anthony of The Opie and Anthony Show. Leykis later reflected on his comparative lack of success in the New York market, explaining that the station never truly got behind him, [...] "We were talking to [...] about the show being on the station on a regular basis. He said, [...] "This show will never work in New York." [...] Now, {{that may be true}} or it may not be true <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you know until the people {{have had a chance to}} listen to it?".|$|E
2500|$|Knowles {{is known}} for insisting on privacy, and the media hailed the film as a rare glimpse into her private life. This {{included}} documenting the events of her marriage to Jay-Z, her miscarriage, birth of daughter Blue Ivy, {{as well as her}} professional split from her father and manager Mathew Knowles. Knowles addressed this in an interview with GQ magazine, saying [...] "I always battle with: How much do I reveal about myself? How do I keep my humility? How do I keep my spirit and the reality? And how do I continue to be generous to — to my fans and to my craft? And how do I stay current? <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> I stay soulful? And it is the battle of my life. When I walk into a stage I'm able to come out of my shell and be as fabulous and over the top and strong and powerful as I want to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luckinbill's musical ability was {{utilized}} in J.T. and Colleen's storyline. He {{stated that the}} writers and producers felt {{like it would be}} a good idea. He added: [...] "They wanted me to sing a song by Alison Krauss called, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these words came out. I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> you feel about this one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E
