For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash “/”) is counted for a slight <b>balance</b> <b>error</b> or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an “X”) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error.The decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official’s rankings. Points are determined by the number of teams competing. The team with the highest final rank obtains the same amount of points as there are teams competing.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{diagnostic}} tools and tests within sports. While the tests and scales may vary greatly from sport to sport, in the end, they effectively gain {{the same information}} regardless. The first initial assessment that should take place with every athlete found to be unconscious after head or neck trauma is the “ABC’s” (airway, breathing, and circulation). There is an array of initial sideline evaluations that can be conducted after a possible concussive incident such as Maddocks questions, Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), <b>Balance</b> <b>Error</b> Scoring System (BESS), or Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2). [...] “The Maddocks questions are a brief set of questions to evaluate orientation as well as short and long-term memory related to the sport and current game. The questions are for sideline use only and {{are included in the}} SCAT2.” [...] The BESS test is a test based on an athlete’s posture. There are 3 positions that the athlete tests in and a composite score of their errors over the 6 rounds of testing determines their scores. [...] The SCAT2 uses both the BESS and SAC test. The SAC and SCAT-2 evaluations also contain symptoms checklists which can determine immediate cognitive and motor deficits, although many symptoms may present hours after the initial injury. 85% of certified athletic trainers use symptom checklists as part of a concussion assessment according to a recent survey.|$|E
40|$|A {{reliable}} {{prediction of}} the total runoff hydrograph is necessary for water resources management. This study investigates two approaches to generate total runoff hydrograph by adding baseflow to direct runoff hydrographs. The first approach uses a method, derived from a digital filter algorithm for hydrograph separation, to generate baseflow hydrographs from direct runoff hydrographs. The method appears to perform well in producing the overall shape {{of the total}} runoff hydrographs and the acceptable mass <b>balance</b> <b>errors</b> for a year of water cycle. For application, the recession baseflow constant needs to be estimated reliably and the initial baseflow could be approximated to the long-term mean dry weather flow. The second approach assumes a constant baseflow rate. Although this approach is still capable of producing the overall hydrograph shape, it yields high mass <b>balance</b> <b>errors</b> in the total runoff hydrographs for both monthly and long-term periods. Further analysis shows that two-third of the mass <b>balance</b> <b>errors</b> are contributed from periods with direct runoff, implying that the constant baseflow assumption could introduce significant errors into the computations of total runoff hydrograp...|$|R

It {{is known as}} a simple and affordable way to get an accurate assessment of balance, although the validity of the BESS protocol has been questioned. The BESS is often used in sports settings to assess the effects of mild to moderate head injury on one’s postural stability. The BESS tests three separate stances (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (firm surface and medium density foam) for a total of six tests. Each test is 20 seconds long, with the entire time of the assessment approximately 5-7 minutes. The first stance is the double leg stance. The participant is instructed to stand on a firm surface with feet side by side with hands on hips and eyes closed. The second stance is the single leg stance. In this stance the participant is instructed to stand on their non-dominant foot on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The third stance is the tandem stance. The participant stands heel to toe on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stances repeat in order stances one, two, and three except the participant performs these stances on a medium density foam surface. The BESS is scored by an examiner who looks for deviations from the proper stances. A deviation is noted when any of the following occurs in the participant during testing: opening the eyes, removing hands from the hips, stumbling forward or falling, lifting the forefoot or heel off the testing surface, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, or remaining out of the proper testing position for more than 5 seconds.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 150 - 152). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses two important issues related to streamline-based flow simulation. The first issue deals with velocity models, specifically, how to determine the velocity models in various geometries in 2 D and 3 D space, and how to draw streamlines and calculate time of flight in various gridblock systems. The present research builds on the previous work of Cordes and Kinzelbach, 1992. Transformations from the real space of {x,y,z} to the unit cube space of {?, ?, ?} have been extensively utilized to draw the streamlines in 2 D and 3 D corner point cell geometry and also to calculate the time of flight. The use of cell-averaged jacobian of the transformation, as is typically done in streamline simulators to determine the time of flight is investigated for its accuracy. The impact of cell skewness in time of flight calculations is also investigated. Our results indicate that the cell-averaged jacobian leads to incorrect time of flight. The second issue that is addressed is related to material <b>balance</b> <b>error</b> during streamline simulation. The material <b>balance</b> <b>error</b> is generated during the discretization of gridblock into streamtubes ([]-discretizations) and also during the saturation assignment to a streamline from the gridblock and vice versa ([]-discretizations). The behavior of the material <b>balance</b> <b>error</b> associated with []-discretizations is studied with respect to parameters like the selection of the gridblock and the number of streamlines in the gridblock. Furthermore, we also examine the behavior of the error associated with []-discretizations with respect {{to the size of the}} discretizations along a streamline. Our results show that the material <b>balance</b> <b>error</b> associated with []-discretizations converges slowly (with a slope of - 1. 0) in a gridblock, if it has a stagnation point. However, if the gridblock does not have any stagnation point in it, then the error converges faster (with a slope of - 2. 0). For the []-discretizations along a streamline, the L? and L[] Norm errors are shown to be inversely proportional to the number of []-discretizations. The L? Norm error is shown to be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of []-discretizations...|$|E
