Ti and Au foils with a {{thickness}} of 10 µm were formed by indenting {{at a place}} neighboring another indented place sequentially {{by means of a}} hemispherical diamond tool with a radius of 5 µm.

We develop an analytical perturbation framework for calculating the <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> of light rays lensed by a Schwarzschild black hole. Using a perturbation parameter given in terms of the gravitational radius of the black hole and the light ray's impact parameter, we determine an invariant series for the strong-deflection <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> that extends beyond the standard logarithmic deflection term used in the literature. In the process, we discover that the expression for the standard logarithmic deflection is not quite correct and provide the appropriate correction. Our perturbation framework is also used to derive as a consistency check, the recently found weak deflection <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> series. We also reformulate the latter series in terms of a more natural invariant pertubation parameter, one that smoothly transitions between the weak and strong deflection series. We then compare our invariant strong deflection bending-angle series with the numerically integrated exact formal <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> expression, and find less than 1 % discrepancy for light rays as far out as twice the critical impact parameter. The paper concludes by showing that the strong and weak deflection <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> series together provide an approximation that is within 1 % of the exact <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> value for light rays traversing anywhere between the photon sphere and infinity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With a {{ray-tracing}} {{procedure and}} variational data assimilation techniques, {{it is now}} possible to make direct use of radio occultation <b>bending</b> <b>angles,</b> rather than their derived temperature and moisture retrievals, in atmospheric data analysis and assimilation. This paper describes results obtained from including more than 800 GPS/MET <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profiles, available over an 11 -day period, 20 – 30 June 1995, into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction spectral statistical interpolation analyses. The methodology for assimilating the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> (including an impact parameter offset correction) is briefly summarized. Verified with 56 collocated radiosonde profiles, the assimilation of only GPS/MET <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> improves the temperature and specific humidity analysis above 850 mbar. Even though the number of GPS/MET soundings is still far less than conventional data and operational satellite soundings, our results from two continuous 11 -day data assimilation cycles demonstrate a closer fit of both GPS/MET and conventional observations to the analyses between 850 and 200 hPa when the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are incorporated.

50|$|Joggling, {{also known}} as joggle bending, is an offset bending {{process in which the}} two {{opposite}} bends are each less than 90° (see following section for how <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> is measured), and are separated by a neutral web so that the offset (in the usual case where the opposite bends are equal in angle) is less than 5 workpiece thicknesses. Often the offset will be one workpiece thickness, in order to allow a lap joint which is smooth on the 'show-face'.|$|E
50|$|In folding, {{clamping}} beams {{hold the}} longer {{side of the}} sheet. The beam rises and folds the sheet around a bend profile.

Large sheets can be handled in this process, making the operation easily automated. There is little risk of surface damage to the sheet.|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{system of}} equations for solving GPS atmospheric sounding’s <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are normally solved using Newton’s method. Because of the nonlinear nature of the equations, Newton’s method applies linearization and iterations. The method assumes the refraction angle to be small enough such that the dependency of the doppler shift on these angles are linear. The <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are then solved iteratively. Since the approach assumes the dependency of doppler shift on <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> to be linear, which in actual sense is not, some small nonlinearity error is incurred. The Newton’s iterative method is often used owing to the bottleneck of solving in exact form the nonlinear {{system of equations}} for <b>bending</b> <b>angles.</b> By converting this system of trigonometric nonlinear equations into algebraic, the present contribution proposes an analytic (algebraic) algorithm for solving the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> and presents the geometry of the solution space.

30|$|We are {{interested}} in differences of the raw <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> between the RISH and the CDAAC products. A comparison of the optimized <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> among the three retrievals shows that rishfsi 2013 has higher vertical resolution around the tropopause (figure is not shown). These variations seem to {{be attributed to the}} background atmospheric model used to optimize the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> or the difference in the vertical resolution due to sewing and smoothing. In the next subsection, we compare these GPS-RO data with simultaneous radiosondes to ascertain which products are closer to the real atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} above can {{be extended}} for lenses which have a distributed mass, rather than a point mass, by using a different expression for the <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> α. The positions θI(θS) of the images can then be calculated. For small deflections this mapping is one-to-one and consists of distortions of the observed positions which are invertible. This is called weak lensing. For large deflections one can have multiple images and a non-invertible mapping: this is called strong lensing. Note {{that in order for}} a distributed mass to result in an Einstein ring, it must be axially symmetric.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} feature of water is its polar nature. The structure has a bent molecular geometry for the two hydrogens from the oxygen vertex. The oxygen atom also has two lone pairs of electrons. One effect usually ascribed to the lone pairs is that the H-O-H gas phase <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> is 104.48°, which is smaller than the typical tetrahedral angle of 109.47°. The lone pairs are closer to the oxygen atom than the electrons sigma bonded to the hydrogens, so they require more space. The increased repulsion of the lone pairs forces the O-H bonds closer to each other.|$|E
50|$|Preferred DNA bend {{direction}} {{is determined by}} the stability of stacking each base on top of the next. If unstable base stacking steps are always found {{on one side of the}} DNA helix then the DNA will preferentially bend away from that direction. As <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> increases then steric hindrances and ability to roll the residues relative to each other also play a role, especially in the minor groove. A and T residues will be preferentially be found in the minor grooves on the inside of bends. This effect is particularly seen in DNA-protein binding where tight DNA bending is induced, such as in nucleosome particles. See base step distortions above.|$|E
30|$|The {{fundamental}} retrieval {{techniques for}} the GPS-RO data are geometric optics (GO) and wave optics (WO), {{assuming that the}} atmosphere has spherical symmetry (Melbourne 2004). The GO method constructs the L 1 and L 2 <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> in the neutral atmosphere by the time derivative of the excess phase (Doppler) and the positions and velocities of the GPS and LEO satellites (Kuo et al. 2004). To reduce {{the influence of the}} ionosphere, optimal filtering is applied on the L 2 <b>bending</b> <b>angle.</b> Then, the ionospheric-free <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> is obtained by combining the L 1 and L 2 <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> (Sokolovskiy et al. 2009; Schreiner et al. 2011).

40|$|Climate {{change has}} become a serious issue for our society. It is of great {{importance}} to accurately monitor climate change and provide reliable information to the society so that proper actions {{can be taken to}} alleviate the significant change of climate. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) based radio occultation (RO) is a new satellite remote sensing technique that can provide high vertical resolution, long-term stable and global coverage atmospheric profiles of the Earth’s atmosphere. However, the quality of the retrieved atmospheric profiles decreases above about 30 km due to a low signal-to-noise ratio of GNSS signals at these high altitudes, since errors in <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profiles are propagated to refractivity profiles through an Abel integral and subsequently propagated to other atmospheric profiles through the hydrostatic integral. It is therefore important to carefully initialise the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> at high altitudes to minimise these error propagation effects and thereby optimise the climate monitoring utility of the retrieved profiles. Statistical optimisation is a commonly used method for this purpose. This method combines the observed <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profile and background <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profile based on their error covariance matrices to determine “optimised” <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profile. The focus of this thesis is to investigate an advanced statistical optimisation algorithm, which dynamically estimates both background and observation error covariance matrices, for the best determination of RO optimised <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profile. In this new algorithm, background <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> profiles and their associated error covariance matrices are estimated using <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> from multiple days of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-term (24 h) forecast and analysis fields as well as the averaged observed <b>bending</b> <b>angle.</b> The background error matrices are constructed with geographically varying background error estimates on a daily-updated basis. The observation error covariance matrices are estimated using multiple days of RO data with geographically varying observation errors for an occultation event. The most distinctive advantage of the new algorithm is that both background and observation error covariance matrices are realistically estimated using large ensemble of climatological and observed data, while existing algorithms use crude formulations to estimate both error matrices. The new algorithm developed is evaluated against the algorithm used by the Wegener Center Occultation Processing System version 5. 4 (OPSv 5. 4) by calculating statistical errors of retrieved atmospheric profiles relative to their reference profiles. Since the background errors at different heights are highly correlated and their covariance matrix is critical for the resulting optimised <b>bending</b> <b>angles,</b> the dynamically estimated background error covariance matrix is first used in statistical optimisation to retrieve atmospheric profiles from simulated MetOp as well as observed CHAMP and COSMIC RO events on single days. The dynamically estimated observation error covariance matrix is then used in the statistical optimisation together with the estimated background error covariance matrix to retrieve atmospheric profiles using the same test data. It can be concluded from the evaluation that if the estimated background error covariance matrix is solely used for the statistical optimisation, it can significantly reduce random errors and generate less or similar residual systematic errors (biases) in the optimised <b>bending</b> <b>angles.</b> The subsequent refractivity profiles and atmospheric (dry temperature) profiles retrieved are benefitted from the improved error characteristics of <b>bending</b> <b>angles.</b> If both observation and background error covariance matrices estimated from the new approach are used, the standard deviations of the optimised <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are only further reduced for simulated MetOp data, while for the observed CHAMP and COSMIC data, large random errors of <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are found at higher altitudes (e. g. &gt; 50 km). This is likely to be that the observation errors are underestimated at high altitudes, where <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are largely affected by ionospheric effects and observation errors, and more weights are given to the noisy observed <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> in the estimation of the optimised <b>bending</b> <b>angles.</b> Errors in CHAMP and COSMIC observed <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are further transferred downwards to their subsequently retrieved refractivity and dry temperature profiles, the quality of which is also degraded. The effects of the estimated background and observation error correlations on the atmospheric retrievals are investigated using simulated MetOp data. It is found that these realistically estimated correlations alone can reduce the random errors of the optimised <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> significantly and improve the quality of the subsequent refractivities and temperatures. The performance of the new approach that uses only the new background matrix in the statistical optimisation on monthly occultation data is evaluated. The results show that the monthly errors are similar to those from single days, but in a smoother manner...|$|R
5000|$|In {{press brake}} forming, {{a work piece}} is {{positioned}} over the die block and the die block presses the sheet to form a shape. Usually bending has to overcome both tensile stresses and compressive stresses. When bending is done, the residual stresses cause the material to [...] towards its original position, so the sheet must be over-bent to achieve the proper <b>bend</b> <b>angle.</b> The amount of spring back {{is dependent on the}} material, and the type of forming. When sheet metal is bent, it stretches in length. The bend deduction is the amount the sheet metal will stretch when bent as measured from the outside edges of the bend.

50|$|In bottoming, {{the sheet}} is forced against the V {{opening in the}} bottom tool. U-shaped {{openings}} cannot be used. Space is left between the sheet and {{the bottom of the}} V opening. The optimum width of the V opening is 6 T (T stands for material thickness) for sheets about 3 mm thick, up to about 12 T for 12 mm thick sheets. The bending radius must be at least 0.8 T to 2 T for sheet steel. Larger bend radius require about the same force as larger radii in air bending, however, smaller radii require greater force—up to five times as much—than air bending. Advantages of bottoming include greater accuracy and less springback. A disadvantage is that a different tool set is needed for each <b>bend</b> <b>angle,</b> sheet thickness, and material. In general, air bending is the preferred technique.|$|E

Hydraulic brakes produce accurate high quality products, are reliable, use little energy and are safer because, unlike flywheel-driven presses, {{the motion of}} the ram can be easily stopped at any time in response to a safety device, e.g. a light curtain or other presence sensing device. Recent improvements are mainly in the control and a device called a backgauge. A back gauge is a device {{that can be used to}} accurately position a piece of metal so that the brake puts the bend in the correct place. Furthermore, the back gauge can be programmed to move between bends to repeatedly make complex parts. Early brakes relied on the tooling to determine the <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> of the bend.

40|$|The {{standard}} approach {{to remove the}} effects of the ionosphere from neutral atmosphere GPS radio occultation measurements is to estimate a corrected <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> from a combination of the L 1 and L 2 <b>bending</b> <b>angles.</b> This approach is known to result in systematic errors and an extension has been proposed to the standard ionospheric correction that is dependent on the squared L 1 /L 2 <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> difference and a scaling term (κ). The variation of κ with height, time, season, location and solar activity (i. e. the f 10. 7 flux) has been investigated by applying a 1 D <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> operator to electron density profiles provided by a monthly median ionospheric climatology model. As expected, the residual <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> is well correlated (negatively) with the vertical TEC. However, κ is more strongly dependent on the solar zenith angle. Furthermore, over the height range of interest (40 – 80  km) κ is approximately linear with height. A simple κ model has also been developed. It is independent of ionospheric measurements, but incorporates geophysical dependencies (i. e. solar zenith angle, solar flux, altitude). The global mean error (i. e. bias) and the standard deviation of the residual errors are reduced to − 2. 2  ×  10 − 10  rad and 2. 0  ×  10 − 9  rad respectively. Although a fixed scalar κ also reduces bias for the global average the selected value of κ (14  rad − 1) is only appropriate for a small band of locations around the solar terminator. In the day time, the scalar κ is consistently too high and this results in an over correction of the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> and a positive <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> bias. Similarly, in the night time, the scalar κ is too low. However, in this case, the <b>bending</b> <b>angles</b> are already small and the impact of the choice of κ is less pronounced...|$|R
