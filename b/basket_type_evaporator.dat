50|$|In this <b>type</b> of <b>evaporator,</b> boiling {{takes place}} inside the tubes, due to heating made (usually by steam) outside the same.

This design is then usually applied to clear, non-salting solutions.Tubes are usually quite long, typically 4 m. Sometimes a small recycle is provided.

50|$|Climbing and falling-film plate {{evaporators}} have {{a relatively}} large surface area. The plates are usually corrugated and are supported by frame. During evaporation, steam flows through the channels formed by the free spaces between the plates. The steam alternately climbs and falls parallel to the concentrated liquid. The steam follows a co-current, counter-current path {{in relation to the}} liquid. The concentrate and the vapor are both fed into the separation stage where the vapor is sent to a condenser. This <b>type</b> of plate <b>evaporator</b> is frequently applied in the dairy and fermentation industries since they have spatial flexibility.

40|$|The sugar {{industries}} {{are one of}} the major food industries in all countries in terms of demand, capacity and consumption. According to the Ethiopian country’s statistical report, the demand of sugar is tremendously increasing. To meet the demand and the requirements of sugar, many sugar {{industries are}} established. The existing sugar industries are operating with high steam consumption and less production capacity. The major cost and energy loss in the sugar industries are the consumption of steam. The main challenging objective in the sugar industry is to reduce the steam consumption.

The presence of parallel, distinctly controlled local circuits within a cortical network may ensure an effective and dynamic regulation of microcircuit function. By applying a combination of optogenetics, electrophysiological recordings, and high resolution microscopic techniques, we uncovered the organizing principles of synaptic communication between principal neurons and basket cells in the basal nucleus of the amygdala. In this cortical structure, known to be critical for emotional memory formation, we revealed the presence of 2 parallel basket cell networks expressing either parvalbumin or cholecystokinin.

Environmentally harmful refrigerants, CFC's and HCFC's, have already been shifted toward environmental friendly refrigerants such as HFC's and hydro carbons. However HFC's have a significant global warming potential. Accordingly, new policies have taken effect which are forcing the refrigerator industry to develop refrigerators that will reduce energy consumption and refrigerant emissions to reduce energy bills and the global warming effects of refrigerators. This study presents the research conducted on the condenser improvement {{of one of the}} commercially available household refrigerators and designing and applying a so-called Alternating evaporator duty cycle (AED) with a two step capacity modulated compressor. In the condenser improvement study, a household refrigerator's condenser configuration was changed from the cross-flow configuration to the counter-flow configuration without changing other components and cabinet structure. Ten experiments for different refrigerant charges were conducted and it was experimentally proved that the refrigerator with counter flow condenser consumes 1 % less energy compared to the one with cross-flow condenser. To study the potential of the AED cycle, a side-by-side household refrigerator equipped with a conventional cycle was converted into the AED cycle. First of all, the performance of the refrigerator with the new cycle was simulated and then cycle components were designed. Two different kinds of evaporators were used for food (R) cabinet such as forced convection fin-and-tube <b>type</b> <b>evaporator</b> (FCE) and natural convection tube-and-plate <b>type</b> <b>evaporator</b> (NCE), to investigate the humidity control improvement.

Therefore, the humidity ratio of R compartment is maintained at 4 - 5 times higher level than that of F compartment for the AED cycle, and also 4 - 5 times higher than that R and F compartments for the base cycle. In addition to the better humidity control, AED cycle provides separate and more efficient cabinet temperature control...|$|R

Falling film <b>types</b> of <b>evaporators</b> are widely used in refrigeration, desalination, petroleum refining, chemical industries, etc. Compared to flooded <b>type</b> <b>evaporators,</b> falling film evaporators need less amount of refrigerant and will give higher heat transfer rates even at lower heat fluxes. Tube geometry and tube size {{have an important role}} on the performance of the falling film evaporators. Geometry of the tube can be varied by heat transfer enhancing techniques and also by changing the shape of the tube. Thermal spray metal coating is a heat transfer enhancement technique which is done by spraying molten metal on any heat transfer surface. Vertical plate with sinusoidal corrugation is a surface enhancement technique which can be cheaper, compact and lighter for falling film evaporation compared to shell and tube configuration. This paper presents a two dimensional CFD study of water falling film evaporation on a thermal spray metal coated vertical corrugated conduits. Two-phase flow simulation is done by using a finite volume method based commercial software, with turbulence modeling which is done by k-Â two equations with shear stress transport (SST). Sinusoidal corrugations with different porosity have been selected for the study. Evaporation and heat transfer during falling film evaporation are included through user defined functions (UDFs).

One of the important factors in achieving the maximum improvement in evaporator performance is the proper choice of the rate of refrigerant spray. A circulation rate that is too high increases the refrigerant charge and also increases the pumping power for the circulation of the refrigerant. On the other hand, if the spray rate is too low, some areas on the tube become dry and the heat-transfer coefficient drops off rapidly.

However, when water is used as refrigerant, the working pressure is very low and vaporization phenomena are really different than vaporization phenomena occurring at higher pressures. Few studies focus on this subject and there is a lack of knowledge about vaporization (boiling or evaporation) phenomena occurring in compact evaporators at low pressure. The design of such evaporators remain manly empirical. There is thus a need of better characterization of the influence of the driving parameters in order to optimize the evaporator design.
