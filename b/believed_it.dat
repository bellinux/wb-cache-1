5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
