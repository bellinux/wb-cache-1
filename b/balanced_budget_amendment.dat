5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} of fiscal deficits in many industrial democracies {{has spawned a}} vast theoretical literature in political econ-omy on why nations run budget deficits, along with a sharp policy debate concern-ing fiscal institutions that might reduce these deficits. The debate on fiscal institu-tions, such as proposed <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendments</b> for the federal government, involves relatively little empirical evidence on the potential effects of such institu-tions. The lack of such evidence {{can be traced to}} several factors. First, some of the proposed institutions under discussion are budgetary innovations that have not been tried on a national or subnational scale before. Second, there is relatively lit-tle intranational variation over time in the nature of budget processes. Therefore, it is difficult to compare fiscal policy before and after significant institutional reforms. Third, while there are differences across countries in fiscal institutions, many ana-lysts are hesitant to draw strong conclu-sions from cross-national comparisons be-cause it is difficult to hold constant other factors that may affect fiscal policy...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{persistent}} political issues facing Congress in recent decades is whether to require that {{the budget of the}} United States be in balance.

25|$|In 1994, Republican Congressional {{candidates}} ran on {{a platform}} of major reforms of government with measures such as a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> and welfare reform.

40|$|What do {{we mean by}} institutions? The {{generality}} of {{the word}} cries out for a defi-nition. But I {{am not going to}} attempt it. A narrow interpretation would consist of only specific legal bodies or procedural mechanisms. Examples include regulatory agencies, such as securities and exchange commissions, standards-setting bodies (e. g., for accounting), and what are sometimes called “commitment devices ” (cur-rency boards (CBs), guarantees of central bank independence, <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendments,</b> the Stability and Growth Pact, etc.). A broad definition would include everything about a society that is more detailed than the basic theoretical model in a graduate economics textbook: from the existence of efficiency wages and a six-month gold futures market, to culture. The notion of institutional qual-ity that has become common in the growth literature lies at an intermediate level of generality, and pertains to property rights and rule of law. I am happy to accept that usage. But, before I turn to it, I want to flag the wide variety of issues that could be termed institutional, and to observe that they may not necessarily all be correlated. For example, democracy is on many people’s list. But the commitment devices I named (currency boards, independent central banks, stability pact), ar...|$|R

25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a <b>Balanced</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> <b>amendment</b> and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E
40|$|In overlapping-generations economies {{with perfect}} {{financial}} markets and lumpsum taxation, {{restrictions on the}} government budget deficits do not limit the set of achievable allocations. For economies in which tax instruments are distortionary and limited in number, deficits are irrelevant only in the unrealistic {{case in which the}} number of tax instruments is large relative to the number of policy goals. In particular, if the government can use only anonymous consumption taxes, then achieving the prescribed deficits without changing the equilibrium allocation will typically be impossible when the number of consumers exceeds the number of commodities. A similar result holds if consumer credit is (exogenously) restricted. Surprisingly, in this case, distortionary taxes may be more likely than lump-sum taxes to lead to the irrelevance of government deficits.
