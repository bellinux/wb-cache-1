5|$|The Tales {{series is}} {{classified}} as a role-playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS for short). Considered {{as one of the}} mainstays and <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> every main entry in the series, it undergoes multiple incremental changes and alterations from one installment to the next. Introduced in Phantasia, it is a real-time fighting system similar to a brawler, as opposed to the majority of RPGs at the time of Phantasias release, which primarily used turn-based battle systems.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{typically}} large, bi-stable spin anisotropy, single-molecule magnets promise {{the realization}} of perhaps the smallest practical unit for magnetic memory, and thus are possible <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> a quantum computer.

25|$|It {{was first}} {{released}} {{under the name}} Seagate Analysis as a free application written in Java released in 1999.

The initial rewrite only supported Microsoft Analysis Services, but support for other vendors soon followed, with Holos cubes in version 8.5, Essbase, IBM DB2 and SAP BW following in later releases. The web client was rewritten using an XSLT abstraction layer for the version 9.0 release, with better standards compliance to support Mozilla based browsers—this work also set the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> support for Safari.|$|E
25|$|Appeals to {{simplicity}} {{were used}} to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, ball lightning, continental drift, and reverse transcriptase. One can argue for atomic <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the atomic theory was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles {{that had not been}} directly detected. Ernst Mach and the logical positivists rejected John Dalton's atomic theory until the reality of atoms was more evident in Brownian motion, as shown by Albert Einstein.|$|E
25|$|Mathematicians often {{strive for}} a {{classification}} (or list) of all mathematical objects {{of a given}} type. It is generally believed that finite groups are too diverse to admit a useful classification. A more modest but still challenging problem is to classify all finite simple groups. These are finite groups which {{may be used as}} <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> constructing arbitrary finite groups {{in the same way that}} prime numbers can be used to construct arbitrary whole numbers by taking products. One of the major achievements of contemporary group theory is the classification of finite simple groups, a mathematical theorem which provides a list of all possible finite simple groups.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to mathematics, both human sensation and intelligence {{were important to}} Metzinger. It was lack of the latter human attribute that the principle theorists of Cubism were to reproach the Impressionists and Fauves, for whom sensation was the sole necessity. Intelligence had to work in harmony with sensation, thus together providing the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> the Cubists construction. Metzinger, with his mathematical education and prowess had realized this relation early on. Indeed, the geometrization of space that would characterize Cubism can already be observed in his works as early as 1905, {{following the lead of}} Seurat and Cézanne. (See Jean Metzinger, 1905–1906, Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape, oil on canvas, 116 x 88.8cm).|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} from genetics that all organisms {{have a common}} ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> proteins. All organisms use the same genetic code (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection {{of many of these}} traits seems arbitrary. Horizontal gene transfer makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor. However, the universal use of the same genetic code, same nucleotides, and same amino acids makes the existence of such an ancestor overwhelmingly likely.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese {{is believed to}} have been started under the auspices of Lin Zexu in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of Tongwen Guan in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law. Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and codified their version of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the Meiji period which involved in large part Japanese translation of European Continental laws.|$|E
