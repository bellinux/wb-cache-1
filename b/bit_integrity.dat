40|$|This article {{describes}} a methodology which supports evaluation of bit preservation strategies for different digital materials. This includes evaluation of alternative bit preservation solutions. The methodology presented uses the preservation planning tool Plato for evaluations, and a BR-ReMS prototype to calculate measures for how well bit preservation requirements are met. Planning storage {{of different types}} of data as part of preservation planning involves classification of the data with regard to requirements on confidentiality, bit safety, availability and costs. Selection of storage parameters is quite complex since e. g. more copies of data means better bit safety, but higher cost and higher risk of compromising confidentiality. Based on a case study of a bit repository offering differentiated bit preservation solutions, the article will present results of using the methodology to make plans and choices of alternatives for different digital material with different requirements for <b>bit</b> <b>integrity</b> and confidentiality. This study shows that the methodology, including the tools used, is suitable for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{features}} proposed for UMTS by the RACE 2084 ATDMA {{project is the}} provision for data services from 9. 6 to 64 kbits/s with low transmission delay (no more than 30 ms) and high <b>integrity</b> (<b>bit</b> error rate lower than 10 /sup - 6 /). The paper shows how this service class can be transported over the ATDMA air interface. After a brief presentation of the latter, the authors develop an appropriate error control coding scheme based on code concatenation. To protect the data to the required quality while matching varying propagation and interference conditions, they define so-called transport modes. Under link adaptation control, the air interface configuration changes from one mode to another so that the target link quality can be maintained. Design parameters are dimensioned and decoding performances are assessed by means of computer and hardware simulations. The authors use a dedicated two-stage simulation approach based on hidden Markov modelling of the transmission channel. Results confirm {{the validity of the}} proposed scheme.

40|$|Abstract—The {{stringent}} on- and off-chip communications {{demands of}} future-generation chip multiprocessors require innovative and potentially disruptive technology solutions, such as chip-scale photonic transmission systems. A space-switched, wavelength-parallel photonic network-on-chip {{has been shown}} to equip users with high-bandwidth, low-latency links in an energyefficient manner. Here, experimental measurements on fabricated silicon photonic devices verify a large set of the components needed to construct these networks. The proposed system architecture is reviewed to motivate the demanding performance requirements of the components. Then, systems-level investigations are delineated for multiwavelength electrooptic modulators and photonic switching elements arranged in 1 × 2, 2 × 2, and 4 × 4 formations. Compact (∼ 10 µm), high-speed (4 Gb/s) modulators, having a large degree of channel scalability (four channels demonstrated), are demonstrated with excellent data <b>integrity</b> (<b>bit</b> error rates (BERs) 10 dB). Data integrity is also verified for the switches (BERs < 10 − 12) with power penalty measurements amid dynamic operation. These network component demonstrations verify the feasibility of the proposed system architecture, while previous works have verified its efficacy.

40|$|The ATLAS {{experiment}} {{is located at}} the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. It is designed to measure decay properties of high energetic particles produced in the protons collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). LHC proton collision at a frequency of 40 MHz, requires a trigger system to efficiently select events down to a manageable event storage rate of about 400 Hz. Event triggering is therefore one of the extraordinary challenges faced by the ATLAS detector. The Level- 1 Trigger is the first rate-reducing step in the ATLAS Trigger, with an output rate of 75 kHz and decision latency of less than 2. 5 μs. It is primarily composed of the Calorimeter Trigger, Muon Trigger, the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). Due to the increase in the LHC instantaneous luminosity up to 3 × 10 ^ 34 cm^− 2 s^− 1 in 2015, a new element will be included in the Level- 1 Trigger scheme: the Topological Processor (L 1 Topo). The L 1 Topo receive data in a dedicated format from the calorimeters and muon detectors to be processed into specific topological algorithms. Those algorithms sits in high-end FPGAs to perform geometrical cuts, correlations and calculate complex observables as the invariant mass. The output of such topological cuts is sent to the CTP. Since the Level- 1 trigger it’s a fixed latency pipelined system the main requirement for the L 1 Topo is a large input bandwidth (≈ 1 Tb/s), optical connectivity and low processing latency on the Real Time data path. This presentation focuses on the design of the L 1 Topo final production module and the tests results on L 1 Topo prototypes. Such tests are aimed at characterizing high-speed links (signal <b>integrity,</b> <b>bit</b> error rate, margin analysis and latency) plus algorithms logic resource utilization...|$|R
