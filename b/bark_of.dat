5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{species from}} several orders of slime molds (myxomycetes) have been {{isolated}} from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> Banksia menziesii. Over half (13) were from the order Stemonitales, and Echinosteliales and Liceales were also common. The abundance {{of the first two}} orders {{may be due to the}} acidity of the bark. Another order, the Physarales, was unusually rare—other studies have demonstrated that the order is typically abundant on the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> various species of tree around the world.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{preliminary}} investigations {{was carried}} out to study the antibacterial activity of the water soluble extracts of five and ten years old <b>barks</b> <b>of</b> Eugenia Jambolana Lam. (fam. Myrtaceae) on dysentery and diarrhoea forming micro organisms. It was observed that the <b>barks</b> <b>of</b> young plants have a better inhibitory effect on micro – organisms like Salmonella viballerup, Shigella dysenteriae 10, Shigella boydii 5, Sgigella dysenteriae 2. The antidysentery and antidiarrhoeal effect <b>of</b> the <b>barks</b> <b>of</b> the large fruit producing tree, Eugenia jambolana Lam., family Mytraceae, is mentioned in Ayurvedic literatures 1 - 5. No {{work has been done}} on the antibacterial effect of the different varieties <b>of</b> <b>barks</b> <b>of</b> Eugenia jambolana Lam.

5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Many Polistes species {{aggregate}} over winter. Polistes exclamans clump {{in rather}} large aggregations while hibernating. “These aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula {{that can be}} as varied as crevices and cracks of rocks or trunks, beneath the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> trees, between walls of buildings, or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation.” Although Polistes exclamans {{have been found in}} organ-pipe muddauber nests, a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection, it is not thought to actually house hibernating Polistes exclamans over the winter.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> other {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E
5|$|The papery <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams {{were covered by}} it and canoes were constructed from it.

Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E

Nutmeg is a seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) and cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium aromaticum).|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|RTI {{scientists}} Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, {{from the}} <b>bark</b> <b>of</b> the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree. These two drugs account for $3 {{billion a year}} in sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.|$|E
