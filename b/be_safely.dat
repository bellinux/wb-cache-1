5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> examined with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
5|$|No {{contraindications}} {{are known}} for this examination. Ultrasonography does not involve the use of ionizing radiation, and the procedure is harmless and can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> used on anybody of any age. A World Health Organization report published in 1998 supports this.|$|E
5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E

5|$|Xenon gas can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> kept {{in normal}} sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, {{although it does}} dissolve in blood and belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E

5|$|The Historia syntomos of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople {{mentions}} {{a single}} brother of Heraclius the Elder, named Gregoras, {{who was the}} father of Nicetas. Theophanes the Confessor mentions Epiphania as the mother of Emperor Heraclius, thus wife of Heraclius the Elder. Heraclius the Elder is mentioned as the father of Emperor Heraclius in several sources, including Theophylact, John of Nikiû, Nikephoros I, Theophanes, Agapius the historian, the Suda, Georgios Kedrenos, Joannes Zonaras, Michael the Syrian, the Chronicle of 1234 and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos. In contrast, there is no source mentioning him in the same sentence as the siblings of Emperor Heraclius. That he was their father can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> assumed though.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a medical}} nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in {{many aspects of the}} diet for it to <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> implemented.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{completion}} of the fort did have some drawbacks, however. The fort lacked some of the refinements that would be present at later forts like Fort Foote. In 1864, civil engineer William C. Gunnell requested {{the removal of the}} wooden buildings that served as company quarters at Fort Greble so that the ammunition for the fort could <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> placed in magazines to be built in place of the shanties. There simply had not been time in 1861 to construct proper earthen magazines. This sort of constant renovation and improvement would continue throughout the war as forts were adapted to new purposes and new garrisons.|$|E

5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, {{but they tend to}} be duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, both new {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> inferred from close relatives.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury's built {{environment}} has developed around {{the areas of}} East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's flood plain, and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall. The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped {{to speed up the}} passage of floodwater. Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> released back into the river.|$|E
5|$|Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) {{are used}} on the {{presumption}} that they reduce PE, although their effectiveness and safety profile are not well established. In general, they are only recommended in some high risk scenarios. The ACCP recommended them for those with a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment but not in addition to anticoagulation, unless an individual with an IVC filter but without a risk for bleeding develops acute proximal DVT. In this case, both anticoagulation and an IVC filter are suggested. NICE recommends caval filters in settings where someone with an acute proximal DVT or PE cannot receive anticoagulation, and that the filter is removed when anticoagulation can <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> started. While IVC filters themselves {{are associated with a}} long-term risk of DVT, they are not reason enough to maintain extended anticoagulation.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{operations}} {{took over}} 24hours; the pace was {{hampered by the}} decision to remove many of the logs by hand for fear that using heavy equipment to remove them would cause further collapses, resulting in further injuries to those still trapped. Students, including the entire Texas A football team and {{many members of the}} university's Corps of Cadets, rushed to the site to assist rescue workers with the manual removal of the logs. The Texas A civil engineering department was also called on to examine the site and help the workers determine the order in which the logs could <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> removed, and, {{at the request of the}} Texas Forest Service, Steely Lumber Company in Huntsville, Texas, sent log-moving equipment and operators. John Comstock was the last living person to be removed from the stack. He spent months in the hospital following amputation of his left leg and partial paralysis of his right side. Comstock returned to A in 2001 to finish his degree.|$|E
5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated discussion to discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to <b>be</b> <b>safely</b> beamed back to the Enterprise.
