60|$|Dogs and jackals[15] {{take much}} {{pleasure}} in rolling and rubbing their necks and backs on carrion. The odour seems delightful to them, though dogs at least {{do not eat}} carrion. Mr. Bartlett has observed wolves for me, and has given them carrion, but has never seen them roll on it. I have heard it remarked, and I {{believe it to be}} true, that the larger dogs, which are probably descended from wolves, do not so often roll in carrion as do smaller dogs, which are probably descended from jackals. When a piece of <b>brown</b> <b>biscuit</b> is offered to a terrier of mine and she is not hungry (and I have heard of similar instances), she first tosses it about and worries it, {{as if it were a}} rat or other prey; she then repeatedly rolls on it precisely as if it were a piece of carrion, and at last eats it. It would appear that an imaginary relish has to be given to the distasteful morsel; and to effect this the dog acts in his habitual manner, as if the biscuit was a live animal or smelt like carrion, though he knows better than we do that this is not the case. I have seen this same terrier act in the same manner after killing a little bird or mouse.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Filipinos snack is ring {{shaped and}} come in several varieties coated in either milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate. Milk or dark chocolate versions feature a light colored biscuit. White chocolate versions feature a dark <b>brown</b> <b>biscuit.</b> These can be purchased in large rolls. The dark and white chocolate versions are also available in the Filipinos GoPack or Mini Filipinos, a smaller loose packet of four biscuits.|$|E
5000|$|The latest {{flavours}} {{are special}} editions, 2 two-tone flavors {{in a larger}} box than chocolate or strawberry Pocky provides ( [...] Special Editions: 2.47 oz. g, Normal Pocky: 1.41 oz. g). The 2 newest flavors are cookies and cream and banana chocolate. Both have <b>brown</b> <b>biscuit</b> sticks (in the chocolate banana Pocky case, the biscuit is the chocolate and banana cream.) The cookies and cream consists of blended chocolate biscuit cookies with a slight chocolaty flavor of the biscuit.|$|E

50|$|Upon their arrival, both {{material}} {{and social conditions}} were difficult for the sisters. The sisters, who were active in education, faced much opposition from the Protestant teachers. In addition, they faced stark poverty. Upon the sisters' arrival at the mission house where the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart were living and where the sisters were to live, they found a kitchen equipped only with two small saucepans, a few plates, and a single spoon, to serve 12 missionaries. There were no cups or glasses, so the missionaries drank out of jam tins. They lived off of coconuts, taros, fish, black coffee, <b>brown</b> sugar, <b>biscuits,</b> boiled rice, tinned beans, and salted meat. Condensed milk and bread were treats saved for Sundays and feast days. The extreme heat, in addition to malnourishment and disease, caused a number of deaths during the early years; however, it took four months or longer for the news of this to reach Europe.|$|R
40|$|Scope Sorghum grain {{components}} {{may play}} a role in mechanisms that protect against development of obesity-related chronic diseases. We conducted a randomized, cross-over trial (40 healthy subjects) using whole grain sorghum flaked biscuits to investigate mechanisms related to satiety. Methods and results Subjects were tested on four occasions after a 12 -h fast. At baseline, they consumed 50 grams of one of four treatment meals: white, red, or <b>brown</b> sorghum <b>biscuits</b> or a wheat control. Subjective satiety was measured at 8 time-points over four hours. In a subset of 20 subjects, plasma glucose, insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), peptide-tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), and ghrelin were measured. Subjects reported significantly lower subjective satiety ratings after consuming wheat compared to sorghum biscuits. Incremental area under the plasma concentration-time curve of postprandial GLP- 1, GIP and in males, PYY, were significantly higher (p = 0. 018, p = 0. 031, p = 0. 036, respectively) for sorghum breakfasts compared to wheat. Energy intake at a subsequent meal did not differ between treatments. Conclusions Sorghum whole grain is a promising novel ingredient in foods targeting satiety as an adjunct for weight control. Evidence is now required from randomized controlled trials that aim to examine specific effects on health outcomes from a sorghum-enriched intervention diet...|$|R
5000|$|In 1839, digestives {{were first}} {{developed}} in the United Kingdom by two Scottish doctors to aid digestion. Digestives featured in advertisements for the Berkshire-based biscuit company Huntley & Palmers in 1876, with a recipe being given in Cassell's [...] "New Universal Cookery Book" [...] of 1894. In 1851 an issue of The Lancet London's advertising section offered <b>brown</b> meal digestive <b>biscuits.</b> At the time, it was asserted grain millers knew only of bran and endosperm. After 10% of the whole grain's coarser outer-bran coat was removed, and because the innermost 70% of pure endosperm was reserved for other uses, brown meal, representing only 20% of the whole grain, remained, consisting of about 15% fine bran and 85% white flour. By 1912 it was more widely known that brown meal included the germ, which lent a characteristic sweetness.|$|R
50|$|Ireland fields a 24-hour ration pack {{somewhat}} {{similar to that}} used by the British. It is packed in a large ziplock plastic bag and contains two pre-cooked main meals and items to be eaten throughout the day. Included are: instant soup, ramen noodles, an oatmeal block, a high-energy protein bar, both <b>brown</b> and fruit <b>biscuits,</b> sweets, and a selection of beverage mixes. Breakfast (bacon and beans or sausage and beans) is packaged in a retort pouch while dinner (Beef Casserole, Irish Stew, Chicken Curry, or a vegetarian main course) comes in either a flat tin or microwaveable plastic tray. Desserts consist of a retort-pouched dessert (chocolate pudding, syrup pudding, fruit dumplings), a Kendal mint cake, and a roll of fruit lozenges. Beverages include tea bags, instant coffee, hot cocoa, and a powdered isotonic drink mix. Also included are a pack of tissues, a small scouring pad, matches, water purification tablets, salt and pepper packets, sugar, dry cream powder, moist towelettes, and individual packets of foot powder.|$|R
5000|$|The UK {{provides}} the Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose. Packed inside a small cardboard box, each ration has enough retort-pouched and canned foods to feed one soldier for 24 hours. [...] Seven menus (plus vegetarian and religious variants) provide two precooked meals (Breakfast and Main Meal) plus a midday snack. Example (Menu A) Breakfast: Hamburger and beans, Instant Porridge. All ration packs also contain Oatmeal Block, Fruit <b>Biscuits,</b> <b>Biscuits</b> <b>Brown</b> (a more compact alternative to bread), a sachet of instant soup and jam or yeast extract (a Marmite like spread) for a lunchtime snack, and chocolate (in {{the form of}} a specially made Yorkie bar which is flatter than civilian bars, or, more recently, a simple unbranded bar of milk chocolate), though this has been phased out with the introduction of the more recent multi-climate ration packs, and boiled sweets (hard candy) for snacking whilst on patrol, or in free time. Main Meal: Instant soup, Chicken with Mushroom and Pasta, Treacle Pudding. Each pack also contains instant coffee, tea bags, creamer, sugar, hot cocoa mix, beef/vegetable stock powder, lemon/orange powder or Lucozade electrolyte powder, matches, packet of tissues, chewing-gum, a small bottle of Tabasco sauce, and water purifying tablets. They sometimes also contain chicken and herb pâté. Also available are Kosher/Halal, Vegetarian, and Hindu/Sikh specific menus. Regardless of their contents, these ration packs are referred to as Rat-Packs or Compo (short for Composite Rations) by the soldiers who eat them. In addition to containing the 24-hour ration, the outside of the cardboard box has a range card printed on its side for use by the soldier to record key features and their range from their position. Other variations designed for specific environments exist.|$|R
