40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} braking system characteristics, brake system performance and <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>component</b> design parameters that influence brake pedal force / displacement characteristics as ‘felt’ by the driver in a passenger car. It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>component</b> design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in brake system simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>component</b> was modelled individually before combining them into the whole brake system {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full brake system simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict brake system performance and to design a system with better brake pedal ‘feel’. Each of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>component</b> design parameters was validated to ensure that the braking system performance was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of brake booster air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for brake system engineers to design a braking system with improved pedal ‘feel’. The simulation model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of brake system performance at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|E

40|$|Stereoscopic {{tracking}} {{technology has}} been developed for simultaneous tracking of numerous markers including particles and dots in three-dimensional space. It can offer an unprecedented capability for measuring three-dimensional (3 -D) velocities in a fluid flow and displacement/deformation of a solid object. For fluid motion measurement, the flow can be seeded with small particles. For surface motion, the surface can be marked with dots while for deformation of a transparent object, it can be embedded with particles. In our effort for implementing the stereoscopic tracking technology, we employ neural networks for particle image overlap decomposition and simultaneous stereoscopic tracking of several thousands markers with high-resolution high-speed solid state cameras. One of the successful application examples is the measurement of parachute aerodynamics, for which the technique is termed stereoscopic tracking velocimetry (STV). By seeding the measurement volume with neutrally-buoyant helium soap bubbles as velocity markers, the parachute flow field can be visualized. The testing with a medium-scale model is conducted with high-speed high-resolution cameras. It is not feasible to provide a 3 -D flow field of known velocity for assessing accuracy in 3 -D flow measurement. For measurement accuracy and performance estimation, known velocity fields and corresponding stereoscopic particle images are thus obtained through 3 -D numerical simulation of the aerodynamics flow around a parachute. Another successful application example is the deformation measurement of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>component</b> of a heavy-duty truck, that is, slack adjuster. For the reliability evaluation of the measurement technology, numerical calculation for the stress analysis has been also performed for cross examination. I...|$|E

40|$|Pneumatic <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> use {{pressurized}} air {{to apply the}} brakes and are used in trucks, amongst other vehicles. Due to the compressibility of the air, {{there is a time}} delay from the push-down of the brake pedal to the attainment of the desired brake effect. The time for the pressure in the brake cylinder to reach 75 % of its final pressure is subject to legal requirements, and this master thesis studies the possibilities to predict that time by simulation. The program GT-SUITE is chosen for the simulation, since it is shown to be suitable in a survey of potential software and an evaluation. Also, MATLAB is used to simulate an approximate system description. To support the modeling of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>components,</b> measurements are made on a simple brake rig, gradually extended with common brake components which then can be modeled.

40|$|Brakes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} safety and performance components in automobiles. Appropriately, ever since the advent of the automobile, the development of brakes has been focused on increasing braking power and reliability. However, the refinement of vehicle acoustics and comfort through improvement in other aspects of vehicle design has dramatically increased the relative contribution of brake noise to these aesthetic and environmental concerns. In order to understand the brake squeal noise problem substantial research has been conducted to predict and to reduce its occurrence. Many different factors on both the micro- and macroscopic levels appear to affect squeal. Out of these, important factors are the existence of scatter in material and geometrical properties of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>components</b> in reality. Therefore, CAD-based robustness analysis has been carried out while considering the material and geometrical scatter for thorough understanding of brake squeal. The Robustness evaluation is carried out by stochastic modelling of material scatter by random variables and geometrical tolerances by random fields. In regard to the modelling of random fields this paper concentrates on random field generation of one of the <b>components</b> of <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> to see its effects on the brake squeal noise. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the main issues when applying this proposed work flow for brake squeal analysis will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|When {{a vehicle}} is parked on a slope with hot brakes, {{what appears to}} be a {{sufficient}} parking brake action can sometimes become insufficient. When the brakes cool down, the braking force reduces due to relaxation of the entire parking <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> and the vehicle may start to move, leading to obvious catastrophic consequences. This phenomenon is known as vehicle rollaway. This thesis describes the problem in detail and postulates a mechanism that accounts for the occurrence of the rollaway event on vehicles using integrated rear callipers. Different testing methods are presented that are used to investigate the propensity of a vehicle's parking <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> to rollaway. These include on-vehicle evaluations and laboratory based measurements. A description is given of a novel dynamometer facility that was developed for this research that is capable of testing vehicle parking <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> for rollaway. Two mathematical modelling techniques are presented that demonstrate how the parking <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> parameters influence the likelihood of rollaway occurring. A finite element model was used to simulate the change in contact pressure at the frictional interface during a rollaway event. A numerical model was also used to predict the change in torque developed by a parking <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> cooling from an initial elevated temperature. The change in clamp load at the frictional interface was modelled using an essentially I-D quasi-static system that showed how the stiffness and the thermal properties of the system qualitatively affect the phenomenon. The research found that rollaway does not always start with a uniform motion, but with a stick/slip motion. The likelihood of rollaway occurring was found to be directly linked to the temperature of the brake when the vehicle is parked. Rollaway can be reduced by lowering the initial temperature of the brake prior to parking. Rollaway can also be reduced by increasing the input load to the system when applying the parking brake. The research identifies the key design parameters of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>components</b> whose values require close control within the real system if rollaway is to be avoided.

First of all, we evaluate the failure probability value according to the classical estimation method and then obtain the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters of two-parameter exponential distribution by performing and using the modified likelihood function. On the other hand, based on Bayesian theory, this article also selects the beta and gamma distributions as the prior distribution, combines with the modified maximum likelihood function, and innovatively applies a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to parameters assessment based on Bayes estimation method for two-parameter exponential distribution, so that two reliability mathematical models of the electromagnetic valve are obtained. Finally, through type-I life test, the failure rates according to maximum likelihood estimation and Bayes estimation method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm are, respectively, 2. 650 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 and 3. 037 [*]×[*] 10 − 5.

Manufacturer of vehicle provides information about initial and minimal size of braking components. It is a rare situation if the brake pads or discs are found at minimal thickness during inspection at scheduled maintenance. In the real aftersales workshop conditions mechanic have to evaluate condition of the brake pads and discs and determinate whenever to propose replacement of either component. Dynamics of wear of brake components on vehicle differ from front or rear axle and inner or outer pad. Correct prediction of service life can reduce maintenance costs and probability of unexpected vehicle breakdown. Service life of the brake components depend on many conditions, such as vehicle model, type of road, style of driving etc. The road conditions in Latvia differ from other European countries with high ratio of unpaved roads. Some of the vehicles sold in Latvia has maximum maintenance periodicity up to 40 000 km but brake pads are wearing out at 30 000 km. Therefore correct model of prediction of brake component wear for local conditions can only be based on data collected from local data sources.

40|$|The {{automotive}} <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> plays {{a significant}} role not only in the deceleration and stopping process, but also in many stability control strategies. To overcome the limitations of conventional <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> and to improve vehicle control strategies such as traction control, and differential braking, a new generation of <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> called the brake-by-wire system has been introduced to the vehicle industry. This generation of <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> combines electrical, mechanical and, in some cases, hydraulic components. Although different types of brake-by-wire mechanisms have been developed in the past two decades, there still exist demands for further improvement and developing new brake mechanisms in the automotive industry due to the ever increasing demand for better safety and performance. This research proposes a novel brake-by-wire system based on cam actuation. This system is a combination of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic components. The unique feature of the cam actuation <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> proposed in this research is that the characteristics of the motor torque amplification can be optimized by careful design of the cam shape. The compactness and self-contained characteristic of the design allow the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> to be installed on each wheel enabling fully independent control of each wheel for better stability control. Moreover, the cam actuated brake has a fail-safe advantage by keeping the direct connection between the driver and the brake calipers in case of any system failure. In this work, different subsystems of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> and their <b>components</b> are explained, the dynamic model of the system is found and the design parameters are optimized. Specifically, the optimal design problem has been formulated by taking the geometry of the cam as the optimization variable and the open-loop response time of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> as the objective function to be minimized. The solution to this problem is then obtained by the multi-layer design optimization process using the genetic algorithm (GA). Various control algorithms are applied to the developed cam actuated <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> to investigate their performance in terms of tracking a desired braking pressure...|$|R

It is such an important parameter in terms of the driver interface that the movement and deformation of the component parts of the system, which affects the force/travel relationship, must always be estimated or predicted at the design stage, or measured from previous similar installations. This last way is chosen by Applus+ IDIADA to perform these measurements. The project is carried out in Applus+ IDIADA facilities as an ideada internal project.
