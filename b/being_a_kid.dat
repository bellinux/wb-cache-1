25|$|Ignacy Tłoczyński {{was born}} 14 July 1911, in Poznań, then {{part of the}} German Empire, and was {{considered}} a skilful young player practising at the local courts of the town. Despite <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> he was the sparring partner of players of the Academic Sports Association. He was born to a poor family {{and was forced to}} play tennis for money. According to the amateur rules that were in effect in pre-World War II tennis organisations, only professionals could financially benefit from playing. However the Polish Lawn Tennis Association suspended his penalty. He then moved to Warsaw and found a job at an insurance company.|$|E
500|$|A San Francisco Chronicle {{review of}} a 2012 concert judged her singing [...] "an {{impressive}} thing to witness, and Evancho's technical precision and enormous range only serve {{to make it seem}} less fluky", but felt that [...] "every selection sounded alike". A reviewer for The Denver Post wrote that Evancho [...] "displayed her famous combo of poise and articulation", but he noted [...] "the burden of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> soprano, a true phenomenon. People pay a lot to see you and orchestras line up to get you on their stage. But still folks wonder if you really comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be home ... eating ice cream. ... And yet they rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish." [...] A Naples Daily News review stated: [...] "Her poise. Her control. Her range. ... Her voice and her performance exhausted all of the superlatives in the dictionary." [...] In 2013, an Atlanta reviewer commented: [...] "Her pure and well-formed vowel sounds touched the hearts of everyone at the concert." [...] A review in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called Evancho [...] "awesomely talented" [...] and [...] "technically flawless". The Buffalo News reviewer wrote: [...] "there is a poignancy to the sound of this mature voice coming out of this child. Her high notes are a joy." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E
2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Lincoln Heights {{neighborhood}} of Los Angeles, Riggs was one of six children of Agnes (Jones) and Gideon Wright Riggs, a minister. He was an excellent table tennis player as a boy and when he began playing tennis at age eleven, he was quickly befriended and then coached by Esther Bartosh, who was the third-ranking woman player in Los Angeles. [...] Depending entirely on speed and ball control, he soon began to win boys (through 15 years old) and then juniors (through 18 years old) tournaments. [...] Although it is sometimes said that Riggs {{was one of the great}} tennis players nurtured at the Los Angeles Tennis Club by Perry T. Jones and the Southern California Tennis Association, Riggs writes in his autobiography that for many years Jones considered Riggs to be too small and not powerful enough to be a top-flight player. (Jack Kramer, however, said in his own autobiography that Jones turned against Riggs [...] "for <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> hustler".) [...] After initially helping Riggs, Jones then refused to sponsor him at the important Eastern tournaments. [...] With the help of Bartosh and others, Riggs played in various National Tournaments and by the time he was 16 was the fifth-ranked junior player in the United States. [...] The next year, he won his first National Championship, winning the National Juniors by beating Joe Hunt in the finals. [...] That same year, 1935, he met Hunt in 17 final-round matches and won all 17 of them.|$|E
