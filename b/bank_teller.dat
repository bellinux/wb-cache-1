5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a <b>bank</b> <b>teller</b> would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the working lives of eight female <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> in Fredericton, New Brunswick. It considers three questions: (1) how do tellers define, and relate to, their jobs which {{are subject to}} considerable change and are of doubtful security? (2) how do the <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> cope with the daily demands of the job? (3) how do the <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> justify their involvement in their work roles, and to what degree do these justifications result in feelings of satisfaction with their jobs? The thesis considers how the <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> handle their occupational roles within a job that is undergoing significant change and possible elimination. A Goffmanesque approach focuses upon the role-playing activities of <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> in their interactions with clients. Added to the analysis are the effects of technological innovations on the interviewees' work demands. Among the main findings this study found that several tellers drew a comparison between telling {{in the past and}} present. Two distinct views of bank telling also emerged from the sample; bank telling as a profession and bank telling as an insecure, part-time job. Finally, many of the <b>tellers</b> described how <b>bank</b> telling is perceived to be more prestigious than it actually is. The significance of this latter finding arises from the fact that, for those who work as tellers, it is an insecure job characterized by low pay, high targets and on-going training. These findings extend the application of Goffman's approach by pointing out how tellers interpret their performance and thereby deal with role demands that offer {{little in the way of}} job satisfaction nor job security...|$|R
25|$|Authentication is {{the act of}} verifying a {{claim of}} identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the <b>bank</b> <b>teller</b> he is John Doe—a claim of identity. The <b>bank</b> <b>teller</b> asks to see a photoID, so he hands the teller his driver's license. The <b>bank</b> <b>teller</b> checks the license {{to make sure it}} has John Doe printed on it and compares the {{photograph}} on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.|$|E

40|$|This {{study will}} focus on the {{critical}} problems encountered by banks due to voluntary turnover of tellers. Voluntary turnover of <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> is a past and present problem for bank management. Job satisfaction and its relationship to voluntary turnover has been extensively studied since the mid- 19502 ̆ 7 s, and continues to be an important topic. This dissertation is based partly on the Job Enrichment (or Two-Factor) Theory (Herzberg, 1959), and also on many other seminal studies conducted since then. This study analyzes how pay satisfaction, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment influence the intention to quit among <b>bank</b> <b>tellers.</b> The research question was: Does low pay satisfaction and low organizational commitment lead to high intention to quit among <b>bank</b> <b>tellers?</b> This study 2 ̆ 7 s results indicate that there was strong support for the relationship of these variables with intention to quit. The study was based on a representative sample and the results of the correlations rejected all four proposed null hypotheses. This study finds support for the hypotheses: pay satisfaction is negatively related to intention to quit; organizational commitment is negatively related to intention to quit; job satisfaction is negatively related to intention to quit; and job satisfaction is positively related to organizational commitment.

40|$|Communication {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} perspectives in service encounters. Communication is a connection between service employees and customers that could help them to interact, to understand and to establish relationships. In service organizational context, service representatives play a critical role in customer service communication. They are considered as the link connecting an organization to its customers. Therefore, perception of the important role of communication is required for their work. This thesis aims to examine how service employees consider the role of communication and how they manage communication behaviors in customer encounters and in building relationships with customers. Qualitative interview method has been used to investigate service employees. The data collection for the study has been performed through the semi-structures interviews with the <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> at the different banks in Vietnam, to examine their consideration and management of communication behaviors in service encounters and in building relationship with customers. The findings of this study show that in the context of service, the <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> are aware of that communication is important in service encounter and in building relationship with customers. According to them, communication impacts directly on customers' satisfaction and decides the success of encounters. In addition, they consider that good perception about the role of communication in service encounters and in establishing relationships with customers helped the <b>bank</b> <b>tellers</b> to cope with problems in emotional displays and to avoid discriminatory service...|$|R
