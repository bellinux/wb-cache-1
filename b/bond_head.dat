25|$|When the Lower Canada Rebellion {{broke out}} on October 9, 1837, <b>Bond</b> <b>Head</b> sent all the British troops {{stationed}} in Toronto to help suppress it. At {{the beginning of}} November, a meeting of 15 reformers at John Doel's house rejected Mackenzie's call for an immediate attack on City Hall. They instead decided to send Mackenzie north to investigate public sentiment. At a secret meeting in East Gwillimbury, Samuel Lount, Silas Fletcher, Peter Matthews of Pickering, Nelson Gorham of Newmarket, Jesse Lloyd of King township and James Bolton of Albion township heard Lloyd report on the revolt in Lower Canada. All were delegates to the Constitutional Convention. They decided to set the date for a supportive Upper Canadian revolt on December 7.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1830s, Lieutenant Governor Francis <b>Bond</b> <b>Head</b> {{devised a}} plan to {{relocate}} the Ojibwa of the Credit River, along with other Indian bands of southern Upper Canada, to Manitoulin Island. [...] <b>Bond</b> <b>Head</b> believed that the Indians needed to be removed completely from {{the influence of the}} white settlers of Upper Canada. [...] Jones, allied with Sir Augustus Frederick D’Este and Dr Thomas Hodgkin of the Aborigines' Protection Society in Britain, opposed the move. [...] They knew the poor soil of Manitoulin Island would force the Indian Bands to abandon farming and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. [...] After the surrender of the Saugeen tract, protected by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Jones became convinced the only way to end the perpetual threat of relocation of the Mississaugas was to obtain title deeds to their lands. [...] Jones travelled to England in 1837 to petition the Colonial Office directly on the issue. [...] He was accompanied by his wife and their niece Catherine Sunegoo. [...] The Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg postponed meeting with Jones until the spring of 1838, as he was occupied with the Rebellions of 1837. [...] In the meantime, Glenelg refused to approve Bond Head's proposal. [...] Jones spent the intervening time touring England, preaching, giving speeches and fundraising for the Canadian Methodists. [...] Although <b>Bond</b> <b>Head</b> had sent a letter to Glenelg to discredit Jones, the Minister met with Jones in the spring of 1838. [...] The meeting went very well for Jones, as Glenelg promised to help secure title deeds for the Mississaugas. Glenelg also arranged an audience with Queen Victoria for Jones. [...] Jones met with her in September of that year, and presented a petition to Queen Victoria from the chiefs of the Mississauga Ojibwa community asking for title deeds to their lands, to ensure the Credit Mississaugas would never lose the title to their lands. [...] The petition was written in the Latin script, signed by the chiefs in pictographs and accompanied by wampum supplementing the information of the petition. [...] Jones, dressed in his Ojibwa regalia, presented the petition and interpreted it for Victoria, to ensure accurate and favourable reception. [...] Victoria approved her minister's recommendation that the Mississaugas be given title deeds. [...] He returned to Upper Canada shortly thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the revolt}} began, Mackenzie hesitated in attacking the city until December 7, when his {{military}} leader, Anthony Van Egmond, arrived. Van Egmond, a veteran {{on both sides}} of the Napoleonic Wars, advised immediate retreat, but Mackenzie remained hesitant. Mackenzie waited for <b>Bond</b> <b>Head's</b> force of about 1000 men and one cannon, led by Colonel James FitzGibbon, which outnumbered Mackenzie's approximately 400 rebels. When the battle started, Mackenzie split his troops into two groups and put one group on each side of Yonge Street, with the western flank taking the brunt of <b>Bond</b> <b>Head’s</b> assault. There are varying accounts on the length of the battle. Some say it was very short while others say the fighting lasted an hour. However, all accounts agree that the rebels were outmatched, both in weaponry and skill. [...] This can be attributed mostly to the unfortunate perception among the rebels that, when their counterparts in the front ranks fell down to reload, they perceived them to have been hit by enemy fire. In less than half an hour the confrontation was over, and the rebel forces dispersed.|$|R
40|$|To {{fulfill the}} demands of ever {{increasingly}} smaller sizes, lighter weight, and lower price points for optoelectronic products, the size and thickness of each component must as a result be reduced. Since a thinner liquid crystal display (LCD) panel can effectively reduce the thickness of an optoelectronic product, the thickness of a LCD panel is usually thinned out through polishing. However, polishing is likely to produce an uneven surface on the LCD panel {{which can lead to}} incomplete fracturing of the anisotropic conductive film (ACF), disabling electrical conductivity. This research focuses on the elimination of the influences of uneven LCD panels in the chip on glass (COG) process. In addition to the standard process parameters a thin film of Teflon was inserted between the <b>bonding</b> <b>head</b> and the driving IC to minimize the influences of an uneven LCD panel. Experiments show that a 0. 1 mm thick Teflon film in association with a 290 A degrees C <b>bonding</b> <b>head</b> temperature, a 7 s bonding duration, and a 17 kg bonding pressure, can effectively overcome the influence of an uneven LCD panel with 20 mu m surface roughness. The yield rate in the production line is thus improved from 95. 5 to 99. 5 %...|$|R

[...] Durham was assigned to report on the grievances among the British North American colonists and find a way to appease them. [...] His report eventually led to greater autonomy in the Canadian colonies, and the union of Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada in 1840.

2500|$|News of the {{intended}} rebellion had reached London {{and the surrounding}} townships by December 7. It was initially thought that the Toronto rebellion was successful, contributing to Charles Duncombe wanting to rise up as well. [...] Upon hearing more details about the rebellion in Toronto, Duncombe convened a series of public meetings to spread news of the supposed atrocities committed by <b>Bond</b> <b>Head</b> against all suspected reformers to help increase anti-government support. It is estimated that there were between 400-500 rebels who assembled under Duncombe [...] Colonel Allan MacNab, who had just finished leading Upper Canadian militiamen during the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, was sent to engage Duncombe's uprising. He left Hamilton, Ontario on December 12 and arrived in Brantford on December 13. Although many rebels, including Duncombe, had fled prior to the upcoming battle due to hearing about the failure of Mackenzie in Toronto and general disorganization, there were still some present in Scotland, Ontario and MacNab commenced his attack on Scotland on December 14, causing the remaining rebels to flee {{after only a few}} shots were fired. [...] The victorious Tory supporters burned homes and farms of known rebels and suspected supporters.

Thomas Naingishkung and Big Shilling and their followers accompanied Musquakie to Rama. The settlement they built there is now the main reserve of the Chippewas of Rama First Nation. The situation at Rama ensured that Musquakie's last years were difficult ones. From the outset the Rama settlers were under considerable pressure from their creditors; in 1839, Musquakie, Naingishkung and Big Shilling wrote to the government that they were relying on that year's hunt to enable them [...] "to pay our debts to those we have been so long owing", presumably white traders for the most part. Although the Chippewas of Rama still reserved the right to hunt across the extensive territory their chiefs had sold in 1815 and 1818, by 1838 European settlement was putting pressure on the game population, and the Ojibwe were also [...] "obliged frequently to submit to irritating and extremely unjust Treatment on the Part of the neighbouring White Settlers". The settlement built for them at Rama by <b>Bond</b> <b>Head's</b> agents proved to be [...] "badly constructed": by 1858, the buildings were reportedly [...] "all going to decay". Musquakie complained to the Methodist leaders that their missionaries living and working at Rama were indifferent to educating his people and encouraging disobedience to the chiefs. Despite a promising start, the Ojibwe's commitment to farming fizzled out as government supervision waned in the 1840s and 1850s, and lack of production increased their debt troubles. Already by the time of his death, Musquakie had had a glimpse of the grave future challenges his people would face.|$|R
