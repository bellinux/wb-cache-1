Mexican-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> typically have very strong familial ties, while Korean-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> typically have very strong community ties. Perhaps more importantly, Mexican-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> have less access to pools of community capital than Korean-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Therefore, it is expected that Mexican-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> are more likely to intermingle financial resources than Korean-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Even when controlling for the time in United States and English language spoken in the household, this study suggests Mexican-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> are more likely to intermingle financial resources than Korean-American small <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Within these two ethnic groups, similar factors contribute to intermingling.

40|$|Abstract: This paper expands {{empirical}} research on family satisfaction by introducing the family APGAR scale, developed and validated {{in the field}} of nursing, to measure the satisfaction of business-owning families and applying the Stafford et al. (1999) model of sustainable family businesses to the assessment of family satisfaction. More specifically, this study compares the differences in the effects of business- and family-related variables on family satisfaction for the families of lifestyle <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> and earner <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> The sample was drawn from the 1997 National Family Business Survey. The family satisfaction was greater for the families of lifestyle <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> but the family variables made a greater contribution to the explanation of variance in the satisfaction of families of earner <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> The regression equation explained a higher percentage of the variance for the families of earner <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Nine family variables were significant in the satisfaction equation for earner <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> in contrast to seven significant family variables in the equation for lifestyle <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Structured families had a significant positive effect on the satisfaction of lifestyle <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> The family manager’s education, putting the family first rather than the business, and the family management score had significant effects on the satisfaction o...|$|R
5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small <b>business</b> <b>owner</b> in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E

However, Travolta was aggressively sought after by producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron for this role because he had starred as Danny Zuko in Grease, the second most successful movie musical to date, beaten only by Mamma Mia!.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to being willing to reveal donation information, <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> who have party membership also receive more governmental incentives. However, religious business owners’ donations are only slightly associated with the government, and they also care much less about {{whether there is a}} reward. Descriptive analysis reveals that <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> who are party members are rewarded at a higher proportion (46  %) than nonparty members (32  %), while the proportion of <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> who have religious beliefs and are rewarded by the government (36  %) is almost equal to <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> without religious beliefs (37  %). This roughly indicates that <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> who have party memberships are more likely to receive governmental rewards because of donations, but donations from religious believers are not necessarily associated with government incentives. After controlling for the location of corporate headquarters in Wenzhou, <b>business</b> type, <b>business</b> <b>owner’s</b> trust in the government, and <b>business</b> <b>owner’s</b> trust in charities, logistic regression analysis further verified the previous conclusions (see Table  2). First, the regression coefficient of whether <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> have party membership on dependent variables is 0. 553 and is significant at the 0.05 level, indicating that <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> who are party members are more likely to receive governmental incentives. Second, adding whether <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> have religious beliefs into the model did not show significance in a statistical test, indicating that religious beliefs are not associated with governmental incentives. In other words, in corporate donations, political beliefs and religious beliefs are subject to different government incentives. Thus, whether donations receive government incentives also depends on business owners’ choice of beliefs. Party members {{are more likely to have}} affinity with rewards but not religious believers.|$|R

However, the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and overturned the Oregon court. Then the Oregon court ruled in February 2006 that Oregon’s land use law, Measure 37, was constitutional. Macpherson v.

The purpose of this qualitative multiple case {{study was to explore}} strategies that <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> in Fayetteville, North Carolina used to recruit military veterans as a means to acquire skilled employees to maximize productivity, profitability, and sustainability. The conceptual framework of this study included human capital theory and recruitment theory. The purposive sample consisted of 6 participants who were small <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> Data from interviews and supporting documents were processed and analyzed using data source triangulation to identify 3 emergent themes. Findings indicated that, for these 6 Fayetteville small <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> job description and transition workshops, resume review and communication, and accommodations and benefits were key attributes related to the successful recruitment of military veterans as skilled employees. Specifically, streamlined hiring processes, relationship building, and access to resources were predictive of a successful hire. Knowledge barriers regarding hiring processes prevented efficient communication between small <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> and military veterans, but <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> cultivated strategies to help with hiring military veterans. The implications for positive social change include the potential for <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> to capitalize on the skills that military veterans bring to the civilian workforce, which in turn may improve the economy...|$|R

(2) People with different beliefs present obvious differences in directions, types, and results of donations: private <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> with party membership emphasize semiofficial charitable organizations in their choice of channels when donating, are willing to disclose their donation information to the public, and often receive incentives from the government. In contrast, most <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> who have religious beliefs choose religious organizations as their donation channel, care little about making their donations public, and are seldom rewarded. (3) Party organizations as an institutional environment external to individual <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> are able to affect donations through influencing the ideal interests of <b>business</b> <b>owners,</b> but this effect is limited.|$|R
40|$|While the {{entrepreneurship}} {{and small}} business research literature has tended to portray women as lesser than men in identifying the differences between them, little research has looked at how gender is construed in business ownership.

The research employs George Kelly's personal construct theory and repertory grids to examine the constructs associated with male and female <b>business</b> <b>owners.</b> It is found that there are many constructs used to describe <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> and, counter to predictions from some of the literature review, few differences between the way in which male and female <b>business</b> <b>owners</b> are construed.
