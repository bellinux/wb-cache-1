50|$|This case {{involved}} three parties: Harris, <b>Balk,</b> and Epstein. Harris owed <b>Balk</b> money and <b>Balk</b> owed Epstein money. Thus, {{there was no}} debt relationship between Harris and Epstein. Harris and <b>Balk</b> lived in North Carolina while Epstein lived in Maryland. Harris traveled to Maryland. While he was there, Epstein attached the debt Harris owed <b>Balk</b> in order for Epstein to obtain jurisdiction over <b>Balk.</b> Through this, Epstein hoped to obtain the debt that <b>Balk</b> owed him by accessing the debt Harris owed <b>Balk.</b> Consequently, Epstein obtained a judgment against <b>Balk</b> which directed Harris to pay Epstein instead of <b>Balk.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two Mariners players {{currently}} hold Major League Baseball records. Ichiro {{holds the}} record for most single-season hits and singles, obtaining both in 2004. Mike Cameron is tied with 14 others for the most home runs in a game, with four.

5|$|Maddux {{made the}} most putouts in a season (39) three times in his career (1990, 1991, and 1993). The American League leader is Frank Lary, who made 32 putouts for the Detroit Tigers in 1961. Kaat is the leader in assists; he made 72 with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. The National League leader, Maddux, trails him by one (71 assists in 1996). Many {{pitchers}} have posted errorless seasons and 1.000 fielding percentages in their winning seasons; Mussina is the leader with four perfect seasons in the field. Guidry (19821984) and Mussina (19961998) both accomplished the feat in three consecutive seasons. The most double plays turned by a winning pitcher is nine, accomplished by Maddux in 2006. Four pitchers have also thrown no wild pitches in a winning season: Maddux (1997, 2006), Kaat (1975), Shantz (1961, 1962), and Rogers (2005). In contrast, the most wild pitches in a winning season is 18, by the knuckleballing Niekro. The fewest <b>balks</b> in a winning season is zero, achieved many times, but Maddux accomplished the feat the most time in his wins (12 balk-free seasons in 18 years). The most <b>balks</b> in a winning season is five, by Mike Norris in 1981 and Orel Hershiser in 1988. Langston picked off the most runners from the pitcher's mound in a winning season, with 10 in 1993; four pitchers are tied for the National League lead with 5 pickoffs. Rogers posted both the highest (100% in 2002) and lowest (0% in 2005) caught stealing percentage in a winning season. Shantz' 1961 season tied Rogers' 0% mark for lowest percentage caught, and three pitchers are tied for the National League lead (67% caught).|$|E
5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) is {{recruiting}} {{for the new}} all-girl show choir {{directed by}} Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), and asks Santana (Naya Rivera)—a member of the school's existing glee club, New Directions—to join. Santana <b>balks</b> at leaving Brittany behind, and when she and Brittany {{go out on a}} dinner date, Santana tries to recruit her, but Brittany is unwilling to leave her New Directions friends. She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling Brittany that Santana has wished for her to join Shelby's glee club. Brittany believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings.

2500|$|In baseball, {{a pitcher}} can commit {{a number of}} illegal motions or actions that {{constitute}} a <b>balk.</b> Most of these violations involve a pitcher pretending to pitch when {{he has no intention}} of doing so. In games played under the Official Baseball Rules, a <b>balk</b> results in a dead ball or delayed dead ball. In certain other circumstances, a <b>balk</b> may be wholly or partially disregarded. [...] Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools (Fed or Federation) Baseball Rules, a <b>balk</b> results in an immediate dead ball. [...] In the event a <b>balk</b> is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat, and with the previous count. [...] The <b>balk</b> rule in Major League Baseball was introduced in 1898.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of Old Romance geographical names in early South Slavic {{confirms that the}} majority of late Proto-Slavic sound changes were still operative in the period of the earliest Old Romance-Slavic language contacts in the Balkan Peninsula and eastern Alps from {{the second half of the}} 6 th century and the beginning of the 7 th century onwards. Phonetic substitutions of the type Rom. *kE, *gE → Sl. *c, *ʒ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Kersu → Sl. *Cersъ, <b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Gīla → Sl. *Ʒiĺa) and Rom. *auC → Sl. *ovC (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Laurentiu > *Laurenču → Sl. *Lovręčь) point to the fact that the first palatalization of velars as well as the monophthongization of the inherited diphthongs were no longer among the ongoing processes. All other late Proto-Slavic sound changes were either still operative or only took place after the borrowing. This is confirmed by the relative chronology of the following set of Romance-Slavic correspondences: simplification of consonant clusters: Rom. *ps → Sl. *s (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Apsaru → Sl. *Osorъ), development of prothetic consonants: Rom. *ū- → Sl. *uū- > *vy- (Alp. Rom. *Ūdẹnu → Sl. *(V) ydьnъ), simplification of j-clusters: Rom. *Ci → Sl. *Cʹ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Arsia → Sl. *Orša), delabialization of *o after *r: Rom. *ro → Sl. *ry > *ri (Rom. *Roma → Sl. *Rymъ > *Rimъ), second regressive palatalization of velars (see above Sl. *Cersъ, *Ʒiĺa), rise of nasal vowels: Rom. *ENC, *ONC → Sl. *ęC, *ǫC (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Parentiu > *Parenču → Sl. *Poręčь, <b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Karantānu → Sl. *Korǫtanъ), progressive palatalization of velars: Rom. *Ek, *Eg → Sl. *c, *ʒ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Longātẹku → Sl. *Lǫgatьcь), delabialization of *ū 1 > *y: Rom. *ū/*o → Sl. *y (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Allūviu → Sl. *Olybъ), labialization of *a > *o: Rom. *a → Sl. *o (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Kapra → Sl. *Koprъ), vowel reduction of *i, *u > *ь, *ъ: Rom. *ẹ, *ọ → Sl. *ь, *ъ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Kọrẹku → Sl. *Kъrьkъ, <b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Tọrre → Sl. *Tъrъ) ...|$|R
40|$|Temperament in cattle {{is often}} {{defined as the}} {{reactivity}} to human handling or novel environments. Temperament differences have been shown among breed-type categories, within breed types, among crossbreds, and between sexes. Temperament tests are typically completed at weaning time on beef cattle, and rarely on fed Holstein steers for beef production. <b>Balking</b> behavior, or cease in forward motion, in the cattle working facility can pose welfare issues as the electric prod use to coerce movement is implemented. Three observational field projects were designed to evaluate <b>balking</b> behavior incidence in unknown breed-types at the processing plant, Holstein steers in the feedlot and processing plant, and Angus and Hereford-Angus crossbred steers over their lifetime. Objectives of the processing plant study were to determine if cattle of certain coat colors or characteristic markings, or sex, {{had an effect on}} <b>balking</b> behavior, and if <b>balking</b> behavior had carcass implications. In 6, 510 observations at a slaughter plant, Holstein steers <b>balked</b> more (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) at entry to the restrainer than all other colors, which <b>balked</b> similarly. Heifers <b>balked</b> more (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than steers, while mixed pens of heifers and steers <b>balk</b> intermediately. Neither the presence of horns nor Bos indicus influence affected <b>balking</b> behavior. The feedlot source affected (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) <b>balking</b> score, pen weight, and dressing percentage. In the fed Holstein steer project, responses to handling in the feedlot and at the plant showed no association of <b>balking</b> at the plant to individual hot carcass weight; therefore, no negative carcass economic effects. Project three allowed assessment of behavior over time in Angus and Hereford-Angus crossbred steers, and also to determine if genetic polymorphisms affected behavior or carcass weight. In Angus and Hereford-Angus crossbred steers, the Hereford-Angus crossbred steers <b>balked</b> more (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than Angus steers, yet Angus steers reacted more (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) to restraint in the chute than Hereford-Angus steers.

25|$|If no runners are on {{base and}} the pitcher commits an {{otherwise}} balkable action, there generally is no penalty. However, delivering a quick return or pitching while off the rubber (which constitute <b>balks</b> when runners are on base) results in a ball being called with the bases empty. If the pitcher should commit an act confusing to the batter with nobody on, or if he stops his delivery or otherwise violates because the batter steps out or otherwise acts confusingly, time is called and the play restarted without penalty (whether or not runners are on base). If a pitcher repeatedly commits illegal actions without runners on base, he {{may be subject to}} ejection for persistently violating the rules.|$|E
40|$|<b>Balking</b> is {{the act of}} not {{joining a}} queue because the {{prospective}} arriving customer judges the queue to be too long.

First we extend Larson's Queue Inference Engine to the case of an arbitrary given <b>balking</b> function and a general (partially unknown) customer arrival process.

This is a generalization of the M/M/ 2 queue with heteroge-neous servers (without <b>balking),</b> and the M/M/ 2 /N queue with <b>balking</b> and heterogeneous servers in the literature. We also develop the con-fidence interval formula for the parameter ρ, the probability of empty system P 0, and the expected number of customers in the system E[N], of an M/M/R/N queue with <b>balking</b> and heterogeneous servers. The effects of varying b, N, and R on the confidence intervals of P 0 and E[N] are also investigated...|$|R
