5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and {{his friend}} Captain Haddock plan an {{expedition}} to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler, the Sirius, {{to search for the}} treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. Having previously read three parchments authored by Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, the duo had discovered the coordinates to what they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel, the Unicorn, near an unknown island. An eccentric, hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers to aid them with the use of his shark-shaped one-man submarine, but they decline his assistance. Setting sail, they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that Calculus has stowed away on board, bringing his submarine with him.|$|E

25|$|In Islam, {{there are}} four sources from which Muslim {{scholars}} extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwa. The first is the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the Sunnah, which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific question from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs {{what is known as}} ijtihad. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning {{to come up with the}} best answer according to the best of their ability.|$|E
25|$|The Messi–Ronaldo rivalry is an {{association}} football rivalry between fans of Argentine forward Lionel Messi and Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo and supposedly between the athletes themselves. Having won a combined nine Ballon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or awards (5 for Messi and 4 for Ronaldo), both are {{widely regarded as}} the two best players of their generation and among the best of all time in the sport. Both players have regularly broken the 50 goal barrier in a single season, and have scored over 600+ goals each in their careers for club and country. They are also the only two players to score seven UEFA Champions League hat-tricks. Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to establish who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best player in modern football. It has been compared to past global sports rivalries such as the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Björn Borg–John McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Ayrton Senna–Alain Prost rivalry in Formula One motor racing.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} home from his boarding school for the summer, Percy and his mother, Sally Jackson, travel to their cabin in Montauk. However, the trip is cut short and {{after a series of}} harrowing incidents such as being attacked by a minotaur, Percy finds himself at Camp Half-Blood, a training camp for demigods like him. He discovers that he is a demigod son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes and father of all horses, that his best friend Grover is actually a satyr and that the Greek gods are accusing him of having stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt (the most powerful weapon in the world). To clear his name and save the world from another war between the Olympian gods, he sets out to retrieve the lightning bolt from Hades, who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> real thief. Thus Percy Jackson and his companions, Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase, a daughter of Athena, start on a journey to the underworld, facing numerous mythological monsters on the way. After confronting an innocent Hades, they learn that their friend Luke Castellan, son of Hermes, is the real thief who stole the bolt to allow Kronos, the defeated king of the Titans, a chance to rise again.|$|E

[...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
