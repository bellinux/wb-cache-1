5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) can all <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> bombarding actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon).
