500|$|This {{story is}} partly in {{conflict}} with what is told by the Origo, which has Peredeo acting as an instigator and not as the murderer. In a similar vein to the Origo is the account of Peredeo contained in the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani, where it is added that Peredeo was Alboin's [...] "chamber-guard", hinting that in the original {{version of the story}} Peredeo's role may just have been to let in the real assassin, who is Helmichis in Agnellus' account, as it had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> of Marius. However, the primary intent of the Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani may have been to obtain a more straightforward and coherent narrative by reducing the number of actors in the story, beginning with Peredeo. The disappearance of Peredeo, however, means that the role of Helmichis changes: while Paul presents him as [...] "the efficient conspirator and killer", with Agnellus he is a victim of a ruthless and domineering queen.|$|E

500|$|One notable {{citation}} as {{an influence}} was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "I {{was trying to}} write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [...] When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> band—or {{at least in a}} Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 In Utero at the request of Cobain.|$|E

500|$|Outside the Pacific Northwest, {{a number}} of artists and music scenes {{influenced}} grunge. Noise rock bands such as Scratch Acid and the Butthole Surfers influenced Nirvana. Alternative rock bands from the Northeastern United States, including Sonic Youth, Pixies, Pavement, and Dinosaur Jr., are important influences on the genre. Through their patronage of Seattle bands, Sonic Youth [...] "inadvertently nurtured" [...] the grunge scene, and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians.

You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation where you can't help it.

[...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be?

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly."
