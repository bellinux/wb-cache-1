40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) {{is formed}} {{by a group}} of mobile nodes {{connected}} by wireless links. The nodes can talk to each other by direct peer-to-peer wireless communication when they are close to each other. When the sender and receiver are far away, their packets can be forwarded by the intermediate nodes along a multi-hop path. As an emerging networking technique, a MANET is envisioned to become a stand-alone network for a group of mobile users, or as a stub-network to connect to the Internet. In this thesis, we focus on the <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> problem in this network. Depending on whether the routers agree to forward packets for each other, different <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes are proposed for both cooperative and non-cooperative MANET environments. In cooperative <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> we first study the two prominent <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes in the Internet, i. e., TCP and equation-based <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> We provide an augmentation to TCP in order to improve its performance, and discover several limitations of applying equation-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> to the MANET domain. Prompted by the deficiencies of these implicit <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes, we design a router-assisted explicit rate-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme (called EXACT) for MANETs. Our result shows that EXACT achieves much better performance than the implicit <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes. Therefore, we advocate using router-assisted explicit <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> as exemplified by EXACT, in the MANET domain. Traditionally, <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> has been studied in a cooperative network environment. Such cooperative behavior is not a realistic assumption in a public MANET formed by a random group of strangers. Users in this network are likely to behave selfishly, by refusing to forward other users' packets. Under this non-cooperative environment, <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering are two problems closely related to each other. A <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> solution would be meaningless if the intermediate routers do not agree to carry the traffic for others. However, existing work in incentive engineering provides only stand-alone solutions, and fails to recognize its close relation with <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> To this end, we propose a scheme called iPass, which is a joint solution for <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering in MANETs. iPass adopts the ``pay for service'' model of cooperation, and utilizes an auction mechanism at each router to fairly allocate bandwidth resources to the passing flows. At the same time, the auction market gives explicit rate signals to the end hosts for <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> purposes. By design of the auction algorithm, iPass achieves several desirable system properties, such as bidding user's true valuation for bandwidth. Therefore, iPass provides an innovative and graceful solution for the <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering problems in a non-cooperative MANET environment...|$|R

Recently, two <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes for ABR traffic were under active discussion, They are credit-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme and rate-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme. Credit-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme can completely avoid cell loss. However, its main drawback is the per-VC large buffer requirement. Therefore, the approach is not scalable to a large number of VCs. On the other hand, rate-based <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> such as FECN and BECN, requires less buffer. Unfortunately, the rate-based schemes are generally slow in response to congestion. Worst still, these schemes are usually unfair. In this thesis, three <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes are introduced. The first one is a modification of the credit-based <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> called the two-level <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme, which can reduce the buffer requirement of the original credit-based scheme and can enhance the efficiency. Another scheme, called the Max-Min scheme, is a rate-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme. The scheme can rapidly achieve the max-min fairness allocation and reduce the peak queue lengths of the bottleneck switches. To solve the problem of different source-to-switch separations for different connections, another rate-based scheme, called the Max-Min Scheme with Delayed Adjustment, is proposed. With this, the peak queue lengths at the switches are further reduced...|$|R
