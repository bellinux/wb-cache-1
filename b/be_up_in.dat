500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards. Debra Messing (Grace) [...] "gasped loudly" [...] when {{it was revealed that}} the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a booth instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, [...] "It starts out our final season in a real special way." [...] Eric McCormack (Will) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened; [...] "It keeps it interesting for us. It stirs it up. It gives us a new way to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each {{worked on}} {{separate}} shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared {{some of their}} files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that [...] "Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a box so he'd be the correct heightâ€”Iron Man is 6'5". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character." [...] The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for {{the effect of the}} glowing Extremis characters.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a hearing}} of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Anne-Marie Brady, a University of Canterbury {{political}} science professor, testified that China considers propaganda work the [...] "life blood of the Party-State in the current era", and promotes foreign propaganda towards the Overseas Chinese community through Confucius Institutes and activities such as [...] "root-seeking" [...] cultural tours. Three years later, Professor Brady analogized, [...] "If we had a U.S. government agency that was stating {{that it was a}} tool for U.S. government propaganda, my colleagues would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> arms about having a center like that on campus." ...|$|E

In Washington {{it seems to me}} they have a fine lot of fish to fry. I do not admire much, either, the way they work it. Some of the people on either side I am perfectly disgusted with, but I feel willing to let that trouble stay in Washington; I do not want any of it in Illinois, and I do not believe anybody wants it settled except in their own state so that they can work harmoniously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immature cocoa pods have {{a variety}} of colours, but most often are green, red, or purple, and as they mature, their colour tends towards yellow or orange, {{particularly}} in the creases. Unlike most fruiting trees, the cacao pod grows directly from the trunk or large branch of a tree rather than from the end of a branch, similar to jackfruit. This makes harvesting by hand easier as most of the pods will not <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the higher branches. The pods on a tree do not ripen together; harvesting needs to be done periodically through the year. Harvesting occurs between three and four times weekly during the harvest season. The ripe and near-ripe pods, as judged by their colour, are harvested from the trunk and branches of the cocoa tree with a curved knife on a long pole. [...] Care must be used when cutting the stem of the pod to avoid damaging the junction of the stem with the tree, as this is where future flowers and pods will emerge. One person can harvest an estimated 650 pods per day.|$|E
