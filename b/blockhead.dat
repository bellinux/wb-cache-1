500|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{travel to}} Gibsonton to {{investigate}} a 28-year series of attacks by an unknown assailant {{in a community of}} former circus sideshow performers. They attend the funeral of the [...] "Alligator Man" [...] (who suffered from Ichthyosis). Among the people they meet afterwards are [...] "self-made freaks" [...] human <b>blockhead</b> Dr. <b>Blockhead</b> (Jim Rose) (who interrupted the funeral by hammering a railroad spike into his own chest) and his [...] "geek" [...] sidekick The Conundrum (The Enigma), who will eat anything, but says nothing. The agents also meet former performer Jim Jim, the Dogface Boy, who later became the local sheriff after his face went through hair loss.|$|E
500|$|One night, Mr. Nutt is fatally {{attacked}} by a creature. The agents eventually discover that the attacker is Lanny's twin, Leonard, {{who is able to}} detach himself from Lanny's body. According to Lanny, Leonard attacks people and attempts to burrow into them because he is looking for a new brother to replace Lanny, who is dying from liver failure due to years of alcohol abuse. Lanny voluntarily locks himself in the local jail {{in an effort to keep}} Leonard from escaping, but dies during the night, and Leonard is able to slip through the bars on the cell window and flee. Mulder and Scully try to capture Leonard, who goes inside a funhouse, but he manages to get away. Upon leaving the funhouse, they find The Conundrum lying on the ground, rubbing his stomach, apparently having eaten Leonard. As Dr. <b>Blockhead</b> prepares to leave town with The Conundrum the following morning, he comments to Scully that with modern science eradicating genetic anomalies, it will be up to self-made freaks like him to remind people that [...] "nature abhors normality." [...] The Conundrum looks unwell and Mulder asks what the matter is. The Conundrum [...] in his only line of the episode [...] replies, [...] "probably something I ate." [...] As Dr. <b>Blockhead</b> drives away with The Conundrum, Mulder and Scully turn to each other with confused and somewhat shocked expressions.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Lego Star Wars II was {{positively}} received by critics, who praised its {{portrayal of the}} films' characters and events. Nintendo Power staff writer Chris Shepperd claimed that [...] "he adorable LEGO adaptations also led to some hilarious story moments: the 'I am your father' scene from The Empire Strikes Back is priceless". Reviewers from GameSpy, 1UP.com, GameSpot, IGN, and [...] offered similar opinions. Shepperd and Varietys Ben Fritz called the game [...] "adorable". In reviews of the Xbox 360 version, Official Xbox Magazine praised the game's [...] "off-kilter humor", and Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that [...] "ou have to give credit to the brilliant <b>blockhead</b> who forced this awesome yet fundamentally bizarro idea on LucasArts." [...] Jeff Bell, corporate vice president of global marketing for Microsoft, commended Lego Star Wars II for expanding the range of consumers for the Xbox 360, noting its family-friendly appeal.|$|E

500|$|Abercrombie's next {{error was}} an {{apparent}} over-reliance on {{the analysis of}} Matthew Clerk. His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread. What {{is clear is that}} Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, did not want to act on Clerk's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer's advice. Clerk was one of the battle's casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame. Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, [...] "There was one hill in particular, which seem'd to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French {{in a very short time}} from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou'd imagine) must have occur'd to any <b>blockhead</b> who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig'd to wear a bib and bells." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{was written}} by Darin Morgan; {{it was his first}} script for the series. Earlier in the second season, he {{appeared}} in the second episode [...] "The Host" [...] as the Flukeman. He also helped his brother Glen Morgan—already a regular writer on The X-Files—with the script for the following episode, [...] "Blood". Series creator Chris Carter offered Darin Morgan a permanent place on The X-Files writing team, which he reluctantly accepted. Morgan said he was uncomfortable initially, stating [...] "One of the reasons I was uncomfortable joining the staff is that I'm a comedy writer and this isn't a comedy show, so I was trying more or less to have an episode {{with a little bit of}} humor, without telling anybody what I was doing." [...] Glen suggested that he write an episode about sideshow performers. Before writing the episode Darin Morgan watched a tape of Jim Rose's circus sideshow and subsequently cast Rose and The Enigma as Dr. <b>Blockhead</b> and The Conundrum, respectively. Other guest stars were Twin Peaks regular Michael J. Anderson as Mr. Nutt and Vincent Schiavelli as Lanny.|$|E
500|$|And {{yet despite}} his {{formidable}} record and undoubted {{importance in the}} history of technology, Evans never became a household name. In this respect Evans was his own worst enemy. He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work, and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme, prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times {{over the course of his}} life. In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force people to pay him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies. A leading Philadelphia merchant summed it up in 1802, stating [...] "few if any [...] are inclined to give pompous <b>blockhead,</b> Oliver Evans, the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents." ...|$|E

500|$|In his 2002 book Strange TV, M. Keith Booker {{describes}} [...] "Humbug" [...] as {{an important}} episode in the show's [...] "ironization" [...] of its exploration of [...] "Otherness"; from the start it challenges the characters'—and viewers'—assumptions about difference. In the teaser, {{what appears to be}} a monster is in fact a suburban father and eventual murder victim. When Mulder and Scully are quick to suspect the freak show performers of murder, Dr. <b>Blockhead,</b> a self-made freak and [...] "postmodern celebration of difference", confronts their prejudice and bemoans a future with no genetic anomalies. The agents, with their conventional appearance are considered outsiders, and are quickly (and correctly) judged to be working for the FBI. According to Booker, the freak show characters from the episode exemplify the concept of the Other. He contrasts the perspective of [...] "Humbug", which celebrates Otherness, with that of The X-Files overall in which [...] "Other" [...] is generally synonymous with danger and evil, much like Leonard. Despite this association between difference and malevolence generally found in The X-Files, the show meets the audience's need for difference and diversity, in its sheer number of strange and different characters. This need for something beyond everyday existence is mirrored by the main characters in Mulder's [...] "wanting to believe" [...] in the paranormal and Scully's Catholic faith. In [...] "Humbug", this is highlighted by Dr. Blockhead's argument that the freaks add a richness to life that will be eliminated by genetic advancements.|$|E
2500|$|In fact, {{the room}} can {{just as easily}} be {{redesigned}} to weaken our intuitions. Ned Block's [...] "blockhead" [...] argument suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple lookup table of rules of the form [...] "if the user writes S, reply with P and goto X". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or [...] "refactored") into this form, even a brain simulation. In the <b>blockhead</b> scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a memory address—a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what [...] "strong AI" [...] claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be extremely specific.|$|E
2500|$|The Yalta Conference {{gave the}} Soviet Union {{the right to}} invade the {{southern}} Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, but not the Japanese home islands. According to Thomas B. Allen and Norman Polmar, detailed Soviet plans for the Far East invasions had been carefully drawn up, except that the landing for Hokkaido [...] "existed in detail" [...] only in Stalin's mind {{and that it was}} [...] "unlikely that Stalin had interests in taking Manchuria and even taking on Hokkaido. Even if he wanted to grab as much territory in Asia as possible, he was too much focused on establishing a <b>blockhead</b> in Europe compared to Asia." [...] Two days before Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, Commissar Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Meretskov suggested that they should invade Hokkaido, but majority of Soviet diplomats and officers, including Vyacheslav Molotov and Georgy Zhukov opposed it {{on the grounds that they}} still didn't have enough landing crafts and equipment needed for the invasion; thus, if they tried anyway, it would dangerously expose their troops to a fierce Japanese defense, and that it would violate the Yalta agreement with the Western Allies, which forbade the Soviets from invading the Japanese home islands.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cultural}} {{attack is}} broader than the political one, {{and it may}} underlie the whole. Pope attacks, over and over again, those who write for pay. While Samuel Johnson would say, half a century later, that no man but a <b>blockhead</b> ever wrote but for money, Pope's attack is not on those who get paid, but those who will write on cue for the highest bid. Pope himself {{was one of the}} earliest poets to make his living solely by writing, and so it is not the professional author, but the mercenary author that Pope derides. He attacks hired pens, the authors who perform poetry or religious writing for the greatest pay alone, who do not believe in what they are doing. As he puts it in book II, [...] "He (a patron) chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state... And (among the poets) instant, fancy feels th' imputed sense" [...] (II 189–91). He objects not to professional writers, but to hackney writers. His dunce booksellers will trick and counterfeit their way to wealth, and his dunce poets will wheedle and flatter anyone for enough money to keep the bills paid.|$|E
2500|$|When {{recording}} {{began in}} New York bass guitarist Paul Simonon was busy making a film called Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, {{and he was}} replaced briefly by Ian Dury and the Blockheads bassist Norman Watt-Roy; this later caused some bad feeling when Watt-Roy and keyboard player Mickey Gallagher, a fellow <b>Blockhead,</b> claimed they were responsible for co-composing the song [...] "The Magnificent Seven", as the song {{was based on a}} tune of theirs. Dread, too, was upset that he was not credited as the album's producer, although he was credited with [...] "Version Mix". Other guests on the album include singer Ellen Foley (Jones' partner at the time), guitarist Ivan Julian formerly of the Voidoids, former Eddie and the Hot Rods member Lew Lewis, and Strummer's old friend and musical collaborator Tymon Dogg, who plays violin, sings on and wrote the track [...] "Lose This Skin"; he later joined Strummer's band the Mescaleros. Gallagher's children also made appearances: his two sons, Luke and Ben, singing a version of [...] "Career Opportunities" [...] from the band's first album, and his daughter Maria singing a snippet of [...] "The Guns of Brixton", from London Calling, {{at the end of the}} track [...] "Broadway".|$|E
