25|$|The <b>biological</b> <b>production</b> of {{hydrogen}} fuel {{has been a}} topic of research {{since at least the}} 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and other specific agricultural crops. Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called gasification, where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by pyrolysis, a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control. Another source for <b>biological</b> <b>production</b> {{of hydrogen}} fuel is algae. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. Experimental algae farms are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{studies show}} that seed {{orchards}} have considerable heavier cones and seeds, but not necessarily more seeds per cone and fluctuations in seed production are smaller than in stands. Harvest statistics are often available for seed orchards; usually the amount of harvested cones and seeds drops by age of the orchard. However, the harvest statistics seldom reflects the actual <b>biological</b> seed <b>production.</b> <b>Biological</b> seed <b>production</b> in some Swedish Scots pine seed orchards was calculated. No decrease in seed production when the orchard gets old was indicated. A case was reported when dense spacing did not increase seed production at age 30.

2500|$|The {{offshore}} Somali {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. Especially during the southwest Indian monsoon, strong upwelling pumps cold (17-22°C) and highly nutrient rich (about 5 to 20 μm of nitrate [...] ) subsurface water to the coastal region. During this season, mean phytoplankton density and productivity is further boosted by the activities of the offshore eddy, the Great Whirl. Total zooplankton biomass consists of about 25% Euphausids, the rest being Copepods (dominant zooplankton species in the region ~ Calanoides carinatus and Eucalanus elongates). However, the fast-moving Somali Current reduces the residence time of the upwelled nutrient-rich water, thus limiting biological productivity in this region somewhat. A major part of this unutilized nutrient is transported to the southern Arabian Sea, supporting <b>biological</b> <b>production</b> there. Furthermore, the high wind speeds (approximately 15m/s) of the Southwest monsoon affecting the Somali Current induce intense vertical mixing, increasing the thickness of the mixed layer as well as overall surface nutrient enrichment leading to high productivity. [...] After this season, with the onset of the Northeast (Winter) Monsoon, primary productivity decreases, though zooplankton density does so only slightly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. Based on {{empirical}} studies {{carried out in}} Reunion Island, Moheli (Comoros) and Madagascar, this communication deals with the non <b>biological</b> <b>productions</b> of MPAS as a major driver of the marine resources conservations governance. Three types of productions can be drawn {{for each type of}} stakeholders: territorial, behavioural and economic. Firtly, the MPA zoning produces new territories, which are generally designed according to ecological parameters (habitat status, [...] ). They overlap with a) the territories of the previous uses of seascape and b) the cultural grounds related to the territorial identity of coastal communities. For the previous users, this overlapping produces both an economical and a terrestrial cost. When the MPA zoning legitimates new uses of the seascape, it produces new territories and sometimes territorial identity. Secondly, MPAs produce lots of talks: direct (from the managers) and indirect (from the coastal populations). These talks lead to hope and satisfaction among the MPA winners or angry and dissatisfaction among the loosers. It is expected that a) after several years hope becomes satisfaction and angry becomes neutrality or satisfaction towards the MPA whose effectiveness has been proved, b) this process is sustainable. In fact this process is very vulnerable to the efficiency of MPA governance, in terms of financial security and ecological results. Satisfaction can move to dissatisfaction and then angry. When previous winners become or feel becoming loosers, they loose their trust into the MPA managers. Reversing this last process needs lots of energy and money. Thirdly, economical productions are both positive and negative. Positive aspects concern the direct wages of rangers, the fishing incomes due to the spill over effect, the income generating activities implemented to improve the social acceptability of MPAs. Negative aspects concern the lack of equity in the income distribution generating envy and finally lack of social acceptability of MPAs. These non <b>biological</b> <b>productions</b> of MPAs work as sociosystem services towards both the ecosystem and the coastal sociosystem and also cost towards the coastal populations.
