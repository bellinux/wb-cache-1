40|$|Glycol ethers {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} and household applications because their chemical and physical properties make them versatile solvents, miscible with both water and organic media. Due to {{the ease with which}} the glycol ethers are absorbed through the skin and the potential for development of adverse health effects {{it is important to understand}} the extent to which local metabolism can contribute to local and systemic toxicity. Sections of previously frozen, full thickness excised human skin samples were placed on transwell supports and placed with the underside of the skin in contact with receptor fluid. The skin surface was dosed with 115. 2 mg of neat <b>butoxyethanol</b> and the absorption and metabolism of <b>butoxyethanol</b> to butoxyacetic acid monitored over time. In total 64. 94 ?? 0. 04 mg of <b>butoxyethanol</b> or its metabolites were removed from the surface of the skin at 24 hours, representing the equivalent of 56 % of the applied dose, the equivalent of 17. 5 % of the applied dose was recovered from the receiver fluid, 3 % from within the skin and the remaining 23. 5 % of the dose was lost to the atmosphere through evaporation. After 24 hours a total of 31. 5 ??g of butoxyacetic acid had been produced representing approximately 0. 03 % of the applied dose. Therefore approximately 0. 16 % (31. 5 ??g as a percentage of the total amount of <b>butoxyethanol</b> reaching the receiver fluid (20. 17 mg) of the absorbed <b>butoxyethanol</b> was metabolised to butoxyacetic acid during its passage through the skin. This suggested that, although enzyme activities capable of converting <b>butoxyethanol</b> to butoxyacetic acid are present in skin, metabolic conversion during percutaneous absorption was small and systemic exposure to the parent compound rather than the metabolite would occur following dermal exposure to <b>butoxyethanol.</b> This experiment demonstrates that it is possible to maintain metabolic activity in skin samples in an in vitro set up for short, but experimentally useful, period...|$|E

DOI: 10. 1016 /j. taap. 2006. 09. 019 Glycol ethers are {{solvents}} widely used alone and as mixtures in industrial and household products. Some glycol ethers {{have been shown to}} have a range of toxic effects in humans following absorption and metabolism to their aldehyde and acid metabolites. This study assessed the influence of water mixtures on the dermal absorption of <b>butoxyethanol</b> and ethoxyethanol in vitro through human skin. <b>Butoxyethanol</b> penetrated human skin up to sixfold more rapidly from aqueous solution (50 %, 450 mg/ml) than from the neat solvent. Similarly penetration of ethoxyethanol was increased threefold in the presence of water (50 %, 697 mg/ml). There was a corresponding increase in apparent permeability coefficient as the glycol ether concentration in water decreased. The maximum penetration rate of water also increased in the presence of both glycol ethers. Absorption through a synthetic membrane obeyed Fick's Law and absorption through rat skin showed a similar profile to human skin but with a lesser effect. The mechanisms for this phenomenon involves disruption of the stratum corneum lipid bilayer by desiccation by neat glycol ether micelles, hydration with water mixtures and the physicochemical properties of the glycol ether???water mixtures. Full elucidation of the profile of absorption of glycol ethers from mixtures is required for risk assessment of dermal exposure. This work supports the view that risk assessments for dermal contact scenarios should ideally be based on absorption data obtained for the relevant formulation or mixture and exposure scenario and that absorption derived from permeability coefficients may be inappropriate for water-miscible solvents...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} skin thickness on the percutaneous penetration and distribution of test compounds with varying physicochemical properties using in vitro systems. Studies were carried out in accordance with OECD guidelines on skin absorption tests. Methods: Percutaneous penetration of caffeine (log P - 0. 01), testosterone (log P 3. 32), propoxur (log P 1. 52) (finite dose in ethanol to water vehicle ratio) and <b>butoxyethanol</b> (log P 0. 83) (undiluted finite dose or as an infinite dose 50 % [v/v] aqueous solution) through skin of varying thicknesses under occluded conditions was measured using flow through cells for 8 - 24 h. Saline (adjusted to pH 7. 4) was used as receptor fluid, with BSA added for studies with testosterone and propoxur. Following exposure, the remaining surface dose was removed by swabbing and the skin digested prior to scintillation counting. Results: The maximum flux of caffeine was increased with decreasing skin thickness, although these differences were found to be non-significant. The presence of caffeine in the skin membrane was not altered by skin thickness. Maximum flux and cumulative dose absorbed of testosterone and <b>butoxyethanol</b> (in both finite and infinite doses) were markedly reduced with full thickness (about 1 mm thick) skin compared with split thickness skin (about 0. 5 mm). Maximum flux of propoxur (dissolved in 60 % ethanol) was clearly higher through skin of 0. 71 mm than through skin of 1. 36 mm, but no difference was found between 0. 56 and 0. 71 mm. The proportion of propoxur present in the membrane after 24 h increased significantly over the complete range of thicknesses tested (0. 56 - 1. 36 mm). Conclusions: A complex relationship exists between skin thickness, lipophilicity and percutaneous penetration and distribution. This has implications for risk assessment studies and for the validation of models with data from different sources. © Springer-Verlag 2006...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The use and {{clinical}} {{efficacy of the}} alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor fomepizole is well established {{for the treatment of}} ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings in adults. Methods. A computerized search of the U. S. National Academy of medicine and EMBase databases was undertaken to identify published cases of patients treated with fomepizole. This search strategy identified 14 published cases related to the topic of this review: 10 due to ethylene glycol poisoning, 1 due to diethylene glycol poisoning, 1 due to <b>butoxyethanol</b> ingestion, and 2 due to methanol poisoning. The median age of these cases was 5. 5 years old. Fomepizole in glycol and glycol ether poisoning. For the 10 ethylene glycol poisoned patients, the median recorded values of their arterial pH was 7. 27 (range 7. 03 – 7. 38), serum bicarbonate concentration was 13 mEq/L (range 2 – 25), and ethylene glycol concentration was 2, 140 mg/L (range 130 – 3, 840). Eight of these patients were not hemodialyzed. The eight patients who were not hemodialyzed had ethylene glycol concentrations as high as 3, 500 mg/L and serum bicarbonate concentrations as low as 4 mEq/L. All 10 patients had resolution of their metabolic acidosis and recovered without sequelae. The half-times of ethylene glycol elimination ranged from 9 to 15 h during fomepizole therapy, which is faster than the 19. 7 h reported in adults. The two patients who ingested diethylene glycol or <b>butoxyethanol</b> all recovered without sequelae. The patient who ingested the <b>butoxyethanol</b> had a serum bicarbonate concentration of 13 mEq/L and was not hemodialyzed. Fomepizole in methanol poisoning. One of the two children who ingested methanol was hemodialyzed. Both cases had a similar degree of severity. Does fomepizole obviate the need for hemodialysis? Based on the experience reviewed herein it appears that, as in adults, hemodialysis may not be necessary in most cases of pediatric ethylene glycol poisoning if treated with fomepizole. Fomepizole pharmacokinetics. Plasma fomepizole concentrations were measured in three cases and were found to be therapeutic with apparent Michaelis–Menton kinetics, having a zero-order elimination rate of 0. 6 – 1 mg/L/h at higher concentrations and a first-order elimination with an apparent elimination half-time of 3. 9 h at lower concentrations. Fomepizole regimen. Most cases used the current U. S. -approved regimen. Adverse effects of fomepizole. The one adverse effect reported during fomepizole therapy was transient nystagmus in a 6 -year-old with a serum ethylene glycol concentration of 130 mg/L and a serum bicarbonate concentration of 2 mEq/L; it is likely that ethylene glycol itself was the cause. Comparison of fomepizole with ethanol therapy. Two cases were originally treated with ethanol but switched to fomepizole because of adverse effects. In both cases, the adverse reactions to ethanol resolved once fomepizole treatment was initiated. Conclusions. The limited data available suggest that fomepizole, using the same dosage regimen as that used for adults, is efficacious and well tolerated in pediatric patients. In many cases of pediatric ethylene glycol poisoning treated with fomepizole, hemodialysis may not be necessary despite high concentrations and the presence of metabolic acidosis...|$|E
40|$|Most QSARs for dermal {{absorption}} predict the permeability coefficient, K p, of a molecule, which is valid for infinite dose conditions. In practice, dermal exposure mostly occurs under finite dose conditions. Therefore, a simple model to predict finite dose {{dermal absorption}} from infinite dose data (K p and lag time) and the stratum corneum/water partition coefficient (K SC,W) was developed. To test the model, {{a series of}} in vitro dermal absorption experiments was performed under both infinite and finite dose conditions using acetic acid, benzoic acid, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, <b>butoxyethanol,</b> cortisone, decanol, diazinone, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, ethacrynic acid, linolenic acid, octylparaben, oleic acid, propylparaben, salicylic acid and testosterone. For six substances, the predicted relative dermal absorption was not statistically different from the measured value. For all other substances, measured absorption was overpredicted by the model, {{but most of the}} overpredictions were still below the European default absorption value. In conclusion, our finite dose prediction model provides a useful and cost-effective estimate of dermal absorption, to be used in risk assessment for non-volatile substances dissolved in water at non-irritating concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of clouding of nonionic surfactant {{and the effect}} of additives on the cloud point has been investigated. The cloud point temperature of Triton X- 100 solutions in the concentration range 1 - 10 % and the cloud point behavior of 4 and 10 % Triton X- 100 solutions in the presence of some aliphatic alcohols and alkanes of different concentrations have been studied. A sharp rise in cloud point of aqueous solutions of Triton X- 100 occurs with increasing surfactant concentration beyond 4 %. A small but significant decrease in cloud point is observed upon the addition of hexane, heptane, octane and decane to 4 and 10 % Triton X- 100 solutions. The alkanes of higher chain length are more effective in depressing the cloud point and the extent of depression follows the order: decane>octane>heptane>hexane. Lower alcohols enhance the cloud point while the higher alcohols including <b>butoxyethanol</b> depress the cloud point.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} problematic of indoor air pollution. There were tested low emitting types of lacquers – UV and waterborne lacquers. The {{work has been}} splitted in to two parts. In the first part samples of lacquers were applied on the particle board with beech veneer on the surface. Samples of air with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from lacquers were taken 3 and 24 hours after application. Tests proved that film layer of UV lacquer emit much smaller volumes of VOCs than acrylic waterborne lacquers or than 2 –component epoxide waterborne lacquer. Acrylic waterborne lacquers’ materials emitted especially butoxyethylene, epoxide lacquer emitted a lot of <b>butoxyethanol</b> and methoxypropanol and UV lacquers particularly emitted toluene, benzene and xylene. Se­cond part of testing consists of VOCs’ measuring of chosen lacquers applied on different base materials – inertial material glass and particle board with beech veneer. Tested criterion was the impact of different base material on emitted amount of VOCs. The results showed that lacquer coated on glass emit much more chemicals than lacquer on wood material. All materials were also tested on total amount of organic compounds emitted in to the air – on the TVOC. Measuring showed the same results as the first parts of research...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To assess {{excretion}} kinetics of {{free and}} total (free + conjugated) 2 -butoxyacetic acid (BAA) following dermal and inhalation exposure to <b>butoxyethanol</b> (BE). Methods: Six male volunteers were derma lly exposed for 4 h to a 50 % aqueous solution of BE on {{an area of}} 40 cm 2 of the volar forearm. Six other male volunteers were exposed by inhalation (mouth only) to 93 mg m- 3 BE for 30 min. As biological indices of exposure, BE in blood and total and free BAA in urine were measured. Results: Following inhalation exposure, the 24 -h cumulative excretion of free and total BAA in urine amounted to 5. 5 ± 2. 7 and 12. 8 ± 4. 0 mg, respectively. After dermal exposure, 147. 1 ± 61. 0 and 346 ± 52 mg, respectively, of free and total BAA were excreted in urine up to 48 h after the onset of exposure. The proportion of conjugated BAA in single urine samples increased after dermal exposure in time from 45 ± 30 % in the first collection period to 92 ± 2 % after 48 h. The elimination half-life of total BAA following dermal exposure was longer than that of free BAA (5. 1 ± 0. 6 and 3. 8 ± 0. 4 h, respectively). The interindividual variation in the cumulative excreted amount after inhalatory exposure was higher (49 %) for free BAA than for total BAA (31 %). The average dermal flux amounted to 3. 5 mg cm- 2 h- 1 independently of whether free or total BAA {{was used for the}} calculation, and, again, the interindividual variation in the estimated fluxes was higher for free BAA than for total BAA (41 % and 15 %, respectively). Conclusion: The interindividual variation in the extent of conjugation is large, and the degree of conjugation increases with time. Due to lower interindividual variability, total BAA is superior to free BAA as a biomarker of exposure. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|E
40|$|As {{the supply}} of natural gas becomes more scarce, it is {{becoming}} increasingly more attractive and financially viable to start using reserves that were previously determined to be to impure to use. H 2 S and CO 2 are a couple of the major impurities found in natural gas. Natural gas high in these chemicals is referred to as sour gas. Presence of these impurities increases the chances of clathrate hydrate formation in pipelines, which can lead to pipe blockages or ruptures. To prevent clathrate hydrate formation, low dosage, polymeric, kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) are used. KHIs are water soluble polymers, most commonly polyvinylcaprolactam (PVCap) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). There is to date no definitive answer to the method of hydrate inhibition by KHIs and knowing how they work could lead to the design and manufacture of more effective inhibitors. This thesis begins with the synthesis of model compounds. Low molecular weight compounds containing pyrrolidone and/or caprolactam rings were created to mimic PVP and PVCap. To look at the crystallisation behaviour of the model compounds, a wide range of different multicomponent crystallisations were attempted with pharmaceutical coformers, hydrogen bond donors, halogen bond donors and metal salts. Successfully formed cocrystals were analysed by single crystal x-ray crystallography. Cocrystals formed with boronic acids were tested for their ability to gel guar and compared with the commercially used boric acid. The effect of sour gas on the interactions of the KHIs and model compounds with water was investigated using IR and NMR techniques. Small angle neutron diffraction was used to explore the synergistic effect between <b>butoxyethanol</b> and PVCap which leads to a significant improvement in hydrate inhibition. Finally the ability of the model compounds to prevent crystallisation was applied to pharmaceuticals. Attempts to stabilise the amorphous forms of a range of drugs by creating coamorphous mixtures with the model compounds were investigated by hot-stage microscopy, DSC and PXRD...|$|E
40|$|Phosphororganic {{flame retardants}} and {{plasticisers}} are important contaminants in the aquatic environment. Whereas the non-chlorinated alkylphosphates were partly eliminated in {{wastewater treatment plants}} the amounts of the chlorinated flame retardants were hardly reduced. Thus these compounds are discharged into the aquatic environment by STP-effluents. The elimination efficiency of wastewater treatment depends {{on the one hand}} on the dimension of the respective STP {{and on the other hand}} on the treatment technique that is applied. The elimination was higher in larger STP (inhabitant equivalent values (IEV) 300, 000 - 1, 000, 000) than in smaller ones (IEV below 100, 000). Lower elimination rates were observed for the trickling filter plant that was sampled in comparison to the activated sludge plants. In degradation experiments of the selected organophosphates with activated sludge in batch reactors, bis-(2 -chlorethyl) phosphate was identified as metabolite of tris-(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate under aerobic conditions. The selected organophosphate esters were detected in surface water that is used for drinking water purification. Thus it was studied if the drinking water quality is affected by these compounds. For this purpose samples from different waterworks in the Ruhr catchment area were analysed. Moreover the elimination efficiency of diverse treatment processes such as slow sand filtration, ozonisation and activated carbon filtration was studied. In the finished water the concentrations of the organophosphates were below the respective limit of quantification (LOQ). The chlorinated alkylphosphates are very persistent in the aquatic environment as they have been detected and quantified in pristine waterbodies such as the German Bight and Lake Ontario. A reduction of these compounds in the German Bight was traced back to dilution effects only. The concentrations of the phosphororganic flame retardants in marine samples were one order of magnitude higher than for other contaminants such as herbicides and by-products of pesticide production. The non-chlorinated alkylphosphates have only been detected in the river Elbe plume. Similar results were obtained for samples of Lake Ontario. As expected from the respective log KOW values of the selected organophosphate esters the bioaccumulation of these substances in fish is low. The concentrations of tri-n-butylphosphate (TnBP), tri-iso-butylphosphate (TiBP), triphenylphosphate (TPP) and tris-(chloroisopropyl) phosphate TCPP in bream muscle from different sampling locations in Germany were in the lower ng/g range (dry weight). Tris-(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris-(dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCP), tris-(butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) and ethylhexyldiphenylphosphate (EHDPP) were not detected in any fish sample. Moreover a temporal trend in the concentrations was observed. The sampling location seems to be an important factor that influences the detected levels of these substances in fish muscle as in the conurbation area higher amounts were detected than in riverine ecosystems. For the extraction of the selected organophosphate esters from water samples liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) has been applied. Fish samples were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) in combination with different clean up steps (SPE on silica gel and size exclusion chromatography (SEC)). The different compounds were detected by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with electron impact ionization (GC-EI-MS). For quantification purposes the isotopic labelled internal standards tri-n-butylphosphate d 27 (TnBP d 27) and triphenylphosphate d 15 (TPP d 15) were used. TPP d 15 was synthesized from phenol d 6 and phosphorus oxytrichloride. The empiric formula of the product was confirmed by electrospray high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-HR-TOF-MS). The metabolites bis-(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP), bis-(methyl, 2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (BCPP) and bis-(butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBEP) were synthesized from phosphorus oxytrichloride and the respective alcohols chloroethanol, 1 -chloro- 2 -propanol and <b>butoxyethanol.</b> For the control of the reaction the respective products were measured after derivatisation with trimethylsulphoniumhydroxide (TMSH) by GC-EI-MS and gas chromatography positive chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (GC-PCI-MS) ...|$|E
