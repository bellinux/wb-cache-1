40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Article {{is to examine the}} nature and origin of the issues now being faced by Washington courts in the area of <b>at</b> <b>will</b> {{employment}} and to argue that the well-established legal principles governing other kinds of contracts be consistently applied to <b>at</b> <b>will</b> employment contracts. This will result in a proper balance between the desire to protect <b>at</b> <b>will</b> employees from unfair termination and the need to allow employers the freedom to make decisions in the hiring and termination of <b>at</b> <b>will</b> employees without undue interference. This Article will first review the historical development of the <b>at</b> <b>will</b> rule from English common law through the significant Washington state cases leading up to the Thompson decision. Next, the Thompson case will be analyzed with particular emphasis on the employee handbook exception to the <b>at</b> <b>will</b> rule. The Article will then discuss cases decided after Thompson {{and the manner in which}} the courts have attempted to resolve some of the questions raised by the Thompson opinion. The probable effects of an expansive interpretation of the Thompson handbook exception on employer-employee relations will be considered in light of the actions employers may take to avoid liability and exposure to Thompson-type claims by discharged employees. Finally, the Article will argue that the consistent adherence to established contract law principals in the application of Thompson will benefit both employers and employees by providing adequate protection against unjust dismissal of <b>at</b> <b>will</b> employees while, <b>at</b> the same time, enhancing the ability of employers to communicate with their <b>at</b> <b>will</b> employees...|$|R

The 1972 passage of Title IX led {{to the establishment of}} intercollegiate women's volleyball and women's basketball teams in 1975, with home games <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> Gym. In addition to equal playing opportunities for female athletes, however, Title IX also required equal facilities {{for both men and women}} and the facilities <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> were not only older and in deteriorating condition, but were considerably smaller than those at the Memorial Gym as the seating capacity <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> Gym had been reduced to near 100 by the mid 1970s. Both women's teams initially played all or most of their schedule <b>at</b> <b>Wills</b> for their first few seasons before permanently moving to Memorial Gym for the 1977-78 seasons.
