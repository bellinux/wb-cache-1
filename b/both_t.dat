25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} that subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans, and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by <b>both</b> <b>T.</b> gondii and Helicobacter pylori in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment. Although a causal relationship between latent toxoplasmosis with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established, preliminary evidence suggests that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.|$|E
500|$|Cantor {{established}} {{these results}} using two constructions. His first construction shows {{how to write}} the real algebraic numbers as a sequence a1, a2, a3,.... In other words, the real algebraic numbers are countable. Cantor starts his second construction with any sequence of real numbers. Using this sequence, he constructs nested intervals whose intersection contains a real number not in the sequence. Since every sequence of real numbers {{can be used to}} construct a real not in the sequence, the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence – that is, the real numbers are not countable. [...] By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers, Cantor produces a transcendental number. Cantor points out that his constructions prove more – namely, they provide a new proof of Liouville's theorem: Every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers. Cantor's next article contains a construction that proves the set of transcendental numbers has the same [...] "power" [...] (see below) as the set of real numbers.} (for example, tn=e/n). Call this set T0. Then T= T0∪{tn}= T0∪{t2n-1}∪{t2n}. The set of reals R= T∪{an}= T0∪{tn}∪{an} where an is the sequence of real algebraic numbers. [...] So <b>both</b> <b>T</b> and R are the union of three pairwise disjoint sets: T0 and two countable sets. A one-to-one correspondence between T and R is given by the function: f(t)=t if t∈T0, f(t2n-1)=tn, and f(t2n)=an. Cantor actually applies his construction to the irrationals rather than the transcendentals, but he knew that it applies to any set formed by removing countably many numbers from the set of reals (...)
