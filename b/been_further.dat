5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have <b>been</b> <b>further</b> developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Although Connecticut {{is divided}} into counties, there is no county {{government}} in Connecticut and local government consists of cities and towns. County government was abolished in Connecticut in 1960, although the names remain for geographical purposes.

5|$|Apart {{from three}} destroyers {{launched}} in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years, Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels. The mainstays of the fleet, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, , and , {{were all over}} thirty years old. Although Minas Geraes had <b>been</b> <b>further</b> refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still too old and in too poor a condition for any {{active role in the}} Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 a Congressional Act {{divided the}} Eastern District into the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Eastern District. The courts of the Eastern Division {{continued}} {{to be held at}} the U.S. Custom House and Post Office in St. Louis, while the courts of the Northern Division were moved to the U.S. Post Office at Hannibal, Missouri, where they met until 1960. These two courts, along with the four courts of the Western District, made six courts for the state, and at the time no other state had so many separate federal courts. The district has since <b>been</b> <b>further</b> divided into the Eastern, Northern, and Southeast divisions.|$|E

5|$|Seeing the {{continued}} success of Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering, {{the game and}} toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999, for about US$325million. Hasbro had expressed interest in purchasing Wizards of the Coast as early as 1994, and had <b>been</b> <b>further</b> impressed after the success of its Pokémon game. Avalon Hill was made a division of Wizards of the Coast, in late 1999; the company had been purchased by Hasbro {{in the summer of}} 1998.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have <b>been</b> <b>further</b> flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and {{a focus on the}} development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have <b>been</b> <b>further</b> extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.|$|E

5|$|The high-altitude explosions {{that had}} caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to {{blackout}} had <b>been</b> <b>further</b> studied in the early 1960s {{and led to a}} new possibility for missile defense. When a nuclear warhead explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy X-rays ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little gas for this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its heat shields.|$|E
5|$|The keep has {{a central}} newel staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors. When first built, the {{garrison}} would have {{lived on the}} ground floor of the keep, the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement for stores. The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have <b>been</b> <b>further</b> subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive. The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain. There is a wooden lantern structure on the top of the keep that contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti. The keep's gun embrasures were converted to form sash windows in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The supreme {{responsibility}} for conservation {{lies with the}} Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated the management to the Governor of Svalbard and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. The foundation for conservation {{was established in the}} Svalbard Treaty of 1920, and has <b>been</b> <b>further</b> specified in the Svalbard Environmental Act of 2001. The first round of protection took force on 1 July 1973, when most of the current protected areas came into effect. This included the two large nature reserves and three of the national parks. Moffen Nature Reserve was established in 1983, followed by four national parks, three nature reserves and one geotope protection area between 2002 and 2005.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled warbler records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine warbler, while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled warbler has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, and there have <b>been</b> <b>further</b> subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached warbler, and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed {{as part of the}} 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached warbler from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} the ranges of {{motion in the}} joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. Therefore, they were not {{likely to have been}} used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. As the prey animal attempted to pull away, it would only have <b>been</b> <b>further</b> impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once the prey was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} hypotheses {{exist on}} the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous wild horse origin is thought improbable, as significant numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800–1050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had <b>been</b> <b>further</b> developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19thcentury.|$|E
