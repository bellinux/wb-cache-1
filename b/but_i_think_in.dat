25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely.

When asked if it was exhausting to promote socialist reforms Folkvord said, [...] "It is. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> some ways easier than before [...] fake socialist regimes have collapsed". Another opinion of his was that [...] "capitalism destroys the natural environment around us making the bourgeois society planners understand that there must be something new in the future. This provides inspiration to win support for socialist beliefs in Norway". Folkvord's first contact with anti-capitalist beliefs came when he joined the Workers' Communist Party. The party told him about [...] "capitalist barbarism" [...] and how the wealthy controlled everything. Folkvord said he believed that [...] " [...] can't be the end of human development", and that he believes humans are destined to create another more-just system.|$|E

Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Nimoy {{made his}} final {{appearance}} as Spock as a cameo in the 2013 film, Star Trek Into Darkness. Abrams approached {{him and asked}} for a favor, and Nimoy agreed as he felt that the lines could only be said by his version of Spock and was about the character itself. The appearance was kept a secret until the premiere, as it was shot at Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, California, with only Nimoy and Abrams present. Nimoy did not rule out a further appearance as Spock, saying that he would hear what Abrams had to offer since he considered him a friend and he had done [...] "a great thing for Star Trek". Nimoy died on February 27, 2015, ahead of the production of the third Kelvin timeline film, Star Trek Beyond. Quinto later said at a Beyond fan event, [...] "In a way I feel like he’s more a part of this film than he was the other two. We were all so cognizant of his absence <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> the face of that, we all held him in our hearts more fully.

60|$|It {{cannot be}} concealed: {{we are a}} divided people. But in divisions, where a part is to be taken, we are to make a muster of our strength.

We should not be much wiser, if we pretended to very great accuracy in our estimate; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> the calculation I have made, the error cannot be very material. In England and Scotland, I compute that those of adult age, not declining in life, of tolerable leisure for such discussions, and of some means of information, more or less, and who are above menial dependence, (or what virtually is such,) may amount to about four hundred thousand. There {{is such a thing as}} a natural representative of the people. This body is that representative; and on this body, more than on the legal constituent, the artificial representative depends. This is the British public; and it is a public very numerous. The rest, when feeble, are the objects of protection,--when strong, the means of force. They who affect to consider that part of us in any other light insult while they cajole us; they do not want us for counsellors in deliberation, but to list us as soldiers for battle.|$|E

60|$|My {{landlord}} {{having taken}} his whole establishment to be salted down, I am waited on by {{an elderly woman}} labouring under a chronic sniff, who, at the shadowy hour of half-past nine o'clock of every evening, gives admittance at the street door to a meagre and mouldy old man whom I have never yet seen detached from a flat pint of beer in a pewter pot. The meagre and mouldy old man is her husband, and the pair have a dejected consciousness {{that they are not}} justified in appearing {{on the surface of the}} earth. They come out of some hole when London empties itself, and go in again when it fills. I saw them arrive on the evening when I myself took possession, and they arrived with the flat pint of beer, and their bed in a bundle. The old man is a weak old man, and appeared to me to get the bed down the kitchen stairs by tumbling down with and upon it. They make their bed in the lowest and remotest corner of the basement, and they smell of bed, and have no possession but bed: unless it be (which I rather infer from an under-current of flavour in them) cheese. I know their name, through the chance of having called the wife's attention, at half-past nine on the second evening of our acquaintance, to the circumstance of there being some one at the house door; when she apologetically explained, 'It's only Mr. Klem.' What becomes of Mr. Klem all day, or when he goes out, or why, is a mystery I cannot penetrate; but at half-past nine he never fails to turn up on the door-step with the flat pint of beer. And the pint of beer, flat as it is, is so much more important than himself, that it always seems to my fancy as if it had found him drivelling in the street and had humanely brought him home. In making his way below, Mr. Klem never goes down the middle of the passage, like another Christian, but shuffles against the wall as if entreating me to take notice that he is occupying as little space as possible in the house; and whenever I come upon him face to face, he backs from me in fascinated confusion. The most extraordinary circumstance I have traced in connexion with this aged couple, is, that there is a Miss Klem, their daughter, apparently ten years older than either of them, who has also a bed and smells of it, and carries it about the earth at dusk and hides it in deserted houses. I came into this piece of knowledge through Mrs. Klem's beseeching me to sanction the sheltering of Miss Klem under that roof for a single night, 'between her takin' care of the upper part in Pall Mall which the family of his back, and a 'ouse in Serjameses-street, which the family of leaves towng ter-morrer.' I gave my gracious consent (having nothing that I know of to do with it), and in the shadowy hours Miss Klem became perceptible on the door-step, wrestling with a bed in a bundle. Where she made it up for the night I cannot positively state, <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> a sink. I know that with the instinct of a reptile or an insect, she stowed it and herself away in deep obscurity. In the Klem family, I have noticed another remarkable gift of nature, and that is a power they possess of converting everything into flue. Such broken victuals as they take by stealth, appear (whatever the nature of the viands) invariably to generate flue; and even the nightly pint of beer, instead of assimilating naturally, strikes me as breaking out in that form, equally on the shabby gown of Mrs. Klem, and the threadbare coat of her husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is high time, my dear doctor, for me {{to speak to you}} frankly and openly, of what my {{intentions}} are in reference to the disposal of my property. I mentioned somewhat of this to you four or five years since, but I should like now to speak explicitly. I am aware that such matters are not usually gone into; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> many cases, of which this is one, it is right and better that it should be so. I have no relations whatever in the world, with the exception of my sisters, who have an ample life provision, and Sophy Needham, my son's child. My property is very large; I have the Harmer estates, my own savings in India, and the accumulation of my brothers, who never lived up to their income for very many years. In all about seven thousand a year. As I have said, Sophy Needham is my only connection in the world--you my only friend. To Sophy I have left half my fortune, the other half I have bequeathed to your children. Do not start, my dear Ashleigh, or offer any fruitless objection, my decision is fixed and immovable. For the last thirteen years my existence has been brightened by your friendly intercourse, in you I have found a scientific guide and friend; indeed, I may say that my life as far as this world is concerned, has been entirely made what it is, tranquil, contented, and happy by your friendship. Ten years ago you will remember I begged you to retire from practice, and to take up your abode here with your family, upon any terms you might name, but in fact as my adopted family. This offer you, from motives I could not but respect, declined. You loved your profession, and considered it incompatible with your duty to leave a career of active usefulness. Things, therefore, went on as before. Towards Sophy my intentions were not fixed, but she has turned out a very good girl, and I shall therefore leave her half my fortune, about seventy-five thousand pounds. Had I any other relation, or any person who could have the smallest claim upon me, you might hesitate; as it is, not even the most morbid feeling of delicacy can tell you that you are depriving others of their expectations. Being so, let the matter be tacitly understood, and say nothing whatever about it; you ought not to have known of it till my death, just suppose that you do not know of it now. You will ask me why have I then told you. For this reason. I wish to benefit your children. My life is uncertain; but I may live for many years yet, and my money might come too late to do good. Your son may have spent the best years of his life struggling in some profession which he does not like; your daughters may have suffered too. I therefore wish at once to place Harry with the best man in the profession he wishes to enter, which I have heard him say is that of a civil engineer, and I shall allow him a hundred and fifty pounds a year for the present. Your daughters I should wish sent to some good school in London to finish their education; and when the time shall come, when such an event may be considered probable, I should wish it to be publicly known that they will each have upon their wedding day ten thousand pounds. Your son shall have a like sum when the time comes for him to enter into a partnership, or start in business for himself. These sums to be deducted from their moiety of my fortune at my death. And now, doctor, let us shake hands and not mention the matter again, and as you {{do not seem to be}} drinking your wine, let us go out and join the young ladies in the garden." ...|$|E
