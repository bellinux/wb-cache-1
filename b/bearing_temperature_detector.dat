In case of critical equipment such as critical compressors or turbines, its consequences could lead to total plant shut down and huge losses.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the influence of}} applied load and oil supply temperature on the performance of a 100 mm plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ± 90 º to the load line has been carried out. Hydrodynamic pressure at the mid-plane of the <b>bearing,</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, bush torque, oil flow rate and shaft position were measured for variable operating conditions. The applied load varied from 2 to 10 kN, whereas the supply temperature ranged from 35 to 50 ºC. Bearing performance is strongly dependent on these parameters. It was found that the cooling effect of the downstream groove increases when the applied load increases. The opposite occurs with the upstream groove. Shaft temperature was found to be close to the maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>temperature</b> for low applied loads, but was significantly lower than this value for high loads. The increase in maximum <b>bearing</b> <b>temperature</b> was between 30 and 50 % of the corresponding increase in supply temperature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The gas {{temperature}} in vessel will be significantly increased {{according to the}} aeration speed and pressure during the aeration or deflation for the ultrahigh pressure vessel. Due to the restriction of air tightness and structure for the ultrahigh pressure vessel, {{it is difficult to}} measure the {{gas temperature}} by adopting the traditional measurement method without change of the vessel structure. In this paper, a new type interior off-line <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> is designed to measure the gas temperature in vessel. The power, temperature sensors, processor, memory and human-computer communication module is linear arranged in the circuit board, which ensure that the <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> can be putted inside the ultrahigh pressure vessel through the vessel inlet of diameter Ø 25 mm. The experiment results show that the gas temperature in vessel can be effectively measured by adopting the interior off-line <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> without change of the vessel structure...|$|R

Instrumentation includes a detailed array of pad <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> and the direct measurement of frictional torque.

40|$|Case StudyA {{centrifugal}} compressor in olefins plant charge gas service experienced excessive thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>temperatures</b> after startup following a field overhaul and rerate.

A mechanical test of an identical spare bearing was conducted on an existing thrust bearing test rig to confirm the results of the analytical study and field observations. A compressor outage was ultimately required to remedy the thrust bearing issue. A methodical approach to the shutdown work was employed to assure detection and correction of the cause for the thrust bearing distress while minimizing the duration of the plant outage. The approach included full scale oil flow rate testing in the field as well as a comprehensive bearing disassembly and inspection plan.
