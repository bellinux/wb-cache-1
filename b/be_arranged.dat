5|$|I am {{not quite}} {{certain that the}} present {{regulations}} governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering whether they could not <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.|$|E
5|$|I beg {{to tender}} the {{following}} suggestion {{as a means}} of getting over the difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> at a friendly conference {{about the same time as}} the International Conference.|$|E

5|$|Bank of America Stadium {{is owned}} entirely by the Panthers, making them {{one of the}} few teams in the NFL to own the {{facility}} they play in.

On some days the stadium offers public tours for a fee. Private tours for groups are offered for a fee seven days a week, though there are some exceptions, and such tours must <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> in advance.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Headley {{received}} {{news that}} his aunt {{had been killed}} by floods in Kingston which had also destroyed his home.

5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>arranged.</b> The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E

5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge.

5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{prior to}} modern DNA analysis developed remarkably prescient theories. The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948. In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E

The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides.

5|$|The general {{statement}} of Apollonius' {{problem is to}} construct one or more circles that are tangent to three given objects in a plane, where an object may be a line, a point or a circle of any size. These objects may <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> in any way and may cross one another; however, they are usually taken to be distinct, meaning {{that they do not}} coincide. Solutions to Apollonius' problem are sometimes called Apollonius circles, although the term is also used for other types of circles associated with Apollonius.|$|E
5|$|The linking of the GN and B routes {{meant that}} {{the section of the}} GN south of Holborn became a branch from the main route. The UERL began {{constructing}} the main route in July 1902.

Construction of the Holborn to Strand section was delayed while the London County Council constructed Kingsway and the tramway subway running beneath it and while the UERL decided how the junction between the main route and the branch would <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> at Holborn.|$|E
