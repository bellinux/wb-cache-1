The thin and poor-quality topsoil yielded an initially good harvest, followed by a smaller harvest the second year. Typically, the land was cultivated for only two years, and then the farmer repeated the process on another plot, allowing the first plot to rest ten years before refarming.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A conifer release {{trial was}} {{established}} in a 45 -year-old aspen overstory stand in Northeast British Columbia, Canada. Thinning occurred from 0 to 100 % in increments of approximately 10 % to yield a total of ten units. Treatment consisted of physically cutting aspen stems at the root collar or girdling at breast height (d. b. h.) for trees 10 cm d. b. h., respectively. The thinning treatment was conducted following standard <b>brushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeding</b> contracts common to the British Columbia Ministry of Forests. At this time {{no significant difference in}} diameter growth can be found between treatments. All girdled trees were flushed the following year after treatment. The result of flushing may have limited the response of the coniferous understory. Continued monitoring of the site may provide valuable information to the operational applicability of thinning aspen stands of this age to release understory spruce...|$|R

500|$|The alpine and subalpine zones, {{despite their}} high {{elevation}} (above 9500 feet, 2900 meters) and significant rainfall (at least 35inches, 89cm per year, except in drought years), are sparsely vegetated. The windswept terrain of the alpine zone is primarily small <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> while trees—mostly small gnarled pines and junipers—occur in canyons and shielded depressions in the subalpine zone. Inland elevations above [...] support much denser forest. Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, black oak, lodgepole pine, and willow constitute {{most of the}} forested lands. The mountain habitats of the watershed support many animals typical of Californian mountain regions, including squirrels, chipmunks, black bears, mule deer, and many species of migratory birds. In the canyons of the San Bernardinos, the river is abundant in rainbow trout and is lined with alders, willow and cottonwoods. Where the river and its large upper tributaries empty out of the mountain canyons into the Inland Empire basin, they are surrounded by the alluvial scrub zone, a mix of desert and upper riparian vegetation.

The {{existing}} stream channel is generally incised, running through areas primarily covered with heavy trees, <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeds.</b> The ravine ranges from 6 to 20 feet deep through the corridor with very steep slopes in several areas. In two areas storm outlets are undercut or suspended above the channel. Tall undercut, eroded banks exist along several of the outside bends. Sediment deposition on the inside bends limits the cross-section of the channel, increasing flow velocity and forcing this faster flow toward the eroded outside bank. A wide array of practices {{will need to be}} implemented to address channel erosion. Improvements will be specifically tailored to address problems observed at each bend. The result will be a channel with a more natural appearance, and reduced use of hard armor and revetment. Some sections will require minimal grading with removal of underbrush for improved maintenance access and more sun exposure, better allowing deep­ rooted plants and flowers to establish to provide further erosion protection. Straight sections with steep banks will require grading to pull back slopes, increasing the creek's capacity to convey storm flows at slower velocities. Sections with sharp bends will require slope pull back and armor protection. A constructed wetland will collect and treat runoff from a small sub-watershed, before being discharged into the main tributary...|$|R
40|$|Research {{shows that}} low-volume roads, {{including}} commonly studied forest roads, can have many effects on {{water quality and}} aquatic resources. The temporal and spatial relationships of these environmental effects are complex. Water quality sampling is costly, and results are difficult to link to specific road problems. Research results from other road systems or regions are often dated and not reflective of a well-maintained road system. Because most best management practices deal with new roads, a landscape-level survey is essential for understanding and managing the environmental effects of roads at a landscape or watershed scale. This rapid survey has been developed by using monitoring and research results. Metrics were developed to quantify the environmental effects of road systems: road location in relation to streams or slopes prone to landslide or erosion; stream crossing effects on fish passage; washout and diversion risk at stream crossings; percent of road system with hydrologic connection to streams; land area dedicated to roads and not growing forests; and general condition rating of the prism, surface, drainage system, drainage structures, <b>and</b> <b>brush</b> <b>and</b> <b>weeds.</b> This survey analyzes conditions {{on the ground and}} is organized in a database and linked spatially to a geographic information system.

[...] Mowing {{can be a very}} successful control method for many annual weeds. Mowing is the most effective when it is performed before the weeds are able to set seed because it can reduce the number of flower stalks and prevent the spread of more seed.

Also, some species are able to re-sprout from stem or root segments that are left behind after mowing.

40|$|This paper summarises {{the major}} European {{achievements}} with physical <b>and</b> cultural <b>weed</b> control methods in minor row crops. Minor crops, such as vegetables, sweet maize and potatoes, present two different situations for physical weed control of entirely different difficulty. Inter-row weeds are easily removed by inter-row cultivation while intra-row weeds, i. e. those growing between the crop {{plants in the}} rows, still constitute a major challenge aimed at minimising laborious hand weeding. Investigations have focussed on optimising the use of mechanical principles against intra-row weeds, e. g. harrowing, <b>brush</b> <b>weeding</b> <b>and</b> finger <b>weeding.</b> These methods {{have been successful in}} some transplants, potatoes and maize, and may become alternatives to chemical control. However, in sown crops with low initial growth rates and in general in organic farming, current intra-row mechanical methods have to act in combination with thermal and cultural methods to achieve sufficient control, though some subsequent hand weeding may be needed. As such, methods worth mentioning are: mulching with dead or living materials; intercropping (e. g. celery in transplanted leek); optimised crop spatial arrangement (e. g. in pigeon bean); and solarisation to reduce soil seed viability. Although the need for hand weeding has been reduced markedly, this is still to be fully achieved. The direction in research has thus moved to new methods. Robotic weeding is now being investigated for row crops with abundant and precise spacing between individual plants, and soil steaming prior to sowing row crops that develop dense crop stands shows promise of effective and prolonged control...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of agricultural lands to forests has increased worldwide {{over the past}} few decades for multiple reasons including increasing forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. However, previous land cover and competing vegetation often impede afforestation. We established 219 plots in 29 Quercus plantations on four previous land cover types (LCT) : Clover, Soybeans, Woody <b>Brush,</b> <b>and</b> Herbaceous <b>Weeds.</b> Plantations were located in Illinois, USA and were sampled 15 – 18 years after planting. Sampling data for all trees (planted and volunteer) included species, diameter, and vine presence on the main bole of the tree. Free-to-grow status was recorded for all Quercus species and estimated cover of two invasive species, Elaeagnus umbellata and Lonicera japonica, was documented on each plot. There was a strong relationship between total tree density and invasive species cover across all sites. Stocking success was lower and E. umbellata cover was higher on Woody Brush sites compared to Clover and Soybean cover types. Additionally, significantly more free-to-grow Quercus saplings occurred in Clover and Soybean cover types compared to the Woody Brush sites. The results indicate that previous land cover plays a critical role in forest afforestation. Furthermore, while historically, volunteer tree species were thought to be detrimental to the development of planted species these results suggest that with the increasing prevalence of invasive species worldwide the role of volunteer species in afforestation should be reconsidered and silvicultural protocols adjusted accordingly...|$|R
