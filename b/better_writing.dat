He {{had a profound}} impact, training many students who {{would go on to}} become influential in the field of psychology such as Stanley Smith Stevens. He pushed psychologists to adapt <b>better</b> <b>writing</b> habits which ultimately benefited the audiences that would later read these works. Instead of focusing on gaining success through his student’s work, Boring led a professional life full of integrity, and was willing to sacrifice his own needs for those of his students.|$|E
500|$|Peter, Joe, and Cleveland {{accompany}} Quagmire to a {{sex shop}} called Pornoslavia. Peter buys an erotic book entitled Much Ado About Humping and finds it disappointing. Peter writes {{a letter to}} the author including an example of what he would consider a <b>better</b> <b>writing</b> style for an erotic novel, which impresses his friends when he reads it to them. Encouraged by their enthusiasm, Peter decides to write his own erotic novel, which is received well by all who read it. The novels he authors are converted into audio books read by Betty White, and [...] "published" [...] by Peter's father-in-law, Carter Pewterschmidt, who only gave Peter $5 for photocopies. While listening to one of Peter's audio books, an aroused driver tries to take off his shirt while driving and crashes his car into the Kool-Aid Man's house. The man sues Carter, who is liable as the publisher. Carter immediately loses his fortune. Blaming Peter for his penniless state, Carter arrives at the Griffin house intending to shoot Peter. Lois persuades Carter to spare him, and Peter agrees to let Carter live with them until he has income.|$|E

[...] A reviewer for The New York Times wrote of it in 1903: [...] "If nothing else makes Mr. London's book popular, {{it ought to be}} rendered so by the complete way in which it will satisfy the love of dog fights apparently inherent in every man."

2500|$|This {{new edition}} of the gamebooks {{features}} new internal artwork by Richard Longmore (books 1 to 12, 17 and 20), Nathan Furman (books 13 and 18), Pascal Quidault (books 14 to 16), Hauke Kock (book 19 and 21) and Stephanie Böhm (book 21). However, the original illustrations by the late Brian Williams were reused for book 22. Giuseppe Camuncoli was hired to illustrate book 29. The first book has been partially rewritten and extended by Joe Dever, whilst the rest were extended in-house. The republished first Lone Wolf book features a retcon of {{the opening of the}} book, where instead of Lone Wolf waking to find everyone at his monastery dead, he joins the fight. Dever has stated that, since he has the chance, and considers himself a better writer, that this is a good opportunity to make a better beginning. Longtime fan and now assistant Jonathan Blake said of the retconning that overall, despite his love of the original, the surprises, grittier illustrations, and <b>better</b> <b>writing</b> have [...] "won him over".|$|E
6000|$|I dwell {{upon this}} {{particular}} book {{because it is}} the best; but take the whole line, and there is not one which is not full of interest. Marbot gives you {{the point of view of}} the officer. So does De Segur and De Fezensac and Colonel Gonville, each in some different branch of the service. But some are from the pens of the men in the ranks, and they are even more graphic than the others. Here, for example, are the papers of good old Cogniet, who was a grenadier of the Guard, and could neither read nor write until after the great wars were over. A tougher soldier never went into battle. Here is Sergeant Bourgogne, also with his dreadful account of that nightmare campaign in Russia, and the gallant Chevillet, trumpeter of Chasseurs, with his matter-of-fact account of all that he saw, where the daily [...] "combat" [...] is sandwiched in betwixt the real business of the day, which was foraging for his frugal breakfast and supper. There is no <b>better</b> <b>writing,</b> and no easier reading, than the records of these men of action.|$|E

6000|$|De Quincey's {{style is}} a {{revelation of the}} beauty of the English language, and it profoundly {{influenced}} Ruskin and other prose writers of the Victorian Age. It has two chief faults,--diffuseness, which continually leads De Quincey away from his object, and triviality, which often makes him halt {{in the midst of a}} marvelous paragraph to make some light jest or witticism that has some humor but no mirth in it. Notwithstanding these faults, De Quincey's prose is still among the few supreme examples of style in our language. Though he was profoundly influenced by the seventeenth- century writers, he attempted definitely to create a new style which should combine the best elements of prose and poetry. In consequence, his prose works are often, like those of Milton, more imaginative and melodious than much of our poetry. He has been well called [...] "the psychologist of style," [...] and as such his works will never be popular; but to the few who can appreciate him he will always be an inspiration to <b>better</b> <b>writing.</b> One has a deeper respect for our English language and literature after reading him.|$|E
