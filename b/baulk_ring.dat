50|$|Amongst {{its list}} of {{improvements}} is increased case rigidity and {{twice the number of}} bolts attaching it to the engine (eight instead of four). The syncromesh <b>baulk</b> <b>ring,</b> gear docking teeth angles and the double cone syncro on 2nd and 3rd gear have also all been retuned.|$|E
50|$|Synchromesh {{transmission}} {{was introduced}} by Cadillac in 1928. If the dog teeth {{make contact with the}} gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or synchromesh, which consists of a cone clutch and blocking ring. Before the teeth can engage, the cone clutch engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a blocker (or <b>baulk)</b> <b>ring.</b> When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|The final major {{upgrades}} to the Minor {{were made}} in 1962. Although the name Minor 1000 was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own ADO development number. A larger version of the existing A-Series engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist Harry Weslake for the then new ADO16 Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than did the 948 cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098 cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38 mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77 mph (124 km/h) with noticeable improvements in low-end torque, giving an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with <b>baulk</b> <b>ring</b> synchromesh rather than the old cone-clutch type. The brakes were still drums on each corner but the front units were increased from 8 inches (20 cm) to 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard layout with toggle switches, textured steel instrument binnacle, {{and the return of}} a glove-box cover on the passengers side (the cubby hole on the driver's side remained open). A different heater completed the interior upgrade, whilst the larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many BMC vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings. These now included a separate bulb and amber lens for indicators while larger tail lamp units also included amber rear flashers. The larger white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light indicating when the oil filter was blocked) and the black plastic two-spoke steering wheel were both shared with the basic Morris 1100.|$|E
50|$|In a {{synchromesh}} gearbox, {{to correctly}} match {{the speed of}} the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the collar locking into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker <b>rings</b> or <b>baulk</b> <b>rings,</b> the latter being spelled balk in the U.S.). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone clutch and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.|$|R
