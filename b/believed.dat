5|$|An EKOS poll {{conducted}} in December 2009 revealed that 83% {{of the respondents}} <b>believed</b> the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured.

As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still <b>believed</b> Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents <b>believed</b> that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% <b>believed</b> senior military officials would have known about the problem.
