50|$|About the {{derivation}} of {{the name}} “Bärenbach” there is no consensus. There are two other villages in Rhineland-Palatinate alone with this same name (this one, for one). If interpreted as a Modern High German word, its meaning would be “Bear’s Brook”, but the modern spelling may not be indicative {{of the name}}’s etymology. Decisive for the interpretation is the first syllable, which - as also with the village of Bärweiler - was originally Ber— (Berenbach/Berwilre). In Middle High German usage, this syllable had several meanings and was applied to not only the bear (Bär in Modern High German) but also the <b>breeding</b> <b>boar</b> (in which case it was cognate with the still current English word boar) and even barley (in which case it was cognate with the Old English word bere, which helped give rise to the modern word barley), now called Gerste in German. At times, placename researchers lean towards {{the interpretation of the}} name having sprung from the brown bear, which once roamed this area. It seems much likelier, though, that the name is drawn from a personal or family name. Many placenames after all go back to a village’s owner, founder or leader, with the village that grows up drawing its name from a homestead that once stood there. If so, Bärenbach might have drawn its name from a man named Bero, a short form of the name Berengar.|$|E

The experiment consisted of 28 Duroc boars breed for 14 weeks. These boars were divided into 4 groups according to age balanced. In the control (n = 7) group (K), was chromium receiving 205 ug/kg/day. In the 1 st group (n = 7) animals (CR 1) was dose chromium even increased by 60. 6 ug/kg compound feed for the second group (n = 7) boars (Cr 2) of 121. 2 ug/kg and 3. group (n = 7) boars (Cr 3) was added chromi-um in an amount of 181. 8 ug/kg compound feed.

40|$|Life {{starts with}} fertilisation. Variation in {{fertility}} {{is caused by}} both farm and sow related parameters and boar and semen related parameters. Therefore, achieving high fertility is not obvious. Predominantly, artificial insemination (AI) is used for breeding pigs. The advantage of AI {{is that you can}} dilute semen from high fertile <b>breeding</b> <b>boars</b> and in this way inseminate many sows. The last years, the pig industry is increased in scale and evaluated in specialisation. Unfortunately there is no golden standard concerning the requirements for qualitative good semen. This thesis handles different semen quality characteristics in relation to fertility, showing that the effect of semen quality characteristics on the variation in fertility is relatively small. These effects seems small, but the economic value in a high producing pig industry is large, with the objective to minimise the variation between farms. Assessing semen quality characteristics objectively and relate them to field fertility leads to an efficient production of insemination doses, which results in an efficient spreading of the genetic genes. Semen motility assessed with CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analysis) and analysing DNA damage are semen quality parameters which show a relation with fertility, in high fertile <b>breeding</b> <b>boars.</b> The value of these tests is possibly even higher in a population in which less selection is performed, added with other tested parameters from this thesis.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundStructural {{chromosome}} abnormalities {{are well}} known as factors that reduce fertility rate in domestic pigs. According to large-scale national cytogenetic screening programs that are implemented in France, {{it is estimated that}} new chromosome abnormalities occur at a rate of 0. 5  % in fertility-unproven boars. ResultsThis work aimed at estimating the prevalence and consequences of chromosome abnormalities in commercial swine operations in Canada. We found pig carriers at a frequency of 1. 64  % (12 out of 732 boars). Carrier pigs consistently showed lower fertility values. The total number of piglets born for litters from carrier boars was between 4 and 46  % lower than the herd average. Similarly, carrier boars produced litters with a total number of piglets born alive that was between 6 and 28  % lower than the herd average. A total of 12 new structural chromosome abnormalities were identified. ConclusionsReproductive performance is significantly reduced in sires with chromosome abnormalities. The incidence of such abnormal sires appears relatively high in populations without routine cytogenetic screening such as observed for Canada in this study. Systematic cytogenetic screening of potential <b>breeding</b> <b>boars</b> would minimise the risk of carriers of chromosome aberrations entering artificial insemination centres.

The age of boars was between 8 months and 30 months. The rhythm of harvesting was following: one harvesting followed by the five days break. Depending on the breed, were differences for volume (183, 5 ± 4, 88 ml at Pietrain boars and 256 ± 5, 3 ml at Landrace boars) and for concentration (309, 7 ± 6, 0 millions/ml at Duroc boars and 430, 7 ± 9, 3 millions/ml at Pietrain boars). In function on the season, semen volume varied insignificant between summer (minimum values: 188. 4 ± 5. 6 ml) and winter (maximum values: 222. 1 ± 6. 6 ml). The spermatozoon concentration was insignificantly influenced by the season (371. 6 ± 11. 7 million/ml - summer; 399. 4 ± 12. 6 million/ ml – autumn). The greatest differences for all indices of semen analysis were in function on individual.

In the experiment, boars of Duroc breed were tested. The first control group (n = 10) was not supplemented with antioxidants. The second experimental group (n = 10) was supplemented with antioxidants in the following quantities of 0. 5 mg of selenium (seleno-methionine), 100 mg of zinc (zinc-methionine), 70 mg of vitamin E (alpha‑tocopherol) and 350 mg of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) per kilogram of their feed. The experiment was carried out for 120 days and took place in summer (June to September). During the experiment, average and maximum daily temperatures, where boars were stabled, were monitored. Average daily temperature ranged from 12 to 28 °C. Maximum temperature during the day was from 13 to 32 °C.

A condition of this abandonment is to solve different problems relatedto <b>breeding</b> <b>boars,</b> especially meat quality. One of the best ways is that of genetics, includinggenomic selection. A resource population has been implemented using French Pietrain pigsraised in a control animal testing station.

A direct boar effect was also shown for the susceptibility to affected lungs. The proportion of the sire effects in the variance of litter traits was very small. The heritability for growth during the fattening period was h 2 - 0. 08, for backfat thickness h 2 - 0, 05 to 0, 11, for slaughter type h 2 = 0, 13 tot 0, 20, for meat quality h 2 = 0, 07 and for susceptibility to affected lungs h 2 = 0, 02 to 0, 08. From the direct sire effects on several traits and their genetic variation, it was concluded that on-farm data on individual traits could be used in breeding programmes. For the relation between growth rate in the testing station and the same trait under field conditions, a correlation rp = 0, 27 was calculated and a genetic correlation rg = 0, 36.

The number of nucleus sows in the main female line (German Landrace) can vary within a wide range without noticeable effect on the genetic and economic response. Productive lifetimes of approximately one year are recommended for nucleus boars and sows after the progeny test. Boars mated to produce crossbreds should be used longer, especially in the terminal sire line. F 1 -sows can have a productive lifetime {{of more than two}} years and can be used close to their biological maximum. Four testing schemes are compared and the contribution of the three breeds to the return is evaluated. Testing crossbred animals at a central test Station cannot be recommended. This capacity should be used to test purebred animals. Both monetary genetic gain and profit are higher in a scheme with a self-performance testing of boars at Station, in comparison to a scheme with only progeny testing at Station, by 36 and 68 %, respectively. Due to a reduced generation interval, using <b>boars</b> to produce <b>breeding</b> <b>boars</b> straight after their self-performance test leads to a further increase of monetary genetic gain by 5 % and profit by 13 %.

SP-TAC also differed (P &lt; 0. 001) among ejaculate fractions (43 ejaculates and 3 fractions per ejaculate), of which the sperm-peak portion of the sperm rich ejaculate fraction (SRF) had the highest SP-TAC. SP-TAC was not correlated with sperm quality (motility and viability) or functionality (intracellular ROS generation and lipid peroxidation) of liquid AI-semen samples stored at 17 degrees C for 72 h (90 AI-samples), but the decline in sperm quality was larger (P &lt; 0. 05) in ejaculates with low, compared with high SP-TAC (hierarchically grouped).

50|$|Presumably, A. suum {{infections are}} present in pig farms all over the world. However, few {{countries}} have up-to-date information on its prevalence. In a Swedish study {{it appeared that the}} pens of sows and fatteners are the heaviest infected environments. This was shown by the presence of eggs in old faecal deposits collected from the pens. These findings were supported by studies from China and Denmark where the highest prevalence of A. suum was also found in breeding sows and fatteners. The prevalence in <b>breeding</b> <b>boars</b> is usually lower than in sows or fatteners. Nevertheless, infected boars could also be an important source of transmission of parasite eggs on the farm since they are often located in more traditional pens than the sows (e.g. with solid floor and/or bedding). Moreover, boars are regularly used for contact stimulation of the sows, which allows them to spread the infection by defecating in areas other than their own pen.Strong evidence exists that under indoor conditions, massive infection of piglets with A. suum usually occurs shortly after arrival in the highly infectious fattening units and not in the farrowing pens. Several studies have shown that A. suum egg excretion was nearly absent in weaners despite the, sometimes substantial, presence of eggs in the farrowing pens of intensive herds. Here, the increased hygienic standards in combination with the low humidity in the farrowing pens may significantly reduce the presence of favourable microenvironments for egg survival. On the other hand, in piglets raised under outdoor conditions, significant transmission is thought to occur soon after birth and pigs are infected before fattening.|$|R

Human and swine E. coli isolates (N = 2130 and 3485, respectively) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the SensititreTM broth microdilution system. The associations between AR prevalence for each antimicrobial agent, multi-drug resistant E. coli, or multivariate AR E. coli, and the risk factors (host species, production type (swine), vocation (human swine worker versus non-worker), and season) in the study were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE), GLM with multinomial distribution, or GEE in a multivariate model using a SAS? macro to adjust for the correlated AR phenotypes. There were significant (p < 0. 05) differences in AR isolates: 1) between host-species with swine at higher risk for ceftiofur, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. The prevalence of ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance were higher among human isolates, 2) swine production group was significantly associated with AR with purchased boars, nursery piglets, and <b>breeding</b> <b>boars</b> at a higher risk of resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline, and 3) human swine worker cohorts exhibited an elevated tetracycline prevalence, but lowered sulfisoxazole prevalence when compared to nonworkers. High variability among seasonal samples over the 3 -year period was observed. There were significant differences in multiple resistance isolates between host species, with swine at higher risk than humans of carrying multi-resistant strains; however, no significant differences in multiple resistance isolates within humans by vocation or within swine by production group. The odds-ratios, adjusted for multivariate dependence of individual AR phenotypes, were increased relative to unadjusted oddsratios among 1) swine as compared to human for tetracycline (OR = 21. 8 vs. 19. 6), and 2) increased significantly among swine-workers as compared to non-workers only for tetracycline (OR = 1. 4 vs. 1. 3). Occupational exposure to swine-rearing facilities appears to be associated with an increased relative odds for the prevalence of tetracycline resistance compared to non-workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is the verification of antioxidants, the vitamin C, the vitamin E and selen influence on the spermgenesis of <b>breeding</b> <b>boars.</b> The ejaculate quality was evaluated {{with the use of}} qualitative and quantitative figures (the ejaculate volume, the motility, the sperm concentration and the number of abnormal sperms). The experiment was done at the boars' insemination station (ISK) in Velké Meziříčí. In the experimet, there were 12 boars of DUROC race involved. The boars were split into two groups. By the first boars experimental group (n= 6) there were added into the feeding batch 350 mg of the vitamín C (ascorbe acid); 70 mg of the vitamín E (alfatocoferol) and 0, 5 mg of selen (selenomethionin) per one kilogram of this special diet. The second group of boars was used as the checking group and the volume of the vitamin C, the vitamin E and the selen was not increased in their diet. The experiment was running for 90 days (June [...] August). At the checking group the volume of their ejaculate was increasing untill the 60 th day of the experiment, in the final stage it has significantly dropped, totally by - 19 %. By the experimental group, the volume of the ejaculate was constantly increasing trend and the total volume increase during the experiment duration was + 32 %. The sperm motility at the checking group has decreased from the original 69 % down to 54 %, while at the experimental group it has increased by approximatelly 1 %. The sperm concentration check [...] by the checking group it has increased by + 6 % and by the experimental group the sperm concentration has decreased by - 24 %. The number of abnormal sperms at the checking group has increased by + 1 % and by the experimental group the number of pathologic sperms has increased by + 30 %. Based on our results it is possible to say, that selen, the vitamin C and vitamin E do not have a provable effect on the boars ejaculate quality. But we must také into the consideration also the summer season, during which the experiment was provided. There were higher temperatures affecting the animals, which could have negative influence on the results...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydiaceae are Gram-negative obligate {{intracellular}} bacteria. They {{are responsible}} for {{a broad range of}} diseases in animals and humans. In pigs, Chlamydia suis, Chlamydia abortus, Chlamydia pecorum and Chlamydia psittaci have been isolated. Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs are associated with different pathologies such as conjunctivitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, polyarthritis, polyserositis, pseudo-membranous or necrotizing enteritis, periparturient dysgalactiae syndrome, vaginal discharge, return to oestrus, abortion, mummification, delivery of weak piglets, increased perinatal and neonatal mortality and inferior semen quality, orchitis, epididymitis and urethritis in boars. However, Chlamydiaceae are still considered as non-important pathogens because reports of porcine chlamydiosis are rare. Furthermore, Chlamydiaceae infections are often unnoticed because tests for Chlamydiaceae are not routinely performed in all veterinary diagnostic laboratories and Chlamydiaceae are often found in association with other pathogens, which are sometimes more easily to detect. However, recent studies have demonstrated that Chlamydiaceae infections in <b>breeding</b> sows, <b>boars</b> and piglets occur more often than thought and are economically important. This paper presents an overview on: the taxonomy of Chlamydiaceae occurring in pigs, diagnostic considerations, epidemiology and pathology of infections with Chlamydiaceae in pigs, public health significance and finally on prevention and treatment of Chlamydiaceae infections in pigs. 1...|$|R

40|$|In the {{reproduction}} of pigs we have been seeing for long time seasonal and sudden declines {{in the production of}} piglets. But there are no completely known specific influencing factors or the extent of their impact on fertility of sows and boars. There are many studies dealing with the causes of decline of showing the estrus of sows and boars reducing sperm quality, but even in the educational literature or professional breeders discussions is not enough space dedicated to reducing the quantity of semen of boars. The number of sperm cells in the ejaculate {{plays an important role in}} fertilization and also has a direct impact on the smooth running of boar AI center and thus their clients. The aim of the study was to evaluate sperm counts of observed boars under the influence of the seasons and compare them with the ideal values. All the data of the number of sperm of observed boars from the years 2006 2010 were divided into groups based on the date when sperm collection was conducted. These groups were then compared statistically among themselves in terms of the average total quantity of sperm cells in the ejaculate, average sperm concentration and average volume of ejaculate. The average total number of sperm cells reached the highest values in winter, the second best results was evaluated in the fall, which was not too far from the spring results that have achieved satisfactory values. The lowest total sperm count was recorded in the summer but even these low values are according to professional literature in the standard. The average sperm concentration peaked again in the winter, but this time with a relatively small margin before spring, which also showed excellent results. Worse values were achieved in the fall and the lowest results from all fell back for the summer. Some sources even stated that the results for the fall and summer are below standard. For ejaculate volume was surprisingly best evaluated fall, but with only a slight difference the second best quality has been reached in winter. Compared to the results of the concentration of sperm cells in the ejaculate volume were recorded relatively low values in the spring, but the worst results were, as expected, again in the summer. The results show that factors related to the ongoing season have undeniable impact on sperm production of <b>breeding</b> <b>boars,</b> these factors have somewhat different effect on semen volume and sperm concentration.

40|$|Abstract: This paper gives a {{detailed}} analysis of the applied biosecurity measures in the production of boar sperm at a swine reproduction center. Biosecurity indicators (existence of a written biosecurity plan, isolation, introduction of newly acquired animals into the herd, herd health, assessment of the personnel attitude towards equipment, traffic control, attitude towards visitors, feeding and watering control, manure management, disposal of dead animal carcasses, attitude towards other animals, rodents and birds control, sanitation) were viewed and evaluated by rating scale: (5) - excellent, (4) - very good, (3) -good, (2) - sufficient, (1) - insufficient, there are resources for improvement (0) -insufficient, with no resources for improvement. Obtained data were analyzed in the SWOT process, taking into account all the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities for improving the biosecurity level. The situation in the center is rated as very good, with an average rating of 4. 15. However, one disadvantage is serious and related to the boar facilities isolation possibilities, taking into account their location and the presence of two types of male <b>breeding</b> animals (<b>boars</b> and bulls) in the same location.

40|$|The {{selection}} of morphologically normal spermatozoa {{is critical to}} obtain high <b>breeding</b> performances in <b>boar</b> <b>breeding</b> farms and artificial insemination (AI) centers. Parameters for the {{selection of}} semen mainly include total sperm motility, concentration, and morphology. However, these primary parameters are often not reliable for discriminating between normal and abnormal, non-fertilizable spermatozoa. The present {{study was designed to}} compare the motion characteristics, fertilization ability using in vitro fertilization (IVF), and acrosome formation of the semen from boars having low (boar number 2012) and normal (boar number 2004 and 2023) breeding performances. The ultimate goal was to identify additional simple and easy criteria for the selection of normal sperm. There {{was no significant difference between}} boar 2004 and boar 2023 sperm total motility in computer assisted sperm analysis. However, boar number 2012 semen presented a significantly reduced population of rapid moving spermatozoa and an increased population of slow moving spermatozoa compared to boar numbers 2004 and 2023. Analysis of detailed motion characteristics revealed that sperm from boar number 2012 had significantly reduced motility in progressiveness, average path velocity, straight-line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), straightness, and linearity. The assessment of the fertilizing ability by IVF also showed that sperm from boar number 2012 showed a fertility rate of 3. 4 %, whereas sperm from boar number 2023 had a fertility rate of 75. 45 %. Interestingly, most of the sperm nuclei were found on the peripheral area of the oocytes, suggesting that the sperm from boar number 2012 lacked penetration ability into the oocyte zonapellucida. The acrosome formation analysis using Pisum sativum agglutinin staining demonstrated that the sperm from boar number 2012 had a defect in acrosome formation. Consequently, primary parameters for selecting semen before AI such as motility are not sufficient to select normal and fertilizable spermatozoa. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the acrosome staining and detailed motion characteristics such as progressiveness, VCL, and VSL should be included in determining semen quality together with primary parameters for successful AI and high breeding performance in the swine industry...|$|R

40|$|Internal {{fertilization}} usually {{implies that}} a spermatozoon, with intact attributes for zygote formation, passes all hurdles during its transport through the female genitalia and reaches the oocyte. During this journey, millions to billions of other spermatozoa perish. Spermatozoa are highly differentiated motile cells without synthetic capabilities. They generate energy via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to sustain motility {{and to maintain}} the stability and functionality of their plasma membrane. In vivo, they spend their short lifespan bathing in female genital tract fluids of different origins, or are in vitro exposed to defined media during diverse sperm handling i. e. extension, cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, etc. Being excitable cells, spermatozoa respond in vivo to various stimuli during pre-fertilization (capacitation, hyperactivation, oocyte location) and fertilization (acrosome reaction, interaction with the oocyte) events, mediated via diverse membrane ion-conducting channels and ligand-gated receptors. The present Thesis has mapped the presence and reactivity (sperm intactness and kinematics) of selected receptors, water and ion channels in ejaculated boar spermatozoa. The final aim {{was to find a}} relevant alternative cell type for in vitro bioassays that could ease the early scrutiny of candidate drugs as well as decreasing our needs for experimental animals according to the 3 R principles. Spermatozoa are often extended, cooled and thawed to warrant their availability as fertile gametes for breeding or in vitro testing. Such manipulations stress the cells via osmotic variations and hence spermatozoa need to maintain membrane intactness by controlling the exchange of water and the common cryoprotectant glycerol, via aquaporins (AQPs). Both AQPs- 7 and - 9 were studied for membrane domain changes in cauda- and ejaculated spermatozoa (un-processed, extended, chilled or frozen-thawed). While AQP- 9 maintained location through source and handling, thawing of ejaculated spermatozoa clearly relocated the labelling of AQP- 7, thus appearing as a relevant marker for non-empirical studies of sperm cryopreservation. Alongside water, spermatozoa interact with calcium (Ca 2 +) via the main Ca 2 + sperm channel CatSper. Increments in intracellular Ca 2 + initiate motility hyperactivation and the acrosome reaction. The four subunits of the CatSper channel were present in boar spermatozoa, mediating changes in sperm motility under in vitro capacitation-inducing conditions (increased extracellular Ca 2 + availability and bicarbonate) or challenge by the CatSper antagonists mibefradil and NNC 55 - 0396. Uterine and oviduct fluids are richest in endogenous opioids as β-endorphins during mating and ovulation. Both μ- and δ- opioid receptors were present in boar spermatozoa modulating sperm motility, as in vitro challenge with known agonists (μ: morphine; δ: DPDPE and κ: U 50488) and antagonists (μ: naloxone; δ: naltrindole and κ: nor-binaltrorphimine) showed that the μ-opioid receptor maintained or increased motility while the δ-opioid receptor mediated decreased motility over time. Finally, boar spermatozoa depicted dose-response effects on sperm kinematics and mitochondrial potential following in vitro challenge with 130 pharmacological drugs and toxic compounds as well as with eight known mito-toxic compounds. In conclusion, boar spermatozoa expressing functional water (AQPs- 7 and - 9) and ion (CatSper 1 - 4) channels as well as μ- and δ-opioid receptors are able to adapt to stressful environmental variations, capacitation and pharmacological compounds and drug components. Ejaculated sperm suspensions are easily and painlessly obtained from <b>breeding</b> <b>boars,</b> and are suitable biosensors for in vitro drug-induced testing, complying with the 3 R principles of reduction and replacement of experimental animals, during early toxicology screening...|$|R
