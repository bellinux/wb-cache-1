25|$|The CAB {{investigated}} the accident, {{and as the}} wreckage pieces were reassembled and scrutinized, {{it became apparent that}} a critical 5/16 inch AN-175-21 nickel steel bolt was missing in the elevator boost linkage mechanism. By carefully examining and analyzing the various scuff marks and grease patterns near the missing bolt, the CAB investigators concluded that the bolt had fallen out prior to the aircraft's disintegration and collision with the ground, and not {{as a result of the}} accident itself. Without the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> the elevator (when in boost mode) and hence the entire aircraft would become uncontrollable, leading the investigators to deduce that the bolt had fallen out, most likely by working itself loose, a short time prior to the beginning of the accident sequence.|$|E

50|$|Bolts use a {{wide variety}} of head designs, as do screws. These are {{designed}} to engage with the tool used to tighten them. Some bolt heads instead lock the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> so that it does not move and a tool is only needed for the nut end.|$|E

50|$|When {{the correct}} key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a lever, {{activating}} a latch or sliding bolt, {{or it may}} itself push against the latch or bolt.

50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a spring bolt lock because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to hold the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|E

The top hat or [...]75 circle {{at the top of}} the pin stops it from going all the way through the hole. The pin has a J design so it is installed horizontally and then turns vertical as it enters the upright frame.

5000|$|Most of the bolt-action designs use turn-bolt design which {{involves}} the shooters doing a [...] "turn + pull" [...] handle movement to unlock/open the bolt, cock {{the firing pin}} and cycle the cartridge. There are three major turning bolt-action system designs: the Mauser system, the Lee-Enfield system, and the Mosin-Nagant system. All three differ {{in the way the}} bolt fits into the receiver, how the bolt rotates as it is being operated, the number of locking lugs holding the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> as the gun is fired, and whether the action is cocked on the opening of the bolt (as in the Mauser system) or the closing of the bolt (as in the Lee-Enfield system). The vast majority of bolt-action rifles utilize one of these three systems, with other designs seeing only limited use.|$|E
50|$|The roller-locked recoil {{operation}} {{functions as}} follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching {{tracks in the}} barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> against the breech. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition pushes the striker assembly back and allows the rollers to move inwards, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats {{as long as the}} trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is only capable of fully automatic fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire. The usual training objective {{is to be able to}} fire a burst of no more than three rounds. The weapon features a recoil booster at the muzzle to increase rearwards force due to recoil, therefore improving functional reliability and rate of fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{component}} sections may typically include metal beams, {{channel and}} angle sections, with the lacing elements either metal plate strips, or angle sections. The lacing elements are typically attached using either hot rivets or threaded locator bolts. As with lattice girders, laced struts and ties {{have generally been}} supplanted by hollow box sections, which are more economic with modern technology. In some case seismic retrofit modifications replace riveted lacing with plates <b>bolted</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A vault door, {{much like}} the smaller {{burglary}} safe door, is secured with numerous massive metal bolts (cylinders) extending from {{the door into the}} surrounding frame. Holding those <b>bolts</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> is some sort of lock. The lock is invariably mounted on the inside (behind) of the difficult to penetrate door and is usually very modest in size and strength, but very difficult to gain access to from the outside. There are many types of lock mechanisms in use: ...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located {{on the right side}} of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram rod and percussion cap which consumed time during loading procedures. The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, {{the bolt}} {{consists}} of a tube of metal inside of which the firing mechanism is housed, and which has at the front or rear of the tube several metal knobs, or [...] "lugs", which serve to lock the <b>bolt</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The operation can be done via a rotating bolt, a lever, cam-action, locking piece, or a number of systems. Straight-pull designs have seen {{a great deal of}} use, though manual turn-bolt designs are what is most commonly thought of in reference to a bolt-action design due to the type ubiquity. As a result, the bolt-action term is often reserved for more modern types of rotating bolt-designs when talking about a specific weapon's type of action. However, both straight-pull and rotating bolt rifles are types of bolt-action rifles. Lever-action and pump-action weapons must still operate the bolt, but they are usually grouped separately from bolt-actions that are operated by a handle directly attached to a rotating bolt. Early bolt-action designs, such as the Dreyse needle gun and the Mauser Model 1871, locked by dropping the bolt handle or bolt guide rib into a notch in the receiver, this method is still used in [...]22 rimfire rifles. The most common locking method is a rotating bolt with two lugs on the bolt head, which was used by the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, Model 1888 Commission Rifle, Mauser M 98, Mosin-Nagant and most bolt-action rifles. The Lee-Enfield has a lug and guide rib, which lock on the rear end of the bolt into the receiver.|$|E

The hatch was <b>bolted</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> at 12:10 UTC. Most of the 70 hatch bolts had been secured, when one was discovered to be broken. This caused a 42-minute delay while all the bolts were removed, the defective bolt was replaced and the hatch was re-bolted <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The count was resumed at 11:25 UTC. The gantry was rolled back at 13:20 UTC. At 13:58 UTC the count was held for 25 minutes while a liquid oxygen propellant valve was repaired.|$|R

Each motor controller contains a contactor or a solid-state motor controller, overload relays to protect the motor, fuses or a circuit breaker to provide short-circuit protection, and a disconnecting switch to isolate the motor circuit. Three-phase power enters each controller through separable connectors. The motor is wired to terminals in the controller. Motor control centers provide wire ways for field control and power cables.|$|R
