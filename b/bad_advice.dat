5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took <b>bad</b> <b>advice</b> from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E

A 45-track box set of Nirvana rarities was scheduled for release in October 2001. However, shortly before the release date, Love filed a suit to dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new Nirvana material until the case was resolved. Love contended that Cobain was the band, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she signed the partnership agreement originally under <b>bad</b> <b>advice.</b> Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.|$|E

5|$|According to Carroll family tradition, Powis {{told his}} new clerk that he {{believed}} King James was receiving <b>bad</b> <b>advice</b> related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis {{was concerned about the}} consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven for English Catholics and other religious minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.|$|E

25|$|Another {{foil for}} Ralph is Alice's mother, who is even sharper-tongued than her daughter. She despises Ralph {{as a bad}} provider.

Alice's sister, Agnes, appeared in one episode (Ralph jeopardizes his newlywed sister-in-law's marriage after giving some <b>bad</b> <b>advice</b> to the groom, but all works out in the end). Ralph and Alice lived with her mother for six years after getting married before they got their own apartment. Ralph's mother rarely is mentioned, although she does appear in one episode. Ralph's father is only mentioned in one episode ("Young Man with a Horn") as having given Ralph a cornet he learned to play as a boy, and insists on keeping when Alice suggests it be thrown away. In a 1967 revival, Ralph refers to Alice (played by Sheila MacRae 1966–70 and once more in 1973) as being one of 12 children with her father never working.|$|E

50|$|Dexter {{was born}} in Malden, Massachusetts. He had little {{schooling}} {{and worked as a}} farm laborer at the age of 8. When he was 16, he became an apprentice to a leather-dresser. In 1769, he moved to Newburyport, Massachusetts. He married Elizabeth Frothingham, a rich widow, and bought a mansion. Some of his social contemporaries considered him unintelligent.

25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to be pleased with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him <b>bad</b> <b>advice</b> out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E
25|$|Those five former {{officers}} were Geoff Sims, Steve Schaefer, Dave Cook, Rich Mann, and Rod Keeling, {{the head of}} the new governing body that was the ABA company pilot who rose to the rank of Vice President of Marketing. Previous to the piloting position with the ABA, he had no experience with BMX racing. Mr. Keeling had departed the ABA on March 2, 1984 and announced the creation of the new governing body on March 23, 1984. Some thought the creation of the USBA was timed {{to take advantage of the}} ABA's financial dire straits and to cause a stampede of ABA tracks to change affiliation to the new organization. Mennenga saw it as a personal betrayal to the point that he called a press conference to denounce them. He charged at that press conference that it was they who had given him <b>bad</b> <b>advice</b> to take a hard, uncompromising line against the track owners, the racers, and the BMX press. His basic charge was that their collective advice was deliberate sabotage to undermine the ABA so they could make this move to set up their own governing body and destroy the ABA. This was a tactic not unknown to Mennenga. During a 1981 dispute with the promoters of the large-pursed ($10,000) Knott's Berry Farm race, the ABA bristled at being scheduled directly opposite, i.e. on the same Thanksgiving weekend as, their prestigious Grand National in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. That it was sanctioned by the NBL, being run under NBL rules and racers received national points at that race as they would at a national created directly by the NBL, exacerbated already raw feelings between the NBL and the ABA. The ABA felt it was a deliberate action to siphon off racers, particularly the pros from their season-ending Grand National. The hiring by the Knott's Berry promoter Thomas Henn of former NBA founder and President Ernie Alexander to run the race (he also designed the temporary track at Knott's) didn't help matters. Alexander had a reputation of deliberately scheduling NBA events against the events of other sanctioning bodies when he ran the NBA. Mennenga sent out press releases and faxes to the BMX press, track operators and bicycle manufactures allegedly hinting that they should boycott persons and organizations that participated in the Knott's Berry race. The ABA allegedly had a boycott list that had many notables of the BMX industry on it, including promoter Renny Roker, which the ABA ordered tracks to boycott his upcoming Pro seven race series that would later come to be known as the ESPN Pro Spectacular. Several ABA tracks left the ABA and joined Roker to participate in his series which were to be NBL sanctioned. With this siege mentality in his background it was easy for Mennenga to believe that USBA stole the valuable ABA membership records to proposition ABA racers to join the USBA. While the value of this list would be a motive to steal it, Mennenga provided no evidence.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} economists' {{understanding}} of the basic determinants of trade patterns and, in particular, on {{the manner in which}} these underlying factors change over time and are affected by various policies. A brief survey contrasts the determinants of the structure of trade emphasized by the Ricardian, Heckscher-Ohlin, and imperfect competition models and discusses how well the predictions of these various theories are supported by empirical evidence. The main conclusion of the survey is that trade economists have been reasonably successful in explaining the structure of trade at any point in time but much less successful in understanding how the determinants of the patterns of trade change over time. This inability to explain how the basic determinants of the structure of trade change over time can lead both to poor predictions and <b>bad</b> policy <b>advice.</b> Given the increased interest in long-term shifts in trading structures, it is argued that trade economists should enlarge their analytical framework by endogenizing to a greater extent the basic economic factors determining these shifts. They must also recognize the endogenous nature of trade policies in their models, if they are to carry out their predictive and evaluative roles in the best possible manner. ...|$|R
