5|$|The RAF had {{initially}} planned on a buy of 150 trainers; however, {{with both the}} BAC TSR-2 tactical strike aircraft and Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL fighter cancelled, the RAF were looking increasingly hard at their future light strike needs and realizing that they now needed more than just advanced trainers with some secondary counter insurgency capability. The RAF's strike line-up {{was at this point}} intended to consist of American General Dynamics F-111s plus the AFVG for lighter strike purposes. There was concern that both F-111 and AFVG were high risk projects and with the French already planning on a strike role for the Jaguar, there was an opportunity to introduce a serious <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> for the RAF's future strike needs – the Jaguar. As a result, by October1970, the RAF's requirements had changed to 165 single-seat strike aircraft and 35 trainers.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005 PacifiCorp {{filed an}} appeal of FERC's 1991 license {{rejection}} under the Bush administration's 2005 energy bill, which allows power producers to challenge licensing requirements retroactively. PacifiCorp explained the appeal as a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> in case decommissioning application failed.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 1984, Thatcher {{convened a}} ministerial meeting to {{consider}} declaring {{a state of}} emergency, with the option to use 4,500 military drivers and 1,650 tipper trucks to keep coal supplies available. This <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> was not needed and was not implemented.|$|E

The {{current status}} of the VCSEL failures, the {{up-to-date}} results in searching for the failure cause, experiences gained in the searching process, possible <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> for the optical transmitters and the lessons learned are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Tandy 2000 was marketed {{through early}} 1988 with continual price cuts. Eventually they were closed out for $999 and the {{remaining}} unsold computers were converted into the first Radio Shack Terminals (which, coincidentally, {{had been one of}} the <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> for the original TRS-80 Model I).|$|R
50|$|Business {{continuity}} planning {{may also}} feed {{off of the}} emergency procedures, enabling an organization to identify points of vulnerability and minimise the risk to the business by preparing <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> and improving resilience. The act of producing the procedures may also highlight failings in current arrangements that if corrected, could reduce the risk levels.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, Alphin founded Omnipotent Investment {{with two}} classmates from high school. Omnipotent {{was a real}} estate {{investment}} firm, which Alphin considered a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> to professional football at the time. Omnipotent Investment was led by one of its co-founders until it folded in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutor-General Monteiro {{said that}} Reinado's group had {{initially}} intended to merely kidnap Ramos-Horta and Gusmão, {{but that this}} plan had failed {{and that they had}} therefore switched to their <b>backup</b> <b>plan.</b> Meanwhile, Araújo said that the government would engage in no further dialogue with the rebels and that there was an arrest warrant for Salsinha.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the Israeli Southern Command began {{implementing}} its <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> {{should the}} 8th Brigade {{fail to take}} 'Auja, and sent some of the Negev Brigade forces that participated in the Battle of Bir 'Asluj to the area. This {{despite the fact that}} the 8th Brigade had prepared for this eventuality and had a plan to defend itself against an Egyptian counterattack. The 9th Battalion of the Negev Brigade set out to capture the Egyptian positions between Bir Thamila and 'Auja, but encountered no resistance.|$|E
50|$|If the infiltrating {{party is}} to be met by local supporters, there must be pre-agreed {{recognition}} signals. Should the infiltrators {{not be able to}} find their local contacts, they should have a variety of <b>backup</b> <b>plans,</b> ranging from establishing a clandestine base and waiting for contact, or to be recovered by their own side.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mobile phone}} must be {{carried by the}} user, charged, and kept in range of a {{cellular}} network whenever authentication might be necessary. If the phone is unable to display messages, such as if it becomes damaged or shuts down for an update or due to temperature extremes (e.g. winter exposure), access is often impossible without <b>backup</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R
50|$|All teams but Sacramento {{used the}} same home stadiums as in 2011; the Mountain Lions moved to the Triple-A {{baseball}} stadium (Raley Field) of the Sacramento franchise of the Pacific Coast League, the Sacramento River Cats. In addition, the Las Vegas Locomotives also negotiated <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> with Cashman Field in Las Vegas, although the team was able to play its first two home games at Sam Boyd Stadium.|$|R
25|$|Techno's {{impersonation}} of Ogre {{ended when}} Scourge of the Underworld stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his {{body from the}} inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again {{to allow him to}} construct a new body. However, his <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> worked, and his consciousness was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially amnesiac of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.|$|E
25|$|Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation {{department}} {{implemented a}} <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> (of supervisors and military air controllers) {{to keep the}} system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{staff were}} placed on duty in the control room. Eurotunnel's policy of {{attempting}} to drive trains through the tunnel {{in the event of}} an on-board fire with a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> of uncoupling the locomotive and amenity coach and driving out were abandoned and replaced by plans to bring trains to a controlled stop and evacuate the occupants into the service tunnel. Liaison between Eurotunnel and emergency services was improved with joint exercises and exchanges of personnel between the British and French fire brigades, so that each had experience with the other's operational procedures. Communications were also improved.|$|E
40|$|The {{last thirty}} years of {{computing}} has resulted in many people being heavily dependent on digital data. Meanwhile, {{there has been a}} significant change in the patterns of data storage and of processing. Despite the many risks involved in data management, there is a dearth of guidance and support for individuals and small organisations. A generic risk assessment is presented, resulting in practicable <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> that are applicable to the needs of those categories of IT user...|$|R
50|$|The Hartford Colonials of the United Football League, in {{part because}} of a change of {{management}} at Rentschler Field, experienced significant delays in renewing their lease for the 2011 season and had <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> to relocate to Dillon Stadium (or Willow Brook Park), although neither venue was believed to be ideal for the UFL. The Colonials did sign a deal with Rentschler in June, but suspended operations on August 10, 2011; the league later folded it outright.|$|R
50|$|As weeks passed, Ava was distraught to {{know that}} her plan had failed, but she had <b>backup</b> <b>plans.</b> Ava was later artificially inseminated and decided to pass the baby off as Bills. Although she was {{committed}} to starting a life with Bill, Ava began {{falling in love with}} Remy Boudreau, and, enjoying feeling carefree and open with him, made love to him in the Spaulding Mansion, where she and Bill had moved when Dinah Marler stole the property from Alan.|$|R
25|$|After this, data {{is output}} in PHP format (compiled with HipHop for PHP). The backend {{is written in}} Java and Thrift is used as the {{messaging}} format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are {{used to make the}} web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.|$|E
25|$|Hoffman {{had already}} confronted Poulson and {{convinced}} her {{to side with}} him against Winston and NURV. When {{it becomes clear that}} Hoffman has not succeeded, a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> is put into motion by Poulson, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and the incorruptible internal security firm hired by NURV. As Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, the second team successfully usurps one of NURV's own work centers—"Building 21"—and transmits the incriminating evidence as well as the Synapse code. Calighan, Winston and his entourage are publicly arrested for their crimes. After parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks.|$|E
25|$|Another {{strategy}} Blackwell devised {{was aimed}} at constitutional conventions. In 1889 when the territories of North Dakota, Montana, and Washington began drafting state constitutions for entry into the Union, the AWSA mobilized to press for inclusion of woman suffrage. But Blackwell realized the chances for success were slim and devised a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> – persuading pro-suffrage delegates, if and when it became apparent a suffrage provision would fail, {{to push for a}} clause that would enable a future state legislature to extend suffrage to women by statute. Blackwell obtained endorsements for the strategy from leading politicians and judges in other states, traveled to the constitutional conventions, lobbied their leaders, got his resolution introduced, and was given a hearing at each one. Though the effort failed, North Dakota and Montana came very close to adopting it.|$|E
50|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{discovers that}} without Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), NBC is putting TGS on a forced hiatus. However, when she passes {{on the news}} to the cast and crew, they all assume that the show will be {{cancelled}} and turn to their <b>backup</b> <b>plans,</b> leading Liz to wonder about her own. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is forced to hire his nemesis Devon Banks in order to turn around his disastrous acquisition of TWINKS, a network for gay men.|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{is made of}} ways of using near-term technologies for direct and semidirect manned Mars missions. A notable feature of the present schemes is the in situ propellant production of CH 4 /O 2 and H 2 O on the Martian surface {{in order to reduce}} surface consumable and return propellant requirements. Medium-energy conjunction class trajectories are shown to be optimal for such missions. Attention is given to the <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> and abort philosophy of these missions. Either the Russian Energia B or U. S. Saturn VII launch vehicles may be used...|$|R
50|$|Studies show {{hardware}} failure and human error {{are the two}} most common causes of data loss, accounting for roughly three quarters of all incidents. Another cause of data loss is a natural disaster, which is a greater risk dependant on where the hardware is located. While the probability of data loss due to natural disaster is small, the only way to prepare for such an event is to store backup data in a separate physical location. As such, the best <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> always include at least one copy being stored off-site.|$|R
25|$|Saddened by Gant's death, Schofield {{attempts}} {{to commit suicide}} but is stopped by Mother. in the meantime, the President of the U.S. gives all of the U.S. Armed Forces' resources to Schofield to neutralize {{the threat posed by}} the ships. He then directs certain ships to be sunk using torpedoes. At the same time, Fairfax and Book II are flown to different ships so that Schofield can disable all of the missiles at the same time. Schofield succeeds in disabling the missiles, but Mother is presumed to have perished. Schofield later learns that there is a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> and a missile is heading right for Mecca {{on the first day of}} Ramadan. Schofield is able to deactivate the missile but in turn, M-12 captures Schofield, Rufus, and Knight.|$|E
25|$|Morrison's first title {{defense was}} {{scheduled}} against Mike Williams, but when Williams withdrew {{on the night}} of the fight, Tim Tomashek stood in as a replacement. Although Tomashek had been prepared to fight as a <b>backup</b> <b>plan,</b> some news reports created the impression that he had just been pulled out of the crowd. The WBO later rescinded their sanctioning of this fight due to Tomashek's lack of experience. Almost immediately, talks of a fight with WBC champion Lennox Lewis began, but were halted when virtually unknown Michael Bentt upset Morrison in his next bout. Bentt knocked Morrison down three times, and the fight was stopped in the first round in front of a live HBO Boxing audience. Morrison recovered by winning three bouts in a row in 1994, but his last fight of the year, against Ross Puritty, ended with a draw.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} alongside another Sonic {{game for the}} Sega Saturn, known as Sonic X-treme, which was stuck in development hell. While Sonic 3D Blast was created for the Genesis as a swan song for Sonic on the system, Sega also commissioned a port for the Saturn as a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> in case X-treme could not be released, a plan that was moved forward on upon the cancellation of X-Treme in 1996. Sonic 3D Blast received mixed reviews from critics, who generally disliked its isometric gameplay but praised its visuals and music. The game was later ported in 1997 to Microsoft Windows computers and re-released on numerous Sonic themed compilations and digital distribution platforms. A similarly titled game, Sonic Blast, was released in the same month for Sega's Game Gear handheld console, though the games had different gameplay, plot, and a separate development team.|$|E
50|$|The Hartford Colonials, in {{part because}} of a change of {{management}} at Rentschler Field, experienced significant delays in renewing their lease with the stadium and had <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> to relocate to another lower-cost stadium such as Dillon Stadium or one of the two stadiums at Willow Brook Park (New Britain Stadium or Veterans Stadium) if an agreement could not be reached, although both of these stadiums are believed to be less than ideal for the UFL. The UFL reached an agreement with the operators of Rentschler Field in late June 2011 before deciding to suspend the franchise outright.|$|R
50|$|On November 7, 2008, ALMA {{announced}} {{on its website}} that it was ceasing all operations, effective immediately, citing the global economic crisis, the increase in fuel prices and the devaluation of the Mexican peso. The airline had not made any <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> for its booked passengers. As a result, all such customers had effectively lost their money unless {{they were willing to}} make a claim to PROFECO, which stated that any such claim could literally take years to resolve. Aeroméxico offered to reprotect passengers, but it charged 999 pesos per segment subject to G class availability.|$|R

25|$|After the Second World War, a Jewish {{group called}} Nakam {{formulated}} several plans to kill Germans in revenge for the Holocaust. Nakam's leader Abba Kovner, a former Lithuanian partisan, {{testified that he}} had approached Weizmann (at that time, President of the World Zionist Organization) with plans for a mass poisoning and that Wiezmann had put him {{in touch with a}} chemist who arranged for a quantity of poison to be procured. According to the story, Kovner did not tell Weizmann of his intention to poison millions of Germans via their water supply, but only of the <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> to poison SS members who were in allied POW camps. The lesser plan was put into operation in April 1946 at Stalag 13. Kovner's story was repeated in 1998 by another Nakam leader Yulik Harmatz. There is no independent evidence for the meeting and some historians doubt it. Kovner's biographer Dina Porat wrote that Weizmann was not in Palestine on the date of the alleged meeting but allows that he might have met Weizmann in early 1946 instead.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{the present}} after the nuclear strike on Cascade Falls, Parker and Webb regroup with stragglers and soon reunite with Sawyer, whereupon they learn of news that the People's Republic of China has {{declared}} its intention to enter the war as a Soviet ally. The U.S. President, learning that a Chinese invasion fleet has been launched to reinforce the Soviet beachhead in Seattle, orders all US forces in Washington to spearhead an assault to recapture the city, while also ordering a nuclear strike against the city, as a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> should this fail. Sawyer, desperate to avoid another Cascade Falls, orders his forces to attack before the Chinese can land, refusing to back down. After successfully breaking through the Soviet Army's defense perimeter around Seattle, and capturing Puget Sound to secure Soviet anti-ship missile launchers for use against the Chinese fleet, the reinforced US battalions launch their counterattack. While Webb is injured during the conflict, Sawyer and Parker manage to hold out in the battle, effectively ensuring that the US forces retake Seattle from the Soviets before the Chinese fleet arrives. Dealt a decisive blow by {{the outcome of the}} battle and unable to launch an amphibious assault of their own, the fleet consequently returns to China. As American soldiers rest from the intense battle since the invasion, Sawyer states that the war isn't over, and that they may still be recalled to fight in other theatres.|$|E
25|$|Agrippa's {{friendship}} with Augustus {{seems to have}} been clouded by the jealousy of Augustus' nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus, which was probably instigated by the intrigues of Livia, the third wife of Augustus, who feared his influence over her husband. Traditionally it is said the result of such jealousy was that Agrippa left Rome, ostensibly to take over the governorship of eastern provinces – a sort of honourable exile, but he only sent his legate to Syria, while he himself remained at Lesbos and governed by proxy, though he may have been on a secret mission to negotiate with the Parthians about the return of the Roman legions standards which they held. On the death of Marcellus, which took place within a year of his exile, he was recalled to Rome by Augustus, who found he could not dispense with his services. However, if one places the events {{in the context of the}} crisis in 23 BC it seems unlikely that, when facing significant opposition and about to make a major political climb down, the emperor Augustus would place a man in exile in charge of the largest body of Roman troops. What is far more likely is that Agrippa's 'exile' was actually the careful political positioning of a loyal lieutenant in command of a significant army as a <b>backup</b> <b>plan</b> in case the settlement plans of 23 BC failed and Augustus needed military support. Moreover, after 23 BC as part of what became known as Augustus' Second Constitutional Settlement, Agrippa's constitutional powers were greatly increased to provide the Principate of Augustus with greater constitutional stability by providing for a political heir or replacement for Augustus if he were to succumb to his habitual ill health or was assassinated. In the course of the year proconsular imperium, similar to Augustus' power, was conferred upon Agrippa for five years. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That was to come later, as was the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas, or powers of a tribune of the plebeians. These great powers of state are not usually heaped upon a former exile.|$|E
40|$|Hayabusa {{asteroid}} explorer successfully {{released the}} sample capsule to Australia on June 13, 2010. Since the Earth reentry phase of sample return was critical, many <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> for predicting the landing location were prepared. This paper investigates the reentry dispersion using ground based optical observation {{as a backup}} observation for radiometric observation. Several scenarios are calculated and compared for the reentry phase of the Hayabusa to evaluate the navigation accuracy of the ground-based observation. The optical observation doesn't require any active reaction from a spacecraft, thus these results show that optical observations could be a steady backup strategy even if a spacecraft had some trouble. We also evaluate the landing dispersion of the Hayabusa only with the optical observation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} how Okayama English Village 2014 events were {{programmed}} and conducted, focusing particularly {{on how they}} were improved {{in line with the}} results of the questionnaires written by the participating pupils of the previous Okayama English Village held in 2013. It also discusses how the events were evaluated by the participants and instructors/assisting staff and then proposes how they can be further improved. According to the evaluations, the events in 2014 were successfully conducted, but there are still several points that should be improved for the subsequent years. Among these are: ・to plan the activities giving more consideration to the participants English abilities, physical conditions, and <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> for bad weather; ・to plan the whole event so as to let the pupils speak more English, desirably between themselves...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{creating}} backups {{of valuable}} computer data has been arduous, tedious, and time consuming {{for the average}} computer user. The increasing concern of encrypting sensitive information has added another layer of complexity to the process. The challenge is creating a single product that encrypts and backs up data on an automated schedule. Likewise, it must decrypt and restore the data with ease. To specifically address this problem, the Cryptic Backup daemon was developed. The daemon schedules and automatically runs <b>backup</b> <b>plans</b> based on user preferences. To demonstrate {{the power of the}} daemon, the Cryptic Backup client application was developed. The client application provides a graphical interface, allowing the user {{to take advantage of the}} functionality the daemon provides. The result is a Cryptic Backup suite that is highly versatile, reliable, and more than capable of fulfilling the encrypted backup needs of the average computer user...|$|R
