The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner.</b> , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.|$|E

25|$|Arklow, Ireland has a {{long history}} of ship-owning. According to local tradition, it extends back to the export of tin and copper by the Phoenicians. The fleet was locally owned, managed, {{mastered}} and manned. Each ship was an individual enterprise, each divided into 64 shares. A captain would probably have a 25% interest in his ship: that is 16 shares. The owner listed in documents was the managing owner, not necessarily the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner.</b> The Arklow shipowners cooperated: they established their own mutual insurance company. A century ago, ownership became concentrated. In 1966 Tyrrell and Hall formed an umbrella company to operate their ships: Arklow Shipping. By November 2011 they had a modern fleet of about 45 ships.|$|E
500|$|Two similar {{techniques}} to provide anonymity for a ship's <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> are [...] "nominee shareholders" [...] and [...] "nominee directors." [...] In some jurisdictions that require shareholder identities to be reported, a loophole may exist where the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> may appoint a nominee {{to be the}} shareholder, and that nominee cannot legally be compelled to reveal {{the identity of the}} <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner.</b> All corporations are required to have at least one director, however many jurisdictions allow this to be a nominee director. A nominee director's name would appear on all corporate paperwork in place of the beneficial owners, and like nominee shareholders, few jurisdictions can compel a nominee director to divulge the identity of beneficial owners. To further complicate matters, some jurisdictions allow a corporation to fulfill the duties of a nominee director.|$|E

500|$|The OECD report {{concludes that}} the use of bearer shares is [...] "perhaps the single most {{important}} (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism" [...] to protect the anonymity of a ship's <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner.</b> Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.|$|E
500|$|Actual owners may {{establish}} shell {{corporations to}} be the legal owners of their ships, making it difficult, if not impossible, to track who is the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> of the ship. The 2004 Report of the UN Secretary General’s Consultative Group on Flag State Implementation reported that [...] "It is very easy, and comparatively inexpensive, to establish a complex web of corporate entities to provide very effective cover to the identities of beneficial owners {{who do not want}} to be known." [...] According to a 2003 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report entitled [...] "Ownership and Control of Ships", these corporate structures are often multi-layered, spread across numerous jurisdictions, and make the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> [...] "almost impenetrable" [...] to law enforcement officials and taxation. The report concludes that [...] "regardless of the reasons why the cloak of anonymity is made available, if it is provided it will also assist those who may wish to remain hidden because they engage in illegal or criminal activities, including terrorists." ...|$|E

2500|$|Depending on {{the legal}} venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of {{reliability}} of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by {{the presentation of the}} evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest. [...] For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).|$|E
2500|$|Where {{there are}} mutual debts between {{the company and}} any of its {{creditors}} when the company goes into winding-up then those debts will set-off.

[...] Mutual debts are only capable of being set-off if each party is the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> of each debt (set-off is not available where the debt is owed to one person as agent for another, or where the debt has been assigned or secured in favour of a third party).|$|E
2500|$|US equities, {{corporate}} and municipal bonds can be issued in certificated form, though this practice {{has been largely}} replaced due to the costs and inefficiencies of keeping them. Rather holdings are kept as [...] "immobilized" [...] or [...] "street name", with the beneficial owners keeping them in accounts at broker-dealers and banks, {{just as they do}} for currencies. DTCC uses a nominee firm, Cede & Co., in whose name a share certificate is held in the DTCC vaults. Each day DTCC reconciles with the relevant transfer agent the number of shares held in its accounts for its member banks and broker-dealers. In turn, other banks and broker-dealers hold accounts with DTCC member firms, creating a chain of ownership down to the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|E

When, for instance, a capitalist invests £20,000 in his business, and draws from it an income of (suppose) £2,000 a year, the common impression is {{as if he were the}} <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> both of the £20,000 and of the £2,000, while the laborers own nothing but their wages. The truth, however, is that he only obtains the £2,000 on condition of applying no part of the £20,000 to his own use. He has the legal control over it, and might squander it if he chose, but if he did he would not have the £2,000 a year also. For all personal purposes they have the capital and he has but the profits, which it only yields to him on condition that the capital itself is employed in satisfying not his own wants, but those of laborers. Even of his own share a small part only belongs to him as the owner of capital. The portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money, since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes to production nothing except the capital itself.|$|E
60|$|Another {{point on}} {{which there is}} much misapprehension {{on the part of}} Socialists, as well as of Trades Unionists and other partisans of Labor against Capital, relates to the {{proportions}} in which the produce of the country is really shared and the amount of what is actually diverted from those who produce it, to enrich other persons. I forbear for the present to speak of the land, which is a subject apart. But with respect to capital employed in business, there is in the popular notions a great deal of illusion. When, for instance, a capitalist invests £20,000 in his business, and draws from it an income of (suppose) £2,000 a year, the common impression is as if he was the <b>beneficial</b> <b>owner</b> both of the £20,000 and of the £2,000, while the laborers own nothing but their wages. The truth, however, is, that he only obtains the £2,000 on condition of applying no part of the £20,000 to his own use. He has the legal control over it, and might squander it if he chose, but if he did he would not have the £2,000 a year also. As long as he derives an income from his capital he has not the option of withholding it from the use of others. As much of his invested capital as consists of buildings, machinery, and other instruments of production, are applied to production and are not applicable to the support or enjoyment of any one. What is so applicable (including what is laid out in keeping up or renewing the buildings and instruments) is paid away to laborers, forming their remuneration and their share in the division of the produce. For all personal purposes they have the capital and he has but the profits, which it only yields to him on condition that the capital itself is employed in satisfying not his own wants, but those of laborers. The proportion which the profits of capital usually bear to capital itself (or rather to the circulating portion of it) is the ratio which the capitalist's share of the produce bears to the aggregate share of the laborers. Even of his own share a small part only belongs to him as the owner of capital. The portion of the produce which falls to capital merely as capital is measured by the interest of money, since that is all that the owner of capital obtains when he contributes nothing to production except the capital itself. Now the interest of capital in the public funds, which are considered to be the best security, is at the present prices (which have not varied much for many years) about three and one-third per cent. Even in this investment there is some little risk--risk of repudiation, risk of being obliged to sell out at a low price in some commercial crisis.|$|E
