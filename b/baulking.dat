He finished third in the AFL Coaches Association best young player award and won the emerging talent award at Adelaide.|$|E
2500|$|He {{would not}} {{finish in the}} points again until coming second at the Austrian Grand Prix, despite taking pole three more times in the {{intervening}} period. (His determination to take pole at the Monaco Grand Prix had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately <b>baulking</b> the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, though the accusations would continue in Canada when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time). Two more podiums followed in the Netherlands and Italy, before Senna added his second victory, again in wet conditions, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. Senna's relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham {{at the end of}} the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian. [...] Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points in the quick but unreliable 97T. In terms of qualifying, however, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field: his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Renault's V6 qualifying engines were reported to be producing over [...] ).|$|E

More conventional track forms were later used, although <b>baulk</b> road could still be seen in sidings {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century.|$|R

Converting broad gauge <b>baulk</b> road to standard was done by cutting the transoms and slewing the longitudinal and its rail to its new position. Between 1852 and 1892 an ever-increasing length of the Great Western Railway had been laid as mixed gauge {{that could be used}} by trains of either gauge. For <b>baulk</b> road this meant laying an additional longitudinal between the existing two (one rail was common to both gauges), but this significantly increased the cost and complexity of the track compared to cross-sleepers.|$|R

Dolores would rather have been a solitary prisoner, able to chafe against oppression, than have been obliged to come down and confront everybody; but she crept into the place left for her between Mysie and Wilfred.
