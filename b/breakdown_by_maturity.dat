40|$|With {{increasing}} {{of obesity}} {{in children and}} adolescents the specialized care services, for the most serious cases, become imperative. Child and Adolescent Obesity Clinic, in the Clinics Hospital/Unicamp give assistance to patients between 03 and 19 years, with BMI≥percentile 95 of the CDC curve. This assistance involves physicians, nutritionists, psychologists and physical educators. For orientation of physical activities and its follow-up an effort test is used, the 2 ̆ 2 go-and-come 2 ̆ 2 test (Course-Navette), wich was proposed by Leger and Lembert (1982 - 1988). Children maturity was classified according to criteria of pubescence of Tanner (1962). Subjects: 33 boys, aged between 7 and 18 years old. The values of VO 2 max (ml/kg/min- 1) were distributed in average and Standard Deviation, <b>by</b> age and <b>maturity.</b> There is a greater result oscillation in the <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> age, and a further drop in the classification values <b>by</b> <b>maturity</b> in VO 2 max (ml/kg/min- 1). These values tend to fall from the young ones to the older ones, unlike the expected. In the population studied, there is an inversion of the trend of VO 2 max, probably due to children’s obesity habits; the classification <b>by</b> <b>maturity</b> seems to give more reliable results; the test proved to be suitable for use in outpatient service...|$|R
