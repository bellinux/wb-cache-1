5|$|The Martinique macaw was scientifically {{described}} by the British banker and zoologist Walter Rothschild in 1905, as a new species of the genus Anodorhynchus, A. martinicus. The taxon was solely based on a 1630s account by Père Jacques <b>Bouton</b> of blue and orange-yellow macaws from the Lesser Antillean island of Martinique. Rothschild reclassified the species as Ara martinicus in his 1907 book, Extinct Birds, which also contained a restoration of the bird by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans. The reassignment lead to confusion as recently as 2001, when Williams and Steadman assumed the two names were meant to refer to separate birds. The Martinique amazon (Amazona martinicana) of the same island, was also based solely on a contemporary description.|$|E

We generated transgenic fruit flies that express a novel green fluorescent membrane protein at the postsynaptic specialization, allowing for repeated noninvasive confocal imaging of synapses in live, developing larvae. As synapses grow, existing synaptic <b>boutons</b> stretch apart and new <b>boutons</b> insert between them; in addition, new <b>boutons</b> are added {{at the ends}} of existing strings of <b>boutons.</b> Some <b>boutons</b> are added de novo, while others bud from existing <b>boutons.</b> New branches form as multiple <b>boutons</b> bud from existing <b>boutons.</b> Nascent <b>boutons</b> contain active zones, T bars, and synaptic vesicles; we observe no specialized growth structures.

Using electron microscopic reconstructions, we estimated that a pyramidal cell body receives synapses from about 60 and 140 synaptic terminals in the CA 1 and CA 3 area, respectively. About 60 % of these terminals were PV positive, whereas 35 - 40 % of them were CB 1 positive. Only about 1 % (CA 1) and 4 % (CA 3) of the somatic <b>boutons</b> were negative for both markers. Using fluorescent labeling, we showed {{that most of the}} CB 1 -positive terminals expressed vesicular glutamate transporter 3. Reconstruction of somatic <b>boutons</b> revealed that although their volumes are similar, CB 1 -positive <b>boutons</b> are more flat and the total volume of their mitochondria was smaller than that of PV-positive <b>boutons.</b> Both types of <b>boutons</b> contain dense-core vesicles and frequently formed multiple release sites on their targets and innervated an additional soma or dendrite as well. PV-positive <b>boutons</b> possessed small, macular synapses; whereas the total synaptic area of CB 1 -positive <b>boutons</b> was larger and formed multiple irregular-shaped synapses. Axo-axonic <b>boutons</b> were smaller than somatic <b>boutons,</b> had only one synapse and their ultrastructural parameters were closer to those of PV-positive somatic <b>boutons.</b> Our results represent the first quantitative measurement-using a highly reliable method-of the contribution of different cell types to the perisomatic innervation of pyramidal neurons, and may help to explain functional differences in their output properties...|$|R

5|$|What <b>Bouton</b> {{described}} {{is likely}} to remain a mystery, but various theories have been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, and may have been the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown. Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw, as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which {{was supposed to have been}} collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the tail of a dove.|$|E

40|$|The {{subcellular}} morphology of the mesencephalic trigeminal (Me 5) nucleus in the rat was {{studied by}} transmission electron microscopy. Most neurons {{in the thin}} rostral {{as well as in}} the major caudal part of Me 5 appeared as large (40 - 50 -mu-m), round-to ovoid-shaped unipolar cells. A few neurons (estimated 5 %) appeared to be multipolar, dsually bipolar. The Me 5 neurons had a large, round, centrally located nucleus, and their cytoplasm was characterized by a dense network of lamellar granular endoplasmic reticulum, an abundant Golgi apparatus, many mitochondria and neurofilaments suggesting very active cells with a high rate of synthesis and axoplasmatic transport. Numerous small spinous processes covered the surface of the Me 5 neurons. Clustering of 2 or 3 cells was accomplished by maculae, i. e. zones of gap junctions and close cell appositions. <b>Boutons</b> contacting the soma of Me 5 neurons and <b>boutons</b> contacting large and small dendrites were defined as axosomatic and axodendritic synapses, respectively. Four types of synaptic <b>boutons</b> were distinguished: (1) S <b>boutons,</b> with round vesicles and asymmetrical as well as symmetrical synapses, (2) F <b>boutons,</b> with pleomorphic admixture of flattened and spherical vesicles and asymmetrical synapses, (3) P <b>boutons,</b> which resembled the F-type <b>boutons</b> but contained predominantly spherical vesicles and symmetrical synapses, and (4) G <b>boutons,</b> characterized by a heterogeneous population of vesicles.

40|$|AbstractThe glutamatergic {{neuromuscular synapse}} in Drosophila forms and differentiates into {{distinct}} <b>boutons</b> in the embryo and grows by sprouting new <b>boutons</b> throughout larval life. We demonstrate that two axons form ∼ 18 <b>boutons</b> on muscles 7 and 6 by hatching and grow to ∼ 180 <b>boutons</b> by third instar. We further show that, after synapse formation, the homophilic {{cell adhesion molecule}} Fasciclin II (Fas II) is localized both pre- and postsynaptically where it controls synapse stabilization. In FasII null mutants, synapse formation is normal, but <b>boutons</b> then retract during larval development. Synapse elimination and resulting lethality are rescued by transgenes that drive Fas II expression both pre- and postsynaptically; driving Fas II expression on either side alone is insufficient. Fas II can also control synaptic growth; various FasII alleles lead to either an increase or decrease in sprouting, depending upon the level of Fas II...|$|R
40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are a {{collection}} of interconnected subcortical nuclei involved in movement, association, motivation and reward processing. Two populations of neurons that play critical roles in the basal ganglia are dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and neurons of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). To define the afferent input to these neurons, which ultimately controls their activity, quantitative immunocytochemical analyses of afferent synaptic terminals was carried out at the electron microscopic level in rat. Glutamatergic afferents from cortical and subcortical sources were identified using antibodies against vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluT 1 and 2 respectively). In the SN, dopaminergic neurons were labelled using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In {{the analysis of the}} STN, additional populations of afferent terminals were labelled using antibodies against vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and TH. Synapses were also categorised {{on the basis of their}} membrane specializations into type- 1 (putatively excitatory) and type- 2 (putatively inhibitory). In the SN, differences in the ratio of type- 1 and 2 synapses were seen between two functional sub-regions (pars compacta: SNc and pars reticulata: SNr). Dopaminergic dendrites in the SNc receive equal innervation from <b>boutons</b> forming type- 1 and 2 synapses (53 % vs 47 %), whereas dopaminergic dendrites in the SNr receive mainly type- 2 synapses (73 % vs 27 %). Type- 1 synaptic <b>boutons</b> included both VGluT 1 - and VGluT 2 -positive <b>boutons</b> in the SNc, meaning cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic neurons directly innervate dopaminergic neurons of the SNc. In the SNr only VGluT 2 -positive <b>boutons</b> were detected suggesting that SNr dendrites only receive sub-cortical glutamate. However, a large proportion of <b>boutons</b> forming type- 1 synapses were not labelled (~ 40 % of type- 1 synaptic <b>boutons)</b> suggesting other transmitters provide a large amount of innervation to these neurons. In the STN type- 1 and 2 synapses provided roughly equal innervation of dendrites. The <b>boutons</b> forming type- 1 synapses were almost entirely either VGluT 1 - or VGluT 2 -positive <b>boutons</b> (98 %) indicating that STN neurons receive input from both cortical and subcortical glutamatergic neurons. Significantly more <b>boutons</b> were immunolabelled with VGluT 2 compared to VGluT 1 (31 % vs 18 %), showing that subcortical sources provide the majority of glutamatergic input to STN neurons. VGAT-positive synaptic <b>boutons</b> were exclusively type- 2 and made up ~ 89 % of type- 2 synapses, TH-positive <b>boutons</b> comprised only ~ 4 % of total synapses and VAChT-positive <b>boutons</b> were more varied producing both type- 1 and 2 synapses. Type- 1 synapse forming VAChT-positive <b>boutons</b> comprised 4 % of total synapses and type- 2 synapse forming VAChT-positive <b>boutons</b> 6 % of the total innervation. Together this totals over 100 % suggesting at least two of these markers are co-localised within a subgroup of <b>boutons.</b> In conclusion, this study demonstrates that both dopaminergic neurons of the SN and neurons of the STN are under the afferent synaptic control of both cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic neurons as well as GABAergic and other populations of terminals. The quantitative analyses demonstrate differences in the innervation of the different types or sub-types of neurons that likely underlie their functional properties.

40|$|Excitatory layer 4 (L 4) neurons in the ‘barrel field’ {{of the rat}} {{somatosensory}} cortex represent an important component in thalamocortical information processing. However, no detailed information exists concerning the quantitative geometry of synaptic <b>boutons</b> terminating on these neurons. Thus, L 4 synaptic <b>boutons</b> were investigated using serial ultrathin sections and subsequent quantitative 3 D reconstructions. In particular, parameters representing structural correlates of synaptic transmission and plasticity such as the number, size and distribution of pre- and postsynaptic densities forming the active zone (AZ) and of the three functionally defined pools of synaptic vesicles were analyzed. L 4 synaptic <b>boutons</b> varied substantially in shape and size; the majority had a single, but large AZ with opposing pre- and postsynaptic densities that matched perfectly in size and position. More {{than a third of}} the examined <b>boutons</b> showed perforations of the postsynaptic density. Synaptic <b>boutons</b> contained on average a total pool of 561 ± 108 vesicles, with ~ 5 % constituting the putative readily releasable, ~ 23 % the recycling, and the remainder the reserve pool. These pools are comparably larger than other characterized central synapses. Synaptic complexes were surrounded by a dense network of fine astrocytic processes that reached as far as the synaptic cleft, thus regulating the temporal and spatial glutamate concentration, and thereby shaping the unitary EPSP amplitude. In summary, the geometry and size of AZs, the comparably large readily releasable and recycling pools, together with the tight astrocytic ensheathment, may explain and contribute to the high release probability, efficacy and modulation of synaptic transmission at excitatory L 4 synaptic <b>boutons.</b> Moreover, the structural variability as indicated by the geometry of L 4 synaptic <b>boutons,</b> the presence of mitochondria and the size and shape of the AZs strongly suggest that synaptic reliability, strength and plasticity is governed and modulated individually at excitatory L 4 synaptic <b>boutons...</b>|$|R

Interatrial septa from four animals were double-labelled immunohistochemically for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the marker of synaptic vesicles synaptophysin (SYP). One hundred intracardiac neurons were analysed by confocal microscopy. Terminals of preganglionic axons were strongly positive for ChAT, while synaptic <b>boutons</b> were strongly positive for both ChAT and SYP. The number of synaptic <b>boutons</b> per neuron ranged from 2 to 121 and was 10 ± 2 (mean±SE). The total area of synaptic <b>boutons</b> ranged from 6 μm 2 to 270 μm 2 and was 98 ± 6 μm 2. The largest total area of synaptic <b>boutons</b> was found on the axonal half of neuronal soma (59 ± 4 μm 2). The total areas of synaptic <b>boutons</b> on both the non-axonal half of soma and the proximal axon were smaller (36 ± 3 μm 2; 6 ± 2 μm 2; P< 0. 001).

25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic <b>bouton</b> showed that the <b>bouton</b> experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E
