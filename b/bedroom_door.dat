5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> at the Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated {{into the room}} as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> and called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Never mind, Wilmet,' said Felix {{at their}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> that night. 'Remember, Father {{never was a}} man for all work and no play.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dazed, I {{watched her}} open the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors,</b> motion to Lindy to pass through, {{and then she}} had closed them again and I was alone in the darkened parlor.|$|R
5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again {{before returning to the}} restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} still minus their collars and ties when they {{suddenly}} realized that something unusual was taking place downstairs. They had closed the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors,</b> but now all of them rushed out into the hallway.|$|R
60|$|Bearing in {{mind this}} succinct {{description}} of the candidate, Stephen climbed the rickety stairs to the low second story. All the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> were flung open except one, on which the number 7 was inscribed. From within came bursts of uproarious laughter, and a summons to enter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, there's been a {{delivery}} of clean {{clothes from the}} wash to-night, and they're put outside the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> here. If you take notice as we go up, what a very few shirts there are, and what a many fronts, you'll penetrate the mystery of his packing.' ...|$|R
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
6000|$|It {{shall be}} Mr. George's duty to knock {{at all the}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> [...] every morning, three {{quarters}} of {{an hour before the}} time fixed for [...] breakfast; and if he fails to do so, then he shall pay all the [...] fines for tardiness that may be incurred that morning by any of the [...] party.|$|R
50|$|Felix {{lives in}} the house of {{discarded}} dreams as well. For the most part, he is an isolated person. The type of guy who has a “Do Not Enter” sign on his <b>bedroom’s</b> <b>door.</b> Yet, his background and hair arevery intriguing. If he wouldn't have his abnormal knowledge and hair, he would have to pay rent in a different way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear cousin, I hope I {{have not}} done wrong. Helena left me all by myself. When I had {{finished}} darning the curtain, I really didn't know what to do. So I opened all the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> upstairs {{and looked into the}} rooms. In the big room with two beds--oh, I am so ashamed--I found this book. Please look at the first page." ...|$|R
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|The voice {{once again}} speaks to Isaac's mother, stating that Isaac must {{be cut off}} from all that is evil in the world. Once again, his mother obliges, and locks Isaac inside his room. Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she has done well, but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife {{from the kitchen and}} walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.|$|E
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Special {{effects were}} used heavily {{throughout}} the film, but some were not. When Adam knocks down his <b>bedroom's</b> <b>door,</b> production designer Leslie Dilley created a set with miniature furniture {{about four feet}} away from the camera, while the adult actors would be about fifteen feet away. Kleiser recalled, [...] "Danny was generally better at improvising and fresh reactions. Josh was better at following directions, so we would alternate." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{front door}} was open, so we rushed in and hurried {{from room to room}} to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> was locked.|$|R
50|$|Brian Cox is an American writer, {{director}} and producer of various independent films and television. He {{is perhaps best}} known for the films Scorpion Spring, Keepin' It Real and the live-action adaption of El Muerto: The Aztec Zombie, the latter of which won the Best Feature Film Award at the first annual Whittier Film Festival. One of his first credited roles in film was as a script consultant for the 1990 thriller film Behind <b>Bedroom</b> <b>Doors</b> II.|$|R
5|$|While {{her mother}} attends the reunion, Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher, Mr. Nystrom (Jeff Gruich). He takes {{her up to}} Jordan's hotel room but as they enter, Emma sees that it is {{completely}} empty except for a video camera which has been set up. She immediately becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access to the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> She locks herself in the bathroom, and comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan. Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go, but when she {{comes out of the}} bathroom he grabs and restrains her.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Uncle Vernon punishes Harry, fitting locks to his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> {{and bars}} to the windows. However, Ron Weasley arrives with his twin {{brothers}} Fred and George in their father Arthur’s enchanted Ford Anglia and they rescue Harry, who stays at their family home, the Burrow, {{for the remainder}} of his holidays. Harry and the other Weasleys—mother Molly, third eldest son Percy, and daughter Ginny (who has a crush on Harry)—travel to Diagon Alley. There, they are reunited with Hermione Granger and introduced to Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry’s school nemesis Draco, and Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer who has been appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor after the death of Professor Quirrel. When Harry and Ron approach Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross station it refuses to allow them pass; instead, they fly Arthur’s car to Hogwarts, where they crash into a sentient willow tree on the grounds.|$|E
25|$|The two Elduayen girls {{told reporters}} and later testified at trial {{that they were}} forced to change from their nightgowns with their <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> open as the masked men roamed their home. At the first opportunity, they and their mother fled and hid in the alfalfa fields.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{consists}} of two small bedrooms, a bathroom and a large roof terrace which overlooks the densely planted rear garden. The roof terrace is accessed from the landing {{at the top of}} the stairs through double timber doors. Built-in cupboards in the principal bedroom have been painted. A wardrobe designed by Karl Langer remains in the smaller <b>bedroom.</b> <b>Doors</b> which opened from the principal bedroom directly onto the terrace have been replaced with windows.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|R
6000|$|Young or old, {{ladies are}} not in the habit of {{sleeping}} with their <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> ajar. A strict sense of duty led Mrs. Presty to listen outside. No sound like the breathing of a person asleep was to be heard. A strict sense of duty conducted Mrs. Presty next into the room, and even encouraged her to approach the bed on tip-toe. The bed was empty; the clothes had not been disturbed since it had been made in the morning! ...|$|R
25|$|In this ending, {{available}} as alternate ending {{on the home}} releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. The screen then fades to black.|$|E
25|$|After {{their return}} from Varennes {{and until the}} {{storming}} of the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, the queen, her family and entourage were held under tight surveillance by the Garde nationale in the Tuileries, where the royal couple was guarded night and day. Four guards accompanied the queen wherever she went, and her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> had to be left open at night. Her health also began to deteriorate, thus further reducing her physical activities.|$|E
25|$|Since Marriott {{was found}} {{lying on the}} floor between the bed and wall, {{investigators}} concluded that he tried unsuccessfully to escape after being awakened by the blaze. Disoriented and confused after inhaling large amounts of thick smoke, Marriott had turned left instead of right towards the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> and safety. He had been unable to rectify his mistake before being overcome with smoke. At the inquest, a verdict of accidental death by smoke inhalation was recorded. Marriott's blood was found to contain quantities of Valium (taken earlier for flight nerves), alcohol and cocaine.|$|E
50|$|A {{social worker}} later noted {{that many people}} in the village were {{prescribed}} sedatives but did not take them when it was raining because they were afraid to go to sleep, and that surviving children did not close their <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> for fear of being trapped. A doctor reported that although an expected surge in heart attacks did not occur, the trauma manifested itself in other ways - the birth rate went up, alcohol-related problems increased, as did health problems for those with pre-existing illnesses, and many parents suffered breakdowns over the next few years.|$|R
50|$|The Elms {{was built}} c. 1872 by Boardman J. Stevens, {{the owner of}} a local shoe and bootmaking shop, and {{originally}} included a carriage house. The property was purchased in 1901 by George W. Richards, a dry goods business owner who was one of Aroostook County's most successful businessmen of the period. Richards was responsible for the renovation of the house's interior, and for widening the front porch. The property was for some time used as a boarding house, as evidenced by numbers on some of its <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the house has been renovated, and appears reminiscent of its look in the 18th-century, with wood paneling and stucco work. The upstairs features several paintings of Roman sports figures and a bedroom that is decorated with a Romanticism period painting of Italy. The house also has fake bedroom doors: the 18th-century owners desired to have symmetry in the interior design so they painted the real <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> to match the walls and fake doors to appear real in a location where one would assume a door would be.|$|R
