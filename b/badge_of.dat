5|$|Armigers, like clan {{chiefs and}} chieftains, may wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the circlet (or on certain occasions a real eagle feather). If an Armiger {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> their chief, however it must be encircled by a strap and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E
5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E

5|$|Despite its continual {{merging with}} other units from 1881, {{the legacy of}} the 52nd remains. Many of the 52nd's battle honours are {{represented}} on the Belt <b>Badge</b> <b>of</b> The Rifles (being a rifle regiment, The Rifles do not carry colours). Various museums record the actions of the 52nd and hold collections of artifacts and memorabilia, including the Royal Green Jackets Museum, and the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Trust, whose archives are managed by the Oxfordshire County Council.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{the most}} senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the coat of arms as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> rank, {{representing}} {{the fact that they}} have received the Queen's warrant (as opposed |to the Queen's commission for officers). The revised 1957 and 1994 Arms of Canada are both protected official government symbols used to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a holographic representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2008, the House of Commons {{was granted}} its own heraldic symbol {{following}} {{a request by}} Commons Speaker Peter Milliken to the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The new symbol for Parliament is a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> the escutcheon in the Arms of Canada superimposed on the mace used by the House of Commons {{as a symbol of}} its authority derived from the Crown. The Senate was granted a similar badge on 15 April 2008, using its own mace. Parliament as a whole has been granted the right to use the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada, superimposed over the maces of the Commons and Senate in saltire.|$|E
