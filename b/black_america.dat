Public Enemy responded to this and other deep-rooted problems of <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> on their following album, Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black (1991), which featured more critical assessments of African-Americans, denouncing Black drug dealers who donned Afrocentric merchandise, hip hop artists who promoted malt liquor, black radio stations for lacking significant airplay to hip hop, and even the Africans {{at the onset of}} the Atlantic slave trade for lacking unity.|$|E

25|$|In the post-World War II era, Harlem {{ceased to}} be home to a {{majority}} of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly <b>black</b> <b>America.</b> The character of the community changed in the years after the war, as middle-class blacks left for the outer boroughs (primarily the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn) and suburbs. The percentage of Harlem that was black peaked in 1950, at 98.2%. Thereafter, Hispanic, Asian, and white residents have increased their share.|$|E
25|$|On May 24, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited African-American novelist James Baldwin, {{along with}} {{a large group of}} {{cultural}} leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have a full understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which {{came to be known as}} the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting, underscored the divide between the needs of <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the Kennedy administration to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans. On June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation—the law which eventually became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That night, Mississippi activist Medgar Evers was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of racial inequality.|$|E

25|$|There {{were major}} changes {{following}} World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem {{was the scene}} of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords {{to improve the quality of}} housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations. The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects. From the mid-20th century, the low quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home. In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly <b>black</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E

500|$|His {{extraordinary}} feats in the 1962 season {{were later}} {{subject of the}} book Wilt, 1962 by Gary M. Pomerantz (2005), who used Chamberlain {{as a metaphor for}} the uprising of <b>Black</b> <b>America.</b> In addition to Chamberlain's regular-season accomplishments, he scored 42 points in the 1962 NBA All-Star Game, still the all-time record. In the 1962 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors met the Boston Celtics again in the Eastern Division Finals, a team which Bob Cousy and Bill Russell called the greatest Celtics team of all time. Each team won their home games, so the series was split at three after six games. In a closely contested Game 7, Chamberlain tied the game at 107 with 16 seconds to go, but Celtics shooting guard Sam Jones hit a clutch shot with two seconds left to win the series for Boston. In later years, Chamberlain was criticized for averaging 50 points, but not winning a title. In his defense, Warriors coach Frank McGuire said [...] "Wilt has been simply super-human", and pointed out that the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer, a playmaker, and a second big man to take pressure off Chamberlain.|$|E

500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{completed}} recording House of Music in September 1996, and {{the album}} was then mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. House of Music was named after a record store in the band's native Oakland, which had closed several {{years prior to the}} album's release. In an interview for Billboard, Wiggins said, [...] "We title all our albums {{at the end of the}} project. We sat back and listened to everything, and it reminded us of this mom-and-pop store around our way in Oakland." [...] "We grew up in a house of music," [...] Wiggins continued, remarking how their father was a blue guitarist and music had a unifying effect on people. According to Billboards Shawnee Smith, the album's title described a varied, complete work distinct from a contemporary music market oversaturated by [...] "retro-soul groups". The cover and booklet photos were taken by photographer William Claxton, who captured Tony! Toni! Toné! dressed in casual and formal, retro clothing. This departure from the more outré wardrobe of the band's past was interpreted by journalist Brandon Ousley as an effort to promote [...] "the elegance of 1960s-era <b>Black</b> <b>America</b> and legendary soul acts to a modern generation".|$|E
500|$|Rampersad {{suggests}} that Haley understood autobiographies as [...] "almost fiction". In [...] "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's Malcolm and Malcolm's Malcolm", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed <b>Black</b> <b>America,</b> {{and makes the}} general point that {{the writing of the}} Autobiography is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should [...] "not be held utterly beyond inquiry". To Rampersad, the Autobiography is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. [...] "Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know." [...] Rampersad {{suggests that}} since his 1965 assassination, MalcolmX has [...] "become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them." [...] Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of MalcolmX perceive [...] "accomplished and admirable" [...] figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and W. E. B. DuBois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, [...] "while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of MalcolmX.|$|E
