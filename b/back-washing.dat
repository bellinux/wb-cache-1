Fe was completely oxidized at alkaline pH and formed hydroxide flocs in Run 8. As a result, a thin soft cake layer of Fe(OH) 3 would be formed {{on the surface of}} filter media, which were washed away easily at the high <b>back-washing</b> hydraulic loading of 1274  L/m 2 /min from the surface of filter media during the <b>back-washing</b> stage. But, in the case of Runs 9 (6.4 %) and 10 (15.1 %) the Fe washout removal efficiencies were found to be comparatively very low with respect to Run 8 (59.7 %). Since sodium lauryl sulfate was present in the influent of Runs 9 and 10, which influenced Fe washout removal performances in the <b>back-washing</b> step. This can be explained {{in such a way that}} the positively charged hydrophobic tails of sodium lauryl sulfate covered the oxidized or un-oxidized Fe and the application of negative potential in the <b>back-washing</b> step created an attracting force that captured the Fe and hindered in washout removal performances.|$|E

30|$|Numerous {{complementary}} research {{works have}} been performed to clearly understand the effects of media material on removal of SS by depth filtration (Sun et al. 2015). Still in recent years, depth filtration models cannot completely account for the fundamental insights concurring with a large variety of solid loading rate for wastewater filtration (Ding et al. 2015). It {{is well known that}} tiny particles separation is a very complex process and influenced by several factors such as wastewater characteristics, types of SS, and the operation mode of filtration (Bedrikovetsky et al. 2011). When filtration proceeds over time without <b>back-washing,</b> effluent quality may be improved but clogging of filter bed will result in an increase in head loss and a decrease in filtration flux (Loderer et al. 2012). Clogging and head loss are influenced by various factors such as particle size distribution, particle concentration, particle surface chemistry, filter media size, and media type (Coustumer et al. 2012). Filter media with an uneven media size distribution normally have a greater chance of clogging than uniform filter media. The formation of clogging depends on the size distribution of SS, fine bedload, and channel sediments. Large fine particles diameter more than 30  µm are subjected to mechanical filtration rather than surface phenomena such as the van deer Waals force. Medium-sized particles between 3 and 30  µm are retained by both filtration mechanisms. Adhesion of colloidal particles and bacteria is exclusively due to physiochemical process (Wang et al. 2012).|$|E

40|$|Relaxation and/or {{backwashing}} {{have been}} incorporated in most membrane bioreactor (MBR) designs as standard operating strategies to limit fouling. However, {{to maintain a}} certain net permeate production, higher instantaneous fluxes have {{to be applied to}} compensate for the loss of permeate caused by those modes of operation. To assess the effects of the different operational parameters on fouling for the same water productivity, and to study the fouling mechanisms, three relaxation and five backwashing conditions were applied in a lab-scale aerobic MBR and compared to the continuous filtration mode. Moreover, the fouling behaviour was analyzed in terms of the consequential increase in trans-membrane pressure, resistance fractions and the biopolymeric composition of the fouling layer. The Pearson correlation analysis was applied to identify the major contributor to fouling. From this study, it was found that fouling could be retarded effectively when the appropriate filtration mode was applied. The instantaneous flux applied to compensate for the loss of productivity during backwashing or relaxation periods was the major factor affecting fouling rate for either relaxation or <b>back-washing,</b> which was significantly correlated with the amount of solids and soluble fractions deposited on the membrane surface. The relaxation and backwashing conditions (i. e. duration, interval, strength) also considerably affected the fouling rate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop fluorescence-based tools that are suitable for performing rapid, accurate and direct characterization of natural organic matter (NOM) and colloidal/particulate substances present in natural water. Most available characterization methods are neither suitable for characterizing all the major NOM fractions such as protein-, humic acid-, fulvic acid- and polysaccharide-like substances as well as colloidal/particulate matter present in natural water nor are they suitable for rapid analyses. The individual and combined contributions of these NOM fractions and colloidal/particulate matter present in natural water contribute to membrane fouling, disinfection by-products formation and undesirable biological growth in drinking water treatment processes and distribution systems. The novel techniques developed in this research therefore, provide an avenue for improved understanding of these negative effects and proactive implementation of control and/or optimization strategies. The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) method was used for characterization of NOM and colloidal/particulate matter present in water. Unlike most NOM and colloidal/particulate matter characterization techniques, this method can provide fast and consistent analyses with high instrumental sensitivity. The feasibility of using this method for monitoring NOM at very low concentration levels was also demonstrated with an emphasis on optimizing the instrument parameters necessary to obtain reproducible fluorescence signals. Partial least squares regression (PLS) was used to develop calibration models by correlating the fluorescence EEM intensities of water samples that contained surrogate NOM fractions with their corresponding dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. These fluorescence-based calibration models were found to be suitable for identifying/monitoring the extent of the relative changes that occur in different NOM fractions and the interactions between polysaccharide- and protein-like NOM in water treatment processes and distribution systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) of fluorescence EEMs was identified as a viable tool for monitoring the performance of biological filtration as a pre-treatment step, as well as ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems. The principal components (PCs) extracted in this approach were related to the major membrane foulant groups such as humic substances (HS), protein-like and colloidal/particulate matter in natural water. The PC score plots generated using the fluorescence EEMs obtained after just one hour of UF or NF operation could be related to high fouling events likely caused by elevated levels of colloidal/particulate-like material in the biofilter effluents. This fluorescence EEM-based PCA approach was sensitive enough to be used at low organic carbon levels present in NF permeate and has potential as an early detection method to identify high fouling events, allowing appropriate operational countermeasures to be taken. This fluorescence EEM-based PCA approach was also used to extract information relevant to reversible and irreversible membrane fouling behaviour in a bench-scale flat sheet cross flow UF process consisting of cycles of permeation and <b>back-washing.</b> PC score-based analysis revealed that colloidal/particulate matter mostly contributed to reversible fouling, while HS and protein-like matter were largely responsible for irreversible fouling. This method therefore has potential for monitoring modes of membrane fouling in drinking water treatment applications. The above approach was further improved by utilizing the evolution of the PC scores over the filtration time and relating these to membrane fouling by the use of PC scores’ balanced-based differential equations. Using these equations the proposed fluorescence-based modeling approach was capable of forecasting UF fouling behaviours with good accuracy based solely on fluorescence data obtained at time = 15 min from the initiation of the filtration process. In addition, this approach was tested experimentally as a basis for optimization by modifying the UF <b>back-washing</b> times with the {{objective of}} minimizing energy consumption and maximizing water production. Preliminary optimization results demonstrated the potential of this approach to reduce power consumption by significant percentages. This approach was also useful for identifying the fouling components of the NOM that were contributing to reversible and irreversible membrane fouling. Grand River water (Southwestern Ontario, Canada) was used as the natural water source for developing the techniques presented in this thesis. Future research focusing on testing these methods for monitoring of membrane fouling and treatment processes in large-scale drinking water treatment facilities that experience different sources of raw water would be useful for identifying the limitation of these techniques and areas for improvements. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|During {{and after}} medical treatment, {{pharmaceutical}} compounds {{as well as}} their metabolites and conjugates are excreted from the users through urine and feces. The pharmaceuticals end up in wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to deal with this kind of organic micro-pollutant. Eventually the pharmaceuticals end up in the environment where they can have adverse physiological and behavioral effects on aquatic life and could contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms. Adsorption to activated carbon is an established method for removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. It is however quite expensive and it is of interest to identify cost-effective alternatives. One possible alternative is bark, which is a common by-product from forest industry and has a complex microstructure and high porosity compared to many other naturally occurring materials. In order to investigate the potential of using bark to remove pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater four column filters were built, two with activated carbon and two with bark. They were used in an experiment conducted at Kungsängsverket, the largest wastewater treatment plant in Uppsala municipality. The objectives were to assess pharmaceutical concentrations in treated wastewater at Kungsängsverket and to compare the performance of bark and activated carbon filters under different loading rates. During this time the filters were run at different loading rates and two different types of bark was used. 24 common pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups were targeted. The pharmaceutical concentrations measured at Kungsängsverket were generally low, but mean concentrations of five pharmaceuticals (atenolol, metoprolol, furosemide, hydrochlorothizide and diclofenac) exceeded 250 ng/l. Out of these, four have been shown to have adverse effects on aquatic life and it would be preferable if they were not released into the recipient. Bark was not as good at removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater as activated carbon was, but decent removal rates were achieved for several compounds. The removal rates of either filter type {{did not seem to be}} significantly impacted by variations in loading rate or bark size. The concentrations of a few compounds increased after treatment with the bark filters and the reason for this is not clear. One possibility is interference from other organic substances in the wastewater or the bark, but determining the reason for this increase should be a priority for any further research on the subject. Another problem encountered during the project that is likely to pose a problem for future implementation is that the bark filters were very sensitive to clogging. Running the filters at full scale would require frequent <b>back-washing</b> which would be a disadvantage from both economical and practical reasons...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} the factors affecting {{the use of}} ICT in the classroom {{in a large scale}} language development project in Bangladesh. The project, called English in Action (EIA) provides ICT materials along with print based materials for the teachers as well as face-to-face training to bring changes in primary and secondary classroom practices. On-going monitoring data showed that the use of audio materials increases as the intervention progresses through the year, however, the pattern changes when a decrease is observed during the third quarter. The study focused on the factors that have an influence on the use of audio in EIA classrooms during different quarters of the year and explored the underlying causes. The study adopted a mixed method approach and used classroom observations and semi-structured interviews with fifteen primary teachers to gather data. Findings showed that different nature and the pressure of the contents during different quarters of the year and the examination focused education system are the key factors that affect the use of ICT in English classes at the primary level. This raises the concern regarding ‘negative <b>back-wash</b> effect’ (Pan, 2009) of the exam system, which can stop effective pedagogical changes in the classroom from happening...|$|R
40|$|The process-engineering {{solutions}} {{developed for}} the regeneration of pickling and washing baths in hot-dip galvanising units were implemented, tested and optimised using appropriate equipment. Zinc was separated from pickling fluid (hydrochloric acid) by the membrane electrolytic process. At {{the core of the}} system is an electrolysis tub to which electrodes are fitted. A separately installed direct-current source supplies the required electrode current (700 amps). The zinc collecting on the cathode is removed periodically with a sultable tool. The entry of acid in the wash bath is prevented by electrodialysis. The equipment used for this is of compact design and consists of several easy to use modules. The main process component, the membrane stack, is connected to a direct-current source (150 amps) through which the contaminated wash water passes. Filters with <b>back-wash</b> function ensure the required media purity. Pumps and a control console complement the system. Both systems operate in a by-pass set-up (2. 5 m" 3 /h) optionally in automatic or manual mode. Full enclosure prevents corrosion, media-exposed parts are covered with plastic (PP). (orig.)

30|$|Moreover, {{the same}} witness {{indicates}} changes also in sea bathymetry {{as suggested by}} the impossibility to use the sciabaca, a fishing instrument: “… tentammo di buttare la sciabaca nel solito luogo, ma con sorpresa scoprimmo, che quel tratto di fondo di mare, ove abbiamo fatto sempre la pesca, e da noi per tanti anni scandagliata la profondità di venti passi d’acqua, si è talmente inalzata con monti di Duna, Cotone o siano Albajone, che in oggi non se ne misurano che quattro … ”. (“… we attempted to throw the sciabaca in the waters where we always fished, but surprisingly, we discovered that the sea bottom, that previously had had a depth of 20 steps had now shallowed to 4 steps due to mounts of Dune, Cotone or Albajone …). Considering the present geomorphological features of the Rossano coast, marked by the presence of a pebble beach that continues below the sea level 5 – 10 m, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the <b>back-wash</b> flow accumulated a large quantity of sediment in the submerged beach, generating an extended submerged bar. Another description reported by De Rosis is that from the chief fisherman Antonio Apicella from Ma-juri: “La sera del 24 aprile il mare si ritrovava in bonaccia, talchè lasciai le mie barche tirate a poca distanza dal lido.|$|R
