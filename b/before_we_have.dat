500|$|Early on, Adams {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} turn the correspondence {{to a discussion of}} their actions in the political arena. Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that [...] "nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age." [...] Adams made one more attempt, writing that [...] "You and I ought not to die <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> explained ourselves to each other. Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book." [...] He criticised {{a picture of the}} cat and Potter wrote him, [...] "If you still feel doubtful about the little cat—will you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think I can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> proofs.

500|$|The Leicester Chronicle {{suspected}} that [...] "it {{will be a}} long time, perhaps, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> another match so keenly contested". The visitors scored early on, but Small Heath's shoot-on-sight policy produced goals for Hands, after a clash with Mobley left Preston goalkeeper James Trainer on the floor, and for Wheldon, before Edward Brueton, deputising in goal for the injured Partridge, let in a soft goal just before half-time. The second half brought [...] "more finesse and less vigour" [...] from the home side, but Preston grew stronger, took the lead, and Small Heath [...] "appeared to be done with". Then Trainer could only turn Mobley's lob in off the post, the same player gave his side the lead, but [...] "before the Small Heath contingent had finished congratulating one another", [...] "North End charging down the field finely from the centre kick scored again before the whistle sounded" [...] to make the final score 4–4. Match receipts totalled nearly £250, a ground record.|$|E

"Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any village teachers, {{we created}} village schools, and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any professors, <b>we</b> opened universities, and thus we falsified public instruction. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a culture {{outside of the}} schools, we created the Romanian Atheneum and {{cultural}} associations, and we despised {{the spirit of the}} literary societies. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> even a shade of original scientific activity, we created the Romanian Academic Society, with philological, historical-archaeological, natural sciences departments, and we falsified the idea of an Academy. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any notable artists, we created the Music Conservatory; <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a single worthy painter, we created the fine art schools; <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a single valuable play, we founded the National Theatre, and we devalued and falsified all these forms of culture." ...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> to make a conscious effort {{not to think about the}} fact that we went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

It is true <b>we</b> might [...] <b>have</b> sounded our new harbour, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ventured out; but I [...] cannot say for certain, whether we should or not; for I, for my [...] part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case was; [...] however, I say, perhaps, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> weighed, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> [...] looked about us a little." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ruth Fischer {{argued that}} the Communist Party of Germany leaders were saying: [...] "In no {{circumstances}} must we proclaim the general strike. The bourgeoisie will discover our plans and destroy us <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> moved. On the contrary, we must calm the masses, hold back our people in the factories and the unemployed committees until the government thinks the moment of danger has passed." [...] In April 1924 the 9th party convention elected her and Maslow co-chairpersons of the Communist Party of Germany. Both criticised by Joseph Stalin, Fischer, intending to defend Maslow (meanwhile arrested for participation in preparing an uprising in Germany planned for 1923), travelled to Moscow arriving there in September 1925 and was held for the following ten months in the Hotel Lux. Meanwhile Ernst Thälmann replaced Fischer and Maslow. Joseph Stalin arranged {{for them to be}} expelled from the party in August 1926.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explosion}} and resulting fire caused a full plant shutdown, reducing Western Australia's {{supply of energy}} by up to 35%. Apache's managing director, Tim Wall, said, [...] "It's pretty easy {{to say there is}} a lot of damage here and we are looking at alternatives to try to get gas to market as soon as possible but it will be at least several months <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> partial sales." [...] He estimated it would be at least three months until the plant was at least partially operational, when the less-damaged processing plants for John Brookes and East Spar are brought back online. The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational. [...] Approximately 80-90% of the island's gas is used by industrial customers, with small amounts provided to Synergy, the state's largest electricity retailer.|$|E
2500|$|Grier dated comedian Richard Pryor in {{the late}} 1970's. In her memoir Foxy: My Life in Three Acts, she reveals her sexual {{relationship}} with Pryor caused cocaine to enter her system. Her doctor informed {{her that she had}} a [...] "buildup of cocaine residue around the cervix and in the vagina." [...] Grier writes that her doctor warned her about what he termed the [...] "epidemic." [...] He asked if perhaps Pyror put cocaine on his penis to sustain his erection, to which she replied, [...] "It's not like he has a pile of cocaine next to the bed and he dips his penis in it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sex." [...] The doctor advised her to use condoms then asked her if her mouth went numb while performing oral sex on Pryor, she says it did, he linked it the Novocaine-like effects of cocaine. Grier confronted Richard about protecting her health to which he said, “I hate condoms. I can’t feel anything.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The benign {{intentions}} of the United States were also argued by John Bright and Richard Cobden, strong supporters of the United States and leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain. Both had expressed strong reservations about the legality of American actions, but argued strongly that the United States had no aggressive designs against Great Britain. [...] Bright publicly disputed that the confrontation had been intentionally engineered by Washington. In an early December speech to his constituents, he condemned the British military preparations [...] "before {{we have made a}} representation to the American Government, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> heard a word from it in reply, [...] should be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard and every man looking about for his pistols and blunderbusses?" [...] Cobden joined with Bright by speaking at public meetings and by writing letters to newspapers, organizers of meetings that he could not attend, and influential people in and out of Britain. As time passed and voices opposing war were heard more and more, the Cabinet also began considering alternatives to war, including arbitration.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than ever}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> access to {{information}} {{that allows us to}} reflect on the causes and consequences of our actions. At the same time we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts. We create, maintain and revise a set of biographical narratives, social roles and lifestyles – the story of who we are, and how we came to be where we are now. We are increasingly free to choose {{what we want to do}} and who we want to be (although Giddens contends that wealth gives access to more options). But increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one's self-fulfilment, and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise risk of which we are increasingly aware (what Giddens sums up as [...] "manufacturing uncertainty"). While in earlier, traditional societies we would be provided with that narrative and social role, in the post-traditional society we are usually forced to create one ourselves.
