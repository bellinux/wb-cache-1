40|$|Due to {{business}} innovation and IT, information systems (IS) {{are made up}} of distributed autonomous subsystems running on heterogeneous IT platforms. These subsystems implement differently same <b>business</b> <b>objects</b> and processes. Thus pieces of data and processes are overlapping and replicated. Moreover, informational and computational resources are locked i. e. they do exist, but they are not accessible. This paper specifies an interaction-dedicated subsystem of the IS called interaction support system (ISS). It is a support for interactions. It aims to: (1) provide subsystems of IS with a unified and consistent representation of <b>business</b> <b>objects,</b> (2) coordinate processes, and (3) lock data and processes. An implementation of a web-based business object-oriented ISS, a specialization of the ISS, is made up of four elements: 1) browser used by subsystems to browse and query <b>business</b> <b>objects</b> over the Internet/Intranet, 2) a web server on which run the logic of the ISS, 3) a metadata representing distribution of <b>business</b> <b>objects</b> and processes, and 4) <b>business</b> <b>objects</b> implementations over the subsystems willing to interact...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} {{existing}} gap between business process models and lawful states of <b>business</b> <b>objects.</b> This gap hinders compliance of business process models with internally and externally imposed regulations. Existing modelling {{methods such as}} BPMN and ArchiMate lack an explicitly declarative approach for capturing flow of <b>business</b> <b>objects,</b> their states and laws of state transitions. Such deficiency can cost organization potential legal problems, make the ability of BPMN and ArchiMate to capture real-world phenomena questionable and drive modellers to employ additional standards. This paper proposes a formalized solution for closing the gap between business process models and states of <b>business</b> <b>objects</b> by using BWW model. Our approach includes means for explicit definition of states of <b>business</b> <b>objects,</b> automatic generation of conceivable state space at a process model design-time, and automatic generation of lawful state space and compliance checking at a process run-time...|$|R
