Agriculture is {{widespread in the}} Transylvanian Plateau, including growing cereals, vegetables, viticulture and <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle,</b> sheep, swine, and poultry. Timber is another valuable resource.|$|E
25|$|The {{land was}} very mountainous, and the inhabitants, when {{not engaged in}} predatory expeditions, chiefly {{supported}} themselves by <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle</b> and cutting timber, little attention being paid to agriculture. Some of the valleys, however, were rich and fertile, and produced wine, which was considered equal to any in Italia. Augustus Caesar preferred Raetian wine to any other. Considerable trade in pitch, honey, wax, and cheese occurred.|$|E
25|$|McCray soon owned a large {{tract of}} quality {{farmland}} surrounding a large pond outside of Kentland which he named Orchard Lake. He married Ella Ade, {{the daughter of}} one of his father's business partners and sister of writer George Ade, on June 15, 1892. The couple had four children, although one died as an infant. McCray became interested in <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle</b> and began building a herd of specialized breeds. His reputation in the cattle community grew rapidly and he established a show barn and auction house and began selling his quality bred cattle, quickly growing his fortune.|$|E

2500|$|The Mannaean kingdom {{began to}} {{flourish}} around 850 BC. The Mannaeans were mainly a settled people, practicing irrigation and <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle</b> and horses. [...] The capital was another fortified city, Izirtu (Zirta).|$|E
2500|$|The Nuragic economy, {{at least}} at the origins, was mostly based on {{agriculture}} (new studies suggest that they were the first to practice viticulture in the western Mediterranean) and animal husbandry, as well as on fishing. As in modern Sardinia, 60% of the soil was suitable only for <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep. Probably, as in other human communities that have the cattle as traditional economic base, the property of this established social hierarchies.|$|E
2500|$|George did {{not accept}} this explanation. He wrote, [...] "I am {{inclined}} {{to think that if}} all wealth consisted of such things as planes, and all production was such as that of carpenters – that is to say, if wealth consisted but of the inert matter of the universe, and production of working up this inert matter into different shapes – that interest would be but the robbery of industry, and could not long exist." [...] But some wealth is inherently fruitful, like a pair of <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle,</b> or a vat of grape juice soon to ferment into wine. Planes and other sorts of inert matter (and the most lent item of all – money itself) earn interest indirectly, by being part of the same [...] "circle of exchange" [...] with fruitful forms of wealth such as those, so that tying up these forms of wealth over time incurs an opportunity cost.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between economic effectiveness and animal welfare standards is investigated {{in the case of}} the pig and <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding.</b> The issue is of importance in order to assess economic viability of livestock breeding while applying animal friendly practices. This paper considers animal welfare standards in national regulations in pig <b>breeding</b> and <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding,</b> production under animal welfare and economic effectiveness in the specified sectors. It is pointed out the conditions which the legislation lays down to ensure better animal welfare. The discussion continues with detailed examination of the applying these standards in the production process. At the end of the paper are presented main conclusions concerning economic efficiency under animal welfare standards. The aim of the paper is to analyse the interactions between the economic effectiveness of livestock production and animal welfare in the pig <b>breeding</b> and <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|R

Hunting Dog had, at Harry's urgent advice, settled down in the ways of civilization, taking up a ranche and <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle,</b> of which he now owns a large herd. Jerry Curtis and Pete Hoskings made a journey together to Europe after the closing of the mine.
