500|$|Gurus' peak of {{popularity}} {{was in the}} mid-to-late 1980s with the albums Mars Needs Guitars!, <b>Blow</b> <b>Your</b> Cool! and Magnum Cum Louder. The albums reached No.140 (1986), No.120 (1987) and No.101 (1989) on the American Billboard 200 album charts respectively. [...] The band's 1987 'Blow Your Cool' concert tour took them to 19 countries playing 204 venues. A concert from the Ritz in New York City was broadcast by MTV America. The 'Magnum Cum Louder' tour in 1990, with dates in Europe, America and Australasia; included Japan for the first time. Based on their extensive touring of America, the band gained a solid following in the U.S. with regular exposure on US college radio (and later MTV's 120 Minutes) and even developed a big fan base in Brazil. The third album <b>Blow</b> <b>Your</b> Cool! let go {{of some of the}} peripheral quirkiness and just concentrated on the band's pop power. Members of their international peer group The Bangles and Dream Syndicate contributed backing vocals to some songs. [...] Then, Hoodoo Gurus decided to opt out of its record contract, tying up the group in legal wranglings for more than a year. In 1988 Richard Grossman (ex Matt Finish, Divinyls) replaced Clyde Bramley on bass. The most stable line-up of Faulkner, Grossman, Kingsmill, and Shepherd saw Hoodoo Gurus from 1988 to the break-up in January 1998.|$|E

What Do You Know, Deutschland? was called [...] "less energetic" [...] and Don't <b>Blow</b> <b>Your</b> Top was called [...] "a little flimsy" [...] in comparison to later albums by AllMusic critics Andy Hinds and Vincent Jeffries, respectively. UAIOE, when the band's sound began to develop, was called [...] "more assured" [...] by Hinds and [...] "more representative of KMFDM's true motives" [...] by Thompson, who added that KMFDM's guitar-heavy sound inspired Ministry's own embrace of the instrument after the bands toured together in 1990.|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play {{it over and over}} again." [...] While the album Don't <b>Blow</b> <b>Your</b> Top was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E

5000|$|Among the non-album {{songs from}} singles, include the opening track, [...] "The Wind <b>Blows</b> <b>Your</b> Hair", which was {{originally}} released in 1967.

Oddly enough, however, the final single's B-side, [...] "Wild Blood", is not featured on the compilation. Previously unreleased recordings include [...] "She's Gone", [...] "Chocolate River", and an alternate version of [...] "The Wind <b>Blows</b> <b>Your</b> Hair" [...] (called [...] "Reprise"), with different, more frightening lyrics. Fallin' Off the Edge also {{marked the first time}} that the version of [...] "Pushin' Too Hard", dubbed a [...] "rehearsal", from the fake live album Raw & Alive: The Seeds in Concert at Merlin's Music Box was released without the studio audience noises. The tune was originally an alternative to the Seeds' hit, recorded in 1967.|$|R
500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't <b>Blow</b> <b>Your</b> Top before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. [...] This short project took my mind off the problems with the KMFDM album and gave me a welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E

The initial preview {{received}} mixed reactions and reviews. Reporters for the Las Vegas Sun, Los Angeles Times, and Las Vegas Review Journal cited a lack of the magic Angel is known for, {{as well as a}} confusing and uninteresting theme. They also opined that neither Angel nor Cirque du Soleil were able to perform to their capabilities during these initial performances. On the positive side, the Las Vegas Sun later quoted Star Pulse, stating, [...] "He has created a live show that is everything a perfect magic performance should be — and then some.

500|$|The lyrics for One Fierce Beer Coaster utilize {{over-the-top}} satire {{and toilet}} humor to provide comedy. For instance the album opener, [...] "Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny", {{is a song}} about {{a man and his}} new girlfriend and their adventures in cunnilingus. It was written by Jimmy Pop about his then-girlfriend; the two subsequent albums would each have one song about said girlfriend - [...] "Three Point One Four" [...] and [...] "No Hard Feelings," [...] respectively. [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And <b>Blow</b> <b>Your</b> Brains Out)" [...] is a satirical call for people who have considered suicide to go through with the act, because their life is worthless. Three minutes into the song, Jimmy Pop says [...] "Rewind and let me reverse it backwards like Judas Priest first did." [...] Immediately after this, a four-second segment of backwards vocals repeats four times. When played in reverse, this segment says, [...] "Devil shall wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni." ...|$|E
