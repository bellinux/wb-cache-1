In 1972, she stated, [...] "Anything that gets out of control becomes a hazard, whether it's fire, flood, or women's lib". She {{went on to say}} that [...] "we want to preserve the nobility, dignity, and femininity of women; there's a danger of some of that being lost. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> too many common-sense women for that to happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} no hurry about Bellairs," [...] said I. [...] "It's rather a long story, and rather a silly one. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a good deal to tell each other, and perhaps we had better wait till we are more alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think Mr. Pettigrew {{is rather}} making {{the worst of}} things, Miss Covington," [...] Dr. Leeds said, {{speaking}} for the first time. [...] "No doubt the difficulties are considerable, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> good heads on our side too, as Miss Purcell has proved, and I feel confident that, {{now that we have}} learned as much as we have done, we shall be successful in the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The question," [...] he explained, [...] "is complicated, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{answered}} it already. I may add {{that it is}} unreasonable to expect a dividend on the first year's operations. Preliminary expenses are large, and a mine is not like a factory. The ground must, so to speak, be cleared before you can get to work. Headings must be driven and timbered, pumps and machines of various kinds have to be put up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very possibly, Mr Saunders, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are {{at least}} farther north in this {{direction}} than anyone has yet been; at least I make it out so by the chart." ...|$|R
60|$|But isn't this relic {{matter a}} little overdone? We find {{a piece of}} the true cross in every old church we go into, and some of the nails that held it together. I would not like to be positive, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen as much as a keg of these nails. Then there is the crown of thorns; they have part of one in Sainte Chapelle, in Paris, and part of one also in Notre Dame.

6000|$|... "I will," [...] {{answered}} Pris, soberly; [...] "for at this informal sociable we can {{institute a}} new order of things. It will make a talk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{a right to do}} it, and I'm sure it will have a good effect, if we only hold out, and don't mind being laughed at. Let us refuse to associate with the young men whom we know to be what is called 'gay,' and accept as friends those of whose good habits we are sure. If they complain, as of course they will, we can say their own misconduct made it necessary, and there we have them." ...|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed reactions. BBC however gave {{a negative}} review claiming {{that it was}} perfunctory. The Belfast compared them to the Northern Ireland trio Ash, who were also signed to Infectious Records. Owen Strathern {{said in an interview}} with Matthew McCreary of the newspaper, [...] "We don't want to be Ash.... It's a coincidence that we are trio from Northern Ireland and a even bigger coincidence that we were signed to the same record label. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> our own thing going on, enough not to have to worry about being in someone's shadow." ...|$|E

It may be 20 odd years late <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> finally made the definitive Wild Swans masterpiece." [...] The 13-track album featured 11 new songs alongside the A-sides of both 2009 singles ("Liquid Mercury" [...] appearing in a noticeably different form from the original single mix.) The B-sides, which included the track after which the album is named, did not appear on the album. Joining the sextet as guest performers on a handful of the album's newer tracks were Will Sergeant and Candie Payne; Ged Quinn painted the album cover.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I'm not," [...] I concluded, after honest, soul-searching reflection. [...] "No, I'm glad, Kate. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{were crazy}} to attempt it, as Sergeant Baker said. Think {{of all the}} might-have-beens." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Heywood earned the role of Brody Morgan during the 29th season of Home and Away. He {{commenced}} filming in February 2016. Brody's family arrived in Summer Bay in mid-2016. He is the third of four children having an older brother, Justin (James Stewart), an older sister, Tori (Penny McNamee) and a younger brother, Mason (Orpheus Pledger). For {{the first few months}} after arriving in Summer Bay, Brody and his family concealed {{the fact that they had}} been living in witness protection for the past seven years and that his true name is Bartholomew Lee, following the shooting deaths of his parents who were part of a drugs syndicate. The family's secret was exposed in the lead-up to the 2016 season finale. Heywood said he expected the Morgans to be seen as the new Braxtons of the Bay, stating in an interview with TV Week, [...] "I can definitely see that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a very different dynamic." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul Dailly of the TVFanatic {{gave the}} episode 3.6 out of 5 stars, calling it as [...] "crazy," [...] and wrote: [...] "The stage {{is set for}} a solid {{conclusion}} to this half of the season, but who won't make it out alive?" [...] Writing for the website SpoilerTV, Gavin Hetherington called the episode as [...] "average", stating: [...] "I think I would have liked it more if they didn't beat around the bush and try too hard to avoid certain things. It slows down the plot, and to me, this episode didn't move to the pace I wanted it too. At least give us something more." [...] In contrast, Jessica Goldstein of Vulture wrote a mixed review for the episode, saying: [...] "It's possible that I've said this before, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> really, truly crossed over to a realm where Pretty Little Liars has no plot at all. Not like 'the plot doesn't make any sense,' a conundrum faced many a time in Rosewood. We are operating in a universe with a total absence of plot." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nergård competed as skip {{during the}} 2010 World Curling Championship in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, when Thomas Ulsrud {{had to return}} home for family reasons. Team Nergård won the silver medal having played some memorable matches, {{including}} a 9-8 win against Canada's Team Kevin Koe in the final round-robin game, which placed Norway first in the rankings (10-1), and a 9-7 win against Scotland's Team Warwick Smith in the semi-final. On the strength of Norway's national team during the tournament, Nergård commented that [...] "it wasn't easy coming into the championship without Tom Ulsrud, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> shown that we can play well. We are a small nation and {{there are not many}} curlers compared to the choice in Canada." [...] At the closing ceremony of the championship, Nergård was honoured by his fellow competitors with the 2010 Colin Campbell Memorial Award, a recognition given to an athlete who [...] "by deed and action {{in the course of their}} performance, best exemplified the traditional curling values of skill, honesty, fair play, friendship and sportsmanship." ...|$|E
