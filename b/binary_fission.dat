5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called <b>binary</b> <b>fission,</b> in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions. <b>Binary</b> <b>fission</b> is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial <b>binary</b> <b>fission</b> {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual mitochondria when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that mitochondria divide by budding.|$|E

25|$|Fission {{is a form}} {{of nuclear}} {{transmutation}} because the resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom. The two nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes, typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2, for common fissile isotopes. Most <b>fissions</b> are <b>binary</b> <b>fissions</b> (producing two charged fragments), but occasionally (2 to 4 times per 1000 events), three positively charged fragments are produced, in a ternary fission. The smallest of these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an argon nucleus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{existence}} of a statistically significant excess of dwarf binaries with mass ratios from 0. 95 to 1, as first noted by Lucy & Ricco (1979), is confirmed by modern data. Excess of such binaries, called twins, is found only for periods shorter than 40 days, and in the 2 − 30 days period range they constitute 10 – 20 % of the total binary population. Twins must have been formed by a special mechanism. It cannot be a mass transfer in contact pre-main-sequence <b>binaries,</b> <b>fission</b> is also unlikely. As shown by Bate (2000), accretion onto a close binary shifts mass ratio towards 1, so twins may originate from binaries that became close while still surrounded by massive envelopes. Many twins are members of higher-multiplicity systems and/or clusters, which probably explains an early formation of a close binary by stellar dynamics...|$|R
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by <b>binary</b> <b>fission</b> or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic recombination between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single mitochondrion can contain 2–10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is usually thought to reproduce by <b>binary</b> <b>fission.</b> What recombination does take place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are studies showing evidence of recombination in mitochondrial DNA. It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for recombination are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination. The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although indirect evidence of recombination exists. If recombination does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through <b>binary</b> <b>fission,</b> {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E

Isolates of the human parasite Blastocystis hominis were observed to begin such a process within 4 to 6 days.

40|$|The nuclear cluster radioactivities {{have been}} studied {{theoretically}} {{in the framework of}} a microscopic superasymmetric fission moddel (MSAFM). The nuclear interaction potentials required for <b>binary</b> cold <b>fission</b> processes are calculated by folding in the density distribution functions of the two fragments with a realistic effective interaction. The microscopic nuclear potential thus obtained has been used to calculate the action integral within the WKB approximation. This subsequently results in a parameter free calculation for the partial half lives of cluster decays. The predicted half lives of the present MSAFM calculations are found to be in good agreement over a wide range of observed experimental data...|$|R
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} are generally similar {{in size and}} shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are {{more closely related to}} those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by <b>binary</b> <b>fission,</b> fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse <b>binary</b> <b>fission.</b> Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria divide by <b>binary</b> <b>fission,</b> {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
40|$|Bacteria are amazingly {{resilient}} organisms, in {{that they}} have evolved and adapted to the many extreme environments of Earth (from salt, to pH, to temperature extremes etc.). The bacterial lifespan and death rates {{are as important as}} its growth rates in these extreme environments. Bacteria would be useful {{to determine the effects of}} age on single cells, but because bacteria reproduce asexually by <b>binary</b> cell <b>fission</b> (clonal replication), calculating the lifespan has proven elusive. Without the determination of a lifespan, age studies using bacteria have limited application. Further, it has been proposed that organisms whose somatic cell line is not distinct from its germ line such as single celled organisms like Escherichia coli K- 12 are immortal (Williams et al., 1957; Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Mangel, 2006) ...|$|R

The genus was first described in 1979, and was originally defined to include [...] "small unicellular cyanobacteria with ovoid to cylindrical cells that reproduce by <b>binary</b> traverse <b>fission</b> in a single plane and lack sheaths". This definition of the genus Synechococcus contained organisms of considerable genetic diversity and was later subdivided into subgroups based on the presence of the accessory pigment phycoerythrin. The marine forms of Synechococcus are coccoid cells between 0.6 and 1.6 µm in size. They are Gram-negative cells with highly structured cell walls that may contain projections on their surface. Electron microscopy frequently reveals the presence of phosphate inclusions, glycogen granules, and more importantly, highly structured carboxysomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{of natural}} complex biofilm {{communities of the}} Elbe river grown in situ on microscopic glass coverslips was studied by using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis. Characteristic microcolonies which measured between 3. 3 and 9. 3 microm in diameter were frequently observed. They had an outer envelope and harbored 6 to 30 cells. The cells formed short rods measuring 1. 09 +/- 0. 28 microm (n = 10) in length and 0. 55 + 0. 07 microm (n = 21) in width. They were surrounded by {{a thick layer of}} electron-transparent, nonosmicated matter, 120 to 300 nm thick. Individual cells exhibited a unique ultrastructural trait, namely, a concentric membrane stack which completely surrounded the cytoplasm. It consisted of three membrane doublets, which showed an overall thickness of 57 to 66 nm. The center-to-center spacing between two membrane doublets was 22. 2 +/- 1. 0 nm (n = 12). The bacterial cell wall seemed to be of the gram-negative type. The fact that upon shrinkage hexagonal clefts appeared proved the cells to be tightly packed, and septum formation by <b>binary</b> <b>fissions</b> was observed. All of these morphological details indicate that the cells within these microcolonies were actively growing and did not represent spore-like states. EDX analysis showed that only the electron-dense surface deposit of the microcolonies contained Mn and Fe in significant amounts, while these two elements were absent from the intercellular space and the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. In contrast, aluminum ions were able to penetrate the outer envelope of the microcolonies and were detected in the intercellular space. They were, however, completely absent from the microbial cytoplasm, indicating a filter cascade with respect to aluminum. From the ultrastructural data together with the deposition of iron and manganese on the microcolony surface, it appears that these organisms may belong to the genus Siderocapsa or Nitrosomonas. They do not precisely match any of the described species and may therefore represent a new species...|$|R

The preformation factors were neglected. In the case when the fragments are assumed to be spherical or with ground state quadrupole deformation, the Q-value principle dictates the occurence of a narrow region around the double magic ^ 132 Sn, like in the case of cluster radioactivity. When the hexadecupole deformation is turned on, an entire mass-region of cold fission in the range 138 - 156 for the heavy fragment arise, in agreement with the experimental observations. This fact suggests that in the above mentioned mass-region, contrary to the usual cluster radioactivity where the daughter nucleus is always a neutron/proton (or both) closed shell or nearly closed shell spherical nucleus, the clusterization mechanism seems to be strongly influenced by the hexadecupole deformations rather than the Q-value.
