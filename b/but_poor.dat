A number of measures were taken to prevent the details of {{the operation}} being revealed to the Germans. Only a limited number of senior officers were involved in the planning, all redeployments took place in bad weather or at night and simulated attack preparations were made elsewhere to confuse the German side.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. Joust 2 introduced a transformation ability that morphs the player's bird into a pegasus, which provides better offensive capabilities while on ground <b>but</b> <b>poor</b> flight capabilities. A second player can join the game. The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies.|$|E

40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{and location}} of Pd in alumina-supported sorbents prepared by different methods was found to influence {{the performance of the}} sorbents in the removal of mercury, arsine, and hydrogen selenide from a simulated fuel gas.

As the contact interaction between Pd and the support is lessened the Pd becomes more susceptible to poisoning by sulfur. resulting in higher capacity for Hg, <b>but</b> <b>poorer</b> long-term performance for adsorption of arsenic and selenium...|$|R

5|$|By 9 July, {{his ground}} forces had made {{significant}} gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders {{to attack the}} rear guard of Army Group Center <b>but</b> <b>poor</b> coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most {{probably not going to}} easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of the}} offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E

5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for a new coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, racking up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, <b>but</b> <b>poor</b> defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, <b>but</b> <b>poor</b> weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had been flying above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored to intercept these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it crashing into the sea.|$|E

40|$|Physiological {{needs for}} thermal comfort, {{nutritional}} comfort, and healthiness make colder and hotter climates more demanding than more temperate climates. Affluence {{may help to}} meet those thermal demands. Two country-level studies indeed show that thermal demands (colder and hotter climates) and wealth-related resources (higher income per capita) are joint roots of happiness (N = 55) and altruism (N = 71). In colder climates richer societies are more <b>but</b> <b>poorer</b> societies are less happy and altruistic. In hotter climates richer societies are happier <b>but</b> <b>poorer</b> societies are unhappier. In both colder and hotter climates richer societies tend to be happier {{at the expense of}} being more altruistic whereas poorer societies tend to be more altruistic at the expense of being happier. The findings generate a demands-resources theory on self- and other-directed consequences of thermoclimate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Tegetthoff was {{a central}} battery ship {{designed}} by Chief Engineer Josef von Romako. The ship's namesake, Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, victor of the Battle of Lissa, had proposed building four new ironclads. These were {{to be completed by}} 1878, <b>but</b> <b>poor</b> economic conditions in the early 1870s forced the Austro-Hungarian government to cut back the naval budget. Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, who succeeded Tegetthoff as the head of naval administration, had attempted to secure funding for two new ships, to be named Tegetthoff and Erzherzog Karl from 1871. Pöck finally succeeded in convincing parliament to allocate funds for the first ship in 1875. He continued to try to convince the parliament to build a sister ship for Tegetthoff until 1880, without success. Austro-Hungarian industry was incapable of supporting the construction of the ship, and significant components had to be ordered from foreign manufacturers, including guns from Germany and armor plating from Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, <b>but</b> <b>poor</b> views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
