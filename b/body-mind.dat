2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, he was {{acclaimed}} for his explorations {{of matter and}} non-matter, specifically evoking the void in both free-standing sculptural works and ambitious installations. Many of his sculptures seem to recede into the distance, disappear into the ground or distort the space around them. In 1987, he began working in stone. His later stone works are made of solid, quarried stone, {{many of which have}} carved apertures and cavities, often alluding to, and playing with dualities (earth-sky, matter-spirit, lightness-darkness, visible-invisible, conscious-unconscious, male-female, and <b>body-mind).</b> [...] "In the end, I’m talking about myself.

2500|$|Qigong {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a [...] "standard medical technique" [...] in China since 1989, and is sometimes included in the medical curriculum of major universities in China. The 2013 English translation of the official Chinese Medical Qigong textbook used in China defines CMQ as [...] "the skill of <b>body-mind</b> exercise that integrates body, breath, and mind adjustments into one" [...] and emphasizes that qigong is based on [...] "adjustment" [...] (tiao 調, also translated as “regulation”, “tuning”, or “alignment.”) of body, breath, and mind. [...] As such, qigong is viewed by practitioners as being more than common physical exercise, because qigong combines postural, breathing, and mental training in one to produce a particular psychophysiological state of being. [...] While CMQ is still based on traditional and classical theory, modern practitioners also {{emphasize the importance of}} a strong scientific basis. [...] According to the 2013 CMQ textbook, physiological effects of qigong are numerous, and include improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, as well as possible beneficial effects on neurophysiology.|$|E

5000|$|When {{starting}} a basic AM session, participants start {{in a comfortable}} position, eyes closed to sense their inner <b>body-mind</b> processes. They then wait for stimuli to arise within them, and follow each impulse expressing movement or sound. Individuals move through the space entirely free from any direction or expectation. This allows people to explore psychological processes as they arise into kinesthetic responses of movement or sound.|$|E
50|$|Philosophical {{phenomenology}} (→Phenomenology (philosophy)) {{paid attention}} to the body, too. Helmuth Plessner (1941) studied laughter and weeping as fundamental human expressions. Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945) placed the body in the centre of human existence, as a way of experiencing the world, challenging the traditional <b>body-mind</b> dualism of René Descartes. Gaston Bachelard (1938) approached bodily existence via a phenomenology of the elements and of space, starting by “psychoanalysis of fire”.|$|E

50|$|The central {{problem in}} Asian (religious) {{philosophy}} {{is not the}} <b>body-mind</b> problem, but the search for an unchanging Real or Absolute beyond the world of appearances and changing phenomena, {{and the search for}} liberation from dukkha and the liberation from the cycle of rebirth. In Hinduism, substance-ontology prevails, seeing Brahman as the unchanging real beyond the world of appearances. In Buddhism process ontology is prevalent, seeing reality as empty of an unchanging essence.|$|E

How do different images influence our ethical responses and moral behavior in different ways?

5000|$|For Popper (1902-1994) {{there are}} three aspects of the mind-body problem: the worlds of mind, matter, and of the creations of the mind, such as mathematics. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be {{interpreted}} by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be radio, {{an example of the}} interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's electromagnetic theory) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world. The <b>body-mind</b> problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions {{is the only one that}} deserves to be taken seriously namely: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that act upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 acts upon his brain and thus upon World 1. This, then, is the thesis of <b>body-mind</b> interaction. Karl Popper ...|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} {{to become a}} body donor is influenced by factors such as: social awareness, cultural attitudes and perceptions of body donation, cultural attitudes and perceptions of death, religion, and perceptions of the <b>body-mind</b> relationship. Studies indicate most donors are primarily driven by altruism and their desire to aid the advancement of medical knowledge and to be useful after death. Other reasons include helping future generations, expressing gratitude for life and good health or for the medical field, to avoid a funeral or to avoid waste.|$|E
50|$|Many {{types of}} {{practices}} {{are associated with}} massage and include bodywork, manual therapy, energy medicine, and breathwork. Other names for massage and related practices include hands-on work, body/somatic therapy, and somatic movement education. <b>Body-mind</b> integration techniques stress self-awareness and movement over physical manipulations by a practitioner. Therapies related to movement awareness/education are closer to Dance and movement therapies. Massage can also have connections with the New Age movement and alternative medicine as well as holistice philosophies of preventative medical care, {{as well as being}} used by mainstream medical practitioners.|$|E
5000|$|Cartesian anxiety {{refers to}} the notion that, ever since René Descartes promulgated his {{influential}} form of <b>body-mind</b> dualism, Western civilization has suffered from a longing for ontological certainty, or feeling that scientific methods, and especially {{the study of the}} world as a thing separate from ourselves, should be able to lead us to a firm and unchanging knowledge of ourselves and the world around us. The term is named after Descartes because of his well-known emphasis on [...] "mind" [...] as different from [...] "body", [...] "self" [...] as different from [...] "other".|$|E
5000|$|The Concept of Mind {{has been}} {{compared}} to Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1943) by Iris Murdoch, who writes that English analytic philosophy shares the same general orientation as continental philosophy. Ryle has been interpreted by David Stannard as maintaining that the psychoanalytic idea of the unconscious is rooted in the Cartesian conception of a <b>body-mind</b> dichotomy and as such is one version of the [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] fallacy. According to Stannard, Ryle views the dogma as a logical error based on a category mistake.|$|E

5000|$|Stone's {{ideas have}} been {{dismissed}} by medical health experts as quackery or untestable. They have also been criticized as a discredited form of vitalism. According to Nancy Allison in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of <b>Body-mind</b> Disciplines, even advocates of Stone's theory consider his books Health Building and Polarity Therapy to be difficult reading due to their inconsistencies and ambiguities. His ideas are thus interpreted widely, and polarity therapists vary in their approaches. [...] His ideas were later popularized by Pierre Pannetier, a naturopath who had studied under Stone. There are many polarity associations around the world.|$|E
50|$|As a {{professional}} philosopher, Kirkeby {{focused on the}} event as the centre of being. In order to describe the event, he conceived {{it as a way}} in which the <b>body-mind</b> (his neologism) absorbed the event by being absorbed by it. The media in which this takes place is language. Thus Kirkeby combined the theory of language games, and the phenomenological tradition, with its emphasis on self-reflective being (Heidegger), and the theory of bodily incorporation developed by Merleau-Ponty, interpreted through the Stoic vocabulary of the event, into an epistemological theory {{of the way in which}} we are “evented”.|$|E
50|$|Within psychology, an {{essential}} question that guides {{our understanding of}} the <b>body-mind</b> relationship is, should the mind be seen strictly as a subset of the body or vice versa? In other words, the mind is sometimes simplified to the brain; the brain is physical, and therefore the mind is purely physical. On the other hand, the body is sometimes simplified to be a creation of the mind: We do not actually access our body, only our mind's interpretation (perception) of the sensations we receive, and therefore our bodies are mental creations. Psychologists are not unified around one answer to this question.|$|E
5000|$|The philosopher Karl Popper {{referred}} to the centipede effect in his book Knowledge and the <b>Body-Mind</b> Problem: In Defence of Interaction: [...] "if we have learnt certain movements so that they have sunk {{below the level of}} conscious control, then if we try to follow them consciously we very often interfere with them so badly that we stop them". He gives the example of the violinist Adolf Busch who was asked by fellow-violinist Bronisław Huberman how he played a certain passage of Beethoven's violin concerto. Busch told Huberman that it was quite simple—and then found that he could no longer play the passage.|$|E
5000|$|Schultz's {{most famous}} {{achievement}} was {{the development of}} autogenic training, {{that was based on}} the hypnosis research and self-experimentation. It was first publicly put forward in 1926 as [...] "autogenic organ exercises", and received its current name in 1928. The program consists of a set of six mental exercises that target specific bodily reactions that are believed to underpin <b>body-mind</b> health. It is a myth that autogenic training is a technique based on creative visualisations. Rather, it is a technique that revolves around a set of sub-vocal instructions to different parts of the body with the trainee simply observing in a completely non-striving way the changes in the way the body feels. It is a passive process, unlike creative visualisations, which rely upon a more active cognitive state. Today, because of Schultz' contribution to <b>body-mind</b> health, autogenic training is practiced worldwide. NASA teaches AT to their astronauts to help them with the psychophysiological stressors of space travel. In Australia, UK, Italy and Spain AT is taught to assist with problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, anger management, insomnia, fatigue and for difficulties with concentration, memory, decision making amongst other things. In Japan and Germany, medical practices teach AT to assist with the treatment {{of a wide range of}} medical complaints. The Autogenic Training Institute of Australia teaches AT for occupational health and safety and has become well known for its work with the mining, oil and gas industry as well as police.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, he met Luangpor Teean Jittasubho, {{the founder}} of Mahasati meditation. Luangpor Thong asked his teacher for an {{intensive}} meditation retreat under his guidance. Luangpor Thong asked permission to remain secluded in a small cottage practicing by himself, without any obligation to go chanting or asking for alms. Luangpor Teean agreed. Since then, this arrangement became a regular practice during Luangpor Teean's meditation retreats. The young disciple practiced this method continuously for thirty days and reached the state of Roop-Nahm (<b>body-mind</b> basic stage). [...] Luangpor Thong continued practicing without interruption for another nine days, and achieved the state of “Birth-Extinction”—a doubtless understanding of life and death.|$|E
