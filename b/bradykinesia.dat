5|$|<b>Bradykinesia</b> (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. <b>Bradykinesia</b> is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinsonâ€™s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice <b>bradykinesia,</b> formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 an English doctor, James Parkinson, {{published}} his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans. An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, {{and the way}} that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and <b>bradykinesia.</b> He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (<b>bradykinesia)</b> plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies show}} that {{nicotine}} administration can be effective for reducing motor side-effects of antipsychotics, with both <b>bradykinesia</b> (stiff muscles) and dyskinesia(involuntary movement) being prevented.|$|E
25|$|Four motor {{symptoms}} are considered cardinal in PD: slowness of movement (<b>bradykinesia),</b> tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Typical for PD is an initial asymmetric distribution of these symptoms, {{where in the}} course of the disease, a gradual progression to bilateral symptoms develops, although some asymmetry usually persists. Other motor symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as decreased arm swing, a forward-flexed posture, and the use of small steps when walking; speech and swallowing disturbances; and other symptoms such as a mask-like facial expression or small handwriting are examples of the range of common motor problems that can appear.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's disease (PD), {{also known}} as Parkinson disease, is a {{degenerative}} disorder of {{the central nervous system}} that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech. Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (<b>bradykinesia),</b> and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.|$|E
25|$|Studies are {{considering}} whether music therapy {{can have a}} beneficial effect on people with Parkinson's Disease. A 3-month study investigated whether there was any motor benefit of music therapy and physical therapy on Parkinson's Disease patients, and whether the therapies had any effect on their emotional well being and their quality of life. The music therapy consisted of choral singing, voice exercise and rhythmic and free body movements, whereas the physical therapy consisted of stretching exercises, specific motor tasks and ways to improve balance and gait. The study concluded that music therapy had a beneficial effect on the patient's emotions, it showed an improvement in <b>bradykinesia,</b> and in quality of life. Music therapy however lacked any motor benefit, whereas physical therapy showed that it improved the rigidity of the patients.|$|E
500|$|Differential {{diagnosis}} {{may become}} difficult in patients recently exposed to both serotonergic drugs and neuroleptic drugs. Features that are classically present in NMS, that {{are useful for}} differentiating the two, are <b>bradykinesia</b> and extrapyramidal [...] "lead pipe" [...] rigidity, whereas serotonin syndrome causes hyperkinesia and clonus.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} difficulties {{found in}} PD are called [...] "parkinsonism" [...] {{and a number}} of different disorders feature parkinsonism. [...] "Parkinsonism" [...] is defined as [...] <b>bradykinesia</b> (slowness in initiating voluntary movements, with progressive reduction in speed and range of repetitive actions such as voluntary finger-tapping) in combination with one of three other physical signs: muscular (lead-pipe or cogwheel) rigidity, tremor at rest, and postural instability.|$|E
500|$|About {{half the}} people with Wilson's disease have {{neurological}} or psychiatric symptoms. Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior. Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow, often {{in the form of}} parkinsonism (cogwheel rigidity, <b>bradykinesia</b> or slowed movements and a lack of balance are the most common parkinsonian features) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body). Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson's disease. A characteristic tremor described as [...] "wing-beating tremor" [...] is encountered in many people with Wilson's; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by extending the arms.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bradykinesia</b> and akinesia: [...] {{the former}} is {{slowness}} of movement, while the latter {{is the absence of}} it. It is the most characteristic clinical feature of PD, and is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. The performance of sequential and simultaneous movements is also hindered. <b>Bradykinesia</b> is the most disabling symptom {{in the early stages of}} the disease. Initial manifestations of <b>bradykinesia</b> are problems when performing daily life tasks requiring fine motor control such as writing, sewing, or getting dressed. Clinical evaluation is based in similar tasks consisting such as alternating movements between both hands or feet. <b>Bradykinesia</b> is not equal for all movements or times. It is modified by the activity or emotional state of the subject to the point of some patients who are barely able to walk being capable of riding a bicycle. Generally, patients have less difficulties when some sort of external cue is provided.|$|E
2500|$|Manganism is also {{documented}} in reports of illicit methcathinone manufacturing. This {{is due to}} manganese being a byproduct of methcathinone synthesis if potassium permanganate is used as an oxidiser. Symptoms include apathy, <b>bradykinesia,</b> gait disorder with postural instability, and spastic-hypokinetic dysarthria. Another street drug sometimes contaminated with manganese is the so-called [...] "Bazooka", prepared by free-base methods from cocaine using manganese carbonate.|$|E

Although Parkinson's disease is primarily a disease of the nigrostriatal pathway and not the extrapyramidal system, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to dysregulation of the extrapyramidal system. Since this system regulates posture and skeletal muscle tone, a result is the characteristic <b>bradykinesia</b> of Parkinson's.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presence}} of parkinsonism as a clinical symptom of CBD is {{largely responsible for}} complications in developing unique diagnostic criteria for the disease. [...] Other such diseases in which parkinsonism forms an integral diagnostic characteristic are PD and PSP. Parkinsonism in CBD is largely present in an extremity such as the arm, and is always asymmetric. It {{has been suggested that}} non-dominant arm is involved more often. Common associated movement dysfunctions that comprise parkinsonism are rigidity, <b>bradykinesia,</b> and gait disorder, with limb rigidity forming the most typical manifestation of parkinsonism in CBD. Despite being relatively indistinct, this rigidity can lead to disturbances in gait and correlated movements. <b>Bradykinesia</b> in CBD occurs when there is notable slowing in the completion of certain movements in the limbs. In an associated study, it was determined that, three years following first diagnosis, 71% of persons with CBD demonstrate the {{presence of}} <b>bradykinesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis {{is similar to}} that of hyperthermia, and includes serotonin syndrome. Features which distinguish NMS from serotonin syndrome include <b>bradykinesia,</b> muscle rigidity, and a high white blood cell count.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} {{anticholinergic}} drugs, bornaprine {{had been used}} to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Bornaprine most effectively treats the tremors associated with Parkinson's and also helps <b>bradykinesia,</b> hypokinesia, and posture and facial expression.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} {{patients}} with parkinsonism and akathisia, and to reduce {{the side effects of}} antipsychotic treatment given for schizophrenia. Procyclidine is also a second-line drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It improves tremor but not rigidity or <b>bradykinesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dysregulation of the nigrostriatal pathway is causative from Parkinson disease (PD) in humans. Toxic and/or genetic {{ablation}} of SNpc neurons produces experimental parkinsonism in {{mice and}} primates.

50|$|Hypokinetic {{movement}} disorders {{refer to}} akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movements), <b>bradykinesia</b> (slow movement) and rigidity. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement {{is the primary}} manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is a manifestation of another systemic or neurological disorder.|$|E
50|$|Neurological {{disorders}} such as, but {{not limited}} to, Parkinson's disease, Dystonia, Huntington's disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and brain trauma and stroke are marked by numerous symptoms. Among the physical symptoms are rigidity, involuntary muscle contractions, <b>bradykinesia</b> (slowness of movement), dyskinesia (excessive and/or repetitive involuntary movement), and impaired balance.|$|E
5000|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} in which an abnormal accumulation of copper occurs.
