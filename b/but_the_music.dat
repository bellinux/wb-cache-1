5|$|In 1735, George Frideric Handel {{wrote the}} opera Samson, with a {{libretto}} by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Samson Agonistes. The opera {{is almost entirely}} set inside Samson's prison and Delilah only briefly appears in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera Samson and Delilah with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> played during her parts invokes sympathy for her.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> is closer to ambient.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{stated that}} {{the energy of the}} group was fast-paced, replicating the style of a music video, which {{children}} seem to enjoy. The educational theories incorporated were disguised with music and entertainment, with the band's work being designed to have multiple layers and cater {{for a wide range of}} ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> itself had the ability to stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E

5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|The dance {{style of}} the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza. By the 1840s habaneras were written, sung, and danced in Mexico, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and Spain. Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic dance; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> has a period charm, {{and there are some}} famous compositions, such as Tú from Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes, which has been {{recorded}} in many versions.|$|E

Sorum left and went to Hollywood {{to play with a}} series of bands, including Population Five, with the bassist Prescott Niles from The Knack. He then left on a tour around the country with a blues guitarist, playing nightclubs and bars.|$|E
25|$|Performers at {{previous}} Olympic {{opening ceremonies}} had occasionally synched to recordings {{of their own}} performance, such as the tenor Luciano Pavarotti at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, due to his pancreatic cancer. Then nine-year-old Eleonora Benetti also lip-synched to a previous recording of the Italian National Anthem. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra appeared to perform at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> spectators heard was entirely pre-recorded, {{with some of the}} music pre-recorded by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Mizraab is {{well noted}} for {{being one of}} the early {{progenitors}} of the progressive metal genre in Pakistan. The founder, vocalist, lead guitarist and songwriter, Faraz Anwar has strong influences from bands such as Rush, America, Iron Maiden, Kansas and Dio. The band sound is aimed to combine distorted guitars and fast riffing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> is focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. Mizraab's music has also been compared by some critics with the likes of Dream Theater.|$|E

25|$|Goodman's {{success story}} was {{told in the}} 1955 motion picture The Benny Goodman Story, {{starring}} Steve Allen and Donna Reed and produced by Universal-International as a follow-up to the successful The Glenn Miller Story, produced the year before. The screenplay was heavily fictionalized, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> was the real draw. Many of Goodman's professional colleagues appear in the film, including Ben Pollack, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton and Harry James. A special appearance {{was made by the}} New Orleans jazz legend Kid Ory, who was pleased that Goodman remembered him.|$|E
25|$|The band is {{well noted}} for {{being one of}} the early {{progenitors}} of the progressive metal genre. The original members, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and John Myung, have strong influences from progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, and Pink Floyd, heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, various speed metal bands, and even the glam metal of the day. This synthesis created a unique metal that was not traditional of the day: it had distorted guitars and fast riffing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. The band's music has focused on three main elements: metal, melody, and progressive roots.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{computer}} {{to play music}} was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist. However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and {{was not used to}} extend musical thinking or composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Baby Machine from the University of Manchester in the autumn of 1951. The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.|$|E

25|$|The first German opera was Dafne, {{composed}} by Heinrich Schütz in 1627, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries {{until the late}} 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop {{in spite of this}} influence. In 1644, Sigmund Staden produced the first Singspiel, Seelewig, a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in Hamburg presented German operas by Keiser, Telemann and Handel. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as Graun, Hasse and later Gluck, chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and {{it was not until the}} arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} (1707 and 1708) {{concluded}} {{with the words}} of Verse 7 of the Chorale, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> was that of Movement 2 (Verse 1 of Chorale). [...] In 1724 and 1725, Bach changed this out to the now-used 4-part Chorale setting.|$|E
500|$|The {{motion picture}} soundtrack album for Fame was {{released}} in the United States on May 16, 1980, by RSO Records. It features nine songs, all of which appear in various scenes in the film. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album five stars out of five and wrote, [...] "Yes, the production techniques often do sound dated... <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> by Michael Gore is dynamic, varied, and alive, sung with real passion and vigor, and it still retains its essential spark 23 {{years after it was}} a pop culture phenomenon." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Almira {{prompted}} the Gänsemarkt management {{to follow it}} almost immediately with a second Handel setting, Die durch Blut und Mord erlangete Lieb; oder, Nero ("The love obtained through blood and murder; or, Nero") generally known as Nero, again based on a Feustking libretto. The libretto survives intact, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> is entirely lost. Dean and Knapp record that a copy of Handel's manuscript score {{was held in the}} library of the Hamburg impresario J.C. Westphal until 1830, when it was sold and thereafter disappeared. [...] The whole work incorporates 20 ensembles and 57 arias.|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge would joke {{around at}} shows, {{as he would}} with Blink-182, the mood was much different. [...] "With Blink, I cant wait until I get done playing a song so I can say {{something}} stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all," [...] he told Las Vegas Weekly. He expounded upon this in another interview: [...] "It's a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It's not about anything <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> itself." ...|$|E
500|$|In this cantata, Bach {{combines}} {{elements of}} ritornello and concerto writing {{to expand his}} range of structural experimentation. Although the closing chorale was a later addition, its melody is incorporated earlier in the piece, unifying the form. The theme of the text is optimistic, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> throughout {{has a sense of}} underlying sadness. Craig Smith describes the cantata as [...] "one of the densest and greatest". The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff notes that the opening duet and also the duet passages on the chorus are in the style of Bach's secular cantatas written in Köthen.|$|E

[...] A review in The Observer again rated the album four out of five stars and found [...] "Morrisons voice remains peerless. A keeper, a goodie." ...|$|R
