By early 1933, however, Prokofiev <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity <b>to</b> write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|R

Disraeli, on the other hand, <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> office. [...] In the interim, Disraeli, as Conservative leader in the Commons, opposed the government on all major measures.|$|R
