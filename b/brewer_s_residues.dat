Three polypeptides of similar proportions and molecular mass (32 kDa) were immunoprecipitated by an antiserum {{directed against the}} first 10 amino acids of the amino terminus of IN. However, the faster-migrating nonphosphorylated polypeptide was not immunoprecipitated by two different polyclonal antisera directed against the last 11 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of IN. These {{results suggest that the}} faster-migrating species was proteolytically processed at its carboxyl terminus. RSV IN is phosphorylated on an <b>S</b> <b>residue</b> located five amino acids from its carboxyl terminus. Two different missense mutations at this <b>S</b> <b>residue</b> resulted in the isolation of slow-growing viable mutants whose phenotypes were stable. Each mutation at residue 282 eliminated both major phosphorylated-Ser-containing tryptic peptides observed with wild-type IN. An S-*F mutation resulted in the conversion of all IN polypeptides to one species that was not precipitable by carboxyl-terminal antisera, suggesting that this amino acid transition promoted proteolysis at the carboxyl terminus. An S-*D mutation resulted in the recovery of one major (> 95 %) slower-migrating polypeptide that was immunoprecipitated by carboxyl-terminal antisera, suggesting that this negatively charged D residue (similar to phosphorylated Ser) inhibited proteolysis. Modification of the <b>S</b> <b>residue</b> at amino acid 262 to R had no apparent effect on the proteolyti...|$|R

40|$|Invariant {{rotational}} tori play {{an important}} role in the dynamics of volume-preserving maps. When integrable, all orbits lie on these tori and KAM theory guarantees the persistence of some tori upon perturbation. When these tori have codimension-one they act as boundaries to transport, and therefore play a prominent role in the global stability of the system. For the area-preserving case, Greene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>residue</b> criterion is often used to predict the destruction of tori from the properties of nearby periodic orbits. Even though KAM theory applies to the three-dimensional case, the robustness of tori in such systems is still poorly understood. This dissertation begins by extending Greene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>residue</b> criterion to three-dimensional, reversible, volume-preserving maps. The application of Greene 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>residue</b> criterion requires the repeated computation of periodic orbits, which is costly if the system is nonreversible. We describe a quasi-Newton, Fourier-based scheme to numerically compute the conjugacy of a torus and demonstrate how the growth of the Sobolev norm or singular values of this conjugacy can be used to predict criticality. We will then use this method to study both reversible and nonreversible volume-preserving maps in two and three dimensions. The near-critical conjugacies, and the gaps that form within them, will be explored in the context of Aubry-Mather and Anti-Integrability theory, when applicable. This dissertation will conclude by exploring the locally and globally most robust tori in area-preserving maps...|$|R

By taking advantage of increased dispersion of resonances for the anomeric H 1 protons at low pD and the superior resolution of band-selective, homonuclear-decoupled (BASHD) two-dimensional 1 H NMR, the primary structure of the heparin-derived octasaccharide ∆UA(2 S) -[(1 [*]→[*] 4) -GlcNS(6 S) -(1 [*]→[*] 4) -IdoA(2 S) -] 3 -(1 [*]→[*] 4) -GlcNS(6 S) has been determined, where ∆UA(2 S) is 2 -O-sulfated ∆ 4, 5 -unsaturated uronic acid, GlcNS(6 S) is 6 -O-sulfated, N-sulfated β-d-glucosamine and IdoA(2 S) is 2 -O-sulfated α-l-iduronic acid. The spectrum was assigned, and the sites of N- and O-sulfation and the conformation of each uronic acid residue were established, with chemical shift data obtained from BASHD-TOCSY spectra, while the sequence of the monosaccharide residues in the octasaccharide was determined from inter-residue NOEs in BASHD-NOESY spectra. Acid dissociation constants were determined for each carboxylic acid group of the octasaccharide, as well as for related tetra- and hexasaccharides, from chemical shift–pD titration curves. Chemical shift–pD titration curves were obtained for each carboxylic acid group from sub-spectra taken from BASHD-TOCSY spectra that were measured as a function of pD. The pK As of the carboxylic acid groups of the ∆UA(2 <b>S)</b> <b>residues</b> are less than those of the IdoA(2 <b>S)</b> <b>residues,</b> and the pK As of the carboxylic acid groups of the IdoA(2 <b>S)</b> <b>residues</b> for a given oligosaccharide are similar in magnitude. Relative acidities of the carboxylic acid groups of each oligosaccharide were calculated from chemical shift data by a pH-independent method...|$|R

(LMW) heparin by {{treatment of}} periodate-oxidized heparin with sodium hydroxide, followed by redn. with sodium borohydride and acid hydrolysis. Gradient {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} anal. showed a mixt. of heparin fragments with an av. size of eight disaccharide units. 1 D 1 H NMR showed two-thirds of the N-acetyl groups were lost on periodate cleavage, suggesting cleavage had occurred at the glucopyranosyluronic acid (GlcpA) and idopyranosyluronic acid (IdopA) residues located within and adjacent to the antithrombin III (ATIII) binding site. The N-acetyl glucopyranose (GlcpNAc) residue was lost on workup. The GlcpA residue, within the ATIII binding site, is on the non-reducing side of the N-sulfo, 3, 6 -O-sulfo glycopyranosylamine (GlcpNS 3 <b>S</b> 6 <b>S)</b> <b>residue.</b> Thus, periodate cleaved heparin should be enriched in GlcpNS 3 <b>S</b> 6 <b>S</b> <b>residues.</b> Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2 D COSY) confirmed that LMW heparin prepd. through periodate cleavage contained GlcpNS 3 S 6 S at its non-reducing end.
