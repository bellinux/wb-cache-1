Mian Sharif expressed his desire to invest {{a certain amount of}} money in the real estate business of Al Thani family in Qatar.

The significant changes in relevant legislation and unresolved questions of the {{anonymity of}} shareholders are the reason I decided to focus on this topic. The main purpose of my thesis is to analyze the anonymity of shareholders and conditions of their identification, primarily regarding the recent recodification of the Czech civil law and the legislation being prepared {{not only in the}} Czech Republic but also at EU-level. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One is introductory and deals with the history of the anonymity of shareholders and their identification within the Czech territory. Chapter two is concerned with the problems that resulted from enacting the <b>Bearer</b> <b>Share</b> Abolition Act. Next two Chapters concentrate on current Czech legislation regulating the anonymity of shareholders and conditions of their identification, represented in particular by the Business Corporation Act and other relevant statues. These chapters are subdivided into several parts which thematically deal with the anonymity based on the form of shares, information publicized in the Commercial Register or the conception of a trust; it also [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This Master's degree thesis {{focuses on}} shares {{from in the}} context of {{provision}} of stock law {{in the context of}} provision on securities or book-entry securities under civil law. In the first part the quality of connection of the right and the list is analyzed including situations when the shareholder's right can exist independently of the security list. Also the definition of securities is reviewed which apply to shares only with certain reservation described here. The functions and the most important features of shares, such as the substitutability and tradability of shares on a regulated market, are also discussed. The thesis further reflects the fact that the share can also be issued as a book-entry security, the regulation of which has been separated from the category of securities and therefore forms a separate category. The last alternative is the share {{in the form of an}} immobilized security whose character is based on the adjustment of the securities as the share's list is preserved, as well as the book-entry securities through registration in the register. The second part analyzes registered <b>shares</b> and <b>bearer</b> <b>shares.</b> These forms of shares are distinguished by their requisites, but also by the extent of the limitations that are set out in these forms. Above all, it is a ban on <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> in [...] ...|$|R
