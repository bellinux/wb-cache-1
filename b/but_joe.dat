5|$|The Giants {{played the}} Cowboys at Giants Stadium in week nine. Defensive end George Martin {{recorded}} a late sack, termed by head coach Bill Parcells {{as the biggest}} play of the game, to help the Giants to a 17–14 victory. The Giants held running backs Tony Dorsett to 45yards in 10 carries and Herschel Walker to 34yards in 10 carries. The Cowboys outgained the Giants 408 to 245 in total yardage, and had 25 first downs compared with the Giants' 14. Phil Simms struggled and completed only 6 of 18 passes for 67yards, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Morris rushed 29 times for 181yards and two touchdowns as the Giants improved to 7–2.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957 (early in {{his second}} year of law school), Kennedy met Joan Bennett at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, {{following}} a dedication speech for a gymnasium that his family had donated at the campus. Bennett was a senior there, had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but she was unfamiliar with the world of politics. After the couple became engaged, she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed. The couple was married by Cardinal Francis Spellman on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph's Church in Bronxville, New York, with the reception being held at the nearby Siwanoy Country Club. Together, Ted and Joan had three children: Kara (1960–2011), Ted Jr. (b. 1961) and Patrick (b.1967). By the 1970s, the marriage was in trouble due to Ted's womanizing and Joan's growing alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|The team {{departed}} New Zealand on 1 August 1888, {{and sailed}} to England via Melbourne. After their six-week voyage from Australia, the Native team arrived in England on 27 September 1888. Their first match was against Surrey, on 3 October, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Warbrick was still injured {{and did not}} play. The side played regularly – they averaged just over three games per week while in Britain – but Warbrick did not appear until 7 November when the team faced Tynemouth. The match was won 7–1, but Warbrick – who played at fullback – exacerbated his foot injury. He managed to play six matches between mid-December and early January before he was again injured. He appeared against Stockport, a match drawn 3–3, on 12 January, but despite being fit enough to play his form was poor.|$|E

5|$|Zoe arrives {{as a new}} {{student at}} the college, {{studying}} Film Studies. She eventually grows closer to her ex-boyfriend Joe. Zoe, Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), Joe and Olivia Johnson (Rochelle Gadd) are in The Dog in the Pond bar when Sam Owen (Louis Tamone) sets it on fire. Zoe escapes <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> and Olivia die. Zoe has a one-night stand with Zak Ramsey. After rejecting the advances of Will and entering a relationship with Will, Zoe is abused and manipulated by him. He stops Zoe from leaving to study in New York City, resorting to stealing her passport and breaking her hand. He spies on her via web-cam, and drugs her, making {{it look like a}} suicide attempt. When Zoe discovers that Will has been spying on her, he ties her up on the college roof and confesses his love for her. Will eventually lets Zoe go and is arrested. A traumatised Zoe leaves to stay with her parents.|$|E
5|$|As both Birmingham City and Manchester City were First Division clubs, {{they entered}} the {{competition}} in the third round. Manchester City's cup run started with a home tie against Blackpool. The visitors took the lead after only 10seconds (their fastest goal ever), but midway through the match, fog enveloped Maine Road. The match was abandoned during the second half, immediately after City had scored an equalising goal, and replayed the following Wednesday; City won 2–1. In the fourth round Manchester City faced Southend United at Roots Hall. The Essex club's ground had only opened five months previously, and was suffering from drainage problems. Torrential rainfall meant that in {{the week before the}} match a trench was dug across the pitch, and sand added. Though Southend were a Third Division team, their familiarity with the uneven pitch meant the match was closely contested. Southend pressured the Manchester City goal, requiring Bert Trautmann to make several saves, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Hayes scored the only goal of the game on a City counter-attack to earn a fifth-round tie against Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The Indians hired Bill McKechnie as a {{pitching}} coach after the 1946 season. One {{of his first}} jobs was to work with Gromek during the offseason and improve his pitching due to his struggles the prior year, in particular against left-handed batters. The Indians talked with the Yankees during the offseason about making a trade for second baseman Joe Gordon. The teams settled on Gromek as the main piece originally, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> DiMaggio suggested the team trade for Reynolds instead. Gromek remained on the Indians for the 1947 season as a result, but {{was moved to the}} bullpen instead of remaining in the starting rotation. The highlight of his season came on July 1 in relief of Feller, who left the game due to injury. In the game against the Browns, he threw 7.2 innings and allowed two runs in a 9–3 victory in what was his longest appearance of the season at that time. For the year, Gromek pitched in 29 games, starting 7, and had a 2–5 record and a 3.74 ERA in 84.1 innings pitched, his first full season in which he pitched under 150 innings.|$|E

5|$|The Three Way {{main event}} began an {{extended}} storyline revolving around the participants. At Bound for Glory, A.J. Styles defeated Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match {{to retain the}} TNA X Division Championship. TNA then held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November13. In that match, Team Ministry (Alex Shelley, Daniels, Samoa Joe, and Roderick Strong) defeated the team of Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. After the contest, Joe assaulted Daniels, performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on him twice, the second time on a steel chair. Daniels suffered an injury in the storyline due to the attack, sidelining him until December11 at TNA's Turning Point PPV event. At that event, Daniels saved Styles from an assault by Joe following Joe's victory over Styles to win the TNA X Division Championship. Daniels then challenged Joe for the championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> retained the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in another Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006. Daniels won, becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship. TNA promoted an Unbreakable rematch at their 2009 Turning Point PPV event on November15. This {{time it was a}} Three Way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Styles, Daniels, and Joe. Styles won the match to retain the championship. This encounter reignited the feud between Styles and Daniels, leading to a bout for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on December20, 2009, which Styles also won.|$|E

The 737 design was presented in October 1964 at the Air Transport Association maintenance and engineering conference by chief project engineer Jack Steiner, where its elaborate high-lift devices raised concerns about maintenance costs and dispatch reliability. The launch decision for the $150 million development {{was made by the}} board on 1 February 1965.|$|E
25|$|England's debutant openers, Len Hutton and Jim Parks senior, did {{not last}} long, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Hardstaff junior and Wally Hammond then hit centuries and shared a third wicket {{partnership}} of 245. But only Eddie Paynter of the other batsmen made runs. New Zealand lost wickets regularly, with Kerr and Hadlee making 30s and Wallace reaching 52. But at 176 for seven wickets, the follow-on looked likely. Then an eighth wicket partnership of 104 between Moloney, who made 64 and Roberts, unbeaten on 66, came to the rescue. The new openers failed again in England's second innings, but Hardstaff made 64 and Charles Barnett an undefeated 83 {{to set up the}} declaration. Resolute batting by Wallace, with 56, and Kerr, who was injured and came in at No 7, saved the match for New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the oldest}} grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, {{but it was a}} weak state side that would not fully {{complete}} in the Sheffield Shield for another 25 years. With the Australian Test players returning home the MCC ran up 361/3 on the first day after winning the toss. Hutton gave a sound start with 51, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Hardstaff (155) and Denis Compton (163) stroked their way though a stand of 282. The second day was rain-affected and Yardley declared at 467/5 to give him the chance of dismissing Tasmania twice in a day. Bill Voce (2/7), Bill Edrich (4/26) and Jack Ikin (3/17) ran through their first innings and only Julian Murflett's 46 not out from number 9 brought them up from 49/8 to 103 all out. Following on Tasmania lost regular wickets to Compton (4/51), but ensured a draw with 129/6. 10,290 attended the game with £1,176 in receipts.|$|E

Kilmarnock had been leading 3-0 at half-time but two goals from Anthony Stokes and a Charlie Mulgrew header brought Celtic back into it. Following the Kilmarnock game, Celtic travelled to France to play Rennes in UEFA Europa League action. Rennes led 1-0 at half-time after a mix-up between Cha Du-ri and Fraser Forster, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Ledley {{scored in the}} second half with a header to secure a draw. The Bhoys returned to Scottish Premier League action defeating Aberdeen 2-1 at Celtic Park on 23 October 2011. Hibernian were the opponents for the final two games of October.

25|$|For the 2013 Ashes series, Root {{was named}} as the opening batsman to partner captain Alastair Cook after {{selectors}} decided to drop Nick Compton from the England squad. Root {{was promoted to}} opening batsman for the first Test and made scores of 30 and 5, and whilst bowling, took his 1st Test wicket when he got Ed Cowan out in the second innings. Root started the second Test with a score of 6 which once again meant that he failed to make a score as an opener. However, in the second innings Alastair Cook did not enforce the follow on and Root made 180 before England declared. In the Australian final innings Root was responsible for taking the wickets of Usman Khawaja and Michael Clarke when both batsmen were on 50 plus scores. Root was named Man of the Match for his performance with the bat and the ball. The third Test wasn't the best for Joe as he was out for 8 in the first innings but managed to get 13* off 57 balls in the second innings before rain brought the match to an end meaning that England retained the Ashes.. England won the fourth test and won the series. In the fifth Test Root top scored in England's first innings as he hit 68 runs, however in England's second innings they were chasing a score the Australians had set <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> only managed to get 11 runs.

Set in the Mississippi Delta, it examines {{the relationships among}} members of the family of Big Daddy (played by Ciarán Hinds), primarily between his son Brick (played by Benjamin Walker) and Maggie (played by Johansson). Her performance received mixed reviews from critics. Entertainment Weeklys Thom Geier wrote, [...] "Scarlett Johansson brings a fierce fighting spirit" [...] to her part, <b>but</b> <b>Joe</b> Dziemianowicz from Daily News called her performance [...] "alarmingly one-note". The 2013 Sundance Film Festival hosted the premiere of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, Don Jon. In this romantic comedy-drama, she plays a woman perplexed by the pornography-addicted title character. Gordon-Levitt wrote the role specifically for Johansson, who admitted to being a fan of his acting work. The film received positive reviews; Johansson's performance was highlighted by critics.

500|$|When Walden {{started to}} look for a record label for Jenkins, Atlantic Records {{representative}} Joe Galkin showed interest and around 1962 sent him to the Stax studio in Memphis. Redding drove Jenkins to the session, as the latter did not have a driver's license. The session with Jenkins, backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, was unproductive and ended early; Redding was allowed to perform two songs. The first was [...] "Hey Hey Baby", which studio chief Jim Stewart thought sounded too much like Little Richard.
