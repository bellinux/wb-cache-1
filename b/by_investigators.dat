5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding <b>by</b> <b>investigators</b> concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under a presumption that DFS is illegal in these states due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions could easily be circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes <b>by</b> <b>investigators</b> in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{theories}} considered <b>by</b> <b>investigators</b> was that Flight 2511 {{was involved in a}} collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport. Investigators reviewed the flight plan and other documents to determine if other aircraft were in the area. There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations: the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought <b>by</b> <b>investigators.</b> The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} {{flight data recorder}} that recorded basic information about the aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered <b>by</b> <b>investigators</b> on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{relatively}} little {{was known about}} the biology of the Chittenango ovate amber snail. Studies <b>by</b> <b>investigators</b> at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) since 1981 {{have contributed to the}} base of knowledge about the biology and life history of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Aloi (1985) analyzed the population dynamics of the succineid snails at Chittenango Falls. Thomee (1986) investigated their behavioral ecology, and Molloy and Norton (1993) developed techniques for captive propagation. Molloy (1995) reported on the captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and associated field studies related to factors influencing the distribution of Succinea sp. B. Confusion on snail identification may have affected the results of Thomee's and Aloi's work, but by the time Molloy's study was initiated, the identification problems had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|Jackson landed his Mooney at Furnace Creek Airport (the lowest {{elevation}} airstrip in North America) {{near the}} visitor center of Death Valley National Park early in the afternoon of 29 January 2011. He had no flight plan filed. Following a brief stop he took off in clear, sunny weather bound for Santa Monica, but {{a few minutes later}} he crashed and died about 6.5 miles (11km) south of the airfield in a dry lake bed. The wreckage was discovered by park rangers on the morning of 31 January, and was later examined <b>by</b> <b>investigators</b> who did not determine a cause for the accident. Jackson was survived by two brothers and two sisters, and by his fourth wife, Terri, their daughter Brianna, and Aja, Jackson's stepdaughter. He was survived by his third wife Betty Bennett and their son Lindsey and daughter Alex. Jackson was survived by his second wife Ruth Davis who sang background vocals for Springsteen. He was also survived by his first wife Margaret who married him when they were both 21 years old. Margaret was with him when he started JANDS, and accompanied him to the U.S. when he went to work for Clair Brothers.|$|E

40|$|Despite initial responsiveness, {{acquired}} {{resistance to}} both bevacizumab and chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer is universal. We have recently published that in vitro, chronically oxaliplatin resistance upregulates soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, downregulates vascular endothelial growth factor, and also promotes c-MET, b-ca catenin/transcription factor 4, and AKT activation. We tested whether variation in three serum biomarkers {{such as the}} natural c-MET ligand (hepatocyte growth factor), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A was associated with efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated in the prospective BECOX study. Serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A 165, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, and hepatocyte growth factor were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method basally and every 3 cycles (at the time of computed tomography evaluation) in a preplanned translational study in the first-line BECOX trial in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with CAPOX plus bevacizumab. Response was evaluated by routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography by RECIST 1. 1 <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and <b>by</b> three blinded independent radiologists. Ratios between soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 /vascular endothelial growth factor-A and hepatocyte growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor-A were established and variations through time were related to RECIST 1. 1 <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and independent radiologist. The BECOX trial included 68 patients, and 27 patients were analyzed in the translational trial. A total of 80 RECIST 1. 1 evaluations were done <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and 56 by independent radiologist. We found that a 3. 22 -fold increase in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 /vascular endothelial growth factor-A <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and a 3. 06 -fold increase in soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 /vascular endothelial growth factor-A by independent radiologist from previous determination were associated with responses compared with 1. 38 -fold increase <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and 1. 59 by independent radiologist in non-responders (p= 0. 0009 and p = 0. 03, respectively). Responders had a 3. 36 -fold increase in hepatocyte growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor-A from previous determination <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and 3. 66 -fold increase in hepatocyte growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor-A by independent radiologist compared with 1. 43 -fold increase <b>by</b> <b>investigator</b> assessment and 1. 53 by independent radiologist for non-responders (p = 0. 002 and 0. 003, respectively). In conclusion, a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor-A {{and an increase in}} soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 during chemotherapy and bevacizumab exposure can contribute to both chemotherapy (due to c- MET/b-catenin activation) and bevacizumab (due to low vascular endothelial growth factor requirements) resistance. Because hepatocyte growth factor levels decrease also during acquired resistance, alternative strategies to hepatocyte growth factor–ligand inhibition should be investigatedThis work was supported by “beca SEOM a Jóvenes Investigadores 2009 ” and by the Emili Letang fellowship to Estela Pineda...|$|R
