5|$|Chesney {{was active}} in his diocese; more than 240documents {{relating}} to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes <b>between</b> <b>religious</b> houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney {{bought a house in}} London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Surviving hymns {{and songs}} from the Old Kingdom include the morning {{greeting}} hymns to the gods in their respective temples. A cycle of Middle-Kingdom songs dedicated to Senusret III (r. 1878–1839 BC) have been discovered at El-Lahun. Erman considers these to be secular songs used to greet the pharaoh at Memphis, while Simpson considers them to be religious in nature but affirms that the division <b>between</b> <b>religious</b> and secular songs is not very sharp. The Harper's Song, the lyrics found on a tombstone of the Middle Kingdom and on Papyrus Harris 500 from the New Kingdom, was to be performed for dinner guests at formal banquets.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict <b>between</b> <b>religious</b> pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E

25|$|It may be {{said that}} the modern formal {{discipline}} of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations.

25|$|Contemporary {{commentators}} have highlighted {{situations in which}} toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of suttee (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the Mormon practice of polygamy. The French head scarf controversy represents a conflict <b>between</b> <b>religious</b> practice and the French secular ideal.

25|$|Stace {{argues that}} doctrinal {{differences}} <b>between</b> <b>religious</b> traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences. Stace argues that mysticism {{is part of}} the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{rejects the}} {{dichotomy}} <b>between</b> <b>religious</b> spirituality {{on the one}} hand and scientific rationality on the other, and favors a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion.

Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through our experience. His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.|$|E
