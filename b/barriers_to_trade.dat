30|$|A {{commonly}} concerned {{issue is}} whether mandatory COOL of the main ingredient would be a technical <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> for developing countries. Since developing countries usually produce primary materials but do not manufacture foods with ingredients imported from other countries, mandatory origin indication of the main ingredient on the label of a finished product should not directly influence the customs procedures for the export of primary materials from a developing country if main ingredient traceability is not mandatory. Otherwise, mandatory traceability would become a technical <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> for the developing country. To avoid the possible protectionism, traceability systems should not be mandatory when the originating place of the main ingredient indicated on the label of a finished product is a developing country. Proposing such a policy would also take into consideration that the statement of origin from a developing country {{is less likely to}} involve fraudulent practice.|$|R

25|$|These {{sweeping}} changes in political authority marked the modern transition from absolutism to constitutional rule. The expansion {{and promotion of}} free markets was another major liberal achievement. However, before they could establish markets liberals had to destroy the old economic structures of the world. In that vein, liberals ended mercantilist policies, royal monopolies and various other restraints on economic activities. They also sought to abolish internal <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> – eliminating guilds, local tariffs, the Commons and prohibitions {{on the sale of}} land along the way. Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights. Liberals have advocated gender equality and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a global civil rights movement in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals.|$|E
500|$|By 1937 Bruce's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} {{to social and}} economic cooperation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large. He had taken {{a leading role in}} promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic cooperation through the League of Nations, working intensively with Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr throughout the decade. In 1937 he presented a plan of [...] "economic appeasement", which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. <b>Barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy. In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the Marshall Plan, Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} {{transport}} costs and trade barriers hinder {{the expansion of}} the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties, exchange controls, import quotas and other non-tariff <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing. More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of capital accumulation remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view. Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of [...] "inward looking growth" [...] as opposed to [...] "outward looking growth".
