40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} initial pH of pickling solutions, total acidity, pickling time, types of vinegar used, addition of salt and sugar, and two starting temperatures of solutions on the flavor and tenderness of pickled egg whites. Tenderness was evaluated by a taste panel and also by an Alio Kramer Shear Press. The pH of each solution was determined before hard cooked eggs were placed in it and again after 3 weeks of pickling. The pH of the egg whites was determined after pickling. The pH of solutions did not influence flavor or tenderness of pickled egg whites. Total acidity of solutions starting at room temperature and at boiling temperature did not significantly influence flavor, but tenderness, as evaluated by the taste panel, was significantly increased by pickling in <b>boiling</b> <b>solutions.</b> Egg white pickled in <b>boiling</b> <b>solutions</b> had lower shear values than did whites pickled in solutions at room temperature. This suggests that the two methods of measuring egg white tenderness were not positively correlated. When shear force values of eggs pickled in solutions at room temperature and in <b>boiling</b> <b>solutions</b> were combined, there was a highly significant differ-ence in tenderness in solutions containing different levels of acid. The pH of all solutions increased during the 3 -week pickling time. Egg whites tended to approach the pH of the solutions during the pickling operation. Tenderness was less in red wine vinegar than it was in either apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar solutions. The addition of salt and sugar in solution did not significantly influence flavor or tenderness. (Key words: pickled eggs, hard cooked eggs, shear values...|$|R

50|$|Cohobation has no {{corresponding}} {{process in}} modern chemistry, {{as it is}} not a useful process. Indeed, it is equivalent to performing the same distillation a number of times and does not increase the purity of the distillate or alter the residue any more than would be done by maintaining it at elevated temperature for the same period of time. The Dean-Stark trap does involve returning some distillate to the reaction flask: a solution is distilled and the condensed liquid is collected in a tube wherein water settles to the bottom and is drained out, while an organic solvent returns to the <b>boiling</b> <b>solution.</b> However, the process is not manual, most of the solvent does not leave the reaction flask, and the apparatus achieves a useful purpose (removing water from the reaction mixture). Circulation, on the other hand, is approximately the same as reflux, where a solution is maintained at its boiling point by condensing the distilling vapors and returning them directly to the reaction mixture.|$|E

In May 2011 he filed with other artists of the [...] "founding Initiative East Side" [...] complaint before the District Court of Berlin, due to destruction of art and infringement of copyright.

From 1980 the first pictures emerged from crystals and crystal panels. Sperling describes his artistic work as Objectivism. In 1991 he created at the national exhibition in Kassel, a video installation that confronted the viewer with the objective documentation of Spacetime.
