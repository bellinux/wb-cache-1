5|$|In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, {{pitch pine}} â€“ scrub oak forests occur on Arbutus Peak and several barren {{areas in the}} {{southern}} part of watershed. In this type of forest, pitch pine, scrub oak, <b>black</b> <b>oak</b> and chestnut oak are the main trees. Bracken fern, teaberry, black chokeberry, blueberry, and huckleberry are the most common shrubs in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grow in {{clusters}} or {{scattered on the}} decomposing leaves and acorns of oak trees, such as Coast Live Oak, Valley Oak and <b>Black</b> <b>Oak.</b> It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it appears from late autumn to early winter.|$|E
5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in {{the canopy of}} trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of <b>Black</b> <b>Oak,</b> probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
50|$|Oak savanna is {{characterized}} by two layers: an overstory of scattered, widespread oaks (mostly bur <b>oaks</b> and <b>black</b> <b>oaks)</b> with an understory of wildflowers, sedges and grasses.|$|R
50|$|In coast live <b>oaks</b> and Californian <b>black</b> <b>oaks,</b> {{the first}} symptom is a burgundy-red to tar-black thick sap {{bleeding}} from the bark surface. These are {{often referred to as}} bleeding cankers.|$|R
50|$|The lakeshore {{is covered}} in a pine-oak forest. Eastern white pines are dominant, with red pines {{clustered}} atop the sandstone cliffs along the water's edge. The hardwoods are a mix of white, red, and <b>black</b> <b>oaks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of <b>black</b> <b>oak</b> and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young <b>black</b> <b>oak</b> trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California <b>black</b> <b>oak,</b> Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
50|$|At 6300 feet elevation, {{the site}} {{contains}} montane hardwood forest dominated by <b>black</b> <b>oaks</b> with a Greenleaf manzanita layer. Mixed conifer and hardwood species form the multiple forest layers seen here. Also, {{white and red}} fir is present.|$|R
50|$|California buckeye, blue oak, valley <b>oak,</b> digger pines, <b>black</b> <b>oaks</b> and {{occasionally}} oracle oaks populate the area surrounding the lake. A variety of wildflowers {{thrive in the}} Spring, Indian paintbrush, California poppy, larkspur, lupine, bordicaea, fiddleneck, Dutchman's pipe and monkey flower can be seen throughout the SRA.|$|R
50|$|White oaks {{provided}} excellent ship {{timber and}} planking. Cedars, chestnuts, and <b>black</b> <b>oaks</b> were {{perfect for the}} underwater portion of the ships - due to their impermeability to liquids, shock resistance, strength, natural durability, and decay-resistant properties among others. Within a decade boats and ships proliferated.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as <b>black</b> <b>oak,</b> hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.|$|E
5|$|Past Route 23 and County Route 504, U.S. Route 202 heads {{north on}} <b>Black</b> <b>Oak</b> Ridge Road, a county {{maintained}} road that heads through residential neighborhoods. The road {{comes to an}} intersection with County Route 689 (Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike), where U.S. Route 202 merges onto that road, forming a concurrency. The Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike heads north past some businesses, running a short distance {{to the east of}} the Ramapo River, before coming to Terhune Drive, where U.S. Route 202 makes a right turn onto that road with County Route 689 continuing north on Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. Terhune Drive carries U.S. Route 202 north through wooded neighborhoods, running in between Pines Lake to the east and Pompton Lake, {{which is part of the}} Ramapo River, to the west.|$|E
5|$|The band began a {{world tour}} in January 1974, which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath {{appeared}} alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands Deep Purple, Eagles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rare Earth, Seals & Crofts, <b>Black</b> <b>Oak</b> Arkansas, and Earth, Wind & Fire. Portions {{of the show}} were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager Don Arden. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the US, Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.|$|E

5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's high {{biodiversity}} {{is due to}} {{its wide}} range of elevations and its location between the Cascade, Klamath, and Eastern Cascade ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support chaparral, oak savanna, and open grassland. Scattered California <b>black</b> <b>oak,</b> Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone trees grow in these areas, as do sclerophyllous shrubs such as birchleaf mountain mahogany, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Pacific poison oak. Common grasses include blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass. Wildflowers including Southern Oregon buttercup, common yarrow, and Tolmie star-tulip also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed coniferous forest, dominated by Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, western juniper, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as common snowberry, bearbrush, greenleaf manzanita, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, deerbrush, and Pacific poison oak make up the understory of the forest, along with herbaceous plants such as creeping snowberry and Idaho fescue.|$|E
