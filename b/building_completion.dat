50|$|The game's tech tree {{is simple}} and straightforward, and most new {{technology}} is accessed upon new <b>building</b> <b>completion.</b> To begin, the player can only build a school house that trains basic workers, but as the game advances more buildings and units become available.

5000|$|... 17th-century {{chronicle of}} Bydgoszcz by Wojciech Łochowski {{as well as}} {{historical}} researches suggest that prior {{the construction of the}} parish church, an older temple dedicated to Saint Giles had been already standing in the suburbs of the old city Kujawski. From the 13th century, it served as a chapel of ease for local officials and knights of Bydgoszcz castle. After the construction of the castle in Bydgoszcz {{in the middle of the}} 14th century, Saint Giles church replaced the castle chapel. Until <b>building</b> <b>completion</b> of the parish church, it parson resided at the chapel of ease. This episode established a later but distorted tradition, making Saint Giles church the oldest parish church in Bydgoszcz; the chapel was erased in 1879 when constructing Bernardyńska Street in Bydgoszcz.|$|E
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century Andrew Carnegie began funding dozens of public {{libraries}} in Pennsylvania, and in 1901 received plans from the Easton Library Association asking for a donation for a new building to be constructed on Church Street.

Included in the plans were a fireproof vault for the protection of books of rare and historic value, and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 400 to 500 people. The final building would be able to house 34,500 volumes. After reviewing the plans, Carnegie donated $50,000 under the condition that the citizens of Easton provide land for the construction of the library the town agree to fund the daily expenses after <b>building</b> <b>completion.</b>|$|E

50|$|Work on {{removing}} the asbestos {{began in the}} summer of 1995, {{three and a half years}} after the building was vacated. Work was expected to finish in February 1997, however inefficient organisation led to delay after delay: rumours about air pollution and violation of standards, electricity failures and asbestos outside the screen brought work to a halt. Longer time frames and more capital were demanded to complete the work. Outside management was brought in with asbestos removal being completed in 1999. Renovation work started on 1 June 1999 with work on full modernisation of the building, including better natural light flows and construction was expected to be finished by the end of 2001 according to optimistic forecasts. However once more there were further delays from the subcontractors, Berlaymont 2000 and SNCB who were constructing a railway link below the <b>building.</b> <b>Completion</b> date was pushed back each year until it reached mid-2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{county board}} of {{supervisors}} applied to the Public Works Administration, or PWA, for a grant {{to build a new}} courthouse and a referendum was approved by 77 percent of voters on September 10, 1935. Des Moines architects Dougher, Rich & Woodburn designed the new building. Excavation for the courthouse was begun once the PWA approved the grant. The cornerstone was laid on August 9, 1936. C.C. Larsen & Sons Co. of Council Bluffs won the contract to build the <b>building.</b> <b>Completion</b> was delayed because of contract delays and cost overruns. The building's final construction costs were $200,000. County offices moved into the building in August and the dedication was held on September 10, 1937. Nearly 6,000 people attnded the ceremonies. Governor Nelson G. Kraschel delivered the main address. Other speakers included State PWA Director P.P. Hopkins and Justice J.M. Parsons of the Iowa Supreme Court, who was a Jones County native.|$|E
50|$|Prior to construction, {{a private}} corporation, PACI, {{was formed to}} take over the {{ownership}} of the construction project and then return the PAC property back to the City of Tulsa after <b>building</b> <b>completion.</b> This allowed for construction to move ahead at greater speed ahead of the rampant inflation. A committee was formed to procure art for the building. One percent of all construction costs of public buildings in Tulsa must be spent on art for the building being constructed to comply with an ordinance adopted by the City of Tulsa in 1969. A combination of local, national and international art, including a large representation of Native American art, was purchased. The works of artists such as Alexandre Hogue, Wolf Kahn, Barbara Hepworth, Louise Nevelson and Woody Crumbo were among the original collection. The initial plan for the Tulsa PAC was for one large performance hall seating almost 2,400 and a smaller proscenium theater seating approximately 430. During the initial construction phase, two more studio theaters were added to the plans. The acoustics for the facility were the work of Bolt, Berenek and Newman, the firm responsible for the acoustics at Lincoln Center in New York City. Ultimately, the cost of building the Tulsa PAC was approximately $19 million. Additional revenue sources were found to fund the difference.|$|E
