These instruments are the bank draft, including the <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> the certified cheque, and the personal money order. The article {{is concerned with the}} binding effect, or the irrevocability, of the bank 2 ̆ 7 s obligation on these instruments under the law of bills and notes. It concludes that (1) the issuer of the bank draft is liable as a drawer, and under some circumstances, also as a maker or acceptor, that (2) cheque certification amounts to the acceptance of the cheque, and that (3) imprinting the amount on a personal money order ought to be treated like cheque certification. As to all three species, the bank 2 ̆ 7 s obligation is thus irrevocable...|$|E
50|$|Postal <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to sending cash through the mail, and are available in any amount up to $1000. Like a <b>bank</b> cheque, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are cashable only by the recipient. Unlike a personal bank check, they are prepaid and therefore cannot be returned because of insufficient funds. <b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> are a declining business for the USPS, as companies like PayPal, PaidByCash and others are offering electronic replacements.|$|R
50|$|<b>Money</b> <b>orders</b> {{have limited}} {{acceptance}} {{in the insurance}} and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering. Because of provisions within the USA PATRIOT Act and the <b>Bank</b> Secrecy Act, <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> have far more regulatory processing requirements than personal cheques, cashier's cheques, or certified cheques.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>money</b> <b>order</b> is used non-uniformly in Canada, {{with some}} {{institutions}} offering both <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> and <b>bank</b> drafts {{depending on the}} amount, with others only offering {{one or the other}} for any amount. Generally, both <b>bank</b> drafts and <b>money</b> <b>orders</b> are treated the same in regards to guaranteed funds and hold policies.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMobile banking is the {{evolutionary}} step after Internet banking where the banks can collaborate with other entities {{to offer the}} latest in banking services in variety of business domains. The remittance of Indian Postal <b>Money</b> <b>Order</b> at present requires the person to visit nearest post office branch, fill up <b>money</b> <b>order</b> form for sending to recipient. The present postal <b>money</b> <b>order</b> lacks in efficiency due to slow delivery, high commission charges, and inconvenience to customers as they require visiting the post office during business hours on working days and many more. The India post had been the oldest and prime source of money transfer for the migrant people and serving personnel employed away from their homes such as migrant workers. This provides the opportunities for banks and India Post to utilize the existing setup and resources to integrate the money remittance through cost effective means of technology such as mobile banking. Although some initiative has been taken to start mobile money transfer services in India but their adoption has remained modest. This study examines the feasible model of mobile <b>banking</b> based <b>money</b> <b>order</b> by integrating India Post with banking sectors and find out the factors that drive and inhibit the demand potentials for such services. The study has identified certain factors for demand of mobile <b>money</b> <b>order</b> for deploying the mobile <b>money</b> <b>order,</b> which can {{provide an opportunity to}} Banks and India Post to accelerate business growth. The results are interesting and useful for all the parties concerned...|$|R
50|$|If banks lend out {{close to}} the maximum allowed by their reserves, then the {{inequality}} becomes an approximate equality, and commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> times the multiplier. If banks instead lend less than the maximum, accumulating excess reserves, then commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> will be less than central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> times the theoretical multiplier.|$|R
50|$|In {{the money}} supply statistics, central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is MB while the {{commercial}} <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is divided up into the M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1 while the types of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized in M2 and M3, with M3 having the largest.|$|R
25|$|In {{countries}} where fractional-reserve banking is prevalent, commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> usually forms {{the majority of}} the money supply. The acceptance and value of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is {{based on the fact that}} it can be exchanged freely at a commercial bank for central <b>bank</b> <b>money.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If banks {{accumulate}} excess reserves, as {{occurred in}} such financial crises as the Great Depression and the Financial crisis of 2007-2008 - in the United States since October 2008, {{the relationship between}} base money and broad money breaks down, and central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> creation may not result in commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> creation, instead remaining as unlent (excess) reserves. However, the central bank may shrink commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> by shrinking central <b>bank</b> <b>money,</b> since reserves are required - thus fractional-reserve money creation is likened to a string, since the central bank can always pull money out by restricting central <b>bank</b> <b>money,</b> hence reserves, but cannot always push money out by expanding central <b>bank</b> <b>money,</b> since this may result in excess reserves, a situation referred to as [...] "pushing on a string".|$|R
50|$|In {{monetary}} economics, a {{money multiplier}} {{is one of}} various closely related ratios of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> to central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> under a fractional-reserve banking system. Most often, it measures {{an estimate of the}} maximum amount of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> that can be created, given a certain amount of central <b>bank</b> <b>money.</b> That is, in a fractional-reserve banking system, the total amount of loans that commercial banks are allowed to extend (the commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> that they can legally create) is equal to an amount which is a multiple of the amount of reserves. This multiple is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio, and it is an economic multiplier.|$|R
25|$|When {{a deposit}} of central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is {{made at a}} {{commercial}} bank, the central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is removed from circulation and added to the commercial banks' reserves (it is no longer counted as part of M1 money supply). Simultaneously, {{an equal amount of}} new commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is created in the form of bank deposits.|$|R
5000|$|In equations, writing M for {{commercial}} <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> (loans), R for reserves (central <b>bank</b> <b>money),</b> and RR for the reserve ratio, the reserve ratio requirement is that [...] {{the fraction of}} reserves {{must be at least}} the reserve ratio. Taking the reciprocal, [...] which yields [...] meaning that commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is at most reserves times [...] the latter being the multiplier.|$|R
50|$|Restated, {{increases}} in central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> may {{not result in}} commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> because the money {{is not required to}} be lent out - it may instead result in a growth of unlent reserves (excess reserves).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>money,</b> or {{broad money}} (M1/M2) {{is the money}} created by private banks through the {{recording}} of loans as deposits of borrowing clients, with partial support indicated by the cash ratio. Currently, <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is created as electronic money.|$|R
50|$|The {{multiplier}} plays a {{key role}} in monetary policy, and the distinction between the multiplier being the maximum amount of commercial <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> created by a given unit of central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> and approximately equal to the amount created has important implications in monetary policy.|$|R
50|$|If banks {{maintain}} {{low levels}} of excess reserves, {{as they did in}} the US from 1959 to August 2008, then central banks can finely control broad (commercial <b>bank)</b> <b>money</b> supply by controlling central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> creation, as the multiplier gives a direct and fixed connection between these.|$|R
25|$|The e-krona is a {{proposed}} electronic currency {{to be issued}} directly by the Riksbank.

50|$|In {{order to}} remedy this situation, a bank {{was founded in}} 1609 under the {{protection}} of the city of Amsterdam. This bank at first received both foreign and local coinage at their real, intrinsic value, deducted a small coinage and management fee, and credited clients in its book for the remainder. This credit was known as <b>bank</b> <b>money.</b> Being always in accord with mint standards, and always of the same value, <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> was worth more than real coinage. At the same time a new regulation was introduced; according to which all bills drawn at Amsterdam worth more than 600 guilders must be paid in <b>bank</b> <b>money.</b> This both removed all uncertainty from these bills and compelled all merchants to keep an account with the bank, which in turn occasioned a certain demand for <b>bank</b> <b>money.</b>|$|R

It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|R
