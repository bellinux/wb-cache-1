5|$|NGC 1664 is {{a fairly}} large open cluster, with a {{diameter}} of 18 arcminutes, and moderately <b>bright,</b> <b>with</b> a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has a diameter of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has a diameter of 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very <b>bright,</b> <b>with</b> a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E

25|$|The {{surface of}} Orcus is {{relatively}} <b>bright</b> <b>with</b> albedo reaching 30%, grey {{in color and}} water-rich. The ice is predominantly in crystalline form, which {{may be related to}} past cryovolcanic activity. Other compounds like methane or ammonia may also be present. The existence of a satellite allowed astronomers to determine the mass of the system, which is approximately equal to that of the Saturnian moon Tethys. The ratio of masses of Orcus and Vanth is uncertain, possibly anywhere from 1:33 to 1:12. The diameter of Orcus is estimated to be 761 or 807nbsp&km and the diameter of Vanth 378 or 267nbsp&km respectively, depending on their relative albedos.|$|E
25|$|The {{light of}} Greece {{may be another}} {{important}} factor {{in the development of the}} particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely <b>bright,</b> <b>with</b> both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to the light on it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail. The gleaming marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with the ever-changing light of day.|$|E

25|$|The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is an {{emission}} nebula that {{is located}} 5,000 light-years from Earth and measures 140 light-years by 60 light-years (1.5°). Though it appears grey in telescopes to the unaided eye, long-exposure photographs reveal its pink hue, common to emission nebulae. It is fairly <b>bright,</b> <b>with</b> an integrated magnitude of 3.0. The Lagoon Nebula was discovered independently by John Flamsteed in 1680, Guillaume Le Gentil in 1747, and Charles Messier in 1764. The central {{area of the}} Lagoon Nebula {{is also known as}} the Hourglass Nebula, so named for its distinctive shape. The Hourglass Nebula has its shape because of matter propelled by Herschel 36. The Lagoon Nebula also features three dark nebulae catalogued in Barnard's Catalog. The Lagoon Nebula was instrumental in the discovery of Bok globules, as Bart Bok studied prints of the nebula intensively in 1947. Approximately 17,000 Bok globules were discovered in the nebula nine years later {{as a part of the}} Palomar Sky Survey; studies later showed that Bok's hypothesis that the globules held protostars was correct.|$|E
25|$|The {{optical effect}} of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less {{dependent}} on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear <b>bright</b> <b>with</b> no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, in particular in smartphones such as iPhones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied {{for a long period}} of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).|$|E

2500|$|Neon was {{discovered}} in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. After obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [...] "electrical gas-discharge" [...] tube that {{was similar to the}} tubes used for neon signs today. Georges Claude, a French engineer and inventor, presented neon tube lighting in essentially its modern form at the Paris Motor Show from December 3–18, 1910. Claude, sometimes called [...] "the Edison of France", had a near monopoly on the new technology, which became very popular for signage and displays in the period 1920-1940. Neon lighting was an important cultural phenomenon in the United States in that era; by 1940, the downtowns of nearly every city in the US were <b>bright</b> <b>with</b> neon signage, and Times Square in New York City was known worldwide for its neon extravagances. [...] There were 2000 shops nationwide designing and fabricating neon signs. The popularity, intricacy, and scale of neon signage for advertising declined in the U.S. following the Second World War (1939–1945), but development continued vigorously in Japan, Iran, and some other countries. In recent decades architects and artists, in addition to sign designers, have again adopted neon tube lighting as a component in their works.|$|E
2500|$|George Boleyn was {{beheaded}} on Tower Hill on 17 May 1536 {{before a}} large crowd. His final speech was chiefly concerned with promoting his new-found Protestant faith. Four other men, {{one of them}} a commoner, were executed alongside him, also accused of having been Anne's lovers. Only the commoner, Mark Smeaton, a musician, had confessed and it was reported that he had been savagely tortured into doing so. (Members of the aristocracy and gentry could not legally be tortured.) Anne was executed two days later, beheaded by a French swordsman, within the walls of the Tower of London. Anne's poise and courage at the scaffold were much commented upon and public opinion {{in the weeks and months}} after often [...] "made of Anne a persecuted heroine, <b>bright</b> <b>with</b> promise and goodness as a young woman, beautiful and elegant." [...] It is not known whether Jane witnessed the execution of either her husband or her sister-in-law, but the posthumous sympathy Anne aroused in many (particularly sentimentalists) meant that many of those linked to her fall were cast in the roles of villains. According to Julia Fox, this mindset explains how Jane's actions were construed as being those of a cruel and jealous intriguer.|$|E
