5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested {{and a lot of}} money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that {{something had to be done}} to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E
500|$|The {{resignation}} of Saleh and Atmar came amidst heavy disagreement between Hamid Karzai and Amrullah Saleh {{on how to}} proceed against the Taliban. [...] Daoud Sultanzoi, {{a member of the}} Afghan parliament, said, he had observed that disagreement between Karzai on the one side and cabinet members such as Saleh and Atmar on the other side had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. Saleh publicly blamed Pakistan for its support to the Taliban and other extremist groups and said talks with the Taliban should take place but not at the cost of democratic structures. Meanwhile, Karzai had increasingly been placing his hopes on his attempts to reach a secret deal with the Taliban and Pakistan. Pakistan had repeatedly urged Karzai to oust Saleh from his position.|$|E
500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time and that he intended {{to put an end to}} it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. Ike sat down to have another drink, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp [...] "You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning." ...|$|E

500|$|On 15 June 2015, Reuters {{reported}} that Airbus was discussing a stretched {{version of the}} A380 with a half dozen customers. [...] This aircraft, which could also feature new engines, would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. [...] Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021. [...] On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier stated that the company will build {{a new version of}} the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines. Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (neo for new engine option) had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months after earlier press releases in 2014, and in 2015 the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018 or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900 and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. [...] Brégier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020. The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all-new options from Rolls-Royce, ranging from derivatives of the A350's XWB-84/97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020.|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions. The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time now, right under our noses." ...|$|E

It's very hard to get the proper training as a Chicago police officer and that's something that has <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very long time. There is certainly a percentage of my members who believe that the Chicago Police Department doesn't offer the same level of training, or the same opportunities to obtain training, as many other police departments in the country.

2500|$|The large {{severance}} payments {{given to}} departing BBC executives came to widespread media attention in 2013 when the National Audit Office conducted {{an investigation into}} BBC senior management pay. The practice had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of years. Senior executives whose payments were criticised included: chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who received a total of £680,400 on her departure in 2011; Deputy Director-General Mark Byford who also left the BBC in 2011, taking £949,000; CEO of BBC Worldwide John Smith who was paid a total of £1,031,000 in 2011 (he later returned £205,000); George Entwistle who left the Director-General job after only 54 days following the Savile crisis, and received a payment of £511,500; and Roly Keating, the Head of BBC Archives, who received a £375,000 severance payment in 2012 (which he later repaid in full). Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, criticised the practice, calling it an [...] "outrageous waste of licence fee payers' money." [...] Following his appointment as Director General, Lord Hall introduced a £150,000 cap on severance payments. Mark Thompson stated to the PAC that the payments had been fully approved by the BBC Trust.|$|E

60|$|When I.O.U.'s {{have for}} some time passed freely in such a company as that now {{assembled}} the sudden introduction of a stranger is very disagreeable, particularly when that stranger intends to start for San Francisco on the following morning.
