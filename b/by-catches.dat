40|$|Baltic seals are {{recovering}} after {{a population}} decline. The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with {{an unknown number}} of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the <b>by-catch</b> of seals [...] the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the <b>by-catch</b> of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the <b>by-catch</b> in areas where interview data was not available. We provide {{a detailed description of the}} survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report <b>by-catch</b> and how this may affect the results. Our analysis shows that the total yearly <b>by-catch</b> by trap and gill nets in Finland, Sweden and Estonia is, with 90 % probability, more than 1240 but less than 2860; and the posterior median and mean of the total <b>by-catch</b> are 1550 and 1880 seals, respectively. Trap nets make about 88 % of the total <b>by-catch.</b> However, results also indicate that in one of the sub-areas of this study, fishermen may have underreported their <b>by-catch.</b> Taking the possible underreporting into account the posterior mean of the total <b>by-catch</b> is between 2180 and 2380.

50|$|The shrimp variety {{includes}} the species of Penaeus indicus and Penaeus monodon among 12 other. Surveys in the Arabian Sea indicate that commercial species of crustaceans like shrimps and lobsters are overexploited. Crabs, cephalopods and other molluscs are an unconventional resource. However, {{there is a}} potential in the export market as a substitute for these. Demersal fish resources show signs of being exploited, hence only limited expansion of catch is possible in future. There may be a possibility of expanding the catch the small pelagic fish resources by venturing further offshore. It is very much likely that the fishermen would have to consider using new fishing methods in order to achieve this. As for the larger variety of pelagic fish, especially Skipjack tuna and its relatives, are available in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Pakistan in the Karachi District. Fishing for these usually result in <b>by-catches</b> of marlin and shark species. Local fishing fleet commonly harvests the species of Frigate mackerel, Indian mackerel, Spanish mackerel, barracuda and dolphinfish. The production figures of 2006 showed overexploitation relative to maximum sustainable yield level. A large variety of mesopelagic fish exist just off the continental shelf and are barely exploited. These resources are prime candidates for conversion to fishmeal for use in poultry and aquaculture but no commercial use is available in the country. Mussels, oysters, clams, seaweed, kelp, sea urchins and other marine resources also exist in Pakistan but further research data is required in order to evaluate the feasibility of propagating the mariculture of these varieties.|$|E

50|$|Any {{fish that}} crosses {{the path of}} a drift net in the ocean may be tangled or caught in the net. Non-target {{individuals}} caught in the net are called <b>by-catch.</b> In 1994 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) estimated global <b>by-catch</b> rates to be as high as 27 million tons of fish discarded by fisheries each year.

40|$|Tropical shrimp {{trawling}} fisheries {{are generally}} known {{to capture a}} large amount of unwanted organisms along with the targeted shrimp. To reduce this <b>by-catch,</b> the fishery for Atlantic seabob shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri in Suriname uses nets fitted Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and <b>By-catch</b> Reduction Devices (BRDs). It is unclear, however, to what extend these selectivity measures, designed to reduce capture of marine turtles and small roundfish respectively, are reducing <b>by-catch</b> of rays. Due to their life-history characteristics, rays (Batoidea; Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are generally vulnerable to overexploitation and several endangered species are known to occur in Surinamese waters. The objective of this study therefore is to assess the effect of the selectivity devices currently in place (TEDs and BRDs) on ray <b>by-catch</b> in the X. kroyeri trawling fishery. Hereto, sixty-five simultaneous catch-comparison hauls were conducted, comparing ray <b>by-catch</b> in trawls fitted with (test-net) and without (control-net) TEDs and BRDs. Five different ray species occurred in the <b>by-catch,</b> Gymnura micrura and Dasyatis guttata being the dominant species. Overall, catch rate of rays was reduced by 36 % in the test-net. Moreover, rays that did end up in the test-net codend were on average 21 % smaller than those in the control-net. This confirms the presumption that rays escape through TEDs rather than BRDs, smaller individuals being able to pass through the TED, but larger ones being guided to the escape opening {{at the bottom of the}} net. TEDs were most efficient in excluding Dasyatis geijskesi, the largest ray species. <b>By-catch</b> of D. guttata was reduced as well, but exclusion was highly dependent on size. A similar, but less pronounced relationship between size and exclusion rate was observed for G. micrura. Nevertheless, large individuals of both species were relatively rare, the bulk of the ray <b>by-catch</b> being made up by small sized (G. micrura and D. guttata, complemented with Urotrygon microphthalmum, a small-sized species. Although TEDs and BRDs seem efficient in reducing <b>by-catch</b> of large rays, they seem inappropriate to protect small-sized individuals, which are more abundant in the population. We therefore suggest that further <b>by-catch</b> related efforts in this fishery are concentrated on reducing the incidental capture of small-sized rays...|$|R

40|$|The total net {{costs of}} the {{introduction}} of a landing obligation for the Dutch fishing fleet are estimated to amount to between 6 and 28 million euros, depending on {{the way in which the}} quotas are modified and the prices of the <b>by-catches</b> to be landed. In this regard, it is assumed that the catch composition and all fishing activities will be the same as in the baseline year (2011). This study therefore says nothing about how fishermen could modify their fishing activities in order to reduce the {{costs of the}} landing obligation, and what the effects of such a modification would be. In the event that the catch quotas remain the same as the current quotas plus discards (scenario 1), the costs of the landing obligation for the entire Dutch offshore fishing fleet would amount to between 6 and 14 million euros. By far the largest share of these costs would be borne by the cutter sector. The additional revenues from the landed <b>by-catches</b> are greatly dependent on the prices at which they can be sold, and do not compensate for the extra costs incurred in order to land the <b>by-catches.</b> The additional costs for full monitoring of all fishing trips by means of cameras would amount to approximately 6 million euros.
