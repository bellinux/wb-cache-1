5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a <b>broken</b> <b>arm.</b> They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E

5|$|Managing the NL All-Star Team in 1960, Alston {{attracted}} {{some controversy}} {{when he left}} Milwaukee Braves pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette off the All-Star roster. An Associated Press report said the omission {{may have been a}} snub directed at Dressen, who was by then managing in Milwaukee. The 1960 Dodgers finished in fourth place. The following year, the team finished in second place after veteran Duke Snider missed two months with a <b>broken</b> <b>arm.</b> The Dodgers lost the lead in the 1962 NL pennant race and rumors surfaced that Alston and coach Leo Durocher might be fired, but the team retained both men for 1963.|$|E
5|$|Success exposed TISM to {{mainstream}} Australian radio and television, {{most of which}} was perplexed by the band's guerrilla approach to interviews and {{lack of interest in}} the music industry. A four CD box set of early albums was released and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand. In 1996 TISM toured on the Big Day Out, during which Ron Hitler-Barassi was either absent or wheelchair-bound due to a detached retina and <b>broken</b> <b>arm</b> caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour. Later the same year, TISM toured England, the group's sole Northern Hemisphere excursion.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} marred {{by a series of}} {{hooligan}} incidents occurring near the stadium. It was being played the day before a Cardiff City game; a group of Cardiff City fans entered the Prince of Wales public house in the city to find it occupied by Manchester United fans staying in the city overnight. A series of running battles between fans of the two clubs followed, resulting in 22 arrests (including two boys aged just 11 and 13) as well as a man suffering stab wounds and a police officer suffering a <b>broken</b> <b>arm.</b> On the day of the game, an army of around 50 Cardiff and Liverpool hooligans were seen attacking United supporters in the Wood Street area.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} at left offensive tackle from 1970 to 1972, and missing only one game in that span, Key {{was moved to}} left guard for the 1973 season. He played in 12 games in 1973, missing two due to injury, and all 14 games in 1974, despite suffering hand and thumb injuries {{in a game against}} the Washington Redskins. During the 1975 season, he suffered a knee injury during mini-camp in May that required surgery, a dislocated toe in {{the first game of the}} season against the New York Giants that was thought to take at least six weeks to recover from, and a fractured forearm in practice on October 16 that also required surgery. He was placed on injured reserve due to the <b>broken</b> <b>arm</b> on October 17 after playing in only two games during the season. From 1976 to 1978, he played in 40 games and started in 39 of them.|$|E
5|$|Fraser {{was working}} as a {{journalist}} on The Glasgow Herald when he wrote the first novel, Flashman; writing in the evenings, after work, he took 90hours in total to write the story. After the book was published, he left journalism and took up writing novels. When a break from writing was forced upon him by a <b>broken</b> <b>arm,</b> he abandoned the book until his wife read the manuscript and urged him to finish. He did not find a publisher for the novel for two years, until Barrie & Jenkins published it in 1969. When the novel was published in the US the same year, of the 34 reviews read by Alden Whitman of The New York Times, ten of them considered the book to be a genuine autobiography. Fraser researched each novel at Trinity College, Dublin. From their first publication, the books were a commercial success, and new editions appeared on the best-sellers' lists.|$|E

5|$|His {{impressive}} form {{during the}} second half of the 2015–16 season saw him handed a new contract during the summer, keeping him at Cardiff until summer 2019. After featuring as an unused substitute during the first match of the 2016–17 season, O'Keefe was handed his first appearance of the season in a 1–0 defeat to Bristol Rovers in the first round of the EFL Cup, where he suffered a <b>broken</b> <b>arm</b> in extra-time. He made his return to the team one month later on 25 September, helping Cardiff to their second win of the season during a 2–1 win against Rotherham United. However, with first-team opportunities limited at Cardiff, on 31 January 2017, O'Keefe joined League One club Milton Keynes Dons on loan until 1 May 2017, making his debut for the club as a substitute in place of Chuks Aneke during a 1–1 draw with Bolton Wanderers on 4 February 2017. He made a total of 18 appearances during the loan spell, scoring four times.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a <b>broken</b> <b>arm</b> makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} the Luftwaffe was sending {{increased}} numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters over England, at night and at low-level. They were able to hit the coastal areas and their speed and agility meant they were a difficult prospect to intercept. The German pilots were disadvantaged in some respects. There {{was a lack of}} nigh-flying experience in these units, the Fw 190s did not carry radar and had a short range. Aside from a small mirror, the pilot could not always see behind him well enough at night. On 16 May 1943 the Fw 190s lost four and probably a fifth to 85 Squadron. On 13 June 1943 Cunningham intercepted an Fw 190 not far from his airfield at West Malling. The GCI controller telephoned the crew-room to notify them the commanding officer was closing on an enemy aircraft heading to London. They heard both aircraft and the brief burst of fire followed by the explosion. To his amazement, Cunningham later learned the pilot—Leutnant Ullrich from 3./Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (Fast Bomber Wing 10—SKG 10)—was thrown through the canopy as the Fw 190A-5, Werknummer, 840047 code CO+LT, fell earthwards. He deployed his parachute and was picked up by a searchlight crew with a <b>broken</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the growing}} Caribbean {{following}} in England, the West Indies entered the series {{as one of}} the most popular touring nations. Lance Gibbs' 11 wickets at Old Trafford set up a commanding 10 wicket win for the West Indies. The second match at Lord's was chiefly remembered for its dramatic ending; all results were possible going into the final over of the match. England required eight runs to win but only had two wickets left. From the fourth ball of the over Derek Shackleton was run out, which meant that Colin Cowdrey had to come out with a <b>broken</b> <b>arm</b> with two balls of the match remaining. He did not have to face a ball, and the match ended in a draw. The third Test saw Fred Trueman claim 12 wickets ensuring England won by 217 runs. Charlie Griffith's 6/36 in the fourth and Conrad Hunte's 108 in the final Test meant the West Indies won the next two Tests and the series finished 3–1. The final Test saw a pitch invasion when Basil Butcher scored the winning runs for the West Indies.|$|E
