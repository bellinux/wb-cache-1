50|$|If {{the organic}} {{polymerization}} {{occurs in the}} presence of an inorganic material to form the hybrid material one has to distinguish between several possibilities to overcome the incompatibility of the two species. The inorganic material can either have no surface functionalization but the <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> surface; it can be modified with nonreactive organic groups (e.g. alkyl chains); or it can contain reactive surface groups such as polymerizable functionalities. Depending on these prerequisites the material can be pretreated, for example a pure inorganic surface can be treated with surfactants or silane coupling agents to make it compatible with the organic monomers, or functional monomers can be added that react with the surface of the inorganic material. If the inorganic component has nonreactive organic groups attached to its surface and it can be dissolved in a monomer which is subsequently polymerized, the resulting material after the organic polymerization, is a blend. In this case the inorganic component interact only weakly or not at all with the organic polymer; hence, a class I material is formed. Homogeneous materials are only obtained in this case if agglomeration of the inorganic components in the organic environment is prevented. This can be achieved if the interactions between the inorganic components and the monomers are better or at least the same as between the inorganic components. However, if no strong chemical interactions are formed, the long-term stability of a once homogeneous material is questionable because of diffusion effects in the resulting hybrid material. The stronger the respective interaction between the components, the more stable is the final material. The strongest interaction is achieved if class II materials are formed, for example with covalent interactions.|$|E

The PPy/Co 0. 2 CrOx composites increase the reversible capacity of the electrochemically active material up to 20 %.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between nanosized particles and living systems are commonly mediated by what adsorbs to the nanoparticle {{in the biological}} environment, its biomolecular corona, rather than the pristine surface. Here, we characterize the adhesion toward the cell membrane of nanoparticles of different material and size and study how this is modulated by {{the presence or absence}} of a corona on the nanoparticle surface. The results are corroborated with adsorption to simple model supported lipid bilayers using a quartz crystal microbalance. We conclude that the adsorption of proteins on the nanoparticle surface strongly reduces nanoparticle adhesion in comparison to what is observed for the <b>bare</b> <b>material.</b> Nanoparticle uptake is described as a two-step process, where the nanoparticles initially adhere to the cell membrane and subsequently are internalized by the cells via energy-dependent pathways. The lowered adhesion in the presence of proteins thereby causes a concomitant decrease in nanoparticle uptake efficiency. The presence of a biomolecular corona may confer specific {{interactions between}} the nanoparticle-corona complex and the cell surface including triggering of regulated cell uptake. An important effect of the corona is, however, a reduction in the purely unspecific interactions between the <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> and the cell membrane, which in itself disregarding specific interactions, causes a decrease in cellular uptake. We suggest that future nanoparticle-cell studies include, together with characterization of size, charge, and dispersion stability, an evaluation of the adhesion properties of the material to relevant membranes. ...|$|E

40|$|Cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) alloys {{have been}} {{reported}} difficult to bond directly on hard tissues owing to encapsulation by fibrous tissues. Several {{attempts have been made}} to improve the situation including coating with a bioactive layer which is mainly hydroxyapatite (HA). Various HA coating methods have been introduced but massive micro crack surface, delamination and low adhesion strength of HA coating are still the major concerns that cause the harmful release of metal ions. In this study, an oxide interlayer on Co-Cr-Mo alloys was developed through thermal oxidation prior to HA coating with the objective to provide better anchorage of HA coatings on the substrate surface, reduce metal ions release and at the same time enhancing the cell attachment. The thermal oxidation process was conducted in a muffle furnace at different temperatures (850 °C, 1050 °C and 1250 °C) for 3 hours to create an oxide interlayer on the substrate surface. It was followed by coating HA on the <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> and on the oxidized substrates using sol gel dip coating technique. Scratch test results showed that the bonding strength of the HA on the oxide interlayer is markedly higher than the HA coated substrates without oxide interlayer. It seems that rough surface of oxide interlayer provides better mechanical interlocking of HA particles to the substrate surface. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) test illustrated that the release of Co and Cr ions from the HA coated oxidized substrates reduced significantly after 28 days immersion as compared to <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> and HA coated substrates without oxide interlayer. This indicates that oxide interlayer is able to act as an additional barrier to suppress the metal ions release. Similarly, the HA coated substrates with oxide interlayer demonstrate strong attachment and proliferation of cells than the HA coated substrates without oxide interlayer. It is concluded that the introduction of an intermediate oxide layer on Co-Cr-Mo substrate prior to HA coating has shown a positive effect in terms of increment of the adhesion strength of HA coating as well as cell bioactivity performance...|$|E

Large volumes of mine waste, such as tailings, have been generated in some areas. Mine waste is highly susceptible to both water and wind erosion, it may create moderate to severe chemical imbalances or toxicities and has a severe abrasive effect on seedlings, a low water-holding capacity and is prone to compaction and crusting. Biogeotextiles are potentially effective and economically-viable erosion control products. The main objective of the study reported herein was to establish the erosion control properties of palm-mats by determining erosion-related variables via rainfall simulation. The textiles were manufactured from the leaves of the Lala palm (Hyphaene coriacea) and covered about 40 % of the tailing surface. Ten representative samples of South African mine waste materials were collected for the rainfall simulator studies. Measured erosion parameters included; runoff, sediment load in runoff and interrill erodibility. Seven samples were sand-textured and three were silty. Sediment load was not dependent on exchangeable sodium or organic matter contents, but prominently associated with pH, silt percentage and the quartz content in the clay fraction.

Erosion parameters studied included runoff (RO), sediment load in the runoff (SL), percentage of stable aggregates (SA), final infiltration rate (FI) and inter-rill erodibility (Ki). Thirty samples, representative of South African soils and mine tailings, were investigated. The soils varied considerably with respect to their textural, chemical and mineralogical properties in line with soil taxonomy, annual precipitation and geological substrate. Tailing sample selection was based on the dominant type of mine. Erosion parameters varied greatly within, but to a much lower extent between, the two different types of material. Several significant correlations were obtained. Sediment load had the best correlation with kaolinite content and with fine sand content, while for runoff, the best correlation was with organic carbon content.

40|$|Fatigue {{testing was}} {{performed}} on two age hardened high strength aluminum alloys (AA 2024 T 351 and AA 7075 T 6) at ultrasonic frequencies of around 20 kHz in fully reversed axial loading (R = - 1). Tests were carried out on flat and riblet structured thin sheets in order to evaluate their usability for a novel technique for aerodynamicdrag reduction {{as well as for}} gaining further insight into the relevant degradation and failure mechanisms. The studied riblets were of semi-circular geometry and produced by a flat rolling process which was developed at the Institute of Metal Forming (RWTH Aachen University). Important aspects of the present work are the influence of commercially pure CP Al claddings – which are frequently used for the prevention of corrosion – as well as of different riblet dimensions on the fatigue performance. Whereas the <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> shows a continuous transition from high cycle fatigue (HCF) to very high cycle fatigue (VHCF), for clad sheets a sharp transition from HCF failure (up to some 1 e 6 cycles) to run-outs (at ≥ some 1 e 9 cycles) is observed. Particularly in the megacycle regime, the fatigue life of the structured <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> is – compared to the non-structured case – significantly reduced by stress concentrations induced by the surface structure. However, the fatigue performance of clad material is not negatively affected by the riblets. In this case, the threshold value at which the transition from HCF failure to run-outs occurs was even higher than in the flat case. The transition stress differs with cladding thickness as well as with riblet geometry. Fatigue cracks are – even in the case of run-outs – always initiated at the surface of the clad layer and grow easily to the substrate. Specimens only fail, if the threshold for further crack growth into the substrate is exceeded. The fatigue limit of both, the flat and riblet structured clad material can thus be described by a fracture mechanics approach using a Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram. In the case of structured clad material, the threshold for fatigue failure is not only directly affected by the remaining thickness of the cladding below the riblet structure. Finite element (FEM) simulations demonstrate that due to plastic deformation a stress redistribution in the CP Al layer occurs which modifies the effective stress at the interface (cladding / substrate). The effective interface stress is thus as well a function of cladding thickness, which therefore, besides the direct effect, also indirectly influences the stress intensity of through-cladding cracks. Further FEM simulations demonstrate that riblets can be optimized with respect to VHCF performance, if the thickness of the clad layer below the riblet valleys is around 25 % of the riblet diameter. The failure mechanisms of both tested alloys are similar to each other. Further aspects covered in this work are a detailed analysis of material changes induced by the structuring process {{and the development of a}} bending testing setup in which the loading conditions resemble the exposure during use in active drag reduction systems...|$|E

To extend the oxidation resistance granted up to 750 °C of <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> protective coatings are commonly used. A novel approach is the use of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on γ-TiAl, typically applied to nickel-based superalloys. This allows to reduce the metal surface temperatures in combination with component cooling for use in high temperature range. The paper is focussed on both development of oxidation resistant coatings as well as thermal barrier coatings for gamma titanium aluminides. Ti-Al-Cr-Y nitride and metallic overlay coatings based on Ti-Al-Cr were produced by magnetron sputtering techniques. Both coatings provide excellent oxidation protection for γ-TiAl alloys in air at 750 °C. EB-PVD partially-yttria-stabilized zirconia TBCs were deposited on Ti- 45 Al- 8 Nb, either pre-oxidized or coated with various "bond coats" mentioned above.

Furthermore the effect of several deposition temperatures, 820 °C and 900 °C, for TBCs in combination with oxidation resistant coatings will be examined. Discussing appeared effects due to diffusion processes post-oxidation SEM/EDX analysis in combination with oxidation behaviour and lifetime of the coating systems will be presented. ...|$|E

As those are very much influenced by the frictional drag of the airplane, a reduction of skin friction which causes {{a major portion of}} total aerodynamic drag is desirable. One possible approach for passive drag reduction is the application of riblets small longitudinal grooves orientated in flow direction. Through an adapted rolling process, riblets can be brought into metal sheets on a large scale. For this process a thin high-strength steel wire is wound around a work roll to structure it with the negative riblet imprint. In a subsequent step the riblet profile is rolled into the sheet material. Different parameters can influence the process {{and the quality of the}} resulting riblet structure. Those parameters that depend on the sheets sheet thickness, material strength, and composition of the sheet are discussed in this paper. Form filling is used as an indicator for riblet quality. It is found that decreasing sheet thickness is beneficial for form filling, but a process dependent minimum sheet thickness exists for which this effect will reverse. Material strength is found to have a much smaller influence on form filling. Nevertheless, harder alloys seem to need a slightly smaller thickness reduction, but higher rolling forces and pressures to achieve desired form filling. Using clad instead of <b>bare</b> <b>materials</b> has a positive influence on form filling and riblet structuring. Furthermore, riblet rolling does not reduce the fatigue strength of the clad material...|$|R

After Al 2 O 3 coating, the surface reactivity was clearly decreasing for both LiCoO 2 and NMC materials. In addition, for LiCoO 2, the coating modifies the surface reactivity with the identification of both sulfate and sulfite species. This result is in line with a change in the adsorption mode from redox toward acidbase after Al/Co substitution. In the case of NMC materials, the coating induced a decrease of the sulfite species content at the surface. This phenomenon can be related to the cation mixing effect in the NMC...|$|R

One sealant, the PRC-DeSoto PR- 1432 GP and several surface treatments were examined. The surface treatments attempted were AlClad, Chromic Acid Anodization on bare sheets, and Alodine chemical conversion coating on bare sheets. Bare sheets without a surface treatment were also evaluated to establish a baseline comparison. Ultimate lap shear testing {{was based on the}} unguided NASM 1312 - 4 2 -spot weld coupon configuration and the guided NASM 1312 - 21 4 -spot weld coupon configuration. Results indicated that the sealants and surface treatments decreased the joint strength of the individual spot welded joints a relatively small amount compared to the <b>bare</b> <b>material</b> strength. However, the sealant’s adhesive properties can potentially compensate for this loss if there is sufficient sealant coverage. The guided NASM 1312 - 21 4 -spot weld coupon configuration was used for fatigue testing. Uniform amplitude fatigue tests were conducted with a variety of load levels to generate a load-life curve. The sealants and surface treatment seemed to have no effect on fatigue life at medium to low fatigue load levels. However, at high fatigue load levels, the sealants and surface treatments were slightly detrimental. The fatigue lives of the swept FSSW coupons was less than those of the NAS 1097 AD 4 riveted coupons at the medium to low loads. However, the swept FSSW coupons were not optimized for fatigue and may improve under such conditions. The results of the corrosion testing indicated that the integrity of the sealant was not compromised by the swept FSSW. Generally, the surface treatments were not affected by the FSSW operation except where the tools displaced the surface and on the anvil side of the coupon in the heat affected zone. Since these areas are more vulnerable to corrosion, some protection should be added after welding. In general, the results {{of this project}} show that swept FSSW can successfully weld through sealants and surface treatments with only a minimum loss of the ultimate strength or fatigue life of the joint. The FSSW operation can be performed while maintaining most of the corrosion resistance...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{production}} and storage are important issues that {{play a key}} role in our daily lives. There is a need for high energy and high power systems for portable electronic devices and zero-emission vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries are crucial in addressing these needs. However, for the smart electric grid and renewable energy storage where cost is critical but weight and footprint requirement is less important, the sodium-ion battery is the most suitable power sources. To achieve both high power density and high energy density, nanostructured sphere particles with controlled porosity and high tapping density are desired for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. The versatile and facile ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method allows for the synthesis of a variety of electrode materials with sphere morphology. Work has been done to develop electrode materials through an aerosol method that can be readily applied to industry. 	Two classes of high energy cathodes suitable for lithium-ion batteries were studied. These include the 5 V spinels and lithium-rich materials. The 5 V spinels are a promising class of electrodes for secondary lithium batteries. This class of material has the highest intrinsic rate capability of the intercalation cathodes with high safety, low toxicity, and low cost making it ideal for high-power applications such as electric vehicles, while the lithium-rich compounds exhibit high capacity and reasonable cycle stability. 	Two classes of stable cathodes suitable for sodium-ion batteries were studied. The first was carbon coated porous hollow Na 2 FePO 4 F spheres with 500 nm diameter and 80 nm wall thickness synthesized by a one-step template-free ultrasonic spray pyrolysis process using sucrose as the carbon source. Nano-sized porous hollow Na 2 FePO 4 F spheres allow electrolyte to penetrate into the hollow structure, and thus the electrochemical reaction can take place on both the outside and inside surface and in the pores. Also, the carbon coating on Na 2 FePO 4 F hollow spheres enhances the electronic conductivity and charge transfer reaction kinetics. The exceptional performance of hollow Na 2 FePO 4 F spheres combined with mature aerosol spray synthesis technology make these carbon coated porous hollow Na 2 FePO 4 F spheres very promising as cathode materials for practical applications in Na-ion batteries. Finally, P 2 -type earth abundant layered oxides with high energy density and long cycling stability were also developed and studied. These layered materials were investigated due to their high theoretical capacity. 	A novel ultrasonic spray pyrolysis system has been developed to effectively coat any cathode, including layered oxides, with a thin layer of carbon to improve the kinetics and increase the electronic conductivity. The residence time in air is sufficiently short to allow the decomposition of the carbon source (sucrose) without further reduction of the cathode material. A vertical configuration allows the solid particles to reach the filter for collection with high efficiency. As a test sample, lithium-rich cathodes have been successfully carbon coated and compared with the <b>bare</b> <b>material...</b>|$|E
