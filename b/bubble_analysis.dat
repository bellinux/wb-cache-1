Approval probability of subprime loans was not affected by higher loan to value ratios. At the loan level, the approval probability of subprime applications is also positively associated with past home price appreciation. These results differ for prime mortgages. ...|$|E
40|$|Simulations of the {{formation}} of small steam bubbles indicate that the rate of growth of bubbles is very sensitive to the rate of evaporation of the micro-layer of liquid beneath the bubble. Such evaporation is rapid, and is modelled as being driven by the large heat flux through the thin liquid layer caused by the difference in temperature between the solid–liquid interface, and the saturation temperature in the interior of the bubble. However, application of this approach to recent experimental measurements of Jung and Kim generated anomalous results. In this paper we demonstrate that a model of the micro-layer heat flux that includes an allowance for the finite evaporative thermal resistance is able to eliminate these anomalies. This evaporative thermal resistance is a consequence of near-interface molecular dynamics, characterised by a quantity termed ‘evaporation coefficient’. Whilst in most engineering applications evaporative thermal resistance is small compared to conductive resistance, here, with the micro-layer thickness ranging from a few microns down to zero, it becomes of considerable importance. Selection of a molecular ‘evaporation coefficient’ to restore consistency to the anomalous measurements allows a plausible numerical value to be inferred. For the several times and multiple locations studied, a fairly consistent value of between 0. 02 and 0. 1 is indicated, (for saturated water in laboratory conditions), which itself is consistent with earlier literature values of this rather difficult quantity. It is shown that the evaporative resistance always represents a large fraction of the conductive resistance, and for important phases of the process dominates it. The need for inclusion of this phenomenon in the micro-layer models used in <b>bubble</b> <b>analysis</b> is clear...|$|E

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{development of}} the Western Hemisphere warm pool and its four geographic subregions are analyzed. The subregional warm pools of the eastern North Pacific and equatorial Atlantic are best developed in the boreal spring, while in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, the highest temperatures prevail during the early and late summer, respectively. For the defining isotherms chosen (>= 27. 5 degrees, >= 28. 0 degrees, >= 28. 5 degrees C) the warm pool depths {{are similar to the}} mixed-layer depth (20 - 40 m) but are considerably less than the Indo-Pacific warm pool depth (50 - 60 m). The beat balance of the WHWP subregions is examined through two successive types of analysis: first by considering a changing volume ("bubble") bounded by constant temperature wherein advective fluxes disappear and diffusive fluxes can be estimated as a residual, and second by considering a slab layer of constant dimensions with the bubble diffusion estimates as an additional input and the advective heat flux divergence as a residual output. From this sequential procedure it is possible to disqualify as being physically inconsistent four of seven surface heat flux climatologies: the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (NCEP 1) and the ECMWF 15 -yr global reanalysis (ERA- 15) because they yield a nonphysical diffusion of heat into the warm pools from their cooler surroundings, and the unconstrained da Silva and Southampton datasets because their estimated diffusion rates are inconsistent with the smaller rates of the better understood Indo-Pacific warm pool when the <b>bubble</b> <b>analysis</b> is applied to both regions.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present a review {{of some of the}} recent {{advances}} in our understanding of the dynamics and acoustics of cavitating flows. We focus first on the individual events which evolve from a single travelling nucleus and describe observations of the intricate micro-fluid-mechanics which affect both the bubble shape and the subsequent emission of noise. These phenomena have important consequences in terms of their implications for the scaling of cavitation damage and noise. We also present calculations of the interaction between the individual traveling bubbles and the irrotational flow outside of the boundary layer of the headform. Comparisons of predicted and experimentally observed bubble shapes show qualitative agreement but further work is necessary to understand the details of the interactions between the viscous boundary layer and the bubble. To model the processes of cavitation inception, noise and damage it is necessary to generate a model of the cavitation event rate which can then be coupled with the consequences of the individual events. In the second part of this paper we describe recent efforts to connect the observed event rates to the measured distributions of cavitation nuclei in the oncoming stream. Such studies necessarily raise questions regarding the nuclei distributions in water tunnels and in the ocean and it would seem that we still know little of the nuclei population dynamics in either context. This is illustrated by a few observations of the population dynamics in a particular facility. The third subject addressed in this paper is the question of the noise produced by an individual travelling cavitation event. It is shown that the distortions in the shape of cavitation bubbles leads to acoustic impulses which are about an order of magnitude smaller than those predicted by the spherical bubble dynamics of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. However, at the higher cavitation numbers, the upper bound on the experimental impulses scales with speed and size much as one would expect from the spherical <b>bubble</b> <b>analysis.</b> Initially, as the cavitation number is decreased, the impulse increases as expected. But, beyond a certain critical cavitation number, the noise again decreases in contrast to the expected increase. This phenomenon is probably caused by two effects, namely the interaction between events at the higher event densities and the reduction in the impulse due to a change in the dominant type of cavitation event. From the single event we then move to the larger scale structures and the interactions which occur when the density of the events becomes large and individual bubbles begin to interact. One of the more important interaction phenomena which occur results from the behaviour of a cloud of cavitation bubbles. Most previous theoretical studies of the dynamics of cavitating clouds have been linear or weakly non-linear analyses which have identified the natural frequencies and modes of cloud oscillation but have not, as yet, shown how a cloud would behave during the massively non-linear response in a cavitating flow. We present non-linear calculations which show the development of an inwardly propagating shock wave during the collapse phase of the motion. These observations confirm the earlier speculation of Mørch and his co-workers...|$|E

40|$|Rectangular dropshafts, {{commonly}} used in sewers and storm water systems, are characterised by significant flow aeration. New detailed air-water flow measurements were conducted in a near-full-scale dropshaft at large discharges. In the shaft pool and outflow channel, the results demonstrated the complexity of different competitive air entrainment mechanisms. Bubble size measurements showed {{a broad range of}} entrained <b>bubble</b> sizes. <b>Analysis</b> of streamwise distributions of bubbles suggested further some clustering process in the bubbly flow although, in the outflow channel, bubble chords were in average smaller than in the shaft pool. A robust hydrophone was tested to measure bubble acoustic spectra and to assess its field application potential. The acoustic results characterised accurately the order of magnitude of entrained bubble sizes, but the transformation from acoustic frequencies to bubble radii did not predict correctly the probability distribution functions of bubble sizes...|$|R
