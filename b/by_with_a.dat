5|$|Despite {{the spring}} {{classics}} season ending without any victories, Nygaard stated he felt {{satisfied with the}} many high placings the team had achieved, particularly {{in the face of}} Gilbert's clear strength. Additionally, Leopard Trek became the number one team in the UCI's rankings after Liège–Bastogne–Liège, a position they had occupied, to no small amount of criticism, before the season and before they officially existed. Nizzolo closed out the team's early-season account <b>by</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> podium finish at the inaugural ProRace Berlin, taking second in the mass sprint behind 's Marcel Kittel.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2013–14 season with further Champions League success in their sights. Celtic were drawn with Cliftonville {{in their first}} {{qualifying}} round and easily disposed of the Northern Irish champions 50 on aggregate. They were next drawn with IF Elfsborg and squeezed <b>by</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10 aggregate win, with Kris Commons scoring the only goal in the first leg at Celtic Park. Although favoured {{to qualify for the}} group stages with minimal challenge after being drawn with Kazakh champions Shakhter Karagandy, Celtic found themselves losing the first leg in Karagandy 20. Celtic returned to Scotland to an electric atmosphere at Celtic Park in the home leg, in what proved to be the high point of their 2013–14 Champions League campaign. They overcame the 20 deficit to level the aggregate thanks to goals by Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras. James Forrest completed the comeback for Celtic with a 90th-minute strike, sending Celtic Park into a frenzy.|$|E

The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood <b>by</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E

25|$|United {{began the}} season <b>by</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4–0 defeat from Kansas City at CommunityAmerica Ballpark on March 27. Their final match was a 3–2 loss to Toronto at RFK Stadium on October 23. Statistically, the 2010 season was United's worst overall season on record in MLS, {{tallying}} a record 20 losses, and 17 games being shut out, which broke the original record of 15. United also {{set the record}} for fewest goals scored in an MLS season (21) shattering the old record set by Toronto in 2007 when the Reds only scored 24. The poor record resulted in their head coach, Onalfo, being fired on August 4, becoming the first United coach in history to be fired during a regular season.

25|$|Cho {{found himself}} in the Judan once more, this time 14 years after his last bid as {{challenger}} in 1991 against Masaki Takemiya (Cho lost 3–2). Cho {{found himself in}} a league with old friends and rivals, including Masao Kato, Rin Kaiho, and Yoda Norimoto. The league also included young guns Cho U, Shinji Takao, and Keigo Yamashita. Keeping this in mind, it {{was not going to be}} an easy campaign for Cho. His first match was against Yujiro Hashimoto. Cho, holding black, won the match by resignation. In his next match, he found himself against another young powerhouse, Kimio Yamada. This time, holding white, Cho squeezed <b>by</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> win of just half a point. Cho continued his run, his next opponent being Naoto Hikosaka. Again holding white, Cho went on to win by 2 and a half points. His last match of the main tournament was against Tomoyasu Mimura, of which he held white once more, and cruised past by resignation. His opponent for the challenger final was Shinji Takao, who had beaten at then some of the top players in Japan, Masao Kato and Norimoto Yoda, on his way into the loser's section of the tournament. Cho took white in the game, and won by 1 and a half points. This made Cho the challenger for the 43rd Judan against title holder O Rissei. O had held the title for 4 straight years before being challenged by Cho. The final would prove to be an exciting one, as the first match ended with a half point win for Cho. The next match was a win for O, by 5 and a half points. The third match was a very large win for O, winning by 19 and a half points, which is unusual to see in pro games. This didn't stop Cho, as he would get revenge by forcing O into resignation in the fourth game. The fifth and last game would go Cho's way, with a 5 and a half point win over O. This was Cho's 68th title, and fourth time winning the Judan.|$|E
