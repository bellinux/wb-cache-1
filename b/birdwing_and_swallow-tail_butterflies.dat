60|$|For {{the first}} few weeks I was very unwell and could not go far from the house. The country was covered with low spiny shrubs and acacias, except in a little valley where a stream came down from the hills, where some fine trees and bushes shaded the water and formed a very {{pleasant}} place to ramble up. There were plenty of birds about, and of a tolerable variety of species; but very few of them were gaily coloured. Indeed, with one or two exceptions, the birds of this tropical island were hardly so ornamental as those of Great Britain. Beetles were so scarce that a collector might fairly say there were none, as the few obscure or uninteresting species would not repay him for the search. The only insects at all remarkable or interesting were the butterflies, which, though comparatively few in species, were sufficiently abundant, and comprised a large proportion of new or rare sorts. The banks of the stream formed my best collecting-ground, and I daily wandered up and down its shady bed, which about a mile up became rocky and precipitous. Here I obtained the rare <b>and</b> beautiful <b>swallow-tail</b> <b>butterflies,</b> Papilio aenomaus <b>and</b> P. liris; the males of which are quite unlike each other, and belong in fact to distinct sections of the genus, while the females are so much alike that they are undistinguishable on the wing, and to an uneducated eye equally so in the cabinet. Several other beautiful butterflies rewarded my search in this place, among which I may especially mention the Cethosia leschenaultii, whose wings of the deepest purple are bordered with buff in such a manner as to resemble at first sight our own Camberwell beauty, although it belongs to a different genus. The most abundant butterflies were the whites and yellows (Pieridae), several of which I had already found at Lombock and at Coupang, while others were new to me.|$|R
50|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{trees on}} which the larva of the <b>Swallow-tail</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Papilio demoleus) will feed other than species of citrus {{belonging}} to Rutaceae. The name 'Hippobromus' is Greek for 'smelling of horse urine', which it closely resembles. The specific name is Latin for 'few flowered'. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae, closely related to Rutaceae, together with over 100 other genera such as Sapindus, Litchi, Koelreuteria, Dodonaea and Blighia.|$|R
60|$|Choongtam {{boasts a}} profusion of {{beautiful}} insects, amongst which the British <b>swallow-tail</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Papilio Machaon) disports itself in company with magnificent black, gold, and scarlet-winged butterflies, of the Trojan group, so typical of the Indian tropics. At night my tent was filled with small water-beetles (Berosi) that quickly put out the candle; and with lovely moths came huge cockchafers (Encerris Griffithii), and enormous and foetid flying-bugs (of the genus Derecterix), which bear great horns on the thorax. The irritation of mosquito and midge bites, and the disgusting insects that clung with spiny legs to the blankets of my tent and bed, were often as effectual in banishing sleep, as were my anxious thoughts regarding the future.|$|R

6000|$|During my ten days' stay at Zemu Samdong, I {{formed a}} large {{collection}} of insects, {{which was in}} great part destroyed by damp: many were new, beautiful, and particularly interesting, from belonging to types whose geographical distribution is analogous {{to that of the}} vegetation. The caterpillar of the <b>swallow-tail</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Papilio Machaon), was common, feeding on umbelliferous plants, as in England; and a Sphynx (like S. Euphorbiae) was devouring the euphorbias; the English Cynthia Cardui (painted-lady butterfly) was common, as were [...] "sulphurs," [...] "marbles," [...] Pontia (whites), [...] "blues," [...] and Thecla, of British aspect but foreign species. Amongst these, tropical forms were rare, except one fine black swallow-tail. Of moths, Noctuae and Geometrae abounded, with many flies and Tipulae. Hymenoptera were scarce, except a yellow Ophion, which lays its eggs in the caterpillars above-mentioned. Beetles were most rare, and (what is remarkable) the wood-borers (longicorns and Curculio) particularly so. A large Telephora was very common, and had the usual propensity of its congeners for blood; lamellicorns were also abundant.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} the ecology of Orchid Island {{and the culture of}} the Tao tribe, the impacts of tourism on the three {{protected}} wild animal species of Taiwan, including Elegant Scops owls, <b>Birdwing</b> butterflies, <b>and</b> coconut crabs, are relatively apparent. These three animals play important roles in the culture of the Tao tribe and are indicators of the traditional biological resources. The strong cultural taboo strictly prohibits members of the Tao tribe from hunting and collecting these; however, these three species have become protected because their population numbers continue to decrease. This change occurred after Orchid Island was opened for tourism; therefore, these three species can be studied to investigate the impacts of tourism activities. Thus, in this study, we select Elegant Scops owls, <b>Birdwing</b> butterflies, <b>and</b> coconut crabs to analyze the impacts of aboriginal tourism on the traditional culture and ecology of indigenous people.|$|R
50|$|O. richmondia {{normally}} feeds only on two {{endemic species}} of the Aristolochiaceae family, Richmond birdwing butterfly vine (Pararistolochia praevenosa) in lowland habitats and Pararistolochia laheyana in highland habitats (e.g. the QLD-NSW border range national parks above 800 m) (Braby 2000, Sands and Scott 1997). Its sole non-native host plant is Aristolochia tagala, although larvae do not transfer well to this species if already established on their usual host plants. Eggs are also laid on the introduced calico flower (Aristolochia littoralis), however larvae are killed by feeding on this plant. Cultivation and sale of A. littoralis is strongly discouraged throughout {{the range of the}} Richmond <b>birdwing</b> <b>and</b> should not be grown in Queensland at any rate, as it is also toxic to the larvae of the clearwing swallowtail (Cressida cressida), the red-bodied swallowtail (Pachliopta polydorus queenslandicus) and all other Australian birdwings (O. euphorion, O. priamus subspecies). The two species of Pararistolochia utilised by O. richmondia are believed to contain aristolic acids toxic to vertebrate predators.|$|R

Material and Methods :-The present study was carried out on 80 adult male albino rats (120 ± 20 g. b. wt.), the rats were divided randomly into 8 groups, the first group served as control group, the second group as alloxan induced diabetic rats, the third group was diabetic rats treated with mixture of folk medicinal plant (0. 01 g / 100 g b. wt.),the fourth group: diabetic rats treated with Nigella sativa (0. 01 g / 100 g b. wt.), the fifth group: diabetic rats treated with Aloe vera (0. 005 g / 100 g b. wt.), the sixth group: diabetic rats treated with Ferule assa-foetida (0. 01 g / 100 g b. wt.), the seventh: diabetic rats treated with Boswellia carterii Birdw (1 ml/ 100 g b. wt.) and the eighth group: diabetic rats treated with Commiphora myrrha (0. 01 g ml/ 100 g b. wt.) Results :- Serum total lipid, serum total cholesterol, LDL­cholesterol, and triglyceride recorded significant increases in diabetic, Nigella sativa, Commiphora myrrha, Boswellia carterii <b>birdw</b> <b>and</b> Aloe vera treated group. While the mixture and Ferule assa-foetida treated group, showed insignificant changes in serum total lipid, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol and LDL­cholesterol.

40|$|Abstract The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, and the {{northern}} tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, overlap geographically {{as well as in}} their host ranges. Adult fe-male swallowtails are incapable of distinguishing be-tween damaged and undamaged leaves, and the opportu-nities for competition between these two species are nu-merous. We designed field and laboratory experiments to look for evidence of indirect competition between P. canadensis and L. dispar larvae. Swallowtail caterpillars were reared in the laboratory on leaves from gypsy-moth-defoliated and undefoliated trees to explore host-plant effects. We tested for pathogen-mediated interac-tions by rearing swallowtail larvae on both sterilized and unsterilized leaves from defoliated and undefoliated sources. In addition, we measured the effects of known gypsy moth pathogens, as well as gypsy moth body flu-ids, on the growth and survival of swallowtail larvae. Field experiments were designed to detect the presence of parasitoid-mediated competition, as well: we recorded parasitism of swallowtail caterpillars placed in the field either where there were no gypsy moth larvae present, or where we had artificially created dense gypsy moth pop-ulations. We found evidence that swallowtails were neg-atively affected by gypsy moths in several ways: defolia-tion by gypsy moths depressed swallowtail growth rate and survival, whether leaves were sterilized or not; ster-ilization significantly reduced the effect of defoliation, and gypsy moth body fluids proved lethal; <b>and</b> <b>swallow-tail</b> caterpillars suffered significantly increased rates of parasitism when they were placed in the field near gypsy moth infestations...|$|R
