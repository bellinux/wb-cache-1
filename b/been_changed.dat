30|$|How, then, {{can such}} a good and {{basically}} functional organization <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> into an excellent one which is prepared {{to take on the}} challenges of the sixth Kondratieff wave? Perhaps we should consider first how it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> It cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by telling people that they must change their behaviour. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> with training or guidance or by altering structures or organizational models. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by avoiding conflict or by forcing the organization to innovate. And, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by launching a grandiose (and expensive) programme for changing organizational culture.|$|R

3000|$|If {{the colors}} of an image have been modified, we can observe that the {{locations}} of the interpolated pixels and original pixels <b>are</b> <b>changed.</b> Figure  1 b presents the color location changes resulting in modifying the hue angle by 120 °.

5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had <b>been</b> <b>changed</b> after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|The current {{highway to}} bear the M-36 moniker is the second to do so. The first was signposted in 1919 north of Pontiac until it was {{partially}} replaced by the modern M-24 in 1926.

5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and agencies were refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public service employees had not <b>been</b> <b>changed.</b> Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he said {{that this was not a}} change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
