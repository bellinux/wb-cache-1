5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, masked booby and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the sooty tern, <b>blue</b> <b>noddy,</b> brown noddy, lesser noddy and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E

50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>noddy</b> was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} genus Procelsterna. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2016 found that the five noddies formed a single clade with the <b>blue</b> <b>noddy</b> and the grey noddy in Procelsterna nested between the species in the genus Anous. The authors proposed that the noddies should be merged into a single genus Anous and that Procelsterna {{should be considered as}} a junior synonym.|$|E
50|$|Sometime {{around the}} year 2002, Asian rats colonized McKean, {{apparently}} when a fishing trawler was wrecked on the island. The 2006 survey found that rat predation had virtually destroyed the once abundant populations of storm-petrels, <b>blue</b> <b>noddies</b> and other petrels and shearwaters. Rabbits on Rawaki were competing for and generally damaging necessary resources for the birds, as well as trampling nests.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Kiribati proclaimed {{it to be}} part of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, {{the largest}} marine {{protected}} area in the world. In 2010, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area became the world's largest UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2002, the wreck of the fishing trawler Chance on McKean released the Asian rat onto the island, which decimated the native populations of storm-petrels, <b>blue</b> <b>noddies</b> and other petrels and shearwaters. In 2008 NZAID funded the rat eradication of McKean Island, which was proven successful in late 2009.|$|R
50|$|As a {{first step}} towards {{biodiversity}} recovery on the islands of the PIPA, in mid 2008 rats and rabbits were targeted on McKean and Rawaki. In November-December 2009 a check of these islands by a science team indicated that the eradication programs were successful. The responses from the plant life and bird life were spectacular with the team finding that seabirds were nesting successfully on McKean {{for the first time}} in nearly 10 years. Meanwhile, on Rawaki the vegetation recovery has enabled birds like <b>blue</b> <b>noddies</b> to find suitable nest sites throughout the island. Even frigatebirds were nesting on the now recovering plants. These restoration efforts will enable populations of Phoenix petrel, white-throated storm petrel, and other important seabird populations to recover in the PIPA. A second eradication expedition was successfully executed in July 2011, with two additional islands of the PIPA targeted for pest removal- Enderbury and Birnie. Both islands had populations of the non-native Pacific rat.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>noddy</b> (Anous cerulea) is a seabird in {{the family}} Laridae. It {{is also known as}} the blue-grey noddy.|$|E
5000|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>blue</b> <b>noddy</b> was by Frederick Debell Bennett in 1840 under the binomial name Sterna cerulea. The specific name cerulea is Latin for [...] "dark blue".|$|E
50|$|The grey noddy or grey ternlet (Anous albivitta) is a seabird {{belonging}} to the family Laridae. It was once regarded as a pale morph of the <b>blue</b> <b>noddy</b> (Anous cerulea) but is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species.|$|E
5000|$|The islands have no {{native land}} mammals. An endemic bird {{subspecies}} is the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet. The {{group has been}} identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds, including white-necked and black-winged petrels, wedge-tailed and little shearwaters, sooty terns and <b>blue</b> <b>noddies.</b> The area also hosts rich habitats for cetaceans. In recent years, increased presences of humpback whales indicate Kermadec Islands functioning as migratory colliders, and varieties of baleen (not in great numbers) and toothed whales including minke whales, sperm whales, less known beaked whales, killer whales, and dolphins frequent in adjacent waters. Vast numbers of southern right whales were historically seen in southwestern areas although only a handful of recent confirmations exist around Raoul Island. The deep sea hydrothermal vents along the Kermadec ridge support diverse extremophile communities including the [...] New Zealand blind vent crab.|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. This first island-wide inventory and preliminary monitoring of American Samoa seabird populations has produced several significant results. The beginning of a seabird colony catalog has been established in a digital format. The protocol for surveying seabirds around Tutuila Island by boat is described, and future efforts can be compared to baseline results reported here. A detailed survey of the National Park lands around Tutuila is mapped and photographed and seabird distributions found in the 2000 round-island survey and 2003 partial-island survey are discussed. Our results support anecdotal evidence that the inaccessible north shore of Tutuila supports the majority of that islandâ€™s resident seabirds. Greater than 90 % of Red-footed Boobies and Great Frigatebird observations during the Tutuila round-island survey were made in NPSA areas. The north shore areas are important for coastal cliff nesters such as Brown, Black <b>Noddies</b> and <b>Blue</b> <b>Noddies,</b> a species of international significance. Bridled Terns are extending their pan tropical range to include Tutuila, including Park areas. White Terns and White-tailed Tropicbirds are more evenly distributed across forests in Tutuila within as well as outside NPSA areas. National Park Service Contract No. 8036 2 900...|$|R

50|$|A {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study published}} in 2007 found that the genus Anous was a sister group to a clade containing the terns, gulls and skimmers. A study of the phylogenetic relationship between the five noddies published in 2016 found that they formed a single clade with the <b>blue</b> <b>noddy</b> and the grey noddy which were {{at the time in}} the genus Procelsterna embedded within the three species in Anous. The authors proposed that the noddies should be merged into a single genus Anous and that Procelsterna should be considered as a junior synonym.|$|E
5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, <b>blue,</b> and grey <b>noddies</b> make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|R
