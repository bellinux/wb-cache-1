The potential benefit of <b>bus</b> <b>priority,</b> using these 3 methods are shown for 80 second cycle lengths and 120 second cycle lengths and the negative impacts, such as long cross road delay, is highlighted. The challenges of providing <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> on routes where the block lengths are short and traffic signals are spaced less than 200 m to 300 m apart, are also highlighted.

40|$|London has a {{long history}} of {{successful}} schemes for bus priority at traffic signals. Recently, Transport for London (TfL) has procured a modern automatic vehicle location (AVL) system for bus fleet management, passenger information and bus priority. The new system is known as iBUS and is based on global positioning system (GPS) and supporting technologies for bus location. The system eliminates the need for on-street hardware for detecting buses and provides more flexibility and opportunity for using bus detectors. However, bus location based on this system is less accurate than location based on fixed infrastructure (e. g. beacons) and could result in reduced benefits from bus priority. This paper first summarises how bus priority at traffic signals works within iBUS, and then explores the effects of GPS locational errors on bus priority benefits. This is followed by a discussion of opportunities available in the context of iBUS to build an even more efficient and beneficial <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> <b>system</b> by taking advantage of its cost-effective multiple detection capabilities.

40|$|Giving {{priority}} to buses at traffic signals {{is a common}} form of priority in a busy urban area where opportunities for segregated systems are not available and/or where numerous traffic signals exist. A <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> <b>system</b> may benefit buses by reducing their journey time and improving their punctuality/regularity. This will result in reductions in passenger waiting time at bus stops and in passenger travel times. With the aid of new technologies and strategies, there are now various priority options {{which can be used}} to optimise the benefits possible from this form of priority. In their advanced form, these priority options use an Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system to locate buses in the system to give priority based on a combination of the lateness of buses and the permitted level of priority at junctions. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} explore these different advanced priority options that are available at traffic signals and to estimate the resulting benefits.

40|$|Public {{transport}} in Brazil {{is almost}} completely based on bus services. In general, approximately 65 % of motorized trips in large or medium sized cities use buses. The decision {{of investing in}} <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> <b>systems</b> was stimulated {{by the federal government}} during the 80 's and was based on two main factors: the lack of funds to implement rail transit systems and the need to improve the performance of bus systems, as a real alternative of medium capacity transit system.

40|$|The {{merits of}} {{alternative}} urban and inter-urban public transport {{systems have been}} the subject of some debate, particularly since the publication of the UK’s 1998 transport policy White Paper A New Deal for Transport. This current paper aims to assess some of the conflicting empirical evidence in the UK and abroad in order to allow an objective assessment of the policy implications. Section 2 presents an overview of technical and financial characteristics of mainly urban public transport systems, including capital and operating costs of recent light rail, guided <b>bus,</b> <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> and suburban rail systems. Section 3 explores the evidence on the wider costs and benefits of systems in the UK, including wider environmental and socio-economic impacts. Although more expensive to build (under similar conditions), light rail systems often carry more passengers than ‘intermediate’ bus-based systems such as guided bus and segregated busways. There is not much between public transport systems on the basis of operating costs per passenger-km, except metro systems, which are twice as expensive to run as busbased systems. When comparing revenues and operating costs directly, all modes except suburban regional rail appear capable of covering operating costs overall, with light rail and some of London’s suburban rail services providing a marginal surplus of revenue. Average speeds of light rail and bus-based systems are comparable. In heavily congested corridors, new light rail systems can reduce journey times significantly, but such reductions are lower for bus-based systems, mainly because of the relatively limited amount of segregated right of way and priority at traffic signals. This highlights the fact that <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> <b>systems</b> act primarily as ‘congestion busters’ at hot spots, which can be implemented more flexibly and gradually than for railbased systems. Currently, electric propulsion appears to be the best option to mitigate air pollution and noise. However, new clean vehicle technologies will soon be in a position to play a major role in reducing emissions, in particular for bus-based systems. In terms of external costs per bus/train-km, environmental costs appear higher than accident costs, but lower than congestion externalities...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{research}} a performance evaluation framework for traffic management and Intelligent Transport Systems was developed, {{consisting of a}} set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the themes of traffic efficiency, safety, pollution reduction and social inclusion, all of which are key components of a smart city.

This is achieved through weighting factors, whereby more important policy objectives are weighted more heavily in the calculation. But while the theoretical framework is ready to accommodate the policy layer, no methodology to determine the values of the weighting factors has been developed so far. The present study, therefore, concentrates on the development and testing of such a methodology, focusing on the environmental impact aspect of urban mobility management and ITS in the context of smart cities.

40|$|Bus {{priority}} is being widely implemented across many UTC areas in London, following successful field trials in the EC-funded projects PROMPT and INCOME. Installation {{has now been}} completed at over 100 junctions, with full evaluations being undertaken in each case. The remaining roll-out programme includes over 500 additional junctions. This roll-out has initially been based on the existing technology of bus transponders and inductive loop technology. However, the committed London-wide implementation of automatic vehicle location (AVL) technology for fleet management and passenger information at bus stops offers the potential to use new technology and more sophisticated control for bus priority. In particular, the real-time bus location information, provided by AVL, enables the level of priority provided for each bus to be tailored to its needs.

40|$|In Hong Kong, {{franchised}} buses {{carry more}} than 3. 9 million passengers daily, ranking {{at the second}} highest daily patronage after MTR of 4. 8 million. The current public transport policy in Hong Kong encourages the use of railway as {{the backbone of the}} public transport system to mitigate congestion and roadside pollution, whilst franchised buses perform as auxiliary and feeder public transport function. With this shift in emphasis, direct measures to assist bus companies in the form of comprehensive <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> <b>system</b> are lacking. Unlike Hong Kong, the transport authorities in Singapore and London have proactively put in more efforts and resources in optimizing their bus priority schemes in recent years, through setting up the bus-only lanes at congested road sections and implementing traffic signal synchronization integrated with GPS-based system for bus-through traffic, which aim at enhancing service reliability of buses and further promoting the modal shift from private transport to public transport. Though Hong Kong, Singapore and London are well-known metropolitan cities sharing similar compact urban population densities with comprehensive public transport networks, yet they have distinct characteristics and varieties towards the implementation of bus priority schemes. As these cities are also competing for investment, quality living and green development, it is of interest to review the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of current public transport policy in Hong Kong in terms of encouraging the use of economic carriers for better use of road space, as well as to review the role of franchised buses performed in the public transport scene. Meanwhile, it is necessary to examine and compare different types of bus priority schemes implemented between Hong Kong, Singapore and London, in order to provide feasible recommendations on further optimizing and enhancing bus priority scheme in Hong Kong with reference to overseas experience. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|E

40|$|Road {{accidents}} {{have and}} will remain a major concern as cities around the world continue to grow. The safety problem is likely to worsen as population growth is accompanied by increased travel. For many cities, these trends {{have led to a}} greater provision of public transport as private vehicles become a less viable mode of transport. With the rise in public transport travel, {{it comes as no surprise}} that road management agencies are turning to an increased application of priority measures to improve the travel experience for commuters. For buses, the provision of priority measures has typically been justified based on travel time savings and operational benefits. Although recent years have seen the advances in research valuing the wider ridership, mode shift and environmental benefits of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> schemes, including the network wide benefits, a major issue that has yet to be considered in <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> planning is the road safety impacts of providing priority schemes. This thesis therefore aims to develop an in-depth understanding of the road safety implications of implementing <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> through an investigation of accident records and conflicts in Metropolitan Melbourne. It is structured around six approaches that had been established to fill the knowledge in the area of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> safety effects. Each approach is the focus of a thesis chapter where the research context is discussed before the research methodology is presented. Results and key findings that emerged from subsequent analyses were used as a basis to understand the implications of implementing <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> in the context of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> planning and research. The first approach concerns an exploration of the safety effects of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> at the aggregate level. Here, a before-after safety evaluation of both “space based” and “time based” <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> was carried out to understand its effects at the network and bus route levels. A before-after accident type analysis was done to examine whether accident counts or nature of accidents had changed following the implementation of <b>bus</b> <b>priority.</b> Results of the safety evaluation based on the Empirical Bayes approach showed that the implementation of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> treatments led to a 14 % reduction in accidents. “Space based” treatments (mainly bus lanes) yielded a stronger positive safety effect (18. 2 %) compared to “time based” ones (11. 1 %). In terms of fatal and serious injury accidents, a drop of 42 to 29 per annum was recorded. Given that different design types are available in before-after safety evaluation, the second approach focuses on understanding how the choice of comparison group type affected the <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> safety estimate. Using the Empirical Bayes (EB) and Comparison Group (CG) approaches, it was found that the effect of using different comparison group types led to discrepancies in the final safety estimates. It is likely that these differences were due to the (necessary) omission of sites with zero accident history and effect of matching treatment sites with similar sites in the CG approach. A new approach that combined both EB and CG results showed promise as a more precise safety estimate was obtained. The third approach relates to an investigation of bus accidents at the route level. Using two mainstream modelling methodologies (MENB - Mixed Effects Negative Binomial and BPNN – Back Propagation Neural Network modelling), risks factors in bus accidents were explored with particular attention paid to the safety effect of <b>bus</b> <b>priority.</b> Results showed that <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> led to lower occurrence for certain accidents types. The MENB and BPNN model results showed that <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> had the effect of reducing route section level accident frequency by about 53. 5 %. The MENB model recorded better performance which pointed to benefits in adopting the MENB approach to account for time- and location-specific effects in accident count modelling. The fourth approach concerns the analysis of bus accidents in terms of vehicle, driver, roadway and environmental factors. This was done to identify the significant risk factors in a bus company database of accidents where bus drivers were deemed to be at-fault. Similar to the third approach, the aim was to understand the effect of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> on drivers’ at-fault probability in bus-involved accidents. Results from mixed logit modelling showed that bus length / age, driver’s gender / age / experience / accident record, road type, speed limit, traffic / daylight conditions, and the presence of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> affect the likelihood of bus drivers being at-fault in bus-involved accidents. For <b>bus</b> <b>priority,</b> the effect was found to be random as <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> only reduced the at-fault likelihood for some 57. 8 % of drivers. The fifth approach centres on an investigation of the <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> effect (<b>bus</b> lanes) at a corridor-level through micro-simulation. The focus was on conflicts at intersections and bus stops as the introduction of bus lanes was expected to have most impact on traffic movements at these locations. Results showed that the provision of bus lanes, regardless of whether they are created through space reallocation or creation, lead to a reduction in conflicts at intersections and bus stop locations. These pointed to lower rear-end and lane change accident risks for vehicles when bus lanes are in place. The sixth approach concerns an estimation of crash risk for vehicles that are behind a slowing or stationary bus at a bus stop in a mixed traffic configuration. This was done to quantify the safety benefit delivered by <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> schemes that segregate buses from mainstream traffic. Using recorded travel behaviour and accident history of a representative road corridor, the average crash risk of vehicles that were in conflict with buses was found to be 0. 0154 % (with a standard error of 0. 0063 %). Based on the assumption of an average of thirty such conflicts occurring daily, it works out that there is an approximate 80 % chance of one or more accidents taking place annually as a result of buses slowing down or being stationary at bus stops. Overall the thesis presents a range of advances in knowledge in the area of <b>bus</b> <b>priority.</b> Through the six approaches, new light has been shed on the safety effects of <b>bus</b> <b>priority.</b> The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the findings, in which its implications in the context of <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> research and planning as well as opportunities for future research are presented...|$|R

40|$|Transit usage {{is based}} on {{reliable}} and timely service. Priority is one method for maintaining reduced transit travel times and a reliable schedule, which make transit more attractive. However, with most buses operating within the same traffic lanes as other vehicle traffic, priority policy affects the surrounding traffic. Consequently, priority is often limited to minimal green time extensions or recall, often only when the bus is behind schedule. The Split Cycle Offset Optimization Technique, SCOOT, provides opportunities for <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> options while also reducing delays for all traffic. A connection between an actual SCOOT system and the simulation VISSIM has been developed to evaluate <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> performance. A Salt Lake City, nine-intersection modeled corridor, evaluates SCOOT’s performance, both with and without <b>bus</b> <b>priority.</b> The SCOOT analysis is compared to an actuated-coordinated optimal signal timing developed in SYNCHRO. The modeling includes the existing 7 -routes on the corridor. A single route {{with a range of}} bus headways is also modeled to evaluate the impacts <b>priority</b> with increasing <b>bus</b> frequency. The results indicate that SCOOT with <b>bus</b> <b>priority,</b> compared to the actuated-coordinated timing, reduces non-bus vehicle delays by 16 % or 4. 4 seconds per person per intersection and bus delays by 27 % or 9. 2 seconds for the 7 -route <b>system.</b> Without <b>bus</b> <b>priority,</b> SCOOT reduced non-bus person-delay by 21 % or 5. 9 seconds per person and bus person-delay by 5 % or 1. 8 seconds per person. SCOOT’s <b>bus</b> <b>priority</b> can reduce transit delay with a minimal impact to other traffic. Keywords...|$|R
