5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should <b>be</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E
500|$|The debt {{taken on}} by the Glazers to finance the {{takeover}} was split between the club and the family; between £265million and £275million was secured against Manchester United's assets, putting the club into debt {{for the first time}} since James Gibson saved them in 1931. This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds: Citadel, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital. The total amount was £660million, on which interest payments came to £62million a year. The club stated, [...] "The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year, which is why lenders want to invest in the club... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market." [...] The Manchester United Supporters Trust responded, [...] "'The amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge... The interest payment is one thing but what about the actual £660million? It is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices, which, as we always suspected, means the fans will effectively <b>be</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> someone to borrow money to own their club." [...] Under the terms of the Glazers' refinancing, as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010, the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14.25% to 16.25%, resulting in annual payments of around £38million.|$|E
