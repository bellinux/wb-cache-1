60|$|On the 4th of September {{we started}} for the village of Chela, which lies west from Churra, at the embouchure of the Boga-panee on the Jheels. The path runs by Mamloo, and down the spur to the Jasper hill (see chapter xxviii): the {{vegetation}} all along is very tropical, and pepper, ginger, maize, and <b>Betel</b> <b>palm,</b> are cultivated around small cottages, which are only distinguishable in the forest by their yellow thatch of dry Calamus (Rattan) leaves. From Jasper hill a very steep ridge leads to another, called Lisouplang, which is hardly so high as Mamloo; the rocks are the same sandstone, with fragments of coal, and remains of the limestone formation capping it.|$|E
50|$|The first element nakhon (Thai: นคร) means town or city. The second element pa (Thai: ป่า) means forest. The third element mak (Thai: หมาก) means <b>betel</b> <b>palm.</b> The {{name as a}} whole {{would be}} loosely {{translated}} as <b>Betel</b> <b>Palm</b> Forest City. <b>Betel</b> <b>Palm</b> are indeed indigenous to the area and inhabitants chew on the betel nuts which contain a natural stimulant, much like chewing tobacco.|$|E

5000|$|Yap Ah Loy {{was born}} in Guangdong (formerly known as Canton) province, {{southern}} China on 14 March 1837. His parents lived {{in the town of}} Danshui/Tamsui (...) in Kwai Yap district, Huizhou prefecture. He was a Hakka of the Fui Chiu clan. Yap Ah Loy left China via Macau for British Malaya in 1854. On his arrival in Malaya, he found the place very different from China. The scenery, with tall coconut and <b>betel</b> <b>palms,</b> and the small Malay houses with atap (nipah thatch) roofs, was a new and fascinating experience to him.|$|R
50|$|The ambitious {{programme}} {{of the corporation}} was conceived three years ago. The local body had even engaged a consultant, shortlisted by experts from Anna University, Public Works Department and the agriculture department. The consultant gave a detailed plan in October last on how to beautify the lake. This included removal of encroachments in Gandhi Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar, fencing of the entire waterbody, provision of three decks for walking, viewing and fishing and a boating jetty. The consultant also suggested plantation of African grass, reed and bamboo along the middle deck and flowering plants and trees like bottlebrush, bougainvillea, royal palms and areca nut <b>betel</b> <b>palms</b> along the upper deck.|$|R
50|$|The name Krong Pinang is {{actually}} the Thai corruption of Kampung Pinang (Jawi: كامڤوڠ ڤينڠ), its original Malay name means 'The Village of Pinang'. The word Pinang means <b>Betel</b> <b>palm</b> or Betel nut tree (Areca catechu) in Malay.|$|E
5000|$|One Piper {{species has}} gained {{large-scale}} {{use as a}} stimulant. Betel (P. betle) leaves are used to wrap <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> nut slices; its sap helps release the stimulating effect of these [...] "cookies" [...] which are widely known as pan in India.|$|E
50|$|Myanmar's slow {{economic}} growth {{has contributed to}} the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems. Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable teak in lower Myanmar, cover over 49% of the country, including areas of acacia, bamboo, ironwood and Magnolia champaca. Coconut and <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> and rubber have been introduced. In the highlands of the north, oak, pine and various rhododendrons cover much of the land.|$|E
50|$|Ficus pumila var. awkeotsang is {{a member}} of the fig family and a variety of Ficus pumila. The plant is {{sometimes}} grown in close proximity to <b>Betel</b> nut <b>palms</b> thus providing a tall trunk, which the fig uses as a support to climb.|$|R
50|$|In India, the dry {{fallen leaves}} of the Areca catechu <b>palm</b> (<b>betel</b> tree) are {{collected}} and hot-pressed into disposable palm leaf plates and bowls.|$|R
50|$|Some {{valuable}} {{timber and}} forest trees are grown {{in this district}} like koroi, sheel koroi, garjan, jarul, shimul, mahagoni, bamboo etc. The main crops of this district are boro and aman paddy, peanut, varieties of pulses, chilli, sugarcane, potato, etc. Mango, jack fruit, papaya, coconut, banana, litchi, <b>betel</b> nut, <b>palm</b> are the main fruits of this district.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species has}} many common names {{including}} the areca palm, areca nut palm, <b>betel</b> <b>palm,</b> Indian nut, Pinang palm, Chinese language/Mandarin: [...] "檳榔", Tamil: [...] கமுகு, Tagalog: bunga, Indonesia/Malay: pinang, Tamil:"கமுகு" [...] "kamuhu" [...] Malayalam:adakka, Kannada: Adike. This palm {{is called the}} betel tree because its fruit, the areca nut, is often chewed along with the betel leaf, a leaf from a vine of the family Piperaceae.|$|E
50|$|Pinang {{refers to}} the seed of Areca catechu, or <b>Betel</b> <b>palm,</b> which, like Cocos nucifera (or the Coconut palm), belongs to Arecaceae (the palm family) and {{is a kind of}} {{evergreen}} tree whose trunk can grow as tall as twenty meters. The word Pinang originated from Indonesian. Pinang was initially used as a kind of herbal plant, although in modern times it is mostly taken as a kind of pick-me-up.|$|E
50|$|Paan chewing {{is a part}} of many Asian cultures, {{especially}} those of China and Vietnam. Preparation techniques vary from using hands to feet to help in grinding and extracting the exotic flavours. The nut is either slivered or grated, often flavored with spices according to local tradition and usually wrapped in a betel leaf (betel leaf comes from the betel pepper plant, Piper betle, which is not botanically related to the <b>betel</b> <b>palm,</b> Areca catechu), along with some lime (calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide) to better extract the alkaloids. Some people also chew tobacco, marijuana or cocaine along with betel nut. After about 20 minutes of chewing, the fibrous residue which remains of the nut is spat out onto the street, where it remains visible due to its characteristic bright red color.|$|E
50|$|Some {{kilometers}} away from Ngu Binh Mountain is Vong Canh hill, across from Ngoc Tran Mountain. From the Vong Canh hill, people can behold fruit gardens green with areca (<b>betel</b> nut) <b>palms,</b> longan trees, orange groves (including mandarin variety), grapefruit trees, etc. Mingling with pine trees, grey roofs of pagodas and temples, {{as well as}} the ancient and meditative tombs, the Perfume River looks like a soft silk strip winding {{at the foot of the}} hill.|$|R
50|$|The main {{crops are}} Paddy, wheat, sweet potatoes, pulses, brinjal and betel leaves, {{and the main}} fruits are mangoes, jackfruits, bananas, blackberries, coconuts, lychee, <b>palms,</b> <b>betel</b> nuts and amra. The extinct or nearly extinct crops are Jute, tobacco, mustard seeds, groundnuts, garlic, sugar cane, arahar, china and kaun.|$|R
50|$|On 10 December 1883, Pryer married Ada Blanche Locke {{and began}} to retire from the {{administration}} post. After his retirement, he purchased the Bai Island in Sandakan Bay, planting coconuts, coffee and <b>betel</b> nut <b>palms</b> and ran cattle. At Beatrice Estate, which is another plantation near Elopura, Pryer experimented with the cultivation of new products. He completely failed from the cultivation of tobacco starting in 1892, but rather predicted a decade before the natural rubber boom that the rubber tree was the ideal working plant for the indigenous coastal inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fibers {{obtained}} from the fronds of betel or betel nut (Areca catechu) palm (or known in Malaysia as pinang tree) were used as woven reinforcement in unsaturated polyester resin. The morphology, physical and mechanical properties of the natural fibers and resulting woven composites were evaluated. Woven <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> composites were prepared in both untreated and treated forms with different fiber volumes: 3 %, 5 %, 7 %, and 9 %. The flexural properties and impact strength of woven <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> composites improve {{with the addition of}} fiber up to 7 vol%. The drop in flexural properties was observed in 9 vol % of fiber due to insufficient resin to wet the fibers during the fabrication of composites. As expected, the treated <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> fibers display better mechanical properties than those of the untreated system. From the SEM observation, it is found that the alkaline treatment of fibers effectively cleans the fiber surface and increases the fiber surface roughness. In general, mechanical properties of the woven composites made from alkali treated fibers were superior to the untreated fibers.

Compared with uninoculated controls, a reduction (P ≤ 0. 05) in fresh root weight was noted after 3 months with M. incognita race 1 {{but not with}} other species or races, No differences (P ≤ 0. 05) in root weight between controls and inoculated plants were observed at 9 months, nor were any differences found in top weight at 3 or 9 months...|$|E
40|$|The {{formerly}} monotypic weevil genus Platytenes Pascoe (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Cryptorhynchinae: Cryptorhynchini: Cryptorhynchina) as treated here, {{includes two}} commonly encountered and broadly distributed {{species in the}} eastern Indo-Australian region. Label data indicate that both species are associated with semicultivated <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> (Areca catechu L., Arecaceae) and human mediated dispersal is suggested to have influenced their present-day distribution. Herein, we provide a diagnosis for Platytenes and redescribe its type species, P. varius Pascoe. We also describe P. occultus Setliff and Larson, a new species from the Solomon Islands. New host and locality records are provided, including the first records of the genus occurring on Ambon Island, the Bismarck Archipelago, D’Entrecasteaux Islands, and many previously unreported localities on New Guinea. A full bibliography, key to species, and distribution map for the genus are also provided...|$|E
5|$|Taxes were levied on {{mining and}} forest products, and {{additional}} income was raised through tolls {{for the use}} of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, <b>betel</b> leaves, <b>palm</b> leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|R

50|$|The {{luxuriant}} {{growth of}} palms {{is the most}} characteristic feature of the vegetation. <b>Betel</b> nut <b>palm</b> or supari (Areca catechu) plantations {{are more and more}} abundant towards the north and the west of the district and grows almost in forest. Coconut are grown abundantly throughout the district. Toddy palms or tal (Borassus flabellifer) and date palms or khejur are also very common. Date palm is a valuable tree. The juice is extracted and made into gurr, the leaves are made into mat. Tal wood is used for posts of houses and other building purposes, leaves are used for making handmade mats and large hand fans. Betel nut and coconut are good source of household income.|$|R
40|$|Falls {{from trees}} and other tree related {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common cause of trauma in some parts of rural Melanesia. A four year review of all admissions for trauma to the Provincial Hospital at Alotau, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea, showed that 27 % were due to falls from trees, and a further 10 % were due to related injuries, such as being struck by a falling branch or a coconut. A questionnaire distributed to rural health centres showed that during the study period at least 28 villagers died from falls from trees before reaching hospital. Head and chest trauma were common causes of death. Many injured patients were boys. Forearm fractures were the most common injuries, but more serious injuries were also frequently encountered. Trees responsible for most deaths and injuries included the coconut palm, <b>betel</b> <b>palm,</b> mango, and breadfruit. There are many strategies for preventing such injuries; perhaps the most important is to stop small boys climbing tall trees. Such falls are a serious occupational hazard for many subsistence farmers...|$|E
40|$|Betel nut or <b>betel</b> <b>palm</b> (Areca catechu Linn) {{has become}} a major cash crop in {{southern}} and central Taiwan since the mid- 1980 s. Many slopeland fruit orchards and forests have been converted to betel nut plantations. The total area of betel nut plantations has increased over the past 30 years, reaching a peak of 56 542 ha in 1997. The public and conservation groups frequently express great concern over the potential negative hydrological impacts of betel nut plantations oil steep slopes. This investigation in central Taiwan examines the effects of hillslope betel nut plantations on hydrological processes. Differences in hydrological characteristics between plots planted with betel nut trees and those with other ground cover types were evaluated at two study sites. The tall, single-layer canopy and wide spacing between planted betel nut trees led to low interception losses, high throughfall and high net rainfall. Plots planted with betel nut trees had lower infiltration, higher surface runoff and higher erosion than forested sites. These hydrological characteristics can be related to factors such as crown cover, soil organic content and soil porosity in betel nut plantations. Strearnflow data from three gauged watersheds with different proportions of total area planted with betel nut showed that where greater proportions of total area were planted with betel nut trees, there were higher annual stream flow/rainfall ratios, higher specific peak flows, steeper recessions and higher peak flow/baseflow ratios. The results from this study suggest that, in general, betel nut trees are less desirable from the soil and water conservation viewpoints than natural forests...|$|E

50|$|Yapese use local {{foods to}} express {{cultural}} values. Local foods bind {{the land and}} people together. Common food grown in Yap include taro, yams, breadfruit, bananas, and reef fish. Traditional agricultural systems on Yap include gardens, shifting cultivation, taro systems, and animal husbandry. Chewing <b>betel</b> nut, drinking <b>palm</b> wine, and consuming commercial alcohol are popular social activities on Yap. The United States gave large subsidies to Micronesia in the 20th century, creating a decline in local food production on Yap. Imported foods such as white rice, canned meat, and frozen meat became more popular.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the ascent of Sispara Ghat by Clements Robert Markham defies editing.We landed {{at the port of}} Calicut, {{on our way to the}} Nilgiri Hills, on the 7th October 1860. He who would desire to receive the most pleasant impression of India, on a first arrival, must follow in the wake of Vasco da Gama, and disembark on the coast of Malabar, the garden of the peninsula. Here Nature is clad in her brightest and most inviting robes, the scenery is magnificent, the fields and gardens speak of plenty, and the dwellings of the people are substantial and comfortable.Late in the evening, we embarked in a canoe on the Beypur river. The banks are wooded down to the water's edge, with groves of slender <b>betel</b> <b>palms</b> rising above the other foliage, and standing out against the starry sky. We were met by Mr. Mclvor at the landing-place of Eddiwana, and started at once for the village of Wundur, whence the road leads up the Sisapara ghat to the Nilgiris.The ascent commences at Sholakul, a post-house surrounded by stout palisades, to protect it from wild elephants. Thence the road first passes through a tract overgrown with gigantic weeds, and then up a steep slope, covered with a forest of blackwood and other fine timber trees, with an undergrowth of ferns, Curcumas, and a brilliant little purple flower, the Wishbone Flower, Torenia Asiatica (Torenia glabra). The occasional openings in the forest, at turns in the road, afforded us views of the mountains below us, covered with the richest vegetation, and of the rice-fields of Malabar, stretching away to the faintly indicated blending of sea and haze on the far horizon. As we continued the ascent the scenery increased in magnificence, the views became more extensive, and there were mountain-tops crowned with grand forest trees far below us. At 6000 feet mosses appear, then lilies, brambles, and wild strawberries, and occasionally we crossed noisy little streams overshadowed by the trees.We reached the Sisapara bungalow, on the summit of the ghat 6742 feet above the level of the sea, late in the afternoon. The Sisapara ghat takes the traveller from the tropical plains to the temperate climate of the hills, where the face of Nature is entirely changed. Here the slopes are covered with grass, and the ravines only are filled with trees, forming thickets called sholas. In the rear of the Sisapara bungalow, there is an almost unrivalled view of the Malabar plains, from the edge of a precipice. The Kundah hills sweep round until they join the Wyanad range, and appeared to be so steep that even a cat could not scale them for many miles; and far below were the forests, with occasional open glades. The distance from Sisapara to Utakamand, the chief English station on the Nilgiris, is thirty-three miles, fifteen of which are over the Kundah hills, and the rest of the distance is within the Nilgiris proper.|$|R
