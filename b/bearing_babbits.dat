40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} <b>babbitted</b> tilting pad <b>bearings</b> are used for oil lubricated <b>bearings.</b> <b>Babbitted</b> tilting pad <b>bearings</b> are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting pad bearing which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a {{tilting pad thrust bearing}} while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is the elimination of the bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting pad bearing over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting pad bearing design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|R

An analysis and curves are provided for some common types of turbomachinery bearings which can be used to correlate mils of vibration with bearing dynamic load. The analysis shows that the percent of bearing clearance consumed by a vibrating journal, together with its steady load, are two important factors in establishing the dynamic load magnitude. These factors can be used to provide a simple estimate of allowable shaft vibration for a specified dynamic load criterion at acceptable, alarm or trip levels...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{the bearing}} alloys have {{two types of}} {{microstructure}} i. e., either a soft matrix with discrete hard particles or a continuous matrix of the harder metal with small amount of the softer metal finely dispersed in it. The aluminium and copper based bearing alloys which are widely studied fall in the second category. However, the bearing materials which have been studied have micron sized dispersoids. In recent times, {{it is possible to}} produce nanoscale dispersoids in a hard matrix by the novel processing route of rapid solidification. This offers an opportunity to study the small length scale effect on tribological processes. In this thesis, we deal with aluminium alloys where nanoscaled dispersions of lead, bismuth and indium are produced by rapid solidification processing. Chapter 1 of the thesis is an introduction, followed by Chapter 2, which reviews the literature on nanomaterials. Special attention is given to the monotectic system, followed by a brief description on friction and wear of materials which is necessary for our present investigation. The details of experimental and characterisation techniques are given in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, we present a brief study of white metal <b>bearings</b> (<b>babbit).</b> Tin-based babbit of composition, Sn- 6 wt% Cu-llwt% Sb was studied. The study of babbit was mainly carried out with the idea that it could serve as a benchmark for subsequent studies in aluminium alloys, in terms of tribological properties. In particular, we have carried out a detailed electron microscopic investigation on the phases present in the bearing alloy. The friction and wear behaviour of this material confirms the proper calibration of our setup for wear studies. This is followed by a detailed study on the synthesis, microstructure and tribological behaviour of nanodispersed aluminium alloys, Al- 6 wt% Pb and Al- 10 wt% Pb in Chapter 5. For comparison, we have also studied melt-spun aluminium without dispersoids. Detailed electron microscopic characterisation indicates that lead has a cube on cube orientation relationship with the aluminium matrix, and the particles exhibit a lognormal distribution with the mode of the particle size distribution being 15 nm. The pin on disc results suggest a distinct lowering of coefficient of friction corresponding to pure aluminium (μ= 0. 40) and as cast aluminium-lead alloys (μ= 0. 41). Detailed SEM studies indicate a tribolayer consisting primarily of Al, Pb and Fe. The later comes from the counterface material. Our results clearly indicate that at an early stage, little or no oxidation takes place at the sliding interface. TEM observations indicate significant deformation of lead particles in the sub-surface region. The observations suggest spreading of the lead, which acts as a lubricating layer. Wear behaviour is primarily adhesive and follows Archard's wear law. However, the rate of wear is less than that reported by other investigators on micronsized lead dispersions in aluminium. In Chapter 6, we present the results for alloys dispersed with nanosized indium and bismuth. We show that indium particles on melt-spinning exhibit both cubic and tetragonal crystal structure. The indium particles are coarser (with a mode of 25 nm) than the lead and bismuth particles (which have mode of 15 nm). The bismuth containing alloys have a lower wear rate and coefficient of friction compared to lead and indium alloys. However, both indium and bismuth particles do not follow Archard's wear law and the wear vs load graph shows a non-linear behaviour. The results are discussed in terms of known mechanisms of the coefficient of friction and wear. Chapter 7 gives the salient conclusions while in Chapter 8 we discuss some of the unanswered questions and the potential for future work in this field...|$|R
40|$|The driving speeds {{at which}} {{self-excited}} motions occur in rotor-bearing systems are {{commonly referred to}} as "instability threshold". These speeds and the magnitude of rotor (journal) trajectories are two important variables characterising the limits and states of a rotating machinery. The hydrodynamic lubrication in journal-bearing provides damping and reduces friction on rotor systems; therefore the journal amplitude should not exceed the bearing radial clearance. Linear bearing models are not able to accurately predict the journal trajectories for rotor-bearing system operating in conditions where the system does not have period one solutions, or when the journal motion is larger than 20 - 30 % of the bearing radial clearance. Therefore the nonlinear bearing impedance descriptions method was used to model the hydrodynamic reaction forces. Two cases were analysed: 1) a rigid non-symmetric rotor and 2) a flexible non-symmetric rotor. The two models consist of a rotor supported by two identical finite-length hydrodynamic journal bearings of length to diameter ratio L/D= 1, with same lubricant properties. The flexible non-symmetric rotor was modelled by the finite element method (FEM). Simulation results show that the instability threshold of the rigid non-symmetric rotor-bearing system (case 1) depends on the low stability characteristics of the less loaded bearing. But when the shaft flexibility and the gyroscopic coupling effect are taken into account; the instability threshold increases for the flexible non-symmetric rotor-bearing system (case 2). The gyroscopic coupling effect does not only increase the instability threshold, but the journal trajectories magnitude has also significantly increased. This is normally not a preferable condition since high vibrations will induce heat and stress in <b>babbited</b> <b>bearing.</b> Godkänd; 2010; 20100506 (jealun...|$|R
40|$|Plans to {{shut down}} nuclear power plants in some European {{countries}} as well as increased electricity production by wind and solar power will increase the work load on hydroelectric power plants in the future. Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional white metal or <b>babbitted</b> <b>bearings</b> call for the development of new bearing designs. An outstanding tribological performance can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to employ nonlinear analysis to provide further understanding of the compliant bearing dynamic response to synchronous shaft excitation. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a nonlinear approach. The numerical model was verified with an in-house developed code at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Results for the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry were compared with published data in dynamic conditions. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, pivot offset, tapers and pad inclination angles. Influence of the viscoelastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. It was also shown that the compliant liner provides lower maximum oil film pressure and thicker minimum oil film thickness in the bearing mid-plane in both static and dynamic operating conditions.

40|$|For {{dynamical}} systems having several {{degrees of}} freedom, motion {{in one direction}} can induce motion in the other and/or vice versa. This {{means that there is}} a certain coupling between these two motions. Coupling can in some cases be a source of instability that causes self-excited vibrations in rotating machinery. In modeling hydropower rotors, couplings other than those that are the result of gyroscopic effect are normally not considered. This is due to the complexity of the reasons for coupling which mainly depends on machinery hardware, for example, the bearing's design (type) and the asymmetry in machine components. In this thesis, couplings due to bearings and gyroscopic effect were studied analytically and numerically. The performed studies include mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of some cases examples. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal-bearing was modeled as a fluid-film lubrication separating the rotor from the stationary rigid bearing. Both nonlinear and linear fluid-film forces were considered in the analyses. In case of tilting-pad bearings, the fluid-film and the flexible support structures were modeled as linear stiffness while neglecting the pads inertia and the fluid-film damping. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal-bearings provide high damping to the rotor system, but they also cross couple the rotor translational motions. Cross coupling is the main source of oil induced instability; therefore, the rotor speed should not exceed the speed at which oil-induced instability occurs. The inherent nonlinearity of plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journalbearings becomes strong for eccentricities greater than 60 % of the bearing clearance, where most existing linear models are not able to accurately predict the rotor trajectory. Strong nonlinearities together with cross coupling are the source of complex dynamics in fluid-film journal bearings. Paper A concerns analysis of the dynamic behavior of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical finite-length journal bearings at high eccentricities. The journal bearing impedance descriptions method, a method that is valid for all bearing aspect ratios and all eccentricities, was used to evaluate linear analysis of the rotor steady-state imbalance response. The results show that linear bearing models derived from the nonlinear impedance descriptions of the Moes-cavitated (π - film) finite-length bearing can predict the steady-state imbalance response of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical journal-bearings at high eccentricities. This is, however, only the case when operating conditions are below the threshold speed of instability and when the system has period one solutions. The error increases in the vicinity of resonance speed. The gyroscopic coupling effect on oil whirl instability and journal trajectories was analyzed in Paper B. The same linear and nonlinear bearing models from Paper A were reused here, and the flexible non-symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical finite-length journal-bearings was modelled by finite element method. The results show that the instability threshold of a rigid non-symmetric rotor-bearing system depends on the low stability characteristics of the less loaded bearing. However, when shaft flexibility and the gyroscopic coupling effect are taken into account, the instability threshold increases. The gyroscopic coupling effect not only increases the instability threshold, the magnitude of journal trajectories also significantly increases. This is normally not a preferable condition since high vibrations will induce heat and stress in <b>babbited</b> <b>bearings.</b> Rotor imbalance has a positive effect on flexible non-symmetric rotors; it enables the rotor system to be operated beyond its threshold speed of instability with reduced vibration amplitudes. Tilting pad journal-bearing has low cross coupling between the rotor's translational (lateral) motions. Vertical rotors and shafts designed to transmit thrust are equipped with thrust bearing. Paper C focuses particularly on modelling and analyzing the thrust bearing's dynamic influence on vertical rotors. A case study on an existing vertical hydroturbogenerator is presented. Results show that the tilting-pad thrust bearing influences the system's second and third natural frequencies. But in this case, the system's first natural frequencies were not influenced by the thrust bearing. The rotor second natural lateral vibration mode shows that the rotor system without thrust bearing has larger vibration amplitude at the exciter location than the rotor system with thrust bearing. The thrust bearing stiffening effect at rotor second natural bending mode has also resulted in reduced vibration amplitude of the rotor at the exciter location. The main observation is that the thrust bearing generates a stiffening moment which is directly proportional to the rotor's angular motions at thrust bearing location. The results obtained from the conducted studies are useful during the design process for new hydropower rotor-bearing systems and for maintaining old existing hydropower plants. The developed models can serve as a simulation tool during design modifications or during analysis of failures. Due to the large scale of real hydropower units, simulations are useful because they are more time and cost-efficient than running full-scale experiments. They also facilitate analysis {{of a large number of}} operating conditions and design modifications.

40|$|The {{principal}} task in {{this research}} project was to analyse the causes and consequences of coupled vibrations and parametric instability in hydropower rotors; where both horizontal and vertical machines are involved. Vibration is a well-known undesirable behavior of dynamical systems characterised by persistent periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic motions. Vibrations generate noise and cause fatigue, which initiates cracks in mechanical structures. Motions coupling can in some cases augment the stability characteristics of a rotating machine, {{but it can also}} be a source of instability that causes self-excited vibrations. In this thesis, motions coupling due to a bearing’s design, gyroscopic effect and geometric misalignment in rotating components were studied. The performed studies include mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of the above named sources of motions coupling. Experiments were also performed in order to evaluate the derived analytical models. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal bearings cross couple the rotor translational motions. This cross coupling is the main source of oil induced instability. The inherent nonlinearity of plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal bearings becomes strong for eccentricities greater than 60 % of the bearing clearance, where most existing linear models are not able to predict accurately the rotor trajectory. Therefore, the journal bearing impedance descriptions method, a method that is valid for all bearing eccentricities and aspect ratios, was used to analyse the rotor steady-state imbalance response. Strong nonlinearities together with cross coupling are the source of complex dynamics in fluid-film journal bearings. The simulation results show that linear bearing models derived from the nonlinear impedance descriptions of the Moes-cavitated (π - film) finite-length bearing can predict the steady-state imbalance response of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical journal bearings at high eccentricities. This is, however, only the case when operating conditions are below the threshold speed of instability and when the system has period one solutions. The speed at which oil induced instability occurs, also called the instability threshold speed, will depend upon the low stability characteristics of the less loaded bearing for an offset rigid rotor. However, for a flexible rotor the gyroscopic coupling effect will increase the instability threshold. The gyroscopic coupling effect not only increases the instability threshold, but the journal trajectories’ magnitude also significantly increases. This is normally not a preferable condition since high vibrations will induce heat and stress in <b>babbited</b> <b>bearings.</b> Adding rotor imbalance would enable the system to be operated beyond its threshold speed of instability with reduced vibration amplitudes. A tilting-pad combi-bearing is a bearing designed as a combination of both tilting-pad journal and thrust bearings. Thrust bearing is a component used in vertical rotating machines and shafts designed to transmit thrust, e. g. hydropower rotors and aircraft engines. The total axial load is normally carried by one thrust bearing. In hydropower applications, the influence of the combi-bearing is strongly simplified in the rotor dynamic modelling. The derived linear model shows that the combi-bearing couples the rotor’s lateral and angular motions at the contact point between the combi-bearing and the rotor. However, if the thrust bearing’s pads arrangement is not symmetrical or if all the pads are not angularly equidistant, the rotor vertical (axial) and angular motions are also coupled. This last case of coupling will also occur if the axial equivalent stiffness is not evenly distributed over the thrust bearing. A defected pad or unequal hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the pads’ surfaces may be the cause. The Porjus U 9 ’s simulation results show that the combi-bearing influences the dynamic behavior of the machine. The rotor motions’ coupling due to combi-bearing changes the system’s natural frequencies and vibration modes. Introducing an angular misalignment in the combi-bearing’s rotating collar will generate an asymmetry in the rotor system at the combi-bearing’s location. The rotor system’s stiffness in its two translational directions differ at the combibearing’s location. Constant parameters and/or coefficients in rotating asymmetric structures appear to change with time when observed in the stationary frame. These time dependent parameters (coefficients) are the source of parametric instability in rotating systems. If the collar angular misalignment is located in one plane, all rotor motions in this plane at the contact point between the combi-bearing and the rotor will be coupled. A parametric instability is observed within certain ranges of the rotor speeds, depending on the magnitude of the angular misalignment. The studied cases of motions coupling due to plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal bearings, motions coupling due gyroscopic effect, motions coupling due to tilting-pad combi-bearing and motions coupling due to manufacture or assembling errors in rotating components are cases that can be encountered in hydropower rotors. The results have revealed in particular that if the combi-bearing is manufactured or assembled with a certain angular misalignment, this may cause a parametric instability in the hydropower rotor. The parametric instability can even occur below the rotor critical speed, which would cause problems for undercritical machines as hydropower plants. The outcomes of these studies will contribute in further understanding of vibration problems and particularly in helping to improve and sustain the functionality of new and existing hydropower plants in Sweden.
