2500|$|The chasse marées took return cargoes {{where they}} were available, so tended {{to move into the}} {{cabotage}} trade (coastal tramping). In particular, having taken fish south to Bordeaux, they would return with salt from Lower Charente (then known as Charente Inférieur) or from Vendée to more northerly coasts of France. Early vessels were replaced progressively by the luggers, then dundees, brigs and schooners. The rig called in French dundee is a little obscure. The Nouveau Petit Larousse Illustrée (1934) describes it only as a 'large sailing ship'. Other available dictionaries ignore it but the [...] describes it as a gaff ketch and says that the rig was used principally in lobster boats and herring drifters. The article includes an illustration showing a vessel well adapted to the chasse-marée trade, with a large sail area and strikeable bowsprit and <b>bumkin.</b> Apparently, the yawl rig (cotre à tapecul) used by French tunnymen was sometimes but improperly called a dundee.|$|E
60|$|The narrowness {{of most of}} {{the canals}} of Venice, with the innumerable angles and the {{constant}} passing, have given rise to a fashion of construction and of rowing that are so peculiar to that city and its immediate dependencies as to require some explanation. The reader has doubtless already understood that a gondola is a long, narrow, and light boat, adapted to the uses of the place, and distinct from the wherries of all other towns. The distance between the dwellings on most of the canals is so small, that the width of the latter does not admit of the use of oars on both sides, at the same time. The necessity of constantly turning aside to give room for others, and the frequency of the bridges and the corners, have suggested the expediency of placing the face of the waterman in the direction in which the boat is steering, and, of course, of keeping him on his feet. As every gondola, when fully equipped, has its pavilion in the centre, the height of the latter renders it necessary to place him who steers on such an elevation as will enable him to overlook it. From these several causes a one-oared boat in Venice is propelled by a gondolier, who stands on a little angular deck in its stern, formed like the low roof of a house, and the stroke of the oar is given by a push, instead of a pull, as is common elsewhere. This habit of rowing erect, however, which is usually done by a forward, instead of a backward movement of the body, is not unfrequent in all the ports of the Mediterranean, though in no other is there a boat which resembles the gondola in all its properties or uses. The upright position of the gondolier requires that the pivot on which the oar rests should have a corresponding elevation; and there is, consequently, a species of <b>bumkin</b> raised {{from the side of the}} boat to the desired height, and which, being formed of a crooked and very irregular knee of wood, has two or three row-locks, one above the other, to suit the stature of different individuals, or to give a broader or a narrower sweep of the blade as the movement shall require. As there is frequent occasion to cast the oar from one of these row-locks to the other, and not unfrequently to change its side, it rests in a very open bed; and the instrument is kept in its place by great dexterity alone, and by a perfect knowledge of the means of accommodating the force and the rapidity of the effort to the forward movement of the boat and the resistance of the water. All these difficulties united render skill in a gondolier one of the most delicate branches of a waterman's art, as it is clear that muscular strength alone, though of great aid, can avail but little in such a practice.|$|E
6000|$|Come--Grief is dry-- You to your dinner--to {{my story}} I. To you my friend who happier days have known And each calm comfort {{of a home}} your own, This is bad living: I have spent my life In hardest toil and unavailing strife, And here (from forest ambush safe at least) To me this scanty pittance seems a feast. I was a plough-boy once; as free from woes And blithesome as the lark with whom I rose. Each evening at return a meal I found And, tho' my bed was hard, my sleep was sound. One Whitsuntide, to go to fair, I drest Like a great <b>bumkin</b> in my Sunday's best; A {{primrose}} posey in my hat I stuck And to the revel went to try my luck. From show to show, from booth to booth I stray, See stare and wonder all the live-long day. A Serjeant to the fair recruiting came Skill'd in man-catching to beat up for game; Our booth he enter'd and sat down by me;-- Methinks even now the very scene I see! The canvass roof, the hogshead's running store, The old blind fiddler seated next the door, The frothy tankard passing to and fro And the rude rabble round the puppet-show; The Serjeant eyed me well--the punch-bowl comes, And as we laugh'd and drank, up struck the drums-- And now he gives a bumper to his Wench-- God save the King, and then--God damn the French. Then {{tells the story of}} his last campaign. How many wounded and how many slain, Flags flying, cannons roaring, drums a-beating, The English marching on, the French retreating,-- [...] "Push on--push on my lads! they fly before ye, [...] "March on to riches, happiness and glory!" [...] At first I wonder'd, by degrees grew bolder, Then cried--"tis a fine thing to be a soldier!" [...] "Aye Humphrey!" [...] says the Serjeant--"that's your name? [...] "'Tis a fine thing to fight the French for fame! [...] "March to the field--knock out a Mounseer's brains [...] "And pick the scoundrel's pocket for your pains. [...] "Come Humphrey come! thou art a lad of spirit! [...] "Rise to a halbert--as I did--by merit! [...] "Would'st thou believe it? even I was once [...] "As thou art now, a plough-boy and a dunce; [...] "But Courage rais'd me to my rank. How now boy! [...] "Shall Hero Humphrey still be Numps the plough-boy? [...] "A proper shaped young fellow! tall and straight! [...] "Why thou wert made for glory! five feet eight! [...] "The road to riches is the field of fight,-- [...] "Didst ever see a guinea look so bright? [...] "Why regimentals Numps would give thee grace, [...] "A hat and feather would become that face; [...] "The girls would crowd around thee to be kist-- [...] "Dost love a girl?" [...] "Od Zounds!" [...] I cried [...] "I'll list!" [...] So past the night: anon the morning came, And off I set a volunteer for fame. [...] "Back shoulders, turn out your toes, hold up your head, [...] "Stand easy!" [...] so I did--till almost dead. Oh how I long'd to tend the plough again Trudge up the field and whistle o'er the plain, When tir'd and sore amid the piteous throng Hungry and cold and wet I limp'd along, And growing fainter as I pass'd and colder, Curs'd that ill hour when I became a soldier! In town I found the hours more gayly pass And Time fled swiftly with my girl and glass; The girls were wonderous kind and wonderous fair, They soon transferred me to the Doctor's care, The Doctor undertook to cure the evil, And he almost transferred me to the Devil. 'Twere tedious to relate the dismal story Of fighting, fasting, wretchedness and glory. At last discharg'd, to England's shores I came Paid for my wounds with want instead of fame, Found my fair friends and plunder'd as they bade me, They kist me, coax'd me, robb'd me and betray'd me. Tried and condemn'd his Majesty transports me, And here in peace, I thank him, he supports me, So ends my dismal and heroic story And Humphrey gets more good from guilt than glory.|$|E
50|$|The braces {{are fixed}} to the outer ends of the yards, and are led to the deck as far aft as possible, to allow the crew to haul on them. The lower yards braces can usually run {{directly}} to the deck, {{but to do so}} with those higher up would mean that most of the force was pulling downwards rather than backwards. Instead, the braces for the upper yards run to another mast and thence to the deck. On the aftermost mast, this may mean they have to be led forwards instead of backwards. Braces from the aftermost mast that run to the very stern of the ship often pass through blocks attached to short outriggers projecting {{from the side of the}} ship in order to improve their lead. These projections are called <b>bumkins</b> and can be seen in the picture.|$|R

50|$|Bumpkin Island, {{also known}} as Round Island, Bomkin Island, <b>Bumkin</b> Island, or Ward's Island, is {{an island in the}} Hingham Bay area of the Boston Harbor. In 1902, Albert Burrage, a Boston philanthropist, had a summer {{hospital}} opened on the island for children with physical disabilities. During World War I the island was used by the U.S. Navy. Starting around 1940, the island was used as a facility for polio patients. However, the hospital closed during World War II and burned down in 1945. Since 1996, {{it is part of the}} Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. The island has an area of 30 acre, plus an intertidal zone of a further 31 acre. It is composed of a central drumlin with an elevation of 70 ft above sea level, surrounded by a rock-strewn shoreline. A sand spit, exposed at low tide, connects the eastern end of the island to Sunset Point in Hull.|$|E
50|$|With {{the spread}} of wealth within places like Paris, the market {{expanded}} and supplies were sought from more distant coasts. In the nineteenth century, these Breton three-masted luggers began to bring fish from ports farther north on the Breton coast and from fishing boats off its coast, into the Seine estuary for sale in Rouen and for transshipment up to Paris. In such waters, a vessel without engines relied heavily on the skilful use of tides. Here, the parallel tidal meaning of marée and the catching of the tide became relevant to prosecuting the trade. It may be this which led the compiler of the Oxford English Dictionary to translate the vessel's name as 'tide-chaser'. This translation is accurate provided less-relevant meanings of the two component words are taken. The chasse marées took return cargoes where they were available, so tended {{to move into the}} cabotage trade (coastal tramping). In particular, having taken fish south to Bordeaux, they would return with salt from Lower Charente (then known as Charente Inférieur) or from Vendée to more northerly coasts of France.
