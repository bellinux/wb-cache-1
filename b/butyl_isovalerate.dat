5000|$|Jackfruit have a {{distinctive}} sweet and fruity aroma. In {{a study of}} flavour volatiles in five jackfruit cultivars, the main volatile compounds that were detected were ethyl isovalerate, propyl isovalerate, <b>butyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> isobutyl isovalerate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 1-butanol, and 2-methylbutan-1-ol. A fully ripe and unopened jackfruit is known to [...] "emit a strong aroma," [...] with {{the inside of the}} fruit described as smelling of pineapple and banana. [...] After roasting, the seeds may be used as a commercial alternative to chocolate aroma.|$|E
40|$|Flavor {{release from}} {{mixtures}} of maltitol, erythritol, polydextrose and oligofructose dissolved in water at concentrations of 43 % (w/w) was investigated to analyze possible {{interactions between the}} viscous matrix and the volatiles using an experimental mixture design in combination with data analysis and response modeling tools. The dynamic release of four flavor compounds (cis- 3 -hexenol, benzaldehyde, ethyl butanoate and <b>butyl</b> <b>isovalerate)</b> from the matrices at 37 Â°C was determined by headspace analyses using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). The aim {{of the present study}} was to understand the complex release mechanisms from high-viscosity polyol and bulking agent solutions for the intention of conducting further studies on flavor release from sugar-free confectionary products. Each of the non-volatiles had a significant effect (p&# 60; 0. 05) on flavor release with regression coefficients (R 2) between 0. 72 and 0. 93 for the release parameters Imax, t 1 / 2, and c/t, and 0. 99 for viscosity. However, the magnitude of influence varied between the bulking agents and polyols due to their different molecular weights. A clear correlation between viscosity of the solutions and flavor release was found, revealing complex matrix-volatile interactions in the high-viscosity solutions. The release of all investigated flavor compounds decreased when the viscosity of the solutions increased. Therefore, it is assumed that the flavor release is significantly influenced by the non-volatiles when a critical concentration (c*) is exceeded. Interactions between the sugar substitutes were found to affect the viscosity of the matrices, whereas flavor release was not affected by interactions between the polyols and bulking agents investigated...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 1 (CG 1) {{consists}} of straight-chain primary aliphatic alcohols/aldehydes/acids, acetals and esters with esters containing saturated alcohols and acetals containing saturated aldehydes of which 86 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The FEEDAP Panel was unable to perform an assessment of ethyl oleate because of its insufficient purity. The following compounds {{are considered to be}} safe for all animal species at the use level proposed for feed flavourings: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, oleic acid, decanol, dodecanol, decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. The remaining substances are considered safe for all animal species at 5 mg/kg complete feed (with a margin of safety between 1 and 120) and at 25 mg/kg complete feed (ethyl acetate and hexyl acetate, with a margin of safety between 2 and 6); and at 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species (ethylacrylate, ethyl hex- 3 -enoate, ethyl trans- 2 -butenoate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, <b>butyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> methyl isovalerate, hexyl isobutyrate, methyl 2 -methyl butyrate, pentyl isovalerate, butyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl isovalerate, ethyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl 2 -methyl butyrate and methyl 2 -methylvalerate). No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 1 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat all compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitizers. No risk for the safety for the environment is foreseen. Since all 85 compounds are used in food as flavourings, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
