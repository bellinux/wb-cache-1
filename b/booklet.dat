30|$|The final {{component}} of the test assembly and administration is the administration of test <b>booklets</b> to examinees. The function booklet_sample facilitates the distribution of test <b>booklets</b> to examinees. The two required arguments are n_subj, the number of examinees, and book_item_design, the output from booklet_design. The default sampling scheme makes all books equally likely but the optional argument book_prob takes a vector of probabilities to make some books more or {{less likely to be}} administered. The logical argument resample will resample <b>booklets</b> until the difference in <b>booklets</b> sampled is less than e or iter attempts. The resampling functionality may be useful when n_subj is small and only one dataset is being generated.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Total hip {{replacement}} (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) {{are two of}} the most common orthopaedic surgeries that occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes aim to decrease convalescence across procedures, morbidity and length of stay. The post-operative physiotherapy routine is standardised across hospitals, however the pathway has been criticised for not containing the correct ingredients for promoting acceleration of return to function. This research aims to analyse the current exercise protocol prescribed to patients within information <b>booklets</b> following THR and TKR in comparison to ERAS principles. Methods A random sample of twenty UK NHS hospital THR and TKR patient information <b>booklets</b> were sourced using a web based methodology. A flowchart of exercise prescription components was formulated from a review of 5 trial <b>booklets.</b> A content analysis was conducted on the patient information <b>booklets.</b> Results 40 % of the information <b>booklets</b> sourced identified their pathways to be ERAS. 50 - 55 % of the hospitals stated their patients would be mobilised on the day of surgery. 90 % of THR and 100 % of TKR guidelines suggested the use of bed exercises for rehabilitation. 15 % of THR and 35 % of TKR <b>booklets</b> suggested functional exercise as a method of rehabilitation. Strength or resistance based exercises were proposed in 40 % of THR and 55 % of TKR <b>booklets.</b> Conclusions Many patient information <b>booklets</b> do not follow ERAS principles for fast-track rehabilitation. The exercise prescription procedure is non-specific, and the physiotherapy routines prescribed could be considered outdated...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to analyze the {{discourse}} {{of a series of}} public relations <b>booklets</b> called “Secret Booklets” produced by Milwaukee’s Pabst Brewery in the late 1880 ’s.
