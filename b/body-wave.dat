By using teleseismic <b>body-waves</b> recorded at 250 seismic stations, this paper presents high-resolution North China Models of P- and S-wave velocity based on finite-frequency kernel tomography. Both P- and S-wave velocity models reveal that: (1) an obvious N–S trending narrow low-velocity region {{is located at the}} base of the lithosphere beneath the Central Block (CB) of the NCC, which extends to more than 500 km depth; (2) a region of high-velocity extends to more than 250 – 300 km depth beneath the Western Block, in contrast to the much shallower high-velocity zones beneath the CB and shallower high-velocities beneath the Eastern Block. These features suggest that warm mantle material with a source at least as deep as the transition zone, possibly a mantle plume, may be responsible for the reactivation of the NCC. The Central Block may have behaved as a sublithospheric corridor for the warm mantle material due to its pre-existing weakness. Citation: Zhao, L. ...|$|R

In F 3 DT, the starting model {{as well as}} the model perturbation is three-dimensional and the sensitivity (Fréchet) kernels are computed using numerical schemes that account for the full physics of 3 D wave propagation. F 3 DT can account for the nonlinearity of structural inverse problem through iteration, thus providing the most efficient means for assimilating seismic observations into dynamic ground-motion models. We have successfully applied a scattering-integral (SI) formulation of F 3 DT to improve a 3 D elastic structure model, Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Community Velocity Model version 3. 0 (CVM 3. 0), in the Los Angeles region. Our data are time- and frequency-localized measurements of phase-delay anomalies relative to synthetics computed from the 3 D elastic starting model. The Fréchet kernels for our measurements were computed by convolving the earthquake wavefields generated by point earthquake sources with the receiver Green tensors (RGTs), which are the spatial-temporal fields produced by three orthogonal unit impulsive point forces acting at the receiver locations.

Preliminary studies were based on long-period data from the WWSSN, HGLP and SRO networks. These showed that data from the WWSSN network are unsuitable for anisotropy studies because of features in the geometry of the recording system which lead to misalignment of the digitizer relative to the galvanometer-swing (which it is not always possible to correct) {{and the fact that the}} horizontal components are not always well matched. Digital data from the HGLP (recorded after 1976) and SRO networks are more suitable for anisotropy studies but eventually it was found that the anisotropic differences are too small to be resolved by long-period instruments. Analysis of short-period teleseismic shear-waves observed at LRSM stations located in United States and southern Canada has revealed shear-wave splitting diagnostic of anisotropy somewhere along the path. The shear-wave splitting is often seen as two separate shear-wave arrivals on the rotated horizontal components. All cases of shear-wave splitting are indicated by an abrupt change in the direction of particle-motion in the horizontal plane. A selection of seismograms and associated particlemotion diagrams is presented in order to illustrate shear-wave splitting. The polarizations of the first arrival shear-waves and the delays between the shear-wave arrivals were measured and are presented in the form of stereograms.

The focal mechanism obtained by P and SH modeling corresponds to reverse faulting {{with a small amount}} of left-lateral movement along a fault striking 246 ° and dipping 56 °. The rupture is found to be complex with two sub-events separated in time but occurring on the same plane. The lowfrequency records of an accelerometer located some 25 km to the west of the main shock are also better fi tted when the rupture is composed of a double pulse. In the two cases, there is strong evidence for the rupture to propagate from south-west towards north-east. The relocalisation of the main shock by using a master-event technique and the data from Italian and Spanish stations led to the same conclusions. Soon after the main event, a temporary seimic network was installed in the epicentral area. The aftershock clouds defi ne a SW-NE fault dipping to the NW compatible with the results of the modelisations of the teleseismic <b>body-waves</b> and the accelerogram.

40|$|The rifting of continents and {{eventual}} formation of ocean basins {{is a fundamental}} component of plate tectonics, yet the mechanism for break-up is poorly understood. The East African Rift System (EARS) is an ideal place to study this process as it captures the initiation of a rift in the south through to incipient oceanic spreading in north-eastern Ethiopia. Measurements of seismic anisotropy {{can be used to}} test models of rifting. Here we summarize observations of anisotropy beneath the EARS from local and teleseismic <b>body-waves</b> and azimuthal variations in surface-wave velocities. Special attention is given to the Ethiopian part of the rift where the recent EAGLE project has provided a detailed image of anisotropy in the portion of the Ethiopian Rift that spans the transition from continental rifting to incipient oceanic spreading. Analyses of regional surface-waves show sub-lithospheric fast shear-waves coherently oriented in a north-eastward direction from southern Kenya to the Red Sea. This parallels the trend of the deeper African superplume, which originates at the core-mantle boundary beneath southern Africa and rises towards the base of the lithosphere beneath Afar. The pattern of shear-wave anisotropy is more variable above depths of 150 km. Analyses of splitting in teleseismic phases (SKS) and local shear-waves within the rift valley consistently show rift-parallel orientations. The magnitude of the splitting correlates with the degree of magmatism and the polarizations of the shear-waves align with magmatic segmentation along the rift valley. Analysis of surface-wave propagation across the rift valley confirms that anisotropy in the uppermost 75 km is primarily due to melt alignment. Away from the rift valley, the anisotropy agrees reasonably well within the pre-existing Pan-African lithospheric fabric. An exception is the region beneath the Ethiopian plateau, where the anisotropy is variable and may correspond to pre-existing fabric and ongoing melt-migration processes. These observations support models of magma-assisted rifting, rather than those of simple mechanical stretching. Upwellings, which most probably originate from the larger superplume, thermally erode the lithosphere along sites of pre-existing weaknesses or topographic highs. Decompression leads to magmatism and dyke injection that weakens the lithosphere enough for rifting and the strain appears to be localized to plate boundaries, rather than wider zones of deformation...|$|R

40|$|Using {{available}} digital seismic stations deployed {{since the}} 1980 ’s, the largest data set based on broadband waveforms among studies on <b>body-wave</b> attenuation (t*) and quality factor (Q) {{are used in}} this thesis. The use of nearly 300, 000 measurements of <b>body-wave</b> spectral ratio from globally distributed stations renders better constraints of t* and Q variations with higher spatial and depth resolutions in the mantle than have been previously available. The maps of <b>body-wave</b> t* correlate well with the variations of t* computed from the most recent surface-wave Q model QRFSI 12 indicating that <b>body-wave</b> and surface-wave t* reflect the same intrinsic attenuation even though these waves sample the upper mantle entirely differently. The high correlation between <b>body-wave</b> t* maps and the t* inferred from a thermal interpretation of shear-wave velocity tomography S 20 RTS suggests that temperature controls both variations in attenuation and velocity in the upper mantle. The distance variations of P- and S-wave t* (t*P and t*S) are inverted for a radial profile of the quality factor Qμ in the lower mantle. On average, t*P and t*S increase by about 0. 2 s and 0. 7 s, respectively, between epicentral distances of 30 degree and 97 degree. The <b>body-wave</b> spectra are explained best if Qμ increases in the lower mantle with the rate of 0. 1 /km. The relatively strong increase of t*S compare to t*P (t*S ~ 4 t*P) suggests that intrinsic attenuation {{is the cause of}} the overall trend in our data. The ratio of P- and S-wave quality factor determined in this thesis (QP/Qμ = 2. 27) confirms that intrinsic attenuation occurs mostly in shear and that bulk attenuation is negligible in the mantle. Finally, the delay of seismic waves which traversed numerical mantle plumes are calculated in this thesis for the first time. High-resolution numerical simulations of mantle plume are used to investigate the effects of numerical plumes on waveforms.

40|$|The 300 -km-long north-central {{segment of}} the Lesser Antilles {{subduction}} zone, including Martinique and Guadeloupe islands has {{been the target of}} a specific approach to the seismic structure and activity by a cluster of active and passive offshore–onshore seismic experiments. The top of the subducting plate can be followed under the wide accretionary wedge by multichannel reflection seismics. This reveals the hidden updip limit of the contact of the upper plate crustal backstop onto the slab. Two OBS refraction seismic profiles from the volcanic arc throughout the forearc domain constrain a 26 -km-large crustal thickness all along. In the common assumption that the upper plate Moho contact on the slab is a proxy of its downdip limit these new observations imply a three times larger width of the potential interplate seismogenic zone under the marine domain of the Caribbean plate with respect to a regular intra-oceanic subduction zone. Towards larger depth under the mantle corner, the top of the slab imaged from the conversions of teleseismic <b>body-waves</b> and the locations of earthquakes appears with kinks which increase the dip to 10 – 20 ° under the forearc domain, and then to 60 ° from 70 km depth. At 145 km depth under the volcanic arc just north of Martinique, the 2007 M 7. 4 earthquake, largest for half a century in the region, allows to document a deep slab deformation consistent with segmentation into slab panels. In relation with this occurrence, an increased seismic activity over the whole depth range provides a new focussed image thanks to the OBS and land deployments. A double-planed dipping slab seismicity is thus now resolved, as originally discovered in Tohoku (NE Japan) and since in other subduction zones. Two other types of seismic activity uniquely observed in Tohoku, are now resolved here: “supraslab” earthquakes with normal-faulting focal mechanisms reliably located in the mantle corner and “deep flat-thrust” earthquakes at 45 km depth on the interplate fault under the Caribbean plate forearc mantle. None such types of seismicity should occur under the paradigm of a regular peridotitic mantle of the upper plate which is expected to be serpentinized by the fluids provided from the dehydrating slab beneath. This process is commonly considered as limiting the downward extent of the interplate coupling. Interpretations are not readily available either for the large crustal thickness of this shallow water marine upper plate, except when remarking its likeness to oceanic plateaus formed above hotspots. The Caribbean Oceanic Plateau of the upper plate has been formed earlier by the material advection from a mantle plume. It could then be underlain by a correspondingly modified, heterogeneous mantle, which may include pyroxenitic material among peridotites. Such heterogeneity in the mantle corner of the present subduction zone may account for the notable peculiarities in seismic structure and activity and impose regions of stick-slip behavior on the interplate among stable-gliding areas.

40|$|In arid environments, near-surface {{complexity}} and surface topography present major challenges to land seismic data acquisition and processing. These challenges can severely affect data quality and introduce uncertainty into reservoir imaging and characterization. The primary objectives of this thesis are to model {{and study the}} contribution of near-surface heterogeneities on seismic wavefield scattering for better understanding of land seismic data, develop an effective approach to filter out the scattered noise from the seismic records to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and to accurately image and locate the near-surface heterogeneities. The {{first part of this}} thesis is concerned with simulating the effects of seismic wave scattering from buried, shallow, subsurface heterogeneities through finite difference numerical forward modeling. The near-surface scattered wavefield is modeled by separating the incident (i. e., in the absence of scatterers) from the total wavefield by means of a perturbation method. Wave propagation is simulated for several earth models with different near-surface characteristics to isolate and quantify the influence of scattering {{on the quality of the}} seismic signal. We show that the scattered field is equivalent to the radiation field of an equivalent elastic source excited at the scatterer locations. Moreover, the scattered waves consist mostly of body waves scattered to surface waves and are, generally, as large as, or larger than, the reflections. These scattered waves often obscure weak primary reflections and can severely degrade the image quality. The results indicate that the scattered energy depends strongly on the properties of the shallow scatterers and increases with increasing impedance contrast, increasing sizes of the scatterers, decreasing depth of the scatterers, and increasing the attenuation factor of the background medium. Also, sources deployed at depth generate weak surface waves, whereas deep receivers record weak scattered surface waves. The analysis and quantified results help in the understanding of the scattering mechanisms and, therefore, can lead to developing new acquisition and processing techniques to reduce the scattered surface waves and enhance the quality of the seismic image. The second part of this thesis develops an approach based on spatially varying local-slope estimation, aiming at alleviating the effects of scattered surface waves and enhancing the quality of the seismic signal. Understanding the mechanism and behavior of the simulated scattered surface waves in the first part of this thesis form the basis for designing the filtering scheme. The algorithm is based on predicting the spatially varying slope of the noise, using steerable filters, and separating the signal and noise components by applying a directional non-linear filter oriented toward the noise direction to predict the noise and then subtract it from the data. The slope estimation step using steerable filters is very efficient, as it requires only a linear combination of a set of basis filters at fixed orientation to synthesize an image filtered at an arbitrary orientation. We apply our filtering approach to simulated data as well as to seismic data recorded in the field to suppress the scattered surface waves from reflected <b>body-waves,</b> and demonstrate its superiority over conventional f - k techniques in signal preservation and noise suppression. The third part of this thesis presents an approach for prestack elastic reverse time migration (RTM) to locate and image near-surface heterogeneities using the near-surface scattered waves (e. g., body to P, S, and surface waves). The approach back-projects the scattered waves until they are in phase with the incident waves at the scatterer locations. The P wave components (divergence of the wavefield) are derived from the spatial derivatives of the measured wavefields. Imaging the near-surface heterogeneities is important for planning seismic surveys or explaining nearsurface related anomalies in the data. The scattered body-to-surface waves travel horizontally along the free surface, and, therefore, they provide optimal illumination of the near-surface compared to scattered body-to-body waves. Additionally, the elastic RTM scheme preserves the relative amplitude because all wave propagation losses, including mode conversions, are properly taken into account. We demonstrate, using synthetic data, that elastic RTM of near-surface scattered waves constructs an accurate and reliable depth image of near-surface scatterers. by Abdulaziz M. Almuhaidib.

The first filter rejects traces base on low P-wave correlation with the stack of all traces at that distance. The sec-ond filter measures coherent energy between all retained traces and suppresses incoherent noise in each trace. With these fil-ters, we can reconstruct clear body waves from each virtual source. Then we estimate 3 D P-wave velocities from these waves with travel-time tomography. The velocities show high resolution structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{incorporate}} <b>body-wave</b> {{arrival time}} and surface-wave dispersion data into a joint inversion for three-dimensional P-wave and S-wave velocity {{structure of the}} crust surrounding {{the site of the}} San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth. The contri-butions of the two data types to the inversion are controlled by the relative weighting of the respective equations. We find that the trade-off between fitting the two data types, controlled by the weighting, defines a clear optimal solution. Varying the weighting away from the optimal point leads to sharp increases in misfit for one data type with only modest reduction in misfit for the other data type. All the acceptable solutions yield structures with similar primary features, but the smaller-scale features change substan-tially. When there is a lower relative weight on the surface-wave data, it appears that the solution over-fits the <b>body-wave</b> data, leading to a relatively rough Vs model, whereas for the optimal weighting, we obtain a relatively smooth model that is able to fit both the <b>body-wave</b> and surface-wave observations adequately...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Removing the crustal {{signature}} from teleseismic {{travel times}} is an im-portant procedure {{to reduce the}} trade-off between crustal and mantle velocity het-erogeneities in seismic tomography. Because reverberations of long- and short-period <b>body-wave</b> arrivals in the crust affect the waveforms of the direct arrivals differently, the crustal effects on travel times measured by waveform cross correlation are fre-quency dependent. With synthetic responses of selected crustal models, this short note illustrates the significance of frequency-dependent crustal corrections to finite-frequency <b>body-wave</b> travel-time tomography. The differences in crustal correction between long- and short-period body waves at the same station can be as large as 0. 6 sec, depending on the crustal thickness, velocity contrast at the Moho, and lay-ering within the crust...|$|E

40|$|Amplitudes of P waves {{recorded}} by long-period seismographs for nuclear explosions in Novaya Zemlya, the Nevada Test Site, and Amchitka Island yield a new <b>body-wave</b> magnitude calibration function for teleseismic distances. At some distances, it {{differs from the}} Gutenberg-Richter (1956) function {{by as much as}} 0. 4 magnitude units. A comparison of short- and long-period <b>body-wave</b> magnitudes for the 1966 Novaya Zemlya event indicates that anelastic attenuation of P waves is greater in the upper than in the lower mantle, but, for waves with periods of 1 sec or greater, the effect of anelastic attenuation on the amplitudes is less than that of geometric spreading. The amplitude data hint at the existence of a second-order velocity discontinuity in the lower mantle at a depth of about 2300 km...|$|E
