25|$|Gneisses are the {{predominant}} rocks in Attappadi. All rock types of Attappadi other than supracrustals could be categorized into seven broad types. They are charnockite, hornblende gneiss, migmaititic amphibolite, quartz biotite gneiss, quartz-feldspathic gneiss, <b>biotite</b> <b>granite</b> gneiss, and pegmatite. Among the rock types charnockite, hornblende gneiss, migmatitic amphibolite, quartz biotite gneiss, quartz-feldspathic gneiss, and <b>biotite</b> <b>granite</b> gneiss {{have been identified}} that belong to the Peninsular Gneissic Complex. The granite and pegmatite of Attappadi represent the post-kinematic intrusives. Many dolerite dykes also have been reported from this area.

Remnants and enclaves of Attappadi supracrustals occur within the gneisses. BIF is another important rock type occurring in close association with the metapyroxinite and amphibolites.|$|E
500|$|Singapore {{took the}} {{position}} that Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge {{should be considered a}} single group of maritime features as Middle Rocks and South Ledge were dependencies of Pedra Branca. It relied, among others, on the Island of Palmas Case (1932): [...] "As regards a group of islands, it is possible that a group may under certain circumstances be regarded as in law a unit, and that the fate of the principal part may involve the rest." [...] It argued that the three maritime features were geomorphologically the same, as rock samples showed that they were all composed of a light, coarse-grained <b>biotite</b> <b>granite.</b> Additionally, Malaysia had not shown any exercise of sovereignty over the uninhabited reefs of Middle Rocks and South Ledge while Singapore had consistently exercised sovereign authority in the surrounding waters. Since sovereignty over Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore, so did sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge as they were within Pedra Branca's territorial waters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the geochronology, petrology, and geochemistry of the two-stage Guikeng pluton, Wuyi Mountain Range, South China, {{with the aim}} of assessing the influence on Indosinian magmatism in South China of collision/amalgamation between the Sibumasu Block and the Indo-China and South China blocks, and between the North China and Yangtze blocks. An additional aim was to summarise the characteristics and geodynamic evolution of Indosinian magmatism in South China. The Guikeng pluton was then compared with the Indosinian Fucheng–Hongshan and Shiwandashan–Darongshan plutons in the Wuyi–Yunkai Mountain Range Belt, two groups of Indosinian granites in Hunan Province (South China Inland Belt), and Indosinian granitoids in the Sulu–South Korea Belt. The Guikeng pluton consists of medium- to fine-grained biotite monzogranites and <b>biotite</b> <b>granites</b> in its marginal belt, medium- to coarse-grained K-feldspar phenocryst-rich <b>biotite</b> <b>granites</b> in its interior part, and late-stage fine-grained muscovite granites. The granites have high Rb, Cs values, (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i, and Rb/Sr ratios, low Sr, Ba, and εNd(t) values, and slightly to moderately negative Eu anomalies. These geochemical characteristics suggest that the granites were derived from late Paleo-proterozoic meta-sedimentary basement (1. 7 – 2. 0 Ga). The rocks of the marginal belt and {{the main part of the}} pluton originated from two distinct magma sources. The fine-grained muscovite granites were produced by intensive differentiation of K-feldspar phenocryst-rich <b>biotite</b> <b>granites.</b> The granites from the marginal belt and the main part of the pluton yield SHRIMP U–Pb zircon ages of 234 ± 3 and 220. 4 ± 3 Ma, respectively, consistent with early and late Indosinian magmatism in South China. The early Indosinian metaluminous to weakly peraluminous foliated <b>biotite</b> <b>granites</b> were formed in a collision/compressional setting, whereas late Indosinian strongly peraluminous massive granites were formed in a post-collision setting. The rock assemblage, source region of Indosinian granites, and tectonic setting differ between South China and Sulu–South Korea, indicating the metamorphic basement of the Ogcheon Metamorphic Belt in North China is different to that of the Nanhua Rift in South China...|$|R

Early Paleocene age of ilmenite gabbro-dolerites and <b>biotite</b> <b>granites</b> {{was confirmed by}} zircon and apatite fission-track dating. Ilmenite and titanomagnetite gabbro-dolerites were produced by multilevel fractional crystallization of basaltic melts with, respectively, moderate and high Fe-Ti contents and contamination of these melts with rhyolitic melts of different compositions. Moderate- and high-Fe-Ti basaltic melts were derived from mantle spinel peridotite variably depleted and metasomatized by slab-derived fluid prior to melting. The melts were generated at variable depths and different degrees of melting. <b>Biotite</b> <b>granites</b> and granite aplites were produced by combined fractional crystallization of a crustal rhyolitic melt and its contamination with terrigenous rocks of the Omgon Group.
