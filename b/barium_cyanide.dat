50|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>cyanide</b> is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula Ba(CN)2. It is synthesized by {{the reaction of}} hydrogen cyanide and barium hydroxide in water or petroleum ether. This white crystal reacts with water and carbon dioxide in air slowly, producing highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possibility}} that atmospheric nitrogen reacts with certain chemicals was first observed by Desfosses in 1828. He observed that mixtures of alkali metal oxides and carbon react at high temperatures with nitrogen. With {{the use of}} barium carbonate as starting material the first commercially used process became available in the 1860s developed by Margueritte and Sourdeval. The resulting <b>barium</b> <b>cyanide</b> could be reacted with steam yielding ammonia. In 1898 Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro decoupled the process and first produced calcium carbide and in a subsequent step reacted it with nitrogen to calcium cyanamide. The Ostwald process {{for the production of}} nitric acid was discovered in 1902. Frank-Caro process and Ostwald process dominated the industrial fixation of nitrogen until the discovery of the Haber process in 1909. Prior to 1900, Nikola Tesla also experimented with the industrial fixation of nitrogen [...] "by using currents of extremely high frequency or rate of vibration".|$|E
40|$|The {{health risks}} for an {{individual}} exposed to contaminants released from SRS outfalls from 1989 to 1995 were estimated. The exposure pathways studied are ingestion of drinking water, ingestion of contaminated fish and dermal contact with contaminants in water while swimming. The estimated incremental risks {{for an individual}} developing cancer vary from 3. E- 06 to 1. 0 E- 05. The estimated total exposure chronic noncancer hazard indices vary from 6. E- 02 to 1. E- 01. The critical contaminants were ranked based on their cancer risks and chronic noncarcinogenic hazard quotients. For cancer risks, the critical contaminants released from SRS outfalls are arsenic, tetrachloroethylene, and benzene. For chronic noncarcinogenic risks, the critical contaminants released from srs outfalls are cadmium, arsenic, silver, chromium, mercury, selenium, nitrate, manganese, zinc, nickel, uranium, <b>barium,</b> copper, tetrachloroethylene, <b>cyanide,</b> and phenol. The critical pathways in decreasing risk order are ingestion of contaminated fish, ingestion of drinking water and dermal contact with contaminants in water while swimming...|$|R
