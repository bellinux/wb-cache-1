5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old <b>boy.</b> <b>I</b> saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

500|$|Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870– 7 October 1922), professionally {{known as}} Marie Lloyd was an English music hall singer, comedian and musical theatre actress.

500|$|... "Adore You" [...] is a pop and R ballad, which {{lasts for}} four minutes and 38 seconds. The song {{performs}} in common time, at a tempo of 60 beats per minute. Played {{in the key}} of C major, the chord structure of C—Fmaj7—Am is followed throughout, and Cyrus's vocal range spans from G3 to A4. Its lyrics discuss [...] "power imbalance in love"; in the chorus, she states her affection towards her boyfriend through the lines [...] "When you say you need me / Know I need you more / <b>Boy,</b> <b>I</b> adore you", although Kyle Fowle of Slant Magazine felt that Cyrus' reliance in her partner is admittedly detrimental to her personal well-being as the song continues.|$|E
500|$|Joining the Maple Leafs for the 1929–30 season, 18-year-old Jackson was the {{youngest}} player in the National Hockey League (NHL). In his league debut, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. [...] Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, [...] "you'll do". Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: [...] "Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. [...] I told him I wasn't a stick <b>boy,</b> <b>I</b> was a hockey player. So he said I {{was nothing but a}} fresh busher [...] and the name stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|Born in London, she was showcased by {{her father}} at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton. [...] In 1884, she made her {{professional}} début as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year. [...] In 1885, she had success with her song [...] "The <b>Boy</b> <b>I</b> Love Is Up in the Gallery", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's West End. [...] In 1891, she was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear in that year's spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomime Humpty Dumpty. She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, Little Bo Peep (1892) and Robinson Crusoe (1893). [...] By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqué content of her songs.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Swift revealed that [...] "Mine" [...] was inspired by an unnamed crush in mind, saying [...] "I was reflecting back on a <b>boy</b> <b>I</b> liked at a certain time." [...] She also told MTV that the song is {{about what it would}} be like if she actually let her guard down. During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about [...] "her tendency to run from love" [...] after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups. She continued, [...] "I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out." ...|$|E
500|$|With Feliciano again up, Secretariat {{returned}} to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2–5 favorite {{caught the attention of}} veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, [...] "You carry an ideal around in your head, and <b>boy,</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible.

500|$|Lloyd {{established}} her {{new name}} on 22 June 1886, with an {{appearance at the}} Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song [...] "The <b>Boy</b> <b>I</b> Love Is Up in the Gallery" [...] (which was initially written for Nelly Power by Lloyd's agent George Ware). By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular {{that she was in}} demand in London's West End, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at skirt dancing. George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she learned from her mother, and one she used {{for the rest of her}} career. She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, The Era called her [...] "a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy." ...|$|E

500|$|When Shaw {{arrived at}} the set for filming, he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid, the actor playing Emperor Palpatine. When McDiarmid {{asked him what he}} was doing there, Shaw responded, [...] "I don't know, dear <b>boy,</b> <b>I</b> think it's {{something}} to do with science-fiction." [...] His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by Richard Marquand, was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue. When the film was re-released on DVD in 2004, a few changes were made: the unmasking scene with Hamill remained mostly the same, but Shaw's eyebrows were digitally removed to tie in with the injuries Anakin Skywalker suffers at the end of [...] Shaw's eyes were also digitally coloured to look like those of Hayden Christensen, the actor who played Anakin in [...] and Revenge of the Sith.|$|E
500|$|The Pope {{remained}} steadfastly {{determined not}} to give Edgardo up, declaring: [...] "What I have done for this <b>boy,</b> <b>I</b> had {{the right and the}} duty to do. If it happened again, I would do the same thing." [...] When the delegation from Rome's Jewish community attended their annual meeting at the Vatican in January 1861, they were surprised to find the nine-year-old Edgardo at the pontiff's side. The new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed a month later with Victor Emmanuel II as king. A reduced incarnation of the Papal States, comprising Rome and its immediate environs, endured outside the new kingdom because of Napoleon III's reluctance to offend his Catholic subjects by withdrawing the French garrison. He pulled these troops out following the entrance of a Jewish child from the Roman Ghetto, nine-year-old Giuseppe Coen, to the Catechumens in 1864. The removal of the French garrison brought the Roman Question to the fore in the Italian parliament. The statesman Marco Minghetti dismissed a proposed compromise whereby Rome would become part of the kingdom with the Pope retaining some special powers, saying: [...] "we cannot go to guard the Mortara boy for the Pope". The French garrison returned in 1867, following an unsuccessful attempt by Garibaldi to capture the city.|$|E

500|$|Executive producers/writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss had {{pitched the}} idea of {{adapting}} Martin's series for television to HBO in March 2006, and the network secured the rights in January 2007. The first actor cast was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion in May 2009. Benioff and Weiss later noted that the funny and [...] "incredibly smart" [...] Dinklage was their first choice for the role, as the actor's [...] "core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well {{in keeping with the}} character." [...] Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, [...] "he wouldn't play elves or leprechauns" [...] and – choosy about genre roles – he had just come from portraying the dwarf Trumpkin in 2008's [...] Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was [...] "a different kind of fantasy little person," [...] or in the actor's words, [...] "No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being." [...] Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because [...] "They told me how popular he was." [...] Martin said of Dinklage's casting, [...] "If he hadn't accepted the part, oh, <b>boy,</b> <b>I</b> don't know what we would have done." [...] Benioff added, [...] "When I read George's books, I decided Tyrion Lannister {{was one of the great}} characters in literature. Not just fantasy literature – literature! A brilliant, caustic, horny, drunken, self-flagellating mess of a man. And there was only one choice to play him." ...|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / <b>Boy</b> <b>I</b> wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E
500|$|Aly Semigran for Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} episode [...] "was {{nowhere near as}} good" [...] as other recent episodes as it was [...] "too {{dependent}} on obvious physical comedy."

The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin was more clearly positive about the episode, calling it a [...] "glorious return to form" [...] and grading the episode an A-. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad opined he was not thrilled with Jenna's plot, observing that it was [...] "kinda ridiculous (and unfunny, which is the worse sin)." [...] Sassone, however, said that Liz and Tracy feuding and Jack and his mother battling [...] "are plots that are always good for some laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that while [...] "The Natural Order" [...] was not a [...] "classic episode" [...] it was still [...] "solid enough, in the end." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Jack and his mother's story, but commented that the Liz and Tracy rivalry was a [...] "hit-or-miss." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts said this episode [...] "is easily the show's most grounded episode ever, even if it does feature a gibbon in a mariachi suit. The script dares to deal with issues of race and gender from a typically irreverent perspective." [...] Fretts noted that Elaine Stritch and Alec Baldwin [...] "share a surprisingly tender scene as Colleen tells her son, 'You're my good <b>boy</b> <b>I</b> just love you to death.'" ...|$|E
