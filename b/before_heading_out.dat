It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with an axe. A week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E

5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States <b>before</b> <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to sea.

5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} Hispaniola rapidly {{weakened}} {{the system to}} a tropical storm early on September4. Moving westward over the Caribbean Sea, the storm failed to re-strengthen before making landfall in western Cuba with winds of 40mph (65km/h) around midday on September6. Thereafter, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico and curved northeastward. At 09:00UTC on September9, the storm again made landfall near Bradenton, Florida with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Later that day, the storm weakened to a tropical depression while crossing Florida. Upon emerging into the Atlantic Ocean on the next day, the system re-intensified into a tropical storm. While located offshore South Carolina, the storm re-attained hurricane status early on September12. The hurricane then brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina <b>before</b> <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to sea. The storm further strengthened to Category2 intensity, heading eastward, but weakened to a tropical storm early on September16. The following day, the storm deteriorated further to a tropical depression, and late on September17, the depression dissipated southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|The revolt in East Anglia was {{independently}} {{suppressed by}} Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich. Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, {{and when he}} found out about it he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went. He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey. He then headed south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reached Cambridge on 19 June, and then headed further into the rebel-controlled areas of Norfolk. Henry reclaimed Norwich on 24 June, <b>before</b> <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster. The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed. Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.|$|E

In the quarter-finals, Aerts was drawn against Rob van Esdonk whom he had {{defeated}} in the Netherlands six months earlier. Van Esdonk knocked Aerts down in round one but Aerts was able to come back and KO him with a right high kick. In the semis, he faced Patrick Smith, an American with a wild, aggressive style. Aerts was still able to handle him, however, and KO'd him just over one minute into the first round. Progressing into the final, he came up against Masaaki Satake for the second time. Aerts simply landed more powerful and a larger amount of strikes on Satake en route to a unanimous decision (27-25, 30-25, 30-29) victory. This made him the 1994 K-1 World Grand Prix Champion.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{the first}} {{adaptation}} of 3 Henry VI is found during the Restoration, when, in 1681, John Crowne created a two-part play entitled Henry the Sixth, The First Part and The Misery of Civil War. Henry comprised Acts 1–3 of 2 Henry VI focusing {{on the death of}} Gloucester, Misery adapted the last two acts of 2 Henry VI and much of 3 Henry VI. Writing at the time of Popish Plot, Crowne, who was a devout royalist, used his adaptation to warn about the danger of allowing England to descend into another civil war, which would be the case should the Whig party rise to power. Changes to the text include a new, albeit silent scene just prior to the Battle of Wakefield where York embraces Rutland <b>before</b> <b>heading</b> <b>out</b> to fight; an extension of the courtship between Edward and Lady Grey, and the edition of two subplots; one concerning a mistress of Edward's whom he accidentally kills in battle (an allusion to Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's Philaster), the other involving an attempt by Warwick to seduce Lady Grey after her husband's death at the Second Battle of St. Albans (this is later used as a rationale for why Warwick turns against Edward). Also worth noting is that the role of Margaret in 3 Henry VI was removed almost entirely, reducing her to two scenes; the death of York and the death of Prince Edward.|$|E

Oulton held the first meeting of the Grapple Executive Committee on New Oxford Street in London on 21 February 1956. The RAF and Royal Engineers would improve the airfield to enable it to operate large, heavily loaded aircraft, and the port and facilities would be improved to enable Christmas Island to operate as a base by 1 December 1956.
