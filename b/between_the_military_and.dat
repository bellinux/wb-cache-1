According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on.|$|E

Alfonsín denounced a pact <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military.

In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E
5|$|An SASR troop was {{deployed}} to Timor Leste in May 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Astute, operating alongside a Commando Company Group {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component following renewed unrest there. On 4 March 2007, along with the commandos, SASR personnel took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. It was reported in October 2006 that 20 SASR operators were in the southern Philippines, supporting Filipino operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah terrorist groups, but this was denied by the Department of Defence. Meanwhile, following tensions in Fiji <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> the government the Australian Government dispatched three naval vessels in November and December 2006 as part of Operation Quickstep, in preparation for a potential evacuation of Australian citizens.

The helicopter's pilot and a soldier from SASR were killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|The Dirty War {{eventually}} ended, and the National Reorganization Process allowed {{political activity}} {{in preparation for}} a return to democracy. Kirchner led one of the three internal factions of the local Justicialist Party (PJ), but Peronist Arturo Puricelli prevailed in the primary elections. Kirchner founded the Ateneo Juan Domingo Perón organization, which supported deposed president Isabel Perón and promoted political dialogue with the military. Cristina Fernández became an attorney of the PJ in Santa Cruz, with the help of Rafael Flores, a former friend from the FURN. Raúl Alfonsín, who was running for president for the Radical Civic Union (UCR), denounced an agreement <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> the Peronist unions which sought an amnesty for the military. Kirchner organized a rally on behalf of Rodolfo Ponce, a union leader mentioned by Alfonsín in his denouncement. Alfonsín won the 1983 presidential election, and Puricelli was elected governor of Santa Cruz. Puricelli sought to unify the local Peronist movement by adding members of the other factions into his government, and appointed Kirchner president of the provincial social-welfare fund.|$|E

25|$|Reasons for the {{cultural}} and connectivity gaps vary widely. The self-selective nature of the All-Volunteer Force is seen by some to {{have led to the}} unrepresentative nature of the armed forces One argument, put forward by a Navy Chief of Chaplains, was that the drawdown {{in the size of the}} military was exacerbating differences and making the separation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian societies potentially even more divisive. He worried that unless an effective dialogue could be maintained <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian branches of society, especially in the area of ethical decision-making, the American military risked losing the support of society or becoming dangerously militaristic. Others argued that the increase in diversity among military personnel has actually strengthened ties between society and the military, especially those ties weakened by the results of the Vietnam War.

25|$|In the post-Suharto period since 1998, {{civilian}} and military leaders have been successfully removing the military influence from politics and advocated the structural reform in military body. For example, the military's representation in the House of Representatives was removed, the police forces was separated completely from armed force, and an active military officer can only serve his/her commission within the armed forces itself and thus is prohibited from being appointed to government positions (including as Minister of Defense). It sometimes comes to armed conflicts <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> the police.|$|E

On November 29, 1951, the military and the police seized power, just as King Bhumibol's ship was returning to Thai waters. Although the military's 1952 constitution, which was similar to the 1932 Constitution, called for elections, the Democrats had been practically barred from government for the following 23 years for their anti-military stance, denying them chances to serve the people.|$|E
25|$|One unique view, {{which does}} not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the {{organizational}} differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>and</b> civilian societies.

This view goes beyond the simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.|$|E
