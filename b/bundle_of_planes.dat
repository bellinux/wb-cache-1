40|$|Abstract: In {{musculoskeletal}} modelling, many muscles {{cannot be}} represented as straight lines from origin to insertion because the bony and musculotendinous morphology of neighboring structures {{causes them to}} wrap. The majority of these passive structures can be adequately described as simple geometric shapes such as spheres and cylinders. Techniques for describing smooth muscle paths around multiple obstacles {{have been developed for}} modelling use. Until now obstacle-set methods have combined the path of single structures. This does not analytically define the shortest smooth path around multiple objects. When a sphere is included in a multiple-object wrapping algorithm, muscle paths around that sphere are restricted to a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> containing the sphere center. This assumed restriction can compromise the iterative process for finding the true shortest muscle path that satisfies all restrictions of a smooth path. This can cause model instability. The new method involves the determination of the shortest smooth muscle path in a spherical and cylindrical wrapping algorithm. A typical example is musculoskeletal modelling of the upper limb, where the muscle fibers have to wrap over this combination of obstacles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study {{a model of}} {{geometry}} of vision due to Petitot, Citti and Sarti. One of the main features of this model is that the primary visual cortex V 1 lifts an image from R 2 to the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> directions <b>of</b> the <b>plane.</b> Neurons are grouped into orientation columns, each of them corresponding to a point <b>of</b> this <b>bundle.</b> In this model a corrupted image is reconstructed by minimizing the energy necessary for the activation of the orientation columns corresponding to regions in which the image is corrupted. The minimization process gives rise to an hypoelliptic heat equation on the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> directions <b>of</b> the <b>plane.</b> In the original model directions are considered both with and without orientation giving rise respectively to a problem on the group of rototranslations <b>of</b> the <b>plane</b> SE(2) or on the projective tangent <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plane</b> PTR 2. We provide a mathematical proof of several important facts for this model. We rst prove that the model is mathematically consistent only if direction are considered without orientation. We then prove that generically the convolution of a L 2 (R 2;R) function (e. g. an image) with a 2 -D Gaussian is generically a Morse function. This fact is important since the lift of Morse functions to PTR 2 is dened on a smooth manifold. We then provide the explicit expression of the hypoelliptic heat kernel on PTR 2 in terms of Mathieu functions. Finally we present the main ideas of an algorithm which allows to perform image reconstruction on real non-academic images. A very interesting point is that this algorithm is massively parallelizable and needs no information on where the image is corrupted...|$|R

Moreover, {{we show that}} the Quot scheme of EX-quotients of rank one and minimal degree is naturally isomorphic to the curve X. Finally we prove that any rank- 2 bundle E on a smooth curve X with the above property is isomorphic to the pull back <b>of</b> the tangent <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> IP 2, for an embedding X → IP 2 (see theorem 4 for the details). Let X be smooth plane curve in IP 2 = IP(V) and ΘIP 2 be the tangent <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> the projective <b>plane.</b> By restriction <b>of</b> the IP 2 -bundle ΘIP 2 (− 1) we obtain a rank- 2 vector bundle EX on X. From the Euler sequence of IP 2 we get the short exact sequence 0 → OX(− 1) → V ∨ ⊗OX → EX → 0. This way we see that EX is spanned. To any geometric point P ∈ IP 2 corresponds, up to scalars, a section of V ∨ ⊗ OX. Hence we get a section sP: OX → EX. We define the line bundle LP to be the minimal subbundle of EX containing this section. LP = ker[EX → (E/im(sp)) /torsion] It {{is obvious that the}} degree of LP is the length of X ∩ P. Hence we obtain: deg(LP) = 1 if P ∈ X 0 otherwise. So we find for any point of X a degree one line bundle in EX. From the Bogomolov inequality we deduce that there are no line <b>bundles</b> in EX <b>of</b> degree greater than one: Lemma 1 For any line bundle L ⊂ EX holds: deg(L) 0.

Or equivalently the inequality a> −d − 1 2 (1) holds. From the exact sequence it, furthermore, follows that: − 1 − b = c 2 (F) = a(1 − d − a) + length(Z). We use this to compute a: a = −d −...|$|R
40|$|From {{geometry}} it is {{well known}} that a Reimannian manifold can either be described internally, giving e. g. the metric as a function of suitable co-ordinates, or by an embedding into some Euclidean space. Embeddings often allow a better visualization of the manifold. On the other hand, they tend to be rather arbitrary. However, this inconvenience does not exist, if one has a canonical embedding, like that of S/sup n/ into R/sup n+ 1 /. If one walks along a closed path in a Reimannian space S, trying to conserve one's orientation at every step, the orientation at the end of the path nevertheless will be different from the one at the start. This phenomenon is described by the Riemannian connection, which can also be visualized with the help of an embedding of S into some R/sup k/. In fact, the latter also yields an embedding <b>of</b> the fibre <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> tangent <b>planes</b> into S*R/sup k/. Gauge fields are also described by a fibre bundle and a connection. They only differ in that the fibres are not related to the geometry of the base space. However, the connection can be described by an embedding, too.

The measurement of CL in a TEM allows spectral information to be correlated with structural information. In-situ electron beam degradation curves of panchromatic CL from GaN epilayers and In(_ 0. 1) Ga(_ 0. 9) N QW emission revealed a decline in the luminescence which could be attributed to the introduction of non-radiative recombination centres. The influence of thickness on both CL spectra and images was investigated experimentally and by modelling. A method of normalising STEM-CL images for thickness contrast was developed. Application of this normalisation to In(_ 0. 1) Ga(_ 0. 9) N QWs in cross-section revealed inhomogeneous CL with bright regions 200 - 700 nm in width. No systematic relationship was identified between luminescence at the QW peak emission wavelength, QW(_A), and luminescence at QW(_A) ± 10 nm. This finding does not support the hypothesis that variation in QW CL brightness is due to local compositional fluctuation. However, clusters of threading dislocations were shown to suppress QW luminescence and are suggested as a cause for the observed inhomogeneity in luminescence. A statistical analysis of (dislocation related) V-pits in In(_x) Ga(_ 1 -x) N MQW samples revealed clustering of pits on a length scale of 60 - 120 nm, but no long range clustering indicative of sub-grain boundaries was found.
