6000|$|... "Exactly, {{but there}} was <b>beeswing</b> only in one glass. You must have noticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?" ...|$|E
60|$|The three {{glasses were}} grouped together, {{all of them}} tinged with wine, {{and one of them}} {{containing}} some dregs of <b>beeswing.</b> The bottle stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply stained cork. Its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. The bottle {{was full}} of it, and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it. There are two {{possible}} explanations, and only two. One is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the third glass received the <b>beeswing.</b> That does not appear probable. No, no, I am sure that I am right." ...|$|E
6000|$|At which, {{like one}} that sees his own excess, [...] And easily forgives {{it as his}} own, [...] He laugh'd; and then was mute; but {{presently}} [...] Wept like a storm: and honest Averill seeing [...] How low his brother's mood had fallen, fetch'd [...] His richest <b>beeswing</b> from a binn reserved [...] For banquets, praised the waning red, and told [...] The vintage--when THIS Aylmer came of age-- [...] Then drank and past it; till at length the two, [...] Tho' Leolin flamed and fell again, agreed [...] That much allowance must be made for men. [...] After an angry dream this kindlier glow [...] Faded with morning, but his purpose held.|$|E
60|$|So {{down over}} Lewthwaite Crag he went: {{a very smart}} groom {{he was at the}} top, and a very shabby one at the bottom; for he tore his gaiters, and he tore his breeches, and he tore his jacket, and he burst his braces, and he burst his boots, and he lost his hat, and what was worst of all, he lost his shirt pin, which he prized very much, for it was gold, and he had won it in a raffle at Malton, and there was a figure at the top of it, of t'ould mare, noble old <b>Beeswing</b> herself, as natural as life; so it was a really severe loss: but he never saw {{anything}} of Tom.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{only two}} glasses were used, {{and that the}} dregs of both were poured into a third glass, so as to give the false {{impression}} that three people had been here. In that way all the <b>beeswing</b> {{would be in the}} last glass, would it not? Yes, I am convinced that this is so. But if I have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be believed, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. That is the mission which now lies before us, and here, Watson, is the Sydenham train." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a dismal}} winter's night, very cold and gusty, {{with the wind}} {{whooping}} in the chimneys and blustering against the window-panes. A thin spatter of rain tinkled on the glass with each fresh sough of the gale, drowning for the instant the dull gurgle and drip from the eaves. Douglas Stone had finished his dinner, and sat by his fire in the study, a glass of rich port upon the malachite table at his elbow. As he raised it to his lips, he held it up against the lamplight, and watched with {{the eye of a}} connoisseur the tiny scales of <b>beeswing</b> which floated in its rich ruby depths. The fire, as it spurted up, threw fitful lights upon his bald, clear-cut face, with its widely-opened grey eyes, its thick and yet firm lips, and the deep, square jaw, which had something Roman in its strength and its animalism. He smiled from time to time as he nestled back in his luxurious chair. Indeed, he had a right to feel well pleased, for, against the advice of six colleagues, he had performed an operation that day of which only two cases were on record, and the result had been brilliant beyond all expectation. No other man in London would have had the daring to plan, or the skill to execute, such a heroic measure.|$|E
