The markings on the hind wing differ as follows:—the discal white patch composed of four elongate spots in interspaces 2-4, that in interspace 4 very <b>broad,</b> <b>filling</b> the interspace between the middle of veins 5 and 6; subterminal series of lunules larger than in latreilli, and all vermilion-red, not crimson, both on the upper and undersides; cilia between tornus and apex of vein 3, apex of tail and cilia at apex of vein 5 vermilion-red. On the underside, the spot of the discal patch in interspace 1 is vermilion-red, and the red lunule of the subterminal series in interspace 2 is produced to the vermilion-red terminal edging below it.

40|$|The opercle is a {{prominent}} craniofacial bone supporting the gill cover in all bony fish {{and has been}} the subject of morphological, developmental, and genetic investigation. We surveyed the shapes of this bone among 110 families spanning the teleost tree and examined its pattern of occupancy in a principal component-based morphospace. Contrasting with expectations from the literature that suggest the local morphospace would be only sparsely occupied, we find primarily dense, <b>broad</b> <b>filling</b> of the morphological landscape, indicating rich diversity. Phylomorphospace plots suggest that dynamic evolution underlies the observed spatial patterning. Evolutionary transits through the morphospaces are sometimes long, and occur in a variety of directions. The trajectories seem to represent both evolutionary divergences and convergences, the latter supported by convevol analysis. We suggest that that this pattern of occupancy reflects the various adaptations of different groups of fishes, seemingly paralleling their diverse marine and freshwater ecologies and life histories. Opercle shape evolution within the acanthomorphs, spiny ray-finned fishes, appears to have been especially dynamic...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study, in a <b>broad</b> sense, <b>fills</b> in {{the missing}} parts in {{previous}} efforts at pullback stripping mode design with a dipping coal seam. Three different spoiling procedures have been developed: the normal mode, where the coal seam is flat/nearly flat; the uphill mode, where the coal seam is dipping and the dragline spoils uphill; and the downhill mode, where the coal seam is again dipping but the dragline spoils downhill. The spoiling pattern {{has a great}} impact on dragline efficiency. The waste can be spoiled near the set on which the dragline sits or near the set on which the dragline digs Each pattern has been analysed in pit geometry design. The study of pullback design has been extended to cover key cut waste placement in order to operate with various pit width values and spoil-side concerns to control spoil-bound conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|The Bangkok subsoil {{that forms}} {{part of the}} larger Chao Phraya Plain {{consists}} of a <b>broad</b> basin <b>filled</b> with sedimen-tary soil deposits that form alternate layers of sand, gravel and clay. The depth of the bedrock is still undetermined, but its level in the Bangkok area is known to vary between 400 m and 1800 m deep. The aquifer system beneath the city area is very complex, and the deep-well pumping from the aquifers over the last 50 years or so has caused substantial piezometric drawdown in the upper soft and highly compressible clay layer. In this paper, the influence of the piezometric drawdown on the performance of vertical drains with surcharge on the upper clay layer is examined. Instrumented test embankments were built and the performance of large-diameter sand drains, sand wicks and prefabricated vertical drains was examined. A novel interpretation technique was adopted to evaluate the settlements from pore pressure dissipation and to compare with those measured directly from settlement measurements.
