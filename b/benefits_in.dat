5|$|Although less {{prevalent}} in modern post-industrial Western societies, the offering of premasticated foods to infants {{is found in}} many traditional cultures and offers their infants numerous <b>benefits.</b> <b>In</b> North America, premastication is still commonly used by Black and Hispanic mothers, and commonly used by women of Inuit and Aleut peoples.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe working conditions, and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} demand for coal, {{resulting}} {{from an economic}} downturn, many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E

5|$|Final {{approval}} for the project was granted in August 2015 by the Seattle City Council, who also approved the substation's unconventional design incorporating public <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> exchange for a street vacation. Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract for the substation project, working alongside subcontractors Valley Electric, W.A. Chester and Transcon. Construction of the substation began in May 2016, {{and by the end}} of the year, the first outer walls were erected. When completed and energized in 2018, the Denny Substation will be the first new substation built by Seattle City Light in 30 years.|$|E

Recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) figures {{indicate}} that the most deprived datazone in Fife is Gallatown and Sinclairtown which has a rank of 82, meaning that it is amongst the 5% most deprived areas in Scotland. Linktown, Seafield, Hayfield, Smeaton and Templehall East areas in Kirkcaldy fall within the 5–10% banding of most deprived communities in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour {{was to be}} an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a show of support and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E

5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the <b>{{benefits}}</b> <b>in</b> some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> the same way.|$|E
5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered some material <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic {{representatives of the}} Baltic states in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying Baltic flags. By establishing a non-recognition policy, it allowed some 120,000 postwar displaced persons from the Baltic states to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E

5|$|Predators of the choughs {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings.

The red-billed chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.|$|E

5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> this area.

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, <b>benefits.</b> <b>In</b> 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With {{the formation of the}} competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.|$|E
5|$|This {{new system}} allowed rural {{residents}} to migrate, {{it did not}} allow them to change their residence or accept any <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> the cities.

Many migrant women do not trust the government to protect their rights. Today, up to 90% of migrants work without contracts, in violation of the Chinese labour law.|$|E
