60|$|The firm {{closing of}} the eyelids and {{consequent}} compression of the eyeball,--and this is a most important element in various expressions,--serves to protect the eyes from becoming too much gorged with blood, as will presently be explained in detail. With respect to {{the order in which}} the several muscles contract in firmly compressing the eyes, I am indebted to Dr. Langstaff, of Southampton, for some observations, which I have since repeated. The best plan for observing the order is to make a person first raise his eyebrows, and this produces transverse wrinkles across the forehead; and then very gradually to contract all the muscles round the elves with as much force as possible. The reader who is unacquainted with the anatomy of the face, ought to refer to p. 24, and look at the woodcuts 1 to 3. The corrugators of the brow (corrugator supercilii) seem to be the first muscles to contract; and these draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards towards the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> causing vertical furrows, that is a frown, to appear between the eyebrows; {{at the same time they}} cause the disappearance of the transverse wrinkles across the forehead. The orbicular muscles contract almost simultaneously with the corrugators, and produce wrinkles all round the eyes; they appear, however, to be enabled to contract with greater force, as soon as the contraction of the corrugators has given them some support. Lastly, the pyramidal muscles of the nose contract; and these draw the eyebrows and the skin of the forehead still lower down, producing short transverse wrinkles across the base of the nose.[2] For the sake of brevity these muscles will generally be spoken of as the orbiculars, or as those surrounding the eyes.|$|E

50|$|The body is slender, {{elongated}} {{and completely}} covered with thorns. These are sharp with dark tips, and uniformly sized on the prehensile tail. The trunk has long thorns which continue until the coronet, which has 4-5. The head is also provided with numerous spines especially on <b>the</b> forehead, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheeks, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and above <b>the</b> eyes. The snout is {{very long and}} tapered. Body coloration is highly variable to match surroundings and goes from grey to cream, and from bright yellow, to green or red and even brownish. It can be plain or with different pattern on the side or/and on the backside. The snout is generally striped {{with one or more}} thin white lines.|$|R
50|$|Successful {{reconstruction}} of the upper lip attempts to maintain the anatomic relationship of the philtrum (central portion of upper lip) and the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> Not distorting the commissure is also desirable for upper lip reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Subtle {{changes to}} the shape and {{structure}} of lips can have a strong influence on feminization. The distance between the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> {{and the top of}} the upper lip tends to be longer in males than in females and the upper lip is longer; when a female mouth is open and relaxed the upper incisors are often exposed by a few millimeters.|$|E
50|$|An {{incision}} {{is usually}} made {{just under the}} <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and a section of skin is removed. When the gap is closed it {{has the effect of}} lifting the top lip, placing it in a more feminine position and often exposing a little of the upper incisors. The surgeon can also use a lip lift to roll the top lip out a little making it appear fuller.|$|E
50|$|According to {{a review}} by Henry Ogg Forbes in 1894, the species differs from other {{sportive}} lemurs—as its name suggests—by having significantly smaller molar teeth.

5000|$|In {{all of the}} {{following}} nose cone shape equations, L is the overall length of the nose cone and R is the radius of the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> cone. y is the radius at any point x, as x varies from 0, {{at the tip of}} the nose cone, to L. The equations define the 2-dimensional profile of the nose shape. The full body of revolution of the nose cone is formed by rotating the profile around the centerline (C/L). While the equations describe the [...] "perfect" [...] shape, practical nose cones are often blunted or truncated for manufacturing or aerodynamic reasons.|$|E
50|$|The {{profile of}} this shape is {{one-half}} of an ellipse, {{with the major}} axis being the centerline and the minor axis being the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> cone. A rotation of a full ellipse about its major axis is called a prolate spheroid, so an elliptical nose shape would properly {{be known as a}} prolate hemispheroid. This shape is popular in subsonic flight (such as model rocketry) due to the blunt nose and tangent base. This is not a shape normally found in professional rocketry, which almost always flies at much higher velocities where other designs are more suitable. If R equals L, this is a hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed over one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through {{a gap in the}} hills and were in front <b>of</b> them.

As the Rangers started to move forward, toward <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge <b>nose,</b> they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} a bullet {{striking}} the human body depends greatly on which organ is struck during penetration. In some instances, the assailant might drop quickly; in others, there might be no apparent effect. A bullet striking the brain kills the assailant almost without exception. Recognizing that similar situations would occur, Cooper popularized the term Mozambique Drill based on the technique improvised by his student there. This drill consists of shooting two rounds {{to the center of}} the torso, followed by a pause and assessment of the situation and then a more carefully aimed shot to the head, specifically, in the triangle formed between the eyes and the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> The [...] "head shot" [...] is required to enter this [...] "fatal triangle" [...] because any other shot in the head with a handgun runs a higher chance of being non-debilitating because of striking thicker cranial bones or the teeth. Under nearly any condition, engaging an assailant with the Mozambique Drill should offer a high probability that one's assailant will be stopped and likely killed.|$|E
5000|$|He {{had left}} Sunbeam and Irving's new employers, Humfrey-Sandberg, granted him {{permission}} to use part of his time designing and constructing Golden Arrow for ex-Sunbeam driver Henry Segrave. Golden Arrow was, Segrave said, very docile compared with other cars of its kind. [...] After the first trial run when he established no goggles were necessary at 182 mph Segrave drove the car up some planks to get it off the beach then drove it back along <b>the</b> main street <b>of</b> Daytona to its garage. The sponsors required a British brand name for the engine and Napier was chosen. Dunlop's tyres were not warranted safe beyond 250 mph so <b>the</b> planned maximum <b>of</b> 274 mph was pulled back.

At that time the car was notable among land speed record cars for having 4-wheel brakes. Suspension was by half-elliptic leaf springs all round, axle travel was limited to just 1¼ inches in front and 1¾ at the rear axle. The car was built at KLG Works on Kingston Hill.|$|R

5000|$|Of his Jutarnji columns, the {{one that}} {{garnered}} most attention and reaction was Arsenijević's intricately long, stinging July 2012 denouncement and condemnation of film director Emir Kusturica. Dissatisfied with Kusturica's latest project — Ivo Andrić-inspired Kamengrad in Višegrad, Republika Srpska, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Arsenijević goes after the director, labeling him [...] "a pompous man who, thanks to his bizarre Serbian nationalism, was able to cajolingly ingratiate himself to every ruling Serbian political figure from the 1990s onward - starting with Milošević, over to Đinđić and Koštunica, and finally Tadić, as a warm male embrace with Tomislav Nikolić surely awaits him in the near future" [...] while describing Kusturica's previous Drvengrad project as [...] "a monument to his own self and his own worldview with his own financial interest and personality cult installed in it, all made possible through mutual cooperation of several politicians in Serbia who couldn't agree on anything else, but nevertheless found minimum consensus over Kusturica". Arsenijević goes on to proclaim Kusturica [...] "a two-headed beast: ethno-nationalist with a severe identity crisis, declared leftist with a far right sensibility, ruthless landowner who's also a fiery anti-capitalist, a state artist in the clothing of a faux rebel, an obedient yet astute servant of many powerful individuals" [...] while describing him as [...] "a man {{who could have been}} and had to have been something more, but instead turned into a sad symptom of a sad time we all live in". Arsenijević then turns to Kusturica's physical characteristics, pointing out the director is [...] "large, strong, big-headed with a long head of hair" [...] while describing him as [...] "having a blast during the apocalyptic 1990s in Serbia" [...] and wondering if [...] "perhaps that explains Kusturica's abundance of megalomania that manifests itself through being stricken with a pharaonic complex and possessing a screaming compulsion for leaving large traces behind such as endowments, ethno-villages, pseudo-towns, etc. — Kusturica's pyramids of sorts". Arsenijević eventually gets to Kamengrad also known as Andrićgrad, blasting it as [...] "a kitschy shopping mall {{in the form of an}} ethno-town founded on bad taste and lies, all erected by a kitschy director in a deadly-kitsch pseudo-state, the so-called Republika Srpska, represented by the man of sizable head, manly chin, cross-eyed gaze, as well as tiring and ineloquent narrative—the (in)famous Milorad Dodik". The columnist further denounces Kusturica and his project in Višegrad, laughing off its stated 'multiethnic nature' over what he sees to be the director's failure to clearly acknowledge and properly commemorate the Bosnian Muslim victims in the city during the Bosnian War, seeing this omission as [...] "Kusturica's true legacy and his only lasting pyramid that's going to remain long after his vainly erected 'towns' have been wiped off the face of the earth". Arsenijević closes by ironically wondering how would Ivo Andrić have reacted to Kusturica's town. And answers that Andrić [...] "has for the umpteenth time been hijacked, misused, maltreated, humiliated, and brutally raped" [...] before imagining Andrić [...] "a slight, physically feeble, and restrained man without a shred of Ottoman or Balkan atavism in him, 'tender and white with a painfully-thin fragrant soul'" [...] yielding to [...] "Kusturica's brutal appearance featuring greasy hair, withered highland never quite cleanshaven face, neurotic wrinkle in the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> and a suspicious gaze".|$|E

Channon moved the company up around the tanks on a small hill ahead. The tank company commander then moved the tanks up to the final objective for the day about 300-400 yards ahead. Jess Tildwell was with him, so Channon brought the company up to that small hill and got it organized. Bob Scully, Channon's third radio operator for the day, was wounded when a mortar round hit. Jess Tildwell had Channon get on a tank with other wounded for the trip back to clearing station.On the way back Channon noticed that there was more than a two thousand yard gap before they saw any fighting elements. So before continuing on, he had a jeep take him to the tank battalion CP. He strongly suggested the gap be closed before dark, which was done and 3rd Company was replaced on line. In addition to those wounded who were able to continue on, four Rangers were killed along with 25 wounded and evacuated in this first engagement.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to define in the en face {{photographs}} of young Greek adults with a harmonious face and an Angle Class 1 occlusion (I) measurements of lip width and height, as well as measurements of the distance of both lips from the level of the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> (2) facial types based on the ratio of upper to lower face height, as well as the ratio of the face height to face width, and (3) measurements of lip width and height, as well as measurements. of the distance of each lip from the level of the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose.</b> These measurements should be characteristic for every facial type and could be used as a data bank of reference values and of the range of normal values. The sample consisted of 84 dental students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki who were characterized by (I) bilateral Angle Class I molar and canine relationships, (2) minimal crowding at the lower anterior teeth, (3) harmonious soft tissue profile, (4) absence of dental arch and face asymmetry, and (5) no previous orthodontic treatment. A specially regulated cephalostat was constructed and used for photographing, the distance of each subject from the camera was fixed at I. 5 m, and a proportional development of the photographs was applied. On each photograph 9 soft tissue points were defined so that the reference planes and the 10 measurements were constructed. Elaboration of the data included discriptive statistical analysis, Student's t-test, Cluster test, Anova and the method of multiple comparisons (Post Hoc test). The most important findings revealed: (1) Statistically significant differences between the two sexes concerning the width of the lip fissure, the distance of each lip from the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> the upper and lower face height and the width of the face. (2) Classification of faces into three groups based on the ratio of the upper to the lower face height (79. 8 %: the upper face height was equal to the lower face height; 13. 1 % the upper face height exceeded that of the lower face height; 7. 1 %: the lower face height exceeded that of the upper face height). (3) Classification of faces into three groups based on the ratio of face height to face width (25. 3 %: the face height was smaller than the face width; 59 % the face height was equal to the face width; 15. 7 %: the face height was longer than the face width). (4) The Anova analysis showed statistically significant differences in the mean values of the three groups concerning only the distance of the lower lip from the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> and the lower face height. (5) For the total sample, the upper lip height was smaller than the lower lip height with mean values of 5. 93 mm and 10. 03 mm, respectively. Also the lower face height was found to be smaller (58. 74 mm) in relation to the upper face height (63. 02 mm).

After informed consent, cellophane-tape preparations were taken from student’s face, especially from the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose,</b> underside of the jaw and the sides of the forehead were examined microscopically. Pearson’s chi-square test was used for statistically analyze and p 0. 05). Conclusion: This parasite transmitted by close contact from person to person can be found in healthy individuals...|$|E
40|$|As {{esthetic}} improvement {{continues to}} be a primary goal of orthodontic patients and practitioners, {{it is important to understand}} the soft tissue movements that occur during the transition from rest to smile. Advances in technology allow capture of 3 -dimesional photographs. The purpose of this study was to quantify the soft tissue changes that occur upon smiling and to compare changes between males and females using 3 -dimensional photography. Fifty-four participants had resting and smiling photographs taken with the 3 dMDface camera system. The two images were registered on stable facial surfaces, landmarks were placed, and measurements were recorded. Three-dimensional changes occurred in the following regions of the face in both males and females: eyes, ears, nose and lips. Intercommissure width of the lips was shown to increase more in females than males, but males showed increased mobility in landmarks at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nose...</b>|$|E
