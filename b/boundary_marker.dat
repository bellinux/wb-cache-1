5|$|Nico Ditch is a six-mile (9.7km) long linear {{earthwork}} between Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford in Greater Manchester, England. It was dug as {{a defensive}} fortification, or possibly a <b>boundary</b> <b>marker,</b> between the 5th and 11th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival of an early animistic reverence for the power inherent in the <b>boundary</b> <b>marker,</b> or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the battle}} {{is one of only}} five battlefields in Norfolk that are {{recognised}} by Norfolk County Council. The battle was commemorated by three mediaeval stone crosses: one is on private land; another (now a stump) was relocated by North Walsham Urban District Council in 1932 and can be found near the roadside by the town's water towers; the third cross was moved and used as a parish <b>boundary</b> <b>marker.</b> It is situated on Toff’s Loke, off Norwich Road.|$|E
50|$|In {{developed}} countries {{the use of}} markers for land ownership has in many places been replaced by maps and land ownership registration. <b>Boundary</b> <b>markers</b> are not legal markers in Western countries and may have troublesome legal effects. However, <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> have legal meaning in Japan, and are generally installed across the country. Markers are still used extensively for marking international borders, which are traditionally classified into two categories: natural boundaries, correlating to topographical features such as rivers or mountain ranges, and artificial boundaries, which have no obvious relation to topography. The latter category includes borders defined by <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> such as stones and walls. International <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> are placed and can be maintained by mutual agreement of the bordering countries.|$|R

5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a <b>boundary</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch was {{constructed}} some {{time between the}} end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, or {{it may have been a}} late 8th or early 9th century <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E

5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of <b>boundary</b> <b>marker.</b> The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{follows the}} {{northern}} edge of the town of Chevy Chase and crosses Coquellin Run, then follows the southern edge of Columbia Country Club to its intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue). The highway leaves the town of Chevy Chase and passes through an unincorporated area of Chevy Chase, within which the highway meets the northern end of MD 186 (Brookville Road) and descends into the valley of Rock Creek. At the bottom of the hill, MD 410 intersects Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive, the main road through Rock Creek Park. The state highway crosses Rock Creek, passes to the north of Meadowbrook Park and leaves the valley as a four-lane road with narrow median and flanking service roads. MD 410 reaches {{the top of the hill}} at Grubb Road and descends into the valley of a branch of Rock Creek. The highway becomes undivided at Sundale Drive and crosses the stream just west of the northern corner of the District of Columbia and its attendant <b>boundary</b> <b>marker,</b> then leaves the stream valley and ascends to an intersection with MD 390 (16th Street) at the western edge of downtown Silver Spring.|$|E

25|$|In 1790, the District of Columbia was created. It was {{surveyed}} in 1791–1792, and <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> stones {{were placed in}} the wilderness at one-mile (1.6km) intervals.

25|$|As {{to whether}} the Deakins line or Michler line was the correct meridan, Justice Day conceded that the Michler line more truly {{reflected}} {{the intent of the}} land grant to Lord Baltimore. But Day also noted that maps in that era were inaccurate at best, and little surveying of the land had been done. The location of the Fairfax Stone, however, was known and clearly had been referred to as a <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> by both states. Indeed, the constitution of Maryland even referred to it as such.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the spatial distribution patterns of isolated woody plants on farmland boundaries in Ibaraki Prefecture. Large areas of central and southern Ibaraki Prefecture are composed of flat upland fields and lowland paddy fields. Isolated woody markers are mostly observed in flat upland fields, which lack a distinct elevated grassy boundary as in paddy fields. Therefore, the distribution of farmland <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> was investigated in flat upland field areas. In addition, the introduction history and management status of <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> and other uses of the plants were investigated by interviewing land managers. Based on our findings, we suggest some means for preserving isolated woody <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> in the study region.|$|R
30|$|Although {{only the}} six species {{illustrated}} in Figure 3 had a distribution probability gradient {{of more than}} 5 % at our sampling scale and intensity, minor marker usage may be heterogeneous at much finer local scales. Moreover, two managers in Tsukuba city and Ishioka city said that P. villosa was also frequently used along woodland boundaries. This may indicate that species selection of woodland <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> also has regional variation, as we found for upland field <b>boundary</b> <b>markers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The undulating summit plateau of Sheffield Pike has marshy {{ground and}} small tarns in places between rocky outcrops, with rough grass and heather. A broad cairn {{on top of}} an outcrop of rock marks the summit. Two iron posts, one on Heron Pike and the other above Nick Head, are inscribed “H 1912” on one side and “M 1912” on the other. These mark the {{boundary}} between the Howard estate of Greystoke and the Marshall estate of Patterdale. The summit cairn also carries an old stone <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> with the H and M initials as well as a cryptic E.R. and the date 1830.|$|E
25|$|Denton was {{originally}} {{one of the}} townships of the ancient parish of Manchester in the Salford Hundred of Lancashire. In 1866 it became a civil parish in its own right. The parish was expanded in 1894 by {{the inclusion of the}} Haughton township, the former area of which now covers {{the eastern part of the}} town. The name of Haughton survives as local place names at Haughton Green and Haughton Dale, both in south Denton. Clues to the former township do still exist at Haughton Street, Haughton Hall Road, the Parish Church of St. Anne, Haughton, and etched onto an ancient <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> on Broomstair Bridge on the A57 Hyde Road – (CHESHIRE Township of Hyde | Township of Haughton LANCASHIRE). Also in 1894 the enlarged parish became Denton Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the area is {{connected}} to the Chiapa people, who occupied the Central Valley area before the arrival of the Spanish. The origin of these people is not known, but theories have them migrating north from Nicaragua or even Paraguay. Their main settlement was in Chiapa de Corzo near the canyon, with a fortified area in the higher areas in the canyon for protection from invasions. The Chiapa fiercely resisted Spanish conquest and were not subdued until the arrival of Diego de Mazariegos in 1528. Their last refuge was in the fortified area, now known as the archeological site of the Ruins of Berlin. Here the last of the Chiapa held out from 1528 to 1535 after the Spanish took over the main city. Legend states that when this last fortification fell, the remaining Chiapa committed collective suicide by jumping into the canyon. Since then, the canyon has served as a <b>boundary</b> <b>marker</b> between the Zoque and Tzotzil peoples.|$|E
