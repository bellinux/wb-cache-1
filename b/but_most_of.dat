5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Australian team {{were watching the}} match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where {{they would have been}} able to hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E

5|$|After initial {{organizational}} problems, the weakened detachment {{reached an}} {{area near the}} village of Košute where they were engaged by Ustaše Militia backed by Italian reinforcements. After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders, members of the detachment began to retreat. In the end, the Partisans suffered four killed in action and 25 taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. All but three of the prisoners were later executed by firing squad. A Split Detachment was reformed, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its fighters were part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Murphy {{enjoyed a}} 21-year acting career. He played {{himself in the}} 1955 autobiographical film To Hell and Back, based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his roles were in westerns. He made guest {{appearances}} on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.|$|E

One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit Chicago, sinking her.|$|E

5|$|Bat dung, {{a type of}} guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertilizer.

5|$|Because of {{the last}} years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them are still {{construction}} sites. Beside these, {{there are some other}} building areas like Tineretului, Lombului or Oser, which are likely to become districts in the following years.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the race}} started, 78 riders {{had signed up}} for the race. Eighteen of those did not start the race, so the Tour began with 60 riders, {{including}} former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them rode with an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up {{to the start of the}} Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.|$|E

5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries, much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources also {{differed}} on his status. Foreign visitors {{often called}} him a chief, especially during his capacity as royal governor, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries like Samuel Kamakau, missionary Hiram Bingham I, and even King Kamehameha III considered him a makaʻāinana or commoner.

5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E

5|$|Dunrobin's origins {{lie in the}} Middle Ages, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the present}} {{building}} and the gardens were added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850.

After being used as a boarding school for seven years, it is now open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Females are not territorial, {{and live}} {{alone or with}} their offspring.

5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask.|$|E
5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
