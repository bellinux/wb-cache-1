5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, Tomko) against {{the team of}} Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe. Jim Cornette, Management Director, made the {{announcement}} on the November 15 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. The match was {{at the request of}} Hall and Nash, with the stipulation that they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a mystery partner. Their mystery partner was later revealed to be Joe during the same episode. The buildup to this encounter began on the November 8 episode of Impact!, when Nash questioned if Hall was Sting's mystery partner in a tag team match against Nash and Angle at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November 11. Hall denied he was Sting's partner and at the sametime mended an alliance with Nash. At Genesis, then-champion Angle and Nash faced Sting and the debuting Booker T in a tag team match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash almost won the encounter before being attacked by Angle, thus costing him the pinfall and the championship, and creating a rivalry between the two.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches on the under-card was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H {{would have to}} defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Chris Benoit, Edge, or Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton to capture the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on Raw, Triple H had a celebration thrown in his honor, complete with women, confetti, streamers and a giant cake. Orton, however, sought revenge by {{coming out of the}} cake and assaulting the three members of Evolution, Triple H's stable with Ric Flair and Batista, which Orton had previously been a part of. On the October 4 episode of Raw, it was announced that because Orton has not won the opportunity to challenge Triple H, fans would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> between three potential contenders for Triple H's World title at Taboo Tuesday. Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 episode of Raw, a standard match involving three wrestlers, called a Triple Threat match, was scheduled between Benoit, Edge, and Michaels. Edge won the match after he pinned Benoit by using the ring ropes for unfair leverage. During the match, Michaels legitimately injured his left knee, tearing his meniscus.|$|E

25|$|The Howard Stern Show was {{syndicated}} to 26 stations nationwide {{by the end}} of 1995, and was {{the subject}} of two Billboard awards for Network/Syndicated Program of the Year in the modern rock and mainstream rock categories in 1996.

Stations would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> shows from a 24-hour menu or carry the network's programming around the clock. In November, the show relocated to a new studio in New York City, four times the size of its former location that housed space for bands to perform. Live performances increased then on, including those by Bush, Stone Temple Pilots, Cheap Trick and White Zombie, in the first four months. By the end of 1996, the show aired on 34 stations.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be {{classified}} in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, Eve may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts. Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient. Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved; see Cryptanalysis of the Enigma for some historical examples of this).|$|E

25|$|In 1971, the FDF {{managed to}} secure the right for {{individuals}} to again <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the language of their education, and the FDF expected that Francization would continue as before. Initially, the effect was {{a reduction in the}} number of students enrolled in Flemish schools, falling from 6000 students in elementary school and 16,000 in high school in 1966-1967 to 5000 and 12,000 nine years later. But by that point, the Flemish Centre of Education, created in 1967, had begun its campaign to promote education in Dutch, with its initial target being Dutch-speaking families. In 1976, this task was taken up by the precursor to today's Flemish Community Commission (VGC), which made substantial investments to improve the quality of Dutch language schools. Starting in the 1978-1979 school year, the strategy began to bear fruit, and the number of children enrolled in Flemish daycares began to increase. This translated to an increase in the enrollment in primary schools a few years later. As a result, all young Dutch-speaking children born after the mid-1970s have only gone to Flemish schools. The Francization of Dutch-speakers became more and more rare with time. Nonetheless, foreign immigration continued to tilt the balance in favor of French.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. She is called Dakhamunzu in the Hittite annuals, a possible transliteration of the Egyptian title Tahemetnesu (The King's Wife). Possible candidates are Nefertiti, Meritaten, and Ankhesenamun. Ankhesenamun seemed once likely since there were no candidates for the throne {{on the death of}} her husband, Tutankhamun, whereas Akhenaten had at least two legitimate successors. but this was based on a 27-year reign for the last 18th pharaoh Horemheb who is now accepted to have had a shorter reign of only 14 years. This makes the deceased Egyptian king appear to be Akhenaten instead rather than Tutankhamun. The phrase regarding marriage to 'one of my subjects' (translated by some as 'servants') is possibly a reference to the Grand Vizier Ay or a secondary member of the Egyptian royal family line. Since Nefertiti was depicted as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt's enemies, she might be the Dakhamunzu in the Amarna correspondence as Nicholas Reeves believes. Ankhesenamun may have been pressured by Ay to marry him and legitimise his claim to the throne of Egypt (which she eventually did) This also might explain why she describes herself as 'afraid', especially considering the popular (but not widely accepted) theory that Ay had a hand in her husband's death. A CT scan taken in 2005 shows that he had badly broken his leg shortly before his death, and that the leg had become infected. DNA analysis conducted in 2010 showed the presence of malaria in his system. It is believed that these two conditions, malaria and leiomyomata, combined, led to his death. However, Ankhesenamun was not as powerful as Nefertiti to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> her spouse from a foreign state.|$|E
