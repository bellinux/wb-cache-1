5|$|In response, the Seventh Air Force {{launched}} repeated {{strikes on}} the Yen Vien rail yard and other infrastructures which linked Hanoi with the China buffer zone. On 21 August 1967, a formation of twenty F-105 Thunderchiefs and eight F-4 Phantoms raided Yen Vien, which contained about 150 boxcars. The Americans {{claimed to have}} damaged {{more than half of}} the boxcars and trapped the remainder in the rail yard, so they returned two days later to destroy the rest. On the afternoon of 23 August 1967, a flight of sixteen F-4s from the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing escorted a formation of thirty-six F-105 strike aircraft from the 355th and 388th Tactical Fighter Wings based in Thailand, for the second attack on Yen Vien. The 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron provided two flights of F-4 Phantoms, ‘Ford’ flight and ‘Falcon’ flight. The mission was led by Colonel Nicholas J. Donelson with Olds, who spearheaded Operation Bolo <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> as the leader of the escort formation. At 1:45pm on 23 August, North Vietnamese radars detected a flight of 40 U.S aircraft approaching Hanoi from Sam Neua, in neighboring Laos.|$|E

Meanwhile, in the ring, Cibernético took advantage of the distraction, hit Parka with a Garra Cibernetica and pinned him for the win. After the match, Cibernético revealed that Taboo had been the one who had helped him invade Parka's home and provided him with the X-rays of his godson's broken leg <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January.</b> Taboo ended the segment by declaring Los Bizarros his new family.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 2009, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, {{a senior}} al-Qaeda leader in East Africa {{as well as}} a senior leader in Shabaab, al Qaeda's {{surrogate}} in Somalia, was killed by elements of U.S. Special Operations. According to a witness, at least two AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters strafed a two-car convoy. Navy SEALs then seized the body of Nabhan and took two other wounded fighters captive. JSOC and the CIA had been trying to kill Nabhan for some time including <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January</b> 2007, when an AC-130 Gunship was called in on one attempt. A U.S. intelligence source stated that CIA paramilitary teams are directly embedded with Ethiopian forces in Somalia, allowing for the tactical intelligence to launch these operations. Nabhan was wanted for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, as well as leading the cell behind the 2002 Mombasa attacks.|$|E
500|$|On 4 March the Japanese {{mounted a}} retaliatory {{raid on the}} Buna airfield, {{the site of a}} base that the Allies had {{captured}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> though the fighters did little damage. Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred [...] "after the horse had been stolen from the barn. It was a good thing that the Nip air commander was stupid.

500|$|Dylan's {{relationship}} with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic {{in the composition}} of the Freewheelin album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January</b> 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin to Dylan's fraught {{relationship with}} Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as [...] "chicks", and she resented being regarded as [...] "a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention".|$|E

500|$|The Allied Air Forces {{had used}} 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped 261 500-pound and 253 thousand-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former, and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48, or 35percent, were {{claimed to have}} hit, but only 29, or 7.5percent, of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This {{compared}} favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships' anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack, but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions. [...] The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another.|$|E

2500|$|Nine {{days into}} the series, Channel 4 was criticised for {{deciding}} to air the word [...] "nigger" [...] on their daily highlights show. After the criticism they received for not handling the Celebrity Big Brother racism allegations properly <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January,</b> they were quick to intervene after Emily used the word in conversation with Charley. On the other hand, Charley and Nicky subsequently used the same contentious word several times, in reference to Emily's use. No action was seen to be taken against them. After Emily's disqualification from the competition was announced, 922 viewers complained to Ofcom, the British television regulator, believing that it was unfair. Another 270 people expressed dissatisfaction with Channel 4's decision to air the word [...] "nigger" [...] uncensored. Parr was invited on BBLB, which also caused disturbances, but postponed her appearance. The press and Dermot presumed she postponed due to the controversy, but as she revealed in her BBLB interview, it was not.|$|E
2500|$|Navratilova won {{her first}} major singles title at Wimbledon in 1978, where she {{defeated}} Evert in three sets {{in the final}} and captured the World No. 1 ranking {{for the first time}} on the WTA computer, a position she held until Evert took it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>January</b> 1979. Navratilova successfully defended her Wimbledon title in 1979, again beating Evert in the final in straight sets, and earned the World No. 1 ranking at the end of the year for the first time. Just before Wimbledon in 1979, Navratilova and Evert played possibly the highest scoring women's professional match ever in the Eastbourne final, in which Evert edged Navratilova 7–5, 5–7, 13-11 after facing match points herself. In April 1981, Evert defeated Navratilova in the finals of the Women's Tennis Association championships, held on clay at Amelia Island, 6–0, 6–0. It was Navratilova's only professional double bagel loss (one she later avenged with a crushing 6–2, 6–0 defeat of Evert in the finals of the same Amelia Island event in 1984). [...] It was at this point that Navratilova began working with Nancy Lieberman to improve her fitness and toughen her mental approach to better compete with Evert and fulfil her true potential. In 1981, Navratilova won her third major singles title by defeating Evert in the final of the Australian Open. Navratilova also defeated Evert to reach the final of the US Open, where she lost a third set tiebreak to Tracy Austin. Navratilova won both Wimbledon and the French Open in 1982.|$|E
