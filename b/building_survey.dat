2500|$|The <b>building</b> <b>survey</b> is {{the most}} {{detailed}} survey available from most firms of Chartered Surveyors. [...] Thorough though it is, it may still lead to recommendations for further investigation from other specialists; see below. [...] The <b>building</b> <b>survey</b> report is much longer than the condition report but may not be much longer than the homebuyer report as its content depends on the condition observed in each individual case. [...] The practice note version <b>building</b> <b>survey</b> looks in more detail at the property {{to report on the}} visual condition and maintenance needs of nine external elements of construction, with scope for sub-division into individual features, with the nine internal elements of construction and the seven services supplied to the building examined in a similar manner. [...] Also the three key components of the grounds in which the property is sited can be subdivided as necessary.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} to a residential <b>building</b> <b>survey</b> which offers the home purchaser a choice of products. The two main variants are the RICS Guidance note version stemming from the earlier RICS guidance note 2004 (more recently updated by the [...] "Surveys of residential property RICS guidance note 3rd edition" [...] which was introduced in December 2013). The primary difference between guidance note and the practice note for the consumer is the format of the reports. A bespoke style or a framework (traffic light signal) style. For surveyors guidance is [...] "best practice" [...] and practice note is [...] "mandatory".|$|E
2500|$|James Wright {{undertook}} a standing <b>building</b> <b>survey</b> of Brammer Farm House and Arundel Cottage during February 2013. The {{purpose of this}} survey was to ascertain whether any in situ medieval masonry survived within the two properties. The results [...] suggest that the boundary wall of the King's Houses survives as a spine wall within both properties up to first floor level. There is also evidence for bonded return walls to both north and south {{as well as a}} splayed window. There are five phases of development to the cottages with the earliest post-medieval builds being north of the boundary wall into the village street.|$|E

2500|$|A {{mortgage}} valuation will {{be required}} by any mortgage lender {{as a condition of}} obtaining a mortgage loan. [...] The homebuyer may take the option to instruct the same surveyor to carry out a [...] "RICS HomeBuyer Report" [...] or a [...] "RICS Building Survey" [...] (sometimes called a [...] "Structural Survey"), usually at additional cost. [...] When the surveyor is instructed in this combined role, the mortgage valuation is still produced for the lender, and the HomeBuyer Report or <b>Building</b> <b>Survey</b> is additionally prepared for the borrower. [...] This arrangement can avoid the potential conflict of interest where the surveyor has as client both the lender and the borrower in the transaction. [...] Because of the ethics and professional liability division, borrowers should note that the lender's survey is produced solely for the lender and the surveyor will not extend any liability for loss or omission to the borrower. [...] Since reform of the RICS Red Book of valuation practice in recent years, the definition of a mortgage valuation has been deleted. [...] It is now a market valuation which is the same definition given to the valuation in the RICS HomeBuyer Report. [...] Before it was removed from the RICS Red Book the valuation for mortgage lending had different criteria from the market valuation.|$|E
