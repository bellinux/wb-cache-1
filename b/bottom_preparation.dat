40|$|At {{the end of}} {{structure}} assembling sides of yacht hulls are usually affected by bump and hollows coming from welding plates each other and plates to frames. This defect, normally tolerated on merchant ships, cannot be accepted on yachts for which the external surface must be smooth and glossy. In case of GRP vessels surface finishing comes from the external layer of gelcoat; in case of steel and aluminium vessels the surface finishing is achieved by a long and delicate process of filling, fairing and painting. The final result {{of this process is}} very important for the yacht aesthetics as the general appearance of the vessel just depends on the external painting. For the most part of people painting is simply perceived as the color of a product; {{as a matter of fact}} the quality of painting depends mainly by the <b>bottom</b> <b>preparation</b> to assure an adequate grip and, most of all, a perfect smooth and faired surface. Despite accurate preparation and painting surface conditions can undergo undesired alteration because of excessive heating due, as an example, to a long exposition to solar radiation. This can cause very slight surface distortions and undulations which however, by human eyes, is perceived as a surface defect. The phenomenon is amplified if the surface is painted with a dark color, and this is the trend of today superyachts for which blue, dark green or black hulls are becoming always more frequent. In this paper an investigating of the influence of temperature on the mechanical behavior of steel plates coated by filler layers of different kind and thickness is reported. The study has been performed by FEM structural analyses calibrated by experimental measurements performed on specimens. This work represents the continuation of a research begun one years ago with the measurement of temperatures on yacht hulls exposed to sun radiation in different conditions...|$|E

Colloidal palladium is prepared via an electrolytic process that affords for a core-shell particle structure, while nanostructured tin oxide films are prepared following a sol-gel process. Pd/SnOx composite layers are obtained adding a proper aliquot of pre-formed PdNPs to the tin oxide precursor solution. The nanomaterials surface chemical composition is addressed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.

40|$|June 8 - 11, 2014 International audienceTwo {{low-cost}} methods, sputtering deposition and sol–gel processes, {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} <b>bottom</b> electrodes <b>preparation</b> on the microstructure evolution and texture development of oriented PZT films. Microstructure development and perovskite content are strongly dependent on the temperature deposition of the Pt bottom electrode on SOI substrate and on the post-deposition annealing heating rate. Fast heating rate forms a dense fine-grained microstructure with polycristalline orientation. Very slow heating rate leads to (001) orientations. The texture selection of PZT films is independent of deposition process but sensitive to the Pt bottom electrode temperature deposition. Correlation and comparison of oriented sol–gel and sputtered PZT films with electrical properties are also made...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} cell for making corrosion measurements {{has been designed}} to prevent or reduce crevice corrosion, which is a common source of error in prior such cells. The present cell (see figure) includes an electrolyte reservoir with O-ring-edged opening at the <b>bottom.</b> In <b>preparation</b> for a test, the reservoir, while empty, is pressed down against a horizontal specimen surface to form an O-ring seal. A purge of air or other suitable gas is begun in the reservoir, and the pressure in the reservoir is regulated to maintain a partial vacuum. While maintaining the purge and partial vacuum, and without opening the interior of the reservoir to the atmosphere, the electrolyte is pumped into the reservoir. The reservoir is then slowly lifted a short distance off the specimen. The level of the partial vacuum is chosen such that the differential pressure is just sufficient to keep the electrolyte from flowing out of the reservoir through the small O-ring/specimen gap. Electrochemical measurements are then made. Because there is no gasket (and, hence, no crevice between the specimen and the gasket), crevice corrosion is unlikely to occur...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{fine-grained}} soft clay {{are used as}} the base material. The earth is first mixed with water, then strained. During the process, wood chips are often added, causing the less dense parts to rise while the heavier parts sink to the <b>bottom.</b> This <b>preparation</b> process is repeated for two weeks until the water is entirely filtered without any residues, and the pure, fine clay is obtained {{from the bottom of}} the vat. The reddish to orange color of the clay is important as it will determine the texture and color of the Hagi surface. [...] The beauty of Hagi ware is appreciated not only for its earthy colors but also for the glaze. The translucent beige glaze is to draw out the natural, deep colors of the clay. After being heated in the kiln, the glaze creates its signature fine web of cracks and fine pores -known as an-nyuu (貫入) or crazing- while cooling. Throughout the heating and cooling process, the cracks form because the glaze shrinks faster than the clay. Over time, a Hagi ware user might notice the color of the glaze getting darker. This is natural as the slightly porous surface absorbs the tea residues or sake through its tiny crackles, maturing over time.|$|R

40|$|Five {{isolates}} of the beetle-transmitted cowpea mosaic virus were studied. The symptoms {{produced by}} each {{on a number}} of hosts were described. The occurrence of amorphous inclusion bodies in the epidermal cells of infected cowpea and pea plants was reported. A purification procedure was described. Three peaks were invariably associated with the purified virus in the analytical ultracentrifuge, the sedimentation coefficients of these components being 58, 100 and 119 S after separation. The components could be purified by density-gradient centrifugation. The top component was not infective; the middle component was far more infective than the <b>bottom</b> component. Purified <b>preparations</b> showed, by electron-microscopy, polyhedral particles of about 25 mμdiameter. Negative staining of the preparations with phosphotungstate revealed empty particles, and of particles apparently containing nucleic acid. An icosahedral model with 60 subunits and 5 : 3 : 2 axial symmetry was most compatible with the structure of the particles seen on the electron-micrographs. On the basis of homologous and heterologous serological reactions the five isolates could be divided into two groups. They proved also to be serologically related to bean pod mottle virus and to an isolate of red clover mottle virus...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{communication}} and dissemination of information have changed dramatically {{with the emergence of}} the Internet and mobile phones. To sustain this revolution, we need reliable mass storage devices which would store information not only in large amount in small space but also for long time. Therefore, realizing high performance memory technologies is very critical for this revolution. This work contributes towards the development of one such technology; Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ). The research conducted in this study is primarily focused on the process development for integrating MTJ on silicon. The film stack explored in this work is CoFeB/MgO-based. The relevant issues in this integration such as smooth <b>bottom</b> electrode <b>preparation,</b> low thermal budget, process chemistry and parameters, and MTJ patterning involving ion-milling have been addressed in this work. Ta and NiCr are evaluated as candidates for bottom electrode. Spin-on Glass (SOG) -based low temperature Inter Level Dielectric (ILD) process is developed. MTJ devices with varying sizes with four terminal contacts for on wafer testing have been designed and fabricated using the process developed. The devices exhibited Resistance-Area (RA) product in the range of 1 - 5 k_Um 2. Recent literature on MgO-based MTJ devices has reported values in a range of 0. 1 – 1000 k_um 2. This data confirms the electrical integrity of the MTJ fabricated. The RA values have been observed to be unchanged on application of magnetic field (+- 300 Oe). Detailed investigations have been carried out to find possible causes for the absence of magnetic response from these junctions. These include XRD analysis of the MTJ stack for CoFeB crystallization and STEM-PEELS studies to investigate the chemical composition. “Neel coupling” or “Orange peel coupling” due to interface roughness is thought {{to be one of the}} main possible causes for magnetically inactive junctions. Suggestions for future are given on the basis of the results from the process and the experiments. In summary, a process has been developed for fabricating MTJ on silicon yielding desired values for junction resistivity. The magnetic response is extremely sensitive to film roughness at nanoscales and will require control of roughness at each step starting with wafer specification. It is concluded that with a control of surface roughness and recommended modifications in MTJ films, a CMOS compatible process for fabricating MTJ is plausible at RIT.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDiarrhoea and {{respiratory}} infections {{are the two}} biggest causes of child death globally. Handwashing with soap could substantially reduce diarrhoea {{and respiratory}} infections, but prevalence of adequate handwashing is low. We tested whether a scalable village-level intervention based on emotional drivers of behaviour, rather than knowledge, could improve handwashing behaviour in rural India. MethodsThe study was done in Chittoor district in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, between May 24, 2011, and Sept 10, 2012. Eligible villages had a population of 700 – 2000 people, a state-run primary school for children aged 8 – 13 years, and a preschool for children younger than 5 years. 14 villages (clusters) were selected, stratified by population size (1200), and randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to intervention or control (no intervention). Clusters were enrolled by the study manager. Random allocation {{was done by the}} study statistician using a random number generator. The intervention included community and school-based events incorporating an animated film, skits, and public pledging ceremonies. Outcomes were measured by direct observation in 20 – 25 households per village at baseline and at three follow-up visits (6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention). Observers had no connection with the intervention and observers and participant households were told that the study was about domestic water use {{to reduce the risk of}} bias. No other masking was possible. The primary outcome was the proportion of handwashing with soap at key events (after defecation, after cleaning a child's <b>bottom,</b> before food <b>preparation,</b> and before eating) at all follow-up visits. The control villages received a shortened version of the intervention before the final follow-up round. Outcome data are presented as village-level means. FindingsHandwashing with soap at key events was rare at baseline in both the intervention and control groups (1 % [SD 1] vs 2 % [1]). At 6 weeks' follow-up, handwashing with soap at key events was more common in the intervention group than in the control group (19 % [SD 21] vs 4 % [2]; difference 15 %, p= 0 · 005). At the 6 -month follow-up visit, the proportion handwashing with soap was 37 % (SD 7) in the intervention group versus 6 % (3) in the control group (difference 31 %; p= 0 · 02). At the 12 -month follow-up visit, after the control villages had received the shortened intervention, the proportion handwashing with soap was 29 % (SD 9) in the intervention group and 29 % (13) in the control group.

40|$|Outbreak {{of early}} {{mortality}} syndrome (EMS) or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and black tiger shrimp (P. monodon) was first documented in August 2011 in Eastern Thailand. The disease subsequently spread to almost all shrimp production areas in 2012 {{until the early}} part of 2016. These episodes of AHPND outbreaks consequently impacted the shrimp industry as evidenced by significant reduction in the production of farmed shrimps, shortage of raw materials for the shrimp export industry, and reduction of global shrimp supply from Thailand. Following the discovery of Vibrio parahaemolyticus as the causal agent of AHPND, PCR techniques subsequently became available for the rapid and accurate detection of AHPND in cultivated shrimps. The Department of Fisheries (DOF) consequently included AHPND in the National Surveillance Program focusing on the investigation of risk factors responsible for the outbreak and concomitant spread of the disease. As a result, the quality of broodstock and postlarvae (PL) and as well as farm management practices, i. e. pond <b>bottom</b> and water <b>preparation,</b> stocking density, feeds and feeding practices, and water quality fluctuations were identified as key risk factors associated with AHPND outbreaks. By and large, the DOF has undertaken mitigating measures to control and prevent further outbreaks of AHPND including the improvement of sanitation in marine shrimp broodstock and PL hatcheries, quality evaluation and disease screening of broodstocks and PL, detection of pathogens in soil and water samples, and acquisition of new broodstocks for improved genetic diversity. To date, Thailand s shrimp industry has gradually recovered from the devastating effects of AHPND since 2015. Heptopancreatic microsporidiosis (HPM) caused by Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), a sporeforming microsporidian, is another emerging disease of cultured penaeids in Thailand. EHP was first documented in farmed P. monodon in 2004, however, its impact was not clearly evaluated at that time. EHP was again observed in P. vannamei in 2014 at the same period of AHPND outbreak in Thailand. In the field, EHP could be transmitted horizontally through feeding of the EHPcontaminated feed and feces from infected shrimp. Samples collected from numerous shrimp farms showed that EHP was heavily present in both ponds with successful and failed crops indicating that EHP infection in shrimp may not be a significant contributing factor to a failed production run. In vitro challenge likewise showed that there was no correlation between EHP and white feces syndrome. However, EHP infection at significantly high levels could affect shrimp growth. One of the mitigating measures to control EHP infection in cultured shrimp is the reduction of contamination in hatcheries and grow-out facilities. Despite the negative impacts of AHPND and HPM on the shrimp industry of Thailand, all parties of the shrimp sector have been working in concert to attain the projected annual shrimp production volume of approximately 300, 000 metric tons (MT) in 2016...|$|R
