5|$|In March 2000, he {{left for}} Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, {{they went on to}} Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri {{followed}} the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot ("muscle") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, at {{the urging}} of many of his friends, {{including}} Darwin, Philip Sclater, and Alfred Newton, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds—which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution—to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently connecting North America and South America) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, The Geographical Distribution of Animals, was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next 80 years.|$|E

25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved.

Once the person got better it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness.

25|$|Wei Yan's {{reasoning}} for his Ziwu Valley Plan {{was recorded}} in the historical text Weilüe, which was then added as annotations to his biography in the Sanguozhi. It stated: Wei Yan received intelligence that the defender of the strategic city Chang'an, Xiahou Mao, was cowardly and incompetent. Thus, he reasoned, it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> him to take 5,000 troops (and another 5,000 to carry supplies) across the Qin Mountains via the Ziwu Valley (子午谷) and into Chang'an. Wei Yan estimated that he would reach Chang'an in ten days and scare Xiahou Mao into flight, leaving the grain in Chang'an's storehouses for Shu's taking. There, Wei Yan's force can wait for Zhuge Liang's main army to take the safer road out of Xie Valley (斜谷) and rendezvous in Chang'an. In this way, the region west of Xianyang could be conquered in one movement.|$|E

The unadorned bust of the King that resulted is in low relief, as de Saulles sought a coin that would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the Royal Mint to strike.

[...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating.

500|$|Michelson and Morley (1887) {{and other}} early experimentalists using {{interferometric}} techniques {{in an attempt}} to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> an observer to [...] "get lost" [...] when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the [...] "2pi ambiguity".|$|E

500|$|The team {{hoped that}} despite the short {{duration}} of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly. They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the [...] "discovery" [...] of the outbreak, its inevitability, and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from {{the primary goal of}} the story. The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies. The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling. Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in slow motion, as they believed that it could make the action feel [...] "balletic" [...] instead of purely violent.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> experienced gamers, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E
