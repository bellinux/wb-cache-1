40|$|M. Tech. : Electrical Engineering. Ordinary {{dial-up access}} to the Internet over a public {{switched}} telephone network forces the telephone network to carry traffic volumes for which it was not dimensioned and can cause serious problems of congestion and {{access to the}}se networks. Significant advantages in the implementation of MultiGain Wireless (MGW) Local Loop (LL) systems in South Africa make data communication possible over large geographical areas where no such services existedpreviously. The main objective of the dissertation was to determine effective traffic estimation values for the voice band data requirements of dial-up data traffic with reference to available standard voice traffic estimation (Erlang) tables for rural and suburban areas in South Africa. Three MGW fixed wireless access prototype networks (case studies) were designed and implemented in the Upington, Bloemfontein and Magaliesburg districts, respectively. Analysis of three networks revealed that the traffic loading per sector significantly depends on service requirements (voice for residential and business and data for residential and <b>business</b> <b>subscribers</b> and public payphones), population subscriber numbers and terrain characteristics. A series of mathematical-analytical equations were derived utilising these parameters and that could enable a better economic and efficiency of subsequently rollout networks. Specific empirical constants and terrain values were derived, based on statistical data as acquired from the case studies. Recommended traffic estimation values for each subscriber type were found to be as follows: 40 mE for residential 32 kbps subscribers, 80 mE for <b>business</b> 32 kbps <b>subscribers,</b> 80 mE for dial-up data 64 kbps residential subscribers, 120 mE for dial-up data 64 kbps <b>business</b> <b>subscribers</b> and 180 mE for payphones. Subsequent business case studies, revealed cost savings of up to 25 percent (on average 11. 5 percent) capital and operational savings that can be achieved for follow-up networks if these recommendations are implemented. The impact of these results on the social and economic development in South Africa could be significant. Specific advantages as identified wrt the implementation of MGWLL in South Africa are as follows: (i) the flexibility of the deployed wireless system; (ii) the highly modular nature of the technology; (iii) immunity to theft compared to ordinary copper network infrastructure; (iv) reliability; and (v) provision of data communications not susceptible to line losses due to weather and other parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{panorama}} of the “Last mile” is rapidly evolving (or has recently evolved) {{in many countries}} {{under the pressure of}} demand for broadband Internet and new services requested both by the residential and the <b>business</b> <b>subscribers.</b> In the convergence towards ubiquitous IP and Ethernet in access and metro networks, legacy fixed-infrastructure access-network technology is transforming from xDSL to fibered access (in particular, passive optical networks), also thanks to new low-impact deployment techniques. On the other hand, alternative technological solutions, competing with fibre, offer less bandwidth but in change require lower investments (e. g. HFC, PLC) and/or ensure user mobility (e. g. WiMax, LTE, LEO/MEO satellites). This short tutorial paper provides a quick bird-eye overview of the evolution of the access network, from present to future technical solutions and technologies for implementing the “Last mile”.

40|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) {{is becoming}} the technology of choice for meeting the increasing bandwidth demands in optical networks. DWDM {{has been used to}} increase the capacity of long-haul optical transport systems. Efforts are being made to move DWDM into the broadband access network serving residential and <b>business</b> <b>subscribers.</b> First, a new centralized DWDM PON scheme is demonstrated for bi-directional upstream and downstream transmissions. The proposed DWDM PON scheme is implemented using optical carrier suppression and separation (OCSS) technology to generate a wavelength pair from a single laser source at the central office. This method enables the co-location of both upstream and downstream DWDM transmitters in the central office. In addition, the complexity, cost, and maintenance of the optical network unit are reduced by enabling wavelength independent operation. Second, a new multistage architecture is proposed for the delivery of information to groups of subscribers located at different distances from the central office. A 25 GHz DWDM comb is generated using OCSS technology, and error-free transmission of four 10 Gbps channels is demonstrated. Finally, a new wide area access network with bi-directional DWDM amplification using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is demonstrated. The detrimental effect of SOA crosstalk resulting from cross gain modulation can be suppressed using a constant intensity modulation format such as differential phase shift keying (DPSK). The feasibiity of bi-directional DPSK transmission of 16 interleaved DWDM channels using an in-line SOA has been studied experimentally. In addition, the reduction of bi-directional SOA reflections has been realized by optimizing the SOA bias current and facet reflectivities. Ph. D.
