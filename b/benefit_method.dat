40|$|Natural {{gas plants}} can have {{multiple}} owners for raw natural gas streams and processing facilities {{as well as}} for multiple products. Therefore, a proper cost allocation method is necessary for taxation of the profits from natural gas and crude oil {{as well as for}} cost sharing among gas producers. However, cost allocation methods most often used in accounting, such as the sales value method and the physical units method, may produce unacceptable or even illogical results when applied to natural gas processes. Wright and Hall (1998) proposed a new approach called the design <b>benefit</b> <b>method</b> (DBM), based upon engineering principles, and Wright et al. (2001) illustrated the potential of the DBM for reliable cost allocation for natural gas processes by applying it to a natural gas process. In the present research, a rigorous modeling technique for the DBM has been developed based upon a Taylor series approximation. Also, we have investigated a cost allocation framework that determines the virtual flows, models the equipment, and evaluates cost allocation for applying the design <b>benefit</b> <b>method</b> to other scenarios, particularly those found in the petroleum and gas industries. By implementing these individual procedures on a computer, the proposed framework easily can be developed as a software package, and its application can be extended to large-scale processes. To implement the proposed cost allocation framework, we have investigated an optimization methodology specifically geared toward economic optimization problems encountered in natural gas plants. Optimization framework can provide co-producers who share raw natural gas streams and processing plants not only with optimal operating conditions but also with valuable information that can help evaluate their contracts. This information can be a reasonable source for deciding new contracts for co-producers. For the optimization framework, we have developed a genetic-quadratic search algorithm (GQSA) consisting of a general genetic algorithm and a quadratic search that is a suitable technique for solving optimization problems including process flowsheet optimization. The GQSA inherits the advantages of both genetic algorithms and quadratic search techniques, and it can find the global optimum with high probability for discontinuous as well as non-convex optimization problems much faster than general genetic algorithms...|$|E

Several methods {{have been used to}} detect genitourinary Mycoplasmas, each having their own limitations, advantages and disadvantages. In the present study, researchers used microbial culture and PCR to detect Mycoplasmas in urogenital specimens with the aim of comparing detection rate, sensitivity and specificity of the two methods. It was a descriptive cross sectional pilot study. About 30 urogenital samples including 17 vaginal swabs, 7 male urine and 6 female urine samples were collected from patients referring to hospitals regardless of their disease and studied for Mycoplasmas by culture (using two media: PPLO agar and PPLO broth) and PCR. Of total 30 specimens, Mycoplasmas were detected in 14, 11 and 11 of them using PPLO broth culture medium, PPLO agar culture medium and PCR, respectively.

40|$|Energy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors in strategic planning throughout the world and can be considered as a dominant driving force for the industry and world economy. Biofuels development and applications specially in the form of Combined Heat and Power using Internal Combustion Engine (ICECHP) is wide-spreading which is the subject matter of the present paper as its economical investigation is concerned. The followed methodology is based on electricity direct pricing and actual annual benefit methods considering producers and consumers viewpoints. This investigation revealed that in the case of electricity direct pricing method, for the consumers the use of bioethanol - gasoline blends (Gasohol) and ICE for CHP is uneconomical in all cases, and for the producers, E 5 and E 10 is economical. For the consumers, the case can be economical too with the grant of subsidy similar to the oil products. It can be concluded from the finding of the optimization process in the case of actual annual <b>benefit</b> <b>method</b> that market electricity price must be equal to its cost price and the subsidy must be devoted to the fuel instead of devoting it to the electricity. In this case, E 5 is economical for the consumers and up to E 15 is economical as for as producer is concerned...|$|E
40|$|Most {{multi-purpose}} {{water resources}} have been planned and constructed by governments in Taiwan {{to meet the}} water demands of different users. However, economic and solvency differences among parties using water create conflicts regarding the reasonable and equitable allocation of investment and operational costs. The Chi-Chi Weir in Nantou County, which was completed in 2002, meets the high water demand of residents {{and the needs of}} industrial growth in central Taiwan. Thus, multi-purpose water reservoirs are designed to serve agriculture, the public and industry. Three analytical methods, the quantity-based method, marginal cost method, and separable cost remaining <b>benefit</b> <b>method</b> (SCRB), are employed to compare the cost allocation for different parties using water. The quantity-based method indicates that proportional costs allocated to agriculture, the public, industry and new irrigated areas are 88. 02, 3. 63, 7. 86, and 0. 49 %, respectively. Via the marginal cost method, the proportional costs allocated to agriculture, the public, hydropower, industry and new irrigated areas are 68. 44, 2. 51, 28. 71, and 0. 34 %, respectively. The marginal cost price of water is NT$ 2. 97 ton(- 1); industrial use has the highest price.

40|$|Purpose. To {{systematically}} {{review the}} quality of the psychometric properties of instruments for assessing functional limitations in workers applying for disability <b>benefit.</b> <b>Method.</b> Electronic searches of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO were performed to identify studies focusing on the psychometric properties of instruments used to assess functional limitations in workers' compensation claimants. Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to select relevant articles and then evaluated the psychometric qualities of the instruments found. Results. Of the 712 articles that were identified, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on four instruments: the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), the Isernhagen Work System (IWS) and the Multiperspective Multidimensional Pain Assessment Protocol (MMPAP). The questionnaires (RMDQ and PSFS) did not focus specifically on the work situation and measured three to eight functional limitations. The psychometric qualities of the IWS were poor to moderate. For the MMPAP, only predictive validity was measured. The instruments assessed a range varying between 3 and 34 physical functional limitations. No instruments were found for assessing mental limitations in workers' compensation claimants. Conclusion. Studies on four instruments specifically focusing on assessing physical functional limitations in workers applying for disability benefit were found. All four instruments have limitations regarding their psychometric qualities or contents. Since the RMDQ has the best demonstrated psychometric qualities and takes little time to complete it, we recommend the RMDQ for clinicians in rehabilitation. For the assessment of functional limitations in workers applying for disability benefit a combination of questionnaires, performance tests or interviews together with the judgment by physicians looks the most promising...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lifestyle {{interventions}} reduce cardiovascular {{risk and}} diabetes but reports on long term effects on {{quality of life}} (QOL) and health care utilization are rare. The aim {{was to investigate the}} impact of a primary health care based lifestyle intervention program on QOL and cost-effectiveness over 3 years. Methods: 151 men and women, age 18 - 65 yr, at moderate-to-high risk for cardiovascular disease, were randomly assigned to either lifestyle intervention with standard care or standard care alone. Intervention consisted of supervised exercise sessions and diet counseling for 3 months, followed by regular group meetings during 3 years. Change in QOL was measured with EuroQol (EQ- 5 D, EQ VAS), the 36 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36), and the SF- 6 D.  The health economic evaluation was performed from a societal view and a treatment perspective. In a cost-utility analysis the costs, gained quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and savings in health care were considered. Cost-effectiveness was also described using the Net Monetary <b>Benefit</b> <b>Method.</b> Results: Significant differences between groups over the 3 -yr period were shown in EQ VAS, SF- 6 D and SF- 36 physical component summary but not in EQ- 5 D or SF- 36 mental component summary. There was a net saving of 47 USD per participant. Costs per gained QALY, savings not counted, were 1, 668 – 4, 813 USD. Probabilities of cost-effectiveness were 89 – 100 %, when 50 000 USD was used as stakeholder’s threshold of willingness to pay for a gained QALY.
