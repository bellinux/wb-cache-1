500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she</b> remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Sia Michel {{called the}} album [...] "lushly atmospheric" [...] but also ambivalent. She {{said that while}} the album paints a [...] "vivid {{emotional}} landscape", it is at odds with McLachlan's statement that the album was about [...] "'facing ugly things' about herself"; not revealing anything particularly dark. Michel also noted certain old-fashioned ideas in the album, particularly in [...] "Sweet Surrender", that contrast with the work of contemporaries such as Ani DiFranco and PJ Harvey. She cited [...] "Witness" [...] as the highlight and said of the album, [...] "erhaps she hasn't found what <b>she's</b> looking for, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she's</b> trying." [...] Elysa Gardner of Los Angeles Times said it [...] "Showcases her considerable strengths—a shimmering soprano voice and a knack for intelligent, emotionally forthright lyrics but also suffers from a lack of compelling craftsmanship and textural daring." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Guardians Caroline Sullivan {{considered}} Joanne to be a [...] "brave move" [...] for Gaga {{and admired}} it. In her three-out-of-five-star {{review in the}} newspaper, Sullivan explained that [...] "Gaga's huge voice adds a self-protective veneer, as does {{the presence of the}} other musicians, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she's</b> done the groundwork for future albums that might show her with true transparency." [...] Digital Spy's Lewis Corner wrote, [...] "Joanne is clearly Gaga's most personal album, popping aside the synthetic personas for something more honest and, well, human. Mother Monster may be retired for now, but Lady Gaga's sheer musical brilliance still shines through." [...] For Evan Sawdey of PopMatters, the album—with its [...] "flaws and all"—was a correct musical step for Gaga, which he believed would make [...] "fans and observers once again rethink what they know about the daring diva". Similarly, Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork remarked how Gaga explores an alternative path diverging away from [...] "visual provocations" [...] that permeated most of her career, and that the album feels [...] "tentative, an affront to the Gaga of yesteryear." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 15 June, Kissing Cousin {{was moved}} {{back up to}} Group One class for the 145th running of the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. With Kinane in the saddle, she started at odds of 13/2 (having been backed down from 20/1 {{on the morning of}} the race) in a nine-runner field, with the 1000 Guineas winner Las Meninas being made the 9/4 favourite. The other contenders {{included}} Relatively Special, Mehthaaf (Irish 1000 Guineas), Lemon Souffle, Prophecy and the unbeaten Zafaaf. Kinane sent the filly into the lead from the start and she maintained her advantage into the straight ahead of Lemon Souffle and the French-trained outsider Eternal Reve. In the final furlong Kissing Cousin was strongly challenged by Eternal Reve but ran on [...] "gamely" [...] to win by a short head, with Mehthaaf two and a half lengths back in third ahead of Lemon Souffle. After the race Henry Cecil commented [...] "She's very genuine but she just has her days. I told Sheikh Mohammed that she would either win or finish last.

500|$|American Life {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, holding {{a score of}} 60/100on music review website Metacritic, based on 17 professional reviews. Billboards Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as Ray of Light positively, saying [...] "American Life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman-in-the-mirror confrontation." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker generally responded well, saying that at its best, the album offers blunt, questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna sounding like a girl who's grown content {{with her husband and}} kids and the ability to hire help to do her bidding. Dimitri Ebrlich of Vibe magazine gave a positive review for American Life, saying that Madonna [...] "stayed still" [...] in the album, and commenting that [...] "This may be the first time Madonna hasn't pushed herself to explore new ground, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>she's</b> chosen a good place to rest." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a mixed review, stating that American Life is not a [...] "masterpiece" [...] compared to her 1992 studio album, Erotica. [...] "It's frequently self-indulgent, misguided, unpleasant, difficult to listen to, silly and humorless, but it's also consistent, uncompromising and unapologetic," [...] Cinquemani opined, ending with the deduction that American Life stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit.|$|R
5000|$|Simpson of The Guardian {{reviewed}} the opening {{show of the}} tour negatively, grading it with two out of five stars. He was negative about Beyoncé's clothing during the show, saying: [...] "The delays may well be down to Beyoncé's wardrobe, which could trouble Imelda Marcos. There are skimpy skirts, tails (for a note perfect if pointless version of Peggy Lee's 'Fever') and a general theme of low material, high glitz. But often, the main sparkle is on Beyoncé's outfit." [...] He also added that [...] "The dancers' 'naked suits' make the former church girl a raunchy rival to Kylie Minogue. But there's an interminable section where they pretend to be homies, and when Beyoncé disappears for long periods it feels like an expensive night with Legs and Co." [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "Clearly, the armies of industry professionals that put Beyoncé together aren't sure of her core audience. A vague Saturday night TV, family entertainment feel gradually gives way to a more intriguing cross between Liza Minnelli showbiz and thumping R&B. However, a ticker tape festooned 'Crazy in Love' and a belting 'Work It Out' suggest Beyoncé is best sticking to her roots.

More broadly, the themes of women's rights and marriage practices (including arranged marriage) are explored.

Initially, she's seen as a tough-as-nails freedom fighter, hostile to Blake, and ready to commit suicide after the deaths of her fellow companions. Already at this story, we're given some clue as to how Cally interacts with her future friends - she looks up to Blake as the leader, Vila's clearly taken with her, but Cally is more interested in Avon, who, amazingly, seems to return the interest, given his distrust of other people. It's a shame that Cally's part would be watered down in future stories - especially in Season Two, where she's mostly stuck glum-faced behind the teleport controls - <b>but</b> here <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> gets a strong debut." ...|$|R

Fillmore Street, certainly, did not contain any such. The office was not so bad.

She no longer completely possessed her love, since his share in it was doubtful; and now, to make things yet more bitter, her clear vision of the way to face life was rendered tremulous and uncertain, because another was witness of it. Feeling her desire for the old unshared intimacy too great to be borne without tears, she rose, walked to the farther end of the room, held the curtains apart, and stood there mastered for a moment.

David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated similar pros, commenting: [...] "If there's {{such a thing as}} a professional lo-fi album, Sheryl Crow is it." [...] He also noted Crow's louder and more assured singing, concluding that she [...] "doesn't expose that much of herself [...] she's an emotional centrist. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> the very <b>least,</b> <b>she's</b> building a bridge to a lasting career".
