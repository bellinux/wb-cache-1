The concept vehicle is based on presently-existing or near-term technology, and incorporates several features to improve performance, including all-composite construction, lightweight pressure-stabilized tankage, and the use of a HIAD (hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator) - an inflatable heatshield - to return from orbit.

50|$|Other {{issues were}} that the LESS had to be as light as {{possible}} {{so as not to}} significantly reduce the cargo capacity of the LEM, and easy to pack into the LEM {{in such a way that}} it would not interfere with the other cargo.

This did not directly reduce the mass required, but it did reduce the <b>empty</b> <b>mass</b> of the LESS, which reduced the fuel required to lift it to orbit, which also reduced the thrust required from the engines and the total mass of the design.|$|R

There were four smaller film vaults in the Multiple Docking Adapter, which had to have four not one, because each spar could not carry enough weight for single larger film vault. The orbital workshop could handle a single larger safe, which is also more efficient for shielding. The large vault in the orbital workshop had an <b>empty</b> <b>mass</b> of 2398 lb (1088 kg, 171.3 stones). The four smaller vaults had combined mass of 1545 lb.

5000|$|A rocket {{system that}} {{implements}} tandem staging means that each individual stage runs in order {{one after the}} other. The rocket breaks free from the previous stage, then begins burning through the next stage in straight succession. On the other hand, a rocket that implements parallel staging has two or more different stages that are active at the same time. For example, the space shuttle rocket has two side boosters that burn simultaneously. Upon launch, the boosters ignite, {{and at the end}} of the stage, the two boosters are discarded while the main rocket tank is kept for another stage. [...] Most quantitative approaches to the design of the rocket system's performance are focused on tandem staging, but the approach can be easily modified to include parallel staging. To begin with, the different stages of the rocket should be clearly defined. Continuing with the previous example, the end of the first stage which is sometimes referred to as 'stage 0', can be defined as when the side boosters separate from the main rocket. From there, the final mass of stage one can be considered the sum of the <b>empty</b> <b>mass</b> of stage one, the mass of stage two (the main rocket and the remaining unburned fuel) and the mass of the payload.|$|R

An inflatable balloon was chronically inserted into the stomach of male rats trained to eat a single daily meal. The mitral cell responses to the usual food odour and to the control odour of isoamyl acetate were recorded in unanaesthetized fasted animals for 3 successive states of the stomach: empty, then inflated by introducing water into the <b>balloon,</b> and <b>empty</b> again. Stomach inflation produced a rapid, long last-ing and significant decrease of the bulb responsiveness to food odour without changing the responsive-ness to control odour.

This has been successfully demonstrated by the HyEnD student project from the University of Stuttgart: On November 8 th, 2016 at 10 : 30 a. m. the hybrid sounding rocket HEROS 3 was launched from the Esrange Space Center to an apogee altitude of 32, 300 m (106, 000 ft).
