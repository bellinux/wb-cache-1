25|$|Although {{the museum}} was afflicted with {{structural}} and logistical problems from its inception, it nonetheless managed to organise five outstanding exhibitions on Chinese history in six years. The first of these exhibitions, which featured royal objects from the Qing Dynasty, put on display many precious artefacts never seen before outside China. By 1995, the museum's problems got the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and on 30 April that year, it closed its doors.|$|E
25|$|During Laurel's {{tenure as}} President, hunger {{was the main}} worry. Prices of {{essential}} commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring consumers' goods under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all. On the other hand, guerrilla activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Quanzhou in 1346, Ibn Battuta began his journey back to Morocco. In Kozhikode, he once again considered throwing {{himself at the}} mercy of Muhammad bin Tughluq in Delhi, but thought <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and decided to carry on to Mecca. On his way to Basra he passed through the Strait of Hormuz, where he learned that Abu Sa'id, last ruler of the Ilkhanate Dynasty had died in Persia. Abu Sa'id's territories had subsequently collapsed due to a fierce civil war between the Persians and Mongols.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson {{did not go}} to Staunton: {{his term}} as {{governor}} had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in Bedford County, and Virginia had no governor for ten days. A number of legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature thought <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.|$|E
25|$|From 30 April 1830 to 17 June 1833 Clio {{was under}} Commander John James Onslow. Around 19 July 1830 she sailed for South America, and on 15 December {{she was in}} Rio de Janeiro. Next, on 2 January 1833, Clio participated in the {{re-establishment}} of British rule on the Falkland Islands. Onslow arrived at Luis Vernet's settlement at Port Louis to request that the Argentine authorities replace {{the flag of the}} United Provinces of the River Plate with the British one and leave the islands. Lieutenant-Colonel José María Pinedo, of the schooner Sarandi considered resisting, but as most of his crew were British, thought <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and sailed on 5 January.|$|E
25|$|Australia had {{substantially}} the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> Walters adding {{his name}} to the fairly select list {{of those who have}} made a hundred in their first Test...After Walters's innings I wrote that with one necessary qualification I thought he would be come to be rated as the best bat produced by Australia since Neil Harvey proclaimed himself with his famous hundred at Headingley in 48. The reservation concerned his ability against really fast bowling, as to which I had no evidence...Only Lawry and Simpson have made more runs and had record to compare if one is to make a quantitative judgement. Any all events my contention is at least arguable. Doug has made eleven hundreds for Australia , some of extreme brilliance, and if he ever played a dull innings I never saw it.|$|E

500|$|The method {{eliminated}} the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality. Reich {{argued that the}} psychoanalytic taboos reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient, and that he wanted his patients {{to see him as}} human. He would press his thumb or {{the palm of his hand}} hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity. He wrote that the purpose of the massage was to retrieve the repressed memory of the childhood situation that had caused the repression. If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the [...] "orgasm reflex." [...] According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it [...] "orgasmotherapy," [...] but thought <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|On {{the fifth}} stage, a bunch sprint {{occurred}} and Greipel got the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> by beating Peter Sagan and Mark Cavendish, respectively. In the sixth stage, Zdeněk Štybar of won after escaping on the concluding small ascent {{in the port}} city of Le Havre. A crash in the final kilometer forced Martin to abandon the Tour with a broken collarbone, the second yellow jersey wearer to surrender after Cancellara. A record was set after the stage, with Daniel Teklehaimanot becoming the first black African to lead the mountains classification. Although Froome now led the race, no rider wore the yellow jersey on stage seven as Martin had finished the stage and earned the right to wear it. Cavendish won the seventh from a bunch sprint in Fougères, Brittany. Froome was awarded the yellow jersey after the stage. Stage eight, finishing atop the Mûr-de-Bretagne, saw the first French victory of the Tour, with [...] rider Alexis Vuillermoz launching an attack inside the final kilometer to take the victory. The general classification favourites finished together except Vincenzo Nibali who lost ten seconds. Sagan moved into the green jersey.

Alberto Contador's [...] in fourth, twenty-eight seconds down, and Nibali's [...] following, a further seven seconds behind. The first rest day took place the following day in Pau.|$|E

But the effort failed and the Wattasid attacks were repulsed. After an {{inconclusive}} battle, they agreed to the 1527 Treaty of Tadla, whereby Morocco was partitioned roughly along the Oum Er-Rbia River between the Wattasids of Fez in the north and the Saadians of Marrakesh in the south. [...] This arrangement did not last long - the truce broke down in 1530 and again in 1536 and another major battle was fought near Tadla, this time the Saadians coming off the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] However, mediation by the Sufi brotherhoods and religious jurists of Fez restored the partition and turned attention back on the Portuguese enclaves.|$|E
