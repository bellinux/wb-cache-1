The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Earlier, Hyelaphus – comprising the <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> (H. kuhli), the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis [...] ) and the hog deer (H. porcinus) – was considered a subgenus of Axis. However Hyelaphus has now been elevated to generic status a 2004 phylogenetic study showed that Hyelaphus {{is closer to the}} genus Rusa than Axis. The study showed that Axis is paraphyletic, and distant from Hyelaphus in the phylogenetic tree. The chital forms a clade with Rucervus duvaucelii (barasinga) and R. schomburgki (Schomburgk's deer). The chital diverged from the Rucervus lineage in the early Pliocene (five million years ago). A 2002 study shows that Axis shansius, followed by A. lyra, is the earliest ancestor in the A. axis lineage. Axis is no longer considered a subgenus of Cervus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> reside on the Bawean {{island in}} Indonesia, {{close to the}} Java Sea.

The most recent analyses indicate that these two species, together with calamianensis, constitute a different genus distinct from Axis, and Hyelaphus (Meijaard and Groves 2004, Pitra et al. 2004).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> (Hyelaphus kuhlii), {{also known}} as Kuhl's hog deer or Bawean hog deer, is a highly {{threatened}} species of deer found only in the island of Bawean (Gresik Regency) in Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size and limited range, the <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> is evaluated as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It has few natural enemies except for {{birds of prey}} and large snakes such as pythons.|$|E
50|$|Nature {{conservation}} measures were being taken back when Bawean was under colonial {{administration of the}} Netherlands. In 1932, five forests with the total area of 4,556 hectares were declared natural reserves. In 1979, two national (Indonesian) nature reserves were created with areas of 3,832 and 725 ha, mostly to protect the forests and the habitat of the <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{river valley}} {{located on the}} eastern side of the zoo {{provides}} natural landscape of wetlands, swamp, and river environment that features crocodiles, gavial and hippopotamus.

5000|$|The {{most notable}} {{representative}} of the fauna of the island is the endemic local subspecies of deer known as <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer,</b> Kuhl's hog deer or Bawean hog deer (Axis kuhlii). It is considered {{as a symbol of}} Bawean and is protected by Indonesian law. With less than 250 individuals, of which more than 90% belong to a single population, it is considered [...] "critically endangered" [...] and is included into the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|The island {{territory}} {{is divided into}} two administrative districts, Sangkapura and Tambak. More than half the population (about 45,750) lives in the district of Sangkapura, centred on the town of that name located on the southern coast of the island. The island has rich nature with many endemic species, such as <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> which is only found on the island and is included to the IUCN Red List. There are several large underwater petroleum and gas fields around the island.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the end of}} 19th century, men of {{the island}} began to {{regularly}} travel {{to work in the}} British colonial possessions in the Malay Peninsula, especially in Singapore. The Dutch authorities do not interfere with the activities of foreign recruiters who visited the island, as Bawean, with about 30,000 people and 66 settlements was overpopulated. The island was then producing tobacco, Indigo, cotton fabrics and coal, and exported the <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> and local breed of horse. Large-scale planting of teak started in the 1930s and resulted in deforestation of most of the island.|$|E
50|$|Organizers {{withdrew the}} design in January 2016, {{after it was}} widely criticized for its {{outdated}} appearance (with some Indonesians joking that the bird depicted into the logo {{looked more like a}} chicken than a cenderawasih). An open call for a new design was held, resulting in 60 submissions. The final design was unveiled on 28 July 2016; titled Energy of Asia, the emblem is modelled upon the roof of Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. New mascots were also unveiled, representing the Eastern, Central, and Western regions of Indonesia respectively; Bhin Bhin—a cenderawasih, Atung—a <b>Bawean</b> <b>Deer,</b> and Ika—a Javan rhinoceros.|$|E
50|$|Males {{can be very}} {{aggressive}} towards other males that approach their small families, and will spray other males, and predators {{in the face with}} their glandular secretions, but also mark their territories with this as well. When fleeing the <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> carries its head low and runs with a trotting gait. Their spine also curves high towards the rear when fleeing from predators. When fleeing from predators the males will run in front and infant if there is one will be behind the males, and the female will run in the back. This is effective {{in order to protect the}} infant from predators.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{separate}} but similar island hog deer species: The <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> (H. kuhlii) of Bawean Island in Indonesia, and the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis) of the Calamian Islands in the Philippines that inhabit moist or dry {{tropical deciduous forest}} environments. Unlike the best known western populations of the hog deer (A. porcinus), their fawns are not spotted at birth. However, the eastern populations (perhaps equalling the subspecies A. p. annamiticus) of the hog deer also have unspotted fawn. The two island hog deer may be remnants of a widespread population of hog deer {{that at one time}} were connected to the hog deer populations of mainland Southeast Asia and inhabited vast areas of the Sunda Shelf during times of lower ocean levels.|$|E

The aims of this research were to identifi  types ofpotential food for <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> in Bawean Wildlife Sanctuary, the abundance ofpotential foods in Bawean Wildlife Sanctuary and the diversity of such potential foods. Data collected using line transects whose length was adjusted according to field condition. The line transects were located in parallel to natural trail of study area. Observation {{was done in the}} plots established along transect, where plant being eaten by <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> was found. Plot has a circular form with diameter of 3. 14 m. Distance between plots was determined to be 100 m. Indicators used to collect data were feces, footprint and bite or chew mark on food plants. Identification ofplant species was conducted directly for every plant which showed bite or chew mark Data concerning type ofplant and its number, part of plants which was bitten or chewed and plant height were recorded. Abundance will be determined from the number of potential foods in each location. The results were afterwards compared among three forest regions. The diversity of food plant species was determined using Shannon index. The result showed that there are 29 plants considered as potential food for <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer.</b> Most of the plants are grasses, and herbs, while woody plants are found in a small number. Leaves, shoots (buds) and fruits are part of plant often being eaten. There are 14 food plants occurred in Gunung Mas forest region, 27 food plants were found in Gunung Besar forest region and 13 food plants in Tanjung Cina Island. Taliata, rumput padang and gadung have high abundance in Gunung Mas forest region, the smallest abundance was occupied by kayu flat. Kabek-kabekan putih, lading-ladingan and taliata showed the highest abundance in Gunung Besar forest region, while karangsang has the lowest abundance. In Tanjung Cina Island, high abundance was dominated by gadung, taliowar and lading-ladingan. On the other hand, talicacing, kayu tekek and rombok putih showed low abundance.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} {{recognized}} need for conservation of tropical forest deer. In {{order to identify}} some environmental factors affecting conservation, we analyzed the seasonal habitat use of two Indonesian deer species, Axis kuhlii in Bawean Island and Muntiacus muntjak in south-western Java Island, in response to several physical, climatic, biological, and anthropogenic variables. Camera trapping was performed in different habitat types during both wet and dry season to record these elusive species. The highest number of photographs was recorded in secondary forest and {{during the dry season}} for both <b>Bawean</b> <b>deer</b> and red muntjac. In models, anthropogenic and climatic variables were the main predictors of habitat use. Distances to cultivated area and to settlement were the most important for A. kuhlii in the dry season. Distances to cultivated area and annual rainfall were significant for M. muntjak in both seasons. Then we modelled their predictive range using Maximum entropy modelling (Maxent). We concluded that forest landscape is the fundamental scale for deer management, and that secondary forests are potentially important landscape elements for deer conservation. Important areas for conservation were identified accounting of habitat transformation in both study areas...|$|E
