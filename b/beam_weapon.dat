5|$|In the film, James Bond {{is sent to}} Jamaica to {{investigate}} the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch with a radio <b>beam</b> <b>weapon.</b> Although {{the first of the}} Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character; the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film also introduced the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which would also appear in six subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows Samus's health, the supply mode for Reserve Tanks, icons that {{represent}} weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the <b>beam</b> <b>weapon</b> can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams {{cannot be used}} simultaneously. The backup units called Reserve Tanks can be used automatically when Samus's health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in each part of the planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered around the planet. The game can also be saved at Samus's gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. Super Metroid has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without her suit. The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours.|$|E
25|$|In the , Cobra Commander {{is portrayed}} in a darker {{incarnation}} {{than the one}} in Sigma 6, revealing the attributes of cowardice and hysterics to have been only a mask for weeding out traitors and such among his organization, as well as to motivate his followers to think for themselves. He executes a plan to achieve world dominion through the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program with a prototype particle <b>beam</b> <b>weapon</b> to hold the world hostage. He is portrayed as utterly ruthless, calmly destroying all of Moscow just to demonstrate the beam's power and killing anyone in his organisation who shows cowardice or threatens his command, such as Sebastian Bludd. Cobra Commander was voiced by Charlie Adler.|$|E

25|$|Season three premiered in the United States on July 14, 2006, {{picking up}} where season 2 ended. Having stopped the Wraith from {{reaching}} Earth and {{having failed to}} develop a working Wraith retrovirus, the expedition faces its third year in the Pegasus galaxy with the Wraith still a threat and a new, powerful enemy bent on destroying the expedition and Atlantis: the Asurans, self-replicating nanobots, also known as Replicators. The situation becomes complicated when an experiment gone awry drains their only ZPM, leaving them without a power source for the city's shields. Soon thereafter, they find a lost Ancient vessel and unwillingly turn over the city of Atlantis to its crew. The SGC sends General O'Neill and Richard Woolsey to try to negotiate an agreement between Earth and the Ancients to allow the expedition to return to Atlantis. The Ancients are then subsequently killed by an invading Asuran force while O'Neill and Woolsey send off a distress call to earth and go into hiding. The main members of the Atlantis expedition on Earth disobey their orders {{and go back to}} the city, rescue O'Neill and Woolsey, and repel the Asuran invasion. The season finale starts off with Earth launching a first strike against the Asurans, who are building an armada to attack Earth. The Asurans counterattack by attacking Atlantis with a powerful <b>beam</b> <b>weapon</b> fired through a satellite housing a Stargate. As a last resort, the Atlantis team fires up the city's stardrive and escapes into space. The finale ends when the hyperdrive malfunctions, leaving the city flying through uncharted space with a day's worth of energy left in their sole ZPM and Dr. Weir critically injured.|$|E
2500|$|In several episodes, the Stargate, and the cobbled-together dialing program {{used by the}} SGC, {{are nearly}} the cause of disaster. In the episode [...] "Red Sky", the {{bypassing}} of a system error caused the Stargate to introduce atoms of plutonium {{into the center of}} a star, causing the star to become unstable. In the episode [...] "Ripple Effect", an unknown device or method was used to connect different realities and was reversed by use of an Asgard <b>beam</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Laser cannons and ion cannons {{serve as}} short range weapons, {{damaging}} or disabling targets respectively. Some starfighters carry limited warheads for additional range/firepower. As with X-Wing, the player needs to balance power allocation between weapons, engines, and shields (when available); some craft also require the player to further balance power for a <b>beam</b> <b>weapon.</b> [...] The player can also change the firing modes {{of his or}} her fighter's weapons (for example, having a pair of laser cannons fire together or alternately). If the ship possesses shields, the player chooses the shield balance between front and rear.|$|E

Since Billy, Storm Shadow, and the Baroness were left {{under the influence}} of Cobra's Brain Wave Scanner {{at the end of the}} original series, Snake Eyes is on this mission to save Storm Shadow. At the end of this story, Storm Shadow returns to his ways as a ninja, and says he will deal with Snake Eyes when he is ready. Snake Eyes and Scarlett move back to his home in the High Sierras, where Timber has died but sired a litter of pups before passing, and Snake Eyes adopts one. After the G.I. Joe Team disbanded, Snake Eyes and Scarlett leave the military and become engaged, but for unknown reasons on the day of the wedding, Snake Eyes disappears and retreats again to his cabin in the High Sierras.|$|E

50|$|In theory, {{there is}} now no limit to how {{powerful}} a <b>beam</b> <b>weapon</b> can be; for instance, a massive super ship could have a <b>beam</b> <b>weapon</b> of class 10 (or higher), although such an application would be impractical due to the increases of mass and point cost.

5000|$|The {{counter to}} chaff is to include [...] "beamers" [...] (warships {{with lots of}} <b>beam</b> <b>weapons)</b> in your battle fleet. <b>Beam</b> <b>weapons</b> {{are not limited to}} one ship killed per shot, and so a {{powerful}} beamer {{can be used as a}} [...] "chaff shredder". However, without chaff of their own, beamers are quite vulnerable to and generally weaker than missile ships. This results in a rock-paper-scissors arrangement that is far more complex. Pre-chaff tactics largely consisted of large slow fleets of missile ships trying to engage each other, with victory going to the player with the biggest fleet. Modern fleets include missile ships, beamers, and chaff in order to win, with the outcome of battles being much harder to predict.|$|R
