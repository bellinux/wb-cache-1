25|$|Indirect {{costs are}} those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual {{coercion}} does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice {{and can lead to}} their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose <b>bitterling</b> (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not. Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.|$|E
25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and wels catfish (Siluris glanis). The endangered species include grayling (Thymallus thymallus), burbot (Lota lota) and <b>bitterling</b> (Rhodeus sericeus) and the non-native species are represented by the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris).|$|E

30|$|<b>Bitterlings</b> are a {{group of}} {{freshwater}} fishes that belong to the subfamily Acheilognathinae (family Cyprinidae), which have a unique spawning symbiosis with freshwater mussels. During the spawning season, males develop bright nuptial coloration and defend territories around mussels. Female <b>bitterlings</b> develop long ovipositors that they use to place their eggs onto the gills of a mussel through the mussels’ exhalant siphon. Males fertilize the eggs by releasing sperm into the inhalant siphon of the mussel, so that water filtered by the mussel carries the sperm to the eggs. <b>Bitterlings</b> display remarkable morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations for using mussels as spawning sites, and they represent a valuable model in behavioral, population, and evolutionary ecology (Smith et al. 2004).|$|R

30|$|The {{perception}} of visual signals {{is determined by}} two components: the physical characteristics of a habitat and the sensory properties of a receiver (Endler 1990); therefore, a change {{in one of these}} two components tends to drive the development of substitute signals in response to variable habitats (Chunco et al. 2007; Endler 1980), which has been demonstrated by several studies (Dalton et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2005; Gray et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2007). Based on the observation that the two aforementioned and closely related <b>bitterlings</b> exhibit distinct nuptial colorations, it is hypothesized that the differences in their nuptial colorations may be related to variations in photic properties of its habitats and/or spectral sensitivities of the fish. To test this hypothesis, the spectral sensitivities of these two <b>bitterlings</b> were recorded with electrophysiological method and the light spectra of their habitats were measured and compared.|$|R
30|$|Generally, in the wild, {{the overall}} sex ratio of <b>bitterlings</b> is 1 : 1 (Zhang 2005). Since females spawn every 2 ~ 3 days and males can court all the time, the OSR is {{typically}} male-biased. Therefore, different settings {{of the sex}} ratio in our experiments have important consequences for the ecology and natural history of the species (Konečná et al. 2010). We suggest that a prevailing male-biased OSR could have some evolutionary consequences.|$|R
50|$|This and Rhodeus smithii, {{sometimes}} called the Japanese rosy <b>bitterling,</b> were formerly considered conspecific. In 1942, rosy <b>bitterling</b> were accidentally introduced with grass (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) from mainland China. Since the rosy <b>bitterling</b> was introduced, their population has been increasing dramatically all over Japan. Hybridization and subsequent gene introgression has been observed within these species in Kashima and Ogori. Because of these interbreeding events, the number of R. smithii has dramatically declined all over Japan and now {{is in danger of}} extinction.

30|$|Fishes {{commonly}} use UV {{signals in}} communication (Losey et al. 1999; Witzany 2014). In this study, ERG data demonstrated that both subspecies can perceive UV light, i.e., 370 nm, and P. h. chii was {{more sensitive to}} UV light than P. h. himantegus, {{which is consistent with}} the light spectra of their respective habitats. However, since the body UV reflection patterns cannot be quantitatively compared between species, {{it is not possible to}} conclude whether the differences in UV sensitivity between the species are related to their body UV reflection patterns. However, the UV reflection patterns of the <b>bitterlings</b> were sexually dimorphic, suggesting that the UV pattern may be a secondary sexual characteristic in these fishes. Furthermore, the nuptial coloration of the males is a crucial signal for the mate choice of females, and the UV cue has been demonstrated to be a factor for nuptial coloration in many fishes (Garcia and Perera 2002; Kodric-Brown and Johnson 2002; Palmer and Hankison 2014; Rick et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2002). Our results imply that the UV reflection pattern of <b>bitterlings</b> may be an important characteristic for consideration in future taxonomic or ecological studies.|$|R
50|$|In the {{breeding}} season of some roach-like fish, such as <b>bitterlings,</b> the females have an ovipositor {{in the form}} of a tubular extension of the genital orifice. They use it when depositing eggs in the mantle cavity of the pond mussel, where their eggs develop in reasonable security. Seahorses have an ovipositor for introducing eggs into the brood pouch of the male, who carries them till it is time to release the fry into a suitable situation in the open water.|$|R
30|$|Vision, an {{important}} sensory modality of many animals, exhibits plasticity {{in that it}} adapts to environmental conditions to maintain its sensory efficiency. Nuptial coloration is used to attract mates and hence should be tightly coupled to vision. In Taiwan, two closely related <b>bitterlings</b> (Paratanakia himantegus himantegus and Paratanakia himantegus chii) with different male nuptial colorations reside in different habitats. We compared the visual spectral sensitivities of these subspecies with the ambient light spectra of their habitats to determine whether their visual abilities correspond with photic parameters and correlate with nuptial colorations.|$|R

5000|$|The European <b>bitterling</b> (Rhodeus amarus) is a {{temperate}} {{freshwater fish}} {{belonging to the}} Acheilognathinae subfamily of the Cyprinidae family. It originates in Europe, ranging from the Rhone River basin in France to the Neva River in Russia. It was originally described as Cyprinus amarus by Marcus Elieser Bloch in 1782, and {{has been referred to}} in scientific literature as Rhodeus sericeus amarus. It is known simply as [...] "the bitterling" [...] in its native range, where it is the only species of its genus Rhodeus, and sometimes in the scientific literature, also, but this is technically wrong, being a leftover from the times when the European <b>bitterling</b> was united with its Siberian relative, the Amur <b>bitterling,</b> in R. sericeus.

30|$|The {{electroretinogram}} (ERG) {{results revealed}} that the relative spectral sensitivity of P. h. himantegus was higher at 670 nm, but lower at 370 nm, than the sensitivity of P. h. chii. Both <b>bitterlings</b> could perceive and reflect UV light, but the UV reflection patterns differed between genders. Furthermore, the relative irradiance intensity of the light spectra in the habitat of P. h. himantegus was higher at long wavelengths (480 – 700 nm), but lower at short wavelengths (350 – 450 nm), than the light spectra in the habitats of P. h. chii.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we found that}} when faced with an {{increasing}} OSR, male rose <b>bitterlings</b> initially showed an increase and then {{a decrease in the}} courtship intensity such as leading, but a continually increasing ejaculation frequency and aggressive behavior. Thus, over a long time, at lower OSRs, sexual selection could lead to the evolution of characteristics related to courtship, such as a large body size and bright color in males; at higher OSRs, sexual selection would favor the evolution of characteristics related to aggression, possibly larger body sizes in males.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bitterlings</b> have a {{remarkable}} reproduction strategy where parents transfer {{responsibility for the}} care of their young to mussels. The female extends her ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalant water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks larvae swim away from the host to continue life on their own.|$|R
