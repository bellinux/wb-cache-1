5|$|The {{report also}} noted {{concerns}} about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion {{was based on the}} model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.|$|E
5|$|This article {{compares the}} {{properties}} of brains across {{the entire range of}} animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares {{the properties of}} other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> them in a human context. The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} know {{of patriarchal}} and matrifocal ancient societies, very little can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> {{a society of}} a species, which is as remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power {{is controlled by the}} males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E

5|$|The easternmost {{enclosure}} {{is known}} as Fort St-Georges, the central is the Château du Milieu (the middle castle), while the westernmost {{is known as}} the Fort du Coudray. The Fort St-George was built under HenryII and contained a chapel dedicated England's patron saint. The Château du Coudray was added by PhilipII in the early 13thcentury, while the Château de Milieu was built in the 12th and 14thcenturies. The round Tour du Coudray built by PhilipII (which has parallels at Dourdan, Falaise, Gisors, Laon, and Lillebonne) guarded the bridge linking the Fort du Coudray and the Château de Milieu. While the curtain wall stands in many places, the buildings within the château do not survive to the same extent, and in many cases little more can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> them than the location of their foundations and possible use.|$|E
5|$|It is archaeologically {{difficult}} to distinguish Diocletian's fortifications from those of his successors and predecessors. The Devil's Dyke, for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most that can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under Probus along the Lake Constance-Basel and the Rhine–Iller–Danube line), on the Danube- where {{a new line of}} forts {{on the far side of}} the river, the Ripa Sarmatica, was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses – in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative, and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The Strata Diocletiana, built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of Bostra, is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear. In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier, the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire's frontiers than Rome had been: Trier sat on the Rhine, Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube, Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward, and Nicomedia and Antioch were important points in dealings with Persia.|$|E

25|$|A word should <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the ciboria, {{so often}} {{found on the}} Oboria {{continent}} of Europe. In tapering arrangement of tabernacle work they rival the English font covers in delicacy of outline (Muse, Rouen).|$|E

25|$|While the Leucocarbonines {{are almost}} {{certainly}} of southern Pacific origin—possibly even the Antarctic which, {{at the time}} when cormorants evolved, was not yet ice-covered—all that can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the Phalacrocoracines is that they are most diverse in the regions bordering the Indian Ocean, but generally occur over a large area.|$|E
25|$|Under Rule 9, players {{must for}} example capture enemy stones {{even when it}} may be obvious to both players that they cannot evade capture. Otherwise the stones are not {{considered}} to have been captured. Because Rule 9 differs significantly from the various systems for ending the game used in practice, a word must <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> them.|$|E
25|$|The works not {{assigned}} {{as a part}} of Cassiodorus's {{educational program}} must be examined critically. Because he had been working under the newly dominant power of the Ostrogoths, the writer demonstrably alters the narrative of history for the sake of protecting himself. The same could easily <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> his ideas, which were presented as non-threatening in their approach to peaceful meditation and its institutional isolationism.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{ruled in}} {{accordance}} to Islamic law. As such, the People of the Book (the Christians and the Jews) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as dhimmi and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy. While the Armenians of Constantinople benefited from the Sultan's support and grew to be a prospering community, the same could not <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the ones inhabiting historic Armenia.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of A. mellifera subspecies {{is probably the}} product of a largely Early Pleistocene radiation aided by climate and habitat changes during the last ice age. That the western honey bee has been intensively managed by humans for many millennia– including hybridization and introductions– has apparently increased the speed of its evolution and confounded the DNA sequence data to a point where little of substance can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the exact relationships of many A. mellifera subspecies.|$|E
25|$|Very little can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Ba Zaw’s {{works in}} spite of his great {{influence}} on Burmese painting because, to date, only about five of his works have surfaced. Three of the works are watercolors on permanent display {{in the collection of the}} National Museum of Myanmar, one of which appears in Ranard’s Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History. It is a watercolor landscape bearing the orange, brown and yellowish tones that one might expect of a painter influenced by J. J. Hilder. The works in the National Museum have historical importance, but they cannot be called remarkable.|$|E

25|$|The main Bulgarian {{advantage}} {{was their}} strong patriotic spirit and high morale, {{as well as}} the feeling among the men that they were fighting for a just cause. The same could not <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the Serbs. Their king had misled them in his manifesto to the army, telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against Turkey, and the Serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that they were fighting Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{applies to}} a Banach space, {{but of course}} other types of space exist as well, for example, topological vector spaces include Banach spaces, but can be more general. On the other hand, Banach spaces include Hilbert spaces, and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results. With suitable restrictions, much can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> {{the structure of the}} spectra of transformations in a Hilbert space. In particular, for self-adjoint operators, the spectrum lies on the real line and (in general) is a spectral combination of a point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum.|$|E
25|$|While his 1934 {{book was}} treated harshly by the CPUSA, {{the same can}} not <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Corey's 1935 effort, The Crisis of the Middle Class, which was {{received}} warmly. By now the party line had changed from the ultra-radical Third Period to a new, more inclusive effort to build bridges with liberals and non-party radicals known as the Popular Front against fascism. Corey was looked upon by the party no longer as a disreputable political transgressor with a checkered past, but rather as a prestigious intellectual ally. This ideological proximity was emphasized when Corey was chosen to edit a special issue of the CPUSA literary monthly The New Masses thematically focused upon the middle class.|$|E
