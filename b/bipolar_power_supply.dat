40|$|This paper {{describes}} the theoretical background and implementation methodology {{of using a}} thermoelectric converter (TEC) for operating temperature control of a loop heat pipe (LHP). In particular, experimental results from ambient and thermal vacuum tests of an LHP are presented for illustrations. The most commonly used state-of-the-art method to control the LHP operating temperature is to cold bias its compensation chamber (CC) and use an electrical heater to maintain the CC at the desired set point temperature. Although effective, this approach has its shortcomings in that the electrical heater can only provide heating to the CC, and the required power can be large under certain conditions. An alternative method {{is to use a}} TEC, which is capable of providing both heating and cooling to the CC. In this method, one side of the TEC is attached to the CC, and the other side is connected to the evaporator via a thermal strap. Using a <b>bipolar</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and a control algorithm, a TEC can function as a heater or a cooler, depending on the direction of the current flow. Extensive ground tests of several LHPs have demonstrated that a TEC can provide very tight temperature control for the CC. It also offers several additional advantages: (1) The LHP can operate at temperatures below its natural operating temperature at low heat loads; (2) The required heater power for a TEC is much less than that for an electrical heater; and (3) It enhances the LHP start-up success. Although the concept of using a TEC for LHP temperature control is simple, there are many factors to be considered in its implementation for space applications because the TEC is susceptible to the shear stress and yet has to sustain the dynamic load under the spacecraft launch environment. The added features that help the TEC to withstand the dynamic load will inevitably affect the TEC thermal performance. Some experiences and lessons learned are addressed in this paper...|$|E

Forward converter {{was chosen as the}} topology of this <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Output voltage is adjustable from 0 V to 32 V. <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> is capable of output current up to 10 A and output has adjustable current limiting. Following parts were designed: LC filter, pulse transformer, bridge rectifier with capacitor, power MOS-FETs driver, closed loop control with its auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Cascade closed loop control is used for controlling of designed <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Control is analogue, operation amplifiers were used for its construction. PCB was designed for the whole <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> was sucessfully assembled and tested...|$|R
