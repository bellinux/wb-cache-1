40|$|To {{gain insight}} {{into the nature of}} <b>biological</b> <b>synchronization</b> at the {{microscopic}} scale, we here investigate the hydrodynamic synchronization between conically rotating objects termed nodal cilia. A mechanical model of three rotating cilia is proposed with consideration of variation in their shapes and geometrical arrangement. We conduct numerical estimations of both near-field and far-field hydrodynamic interactions, and apply a conventional averaging method for weakly coupled oscillators. In the non-identical case, the three cilia showed stable locked-phase differences around ±π/ 2. However, such phase locking also occurred with three identical cilia when allocated in a triangle except for the equilateral triangle. The effects of inhomogeneity in cilia shapes and geometrical arrangement on such asymmetric interaction is discussed to understand the role of biological variation in synchronization via hydrodynamic interactions.

40|$|An {{oscillator}} {{neural network}} {{based on the}} Ginzburg-Landau equation is proposed in order to investigate associative memory. The embedded patterns include both off- and on-firing states with phase. Neurons encode not only the phase but also {{the state of the}} cell. The system has a Lyapunov function with wells corresponding to off- and on-firing states. These two states are characterized by mutual stabilities which are generally different. Each neuron falls into one of the wells, as determined by its dynamics. The storage capacity and the order parameter overlap are studied using numerical simula-tions and an ordinary self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis. We show that these properties depend crucially on both the potential parameter and the mean activity levels of the pat-terns. In the case of the sparse coding limit, the storage capacity diverges {{as in the case of}} the binary model. There are many reports on <b>biological</b> <b>synchronization</b> phenomena, e. g., in the circadian rhythm of animals, heart tissue, plasmodium and light emission from fire-flies. 1) There are also several experimental observations on the phase synchronizatio...|$|E
40|$|For spiking neural {{networks}} we consider the stability problem of global synchrony, arguably the simplest non-trivial collective dynamics in such networks. We find that even this simplest dynamical problem [...] local stability of synchrony [...] is non-trivial to solve and requires novel methods for its solution. The dynamics {{in the vicinity of}} the synchronous state is determined by a multitude of linear operators, in contrast to a single stability matrix in conventional linear stability theory. This unusual property qualitatively depends on network topology and may be neglected for globally coupled homogeneous networks. For generic networks, however, the number of operators increases exponentially with the size of the network. We present methods to treat this multi-operator problem exactly. First, based on the Gershgorin and Perron-Frobenius theorems, we derive bounds on the eigenvalues that provide important information about the synchronization process but are not sufficient to establish the asymptotic stability or instability of the synchronous state. We then present a complete analysis of asymptotic stability for topologically strongly connected networks using simple graph-theoretical considerations. For inhibitory interactions between dissipative (leaky) oscillatory neurons the synchronous state is stable, independent of the parameters and the network connectivity. These results indicate that pulse-like interactions play a profound role in network dynamical systems, and in particular in the dynamics of <b>biological</b> <b>synchronization,</b> unless the coupling is homogeneous and all-to-all.

The input to each neuron is the feature of an image, i. e. light intensity.

Two rules for the unsupervised adaption of the synaptic weigths have been derived to achieve segmentation image of areas belonging to the same feature. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{synchronization}} of metacommunities is investigated {{in this article}} with reference to a rather general model composed of a chaotic environmental compartment driving a <b>biological</b> compartment. <b>Synchronization</b> {{in the absence of}} dispersal (i. e., the so-called Moran effect) is first discussed and shown to occur only when there is no biochaos. In other words, if the biological compartment is reinforcing environmental chaos, dispersal must be strictly above a specified threshold in order to synchronize population dynamics. Moreover, this threshold can be easily determined from the model by computing a special Lyapunov exponent. The application to prey-predator metacommunities points out the influence of frequency and coherence of the environmental noise on synchronization and agrees with all experimental studies performed on the subject...|$|R

As a criterion in the determination of the functional significance of a n-node subgraph, we propose an analytic method to measure the stability of the synchronous state (SSS) the subgraph displays. We finally show that, in those <b>biological</b> networks where <b>synchronization</b> is a relevant issue, the SSS of a given motif is potentially correlated with its relative abundance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{wireless}} sensor networks, {{hundreds or}} thousands of microsensors are deployed in an uncontrolled way to monitor and gather information of environments. Sensor nodes have limited power, computational capacities, memory, and communication capability. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for data fusion where sensored information periodically propagates without any centralized control from the edge of a sensor network to a base station as the propagation forms a concentric circle. By observing the radio signals emitted by sensor nodes in its vicinity, a sensor node independently determines the cycle and the timing at which it emits sensored information in synchrony. For this purpose, we adopt a pulse-coupled oscillator model based on <b>biological</b> mutual <b>synchronization</b> such as that used by flashing fireflies, chirping crickets, and pacemaker cells. Through simulation experiments, we confirmed that our scheme can fuse sensor information in a fully-distributed, self-organizing, robust, adaptable, scalable, and energy-efficient manner. ...|$|R

The maintenance of the synchronized regime in this cases is energetically costly 1. This work studies the energy implications of synchronization phenomena in a pair of structurally flexible coupled neurons that interact through electrical coupling. We show that the forced synchronization between two nonidentical neurons creates appropriate conditions for an efficient actuation of adaptive laws able to make the neurons structurally approach their behaviours in order to decrease the flow of energy required to maintain the synchronization regime...|$|R

40|$|Biological systems possess {{negative}} entropy. In them, {{one form}} of order produces another, more organized form of order. We propose a formal scheme to calculate robustness of an entire biological system by quantifying the negative entropy present in it. Our Methodology is based upon a computational implementation of two-person non-cooperative finite zero-sum game between positive (physico-chemical) and negative (biological) entropy, present in the system(TCA cycle, for this work). Biochemical analogue of Nash equilibrium, proposed here, could measure the robustness in TCA cycle in exact numeric terms, whereas the mixed strategy game between these entropies could quantitate the progression of stages of <b>biological</b> adaptation. <b>Synchronization</b> profile amongst macromolecular concentrations (even under environmental perturbations) is found to account for negative entropy and biological robustness. Emergence of synchronization profile was investigated with dynamically varying metabolite concentrations. Obtained results were verified with that from the deterministic simulation methods. Categorical plans to apply this algorithm in Cancer studies and anti-viral therapies are proposed alongside. From theoretical perspective, this work proposes a general, rigorous and alternative view of immunology. Comment: Biological robustness, negative entropy, game theory.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{study of}} spontaneous synchronization is an emerging {{field in the}} study of nonlinear dynamics. Spontaneous synchronization occurs {{in a wide variety of}} human, biological, and mechanical systems. Mathematical descriptions of synchronization require systems of coupled differential equations. Differential equations relate quantities and their rates of change. Differential calculus makes it possible to deal mathematically with non-constant rates of change. Entities that synchronize can be modeled as coupled oscillators. The Kuramoto model is a solvable system of coupled differential equations that can represent multiple related oscillators.

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} {{symbolic}} computation tools for the parametric analysis of the synchronization stability of chaotic oscillators. Moreover, some concepts of synchronization recently proposed in the literature are briefly presented. 1 Introduction The study of synchronization of coupled systems dates from the works of Huygens on coupled pendulums (1673). Since then, these concepts have been applied to a broad class of systems. In {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century the occurrence of synchronization phenomena in electric and electromechanical systems has been reported. Recently, it has been shown how chaotic oscillators could be synchronized [2]. Nowadays, there are many applications of synchronized chaotic oscillators, such as: secure communication [6], control of chaotic systems [1], <b>biological</b> systems [7]. <b>Synchronization</b> could be roughly defined as the mutual time conformity of two or more processes characterized by the relations of some functionals of the referred proc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{characteristic of}} the theory of coupled oscillators, at least from the admittedly limited biologist’s perspective, is its ability to explain a large variety of phenomena which, regardless of their specific nature and constituents, seem to share common underlying principles that contribute to such characteristic <b>biological</b> phenomena as <b>synchronization,</b> with all its ramifications. From a bunch of fireflies in an open field synchronizing their light emission, to masses of people applauding in a theatre, coupled oscillator formalisms have been applied to determine underlying mechanisms which allow the set of these most unlikely “oscillators ” (are people oscillators? and when?) to synchronize. After all, and generally speaking, individuals (cells, brains, persons, fireflies [...] .) can be considered oscillators. Oscillations and synchronization processes pervade all aspects of life, from circadian rhythms to individual habits and traits such as spontaneous synchronization in clapping and walking, in pathologies like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, or even among the organs in the body which have been considered to be weakly coupled (alteration in their coupling has been proposed to lead to the disorder known as multiple organ dysfunction). In this brief review, we focus on specific contributions of oscillator theory to neuroscience, and comment on current trends to understand the relation between brain activity and behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Most organisms have {{developed}} an internal timing mechanism or circadian clock that is able to generate 24 -hour <b>biological</b> rhythms in <b>synchronization</b> with the diurnal environmental changes. Despite our increasing understanding of the molecular machinery underlying circadian clock function, a complete picture of the components and regulatory mechanisms governing the circadian system in Arabidopsis thaliana is still lacking. In a recent study, we have characterized {{the role of the}} MYB-like transcription factor REVEILLE 8 /LHY-CCA 1 -LIKE 5 (RVE 8 /LCL 5) within the Arabidopsis circadian clock. We have generated RVE 8 /LCL 5 mutant and overexpressing plants and showed that similar to the MYB-like transcription factor CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA 1), RVE 8 /LCL 5 binds to the promoter of key clock component TOC 1 (Timing of CAB expression 1) and regulates its circadian expression. However, the mechanisms of RVE 8 /LCL 5 and CCA 1 circadian function seem to differ: while CCA 1 represses TOC 1 expression by facilitating a hypo-acetylated state of Histone H 3, RVE 8 /LCL 5 contributes to TOC 1 expression by favouring H 3 acetylation at the TOC 1 locus. Although CCA 1 has a more predominant role on this regulation, our results showing the opposing function of RVE 8 /LCL 5 open interesting questions about the complex networks of transcriptional regulators and chromatin remodelling activities that need to be integrated in synergistic and antagonistic ways to generate the circadian periodicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} drug eluting stents (DESs) has been {{challenged}} by recent reports published on recurrence of thrombosis after the implantation of DESs. The response to injury post stenting leading to recruitment and stabilization of platelets has posed a severe threat to using DESs. Many reports published earlier indicate a lack of a complete endothelial layer formation post-stenting as a precursor to thrombosis. Various approaches have been attempted to prevent thrombosis, including delivering biological agents (e. g., estradiol) that promote endothelialization and use of natural polymers as drug carriers. The drawback of these methods has been inability to release the <b>biological</b> agent in <b>synchronization</b> with the foreign body response in vivo. The natural healing process of the endothelium after an injury starts to occur after a week and may take up to a period of month in humans to complete. The challenge in developing an anti thrombogenic stent has been to sustain the release of drug over this period of time. Previous approaches have focused on modifying the polymeric carrier to achieve this sustained drug release. A significant knowledge gap exists in understanding the physico-chemical properties of the drug and its interaction with the polymer in developing formulation for DES. The present work involves in developing a DES with combination of drugs that can release both antiproliferative agent (Paclitaxel (PTX)) and endothelializing agent (Probucol (PB)) from the same polyurethane (PU) matrix in a sustained manner. Paclitaxel is an anti proliferative agent that inhibits restenosis, used in commercially available drug eluting stent. Probucol (PB), a highly lipophilic drug, {{has been shown to}} promote endothelialization. ...|$|R
40|$|Synchronization {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{phenomena}} involved in information processing in living systems. It is known that the nervous system requires the coordinated activity of both local and distant neural populations. Such an interplay allows to merge different information modalities in a whole processing supporting high-level mental skills as understanding, memory, abstraction, etc. Though the <b>biological</b> processes underlying <b>synchronization</b> in the brain are not fully understood there have been reported a variety of mechanisms supporting different types of synchronization both at theoretical and experimental level. One of the more intriguing of these phenomena is the anticipating synchronization, which has been recently reported in a pair of unidirectionally coupled artificial neurons under simple conditions cite{Pyragas}, where the slave neuron is able to anticipate in time the behaviour of the master one. In this paper we explore the effect of spike anticipation over the information processing performed by a neural network at functional and structural level. We show that the introduction of intermediary neurons in the network enhances spike anticipation and analyse how these variations in spike anticipation can significantly change the firing regime of the neural network according to its functional and structural properties. In addition we show that the interspike interval (ISI), one of the main features of the neural response associated to the information coding, can be closely related to spike anticipation by each spike, and how synaptic plasticity can be modulated through that relationship. This study has been performed through numerical simulation of a coupled system of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAutistic {{people are}} well known to show {{particularities}} in tasks requiring integrating information (weak central coherence, reinforced perception) as well as difficulties in processing overfull information {{at the same time}} and in processing complex visual information that requires inter-network interactions. All these show an abnormal style of brain connectivity, either anatomical, functional or both. Sleep problems are also common in children with autism, including “longer sleep onset times” and “greater fragmentation of sleep”. However, it remains to be determined whether there is a relationship between sleep problems and their special way of information processing. First, sleep in early life has been suggested to play a crucial role in brain development. Being regarded as an “unconscious” state to outside stimuli (non-REM sleep) and an “active” state of memory consolidation (REM sleep), sleep helps our brain work better by eliminating useless information, updating stored information and reinforcing efficient brain connectivity, to develop a more and more “personally perfect” internal representation of the world and a more and more efficient cognitive system. Sleep problems in autistic people, especially the greater fragmentation of sleep, may lead to less efficient brain connectivity in the developing brain, which could furnish a neural substrate for forming such a specificity of information processing (weak central coherence). Second, abnormal melatonin physiology has been supposed to explain sleep problems in autistic people. Melatonin receptors are detected in a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types of human brain and peripheral structures. Its rhythmic secretion has been suggested to be a major messenger that supports <b>biological</b> rhythm <b>synchronization</b> S. V. Anisimov and N. Popovic, Genetic aspects of melatonin biology, Rev Neurosci 15 (2004), pp. 209 – 230. View Record in Scopus | Cited By in Scopus (12) and modifies the sleep-vigilance states. Interestingly, the secretion of melatonin in autistic subjects has also been reported to be elevated during daytime. Such an abnormal neurotransmitter physiological regulating could probably make a “functional disconnection effect” during the day, just like the normal “fading of consciousness” effect during the night as reported by Massimini et al. who suppose that the fading of consciousness during certain stages of sleep might be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity. So we suggest that the capacity of the brain to integrate information might be reduced in autistic people given that the regulation of the sleep-vigilance neurotransmitter networks was disturbed. Thus, sleep problems and abnormal melatonin physiology found in autistic people may play an important role for their specificity in brain connectivity and in information processing...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expressions}} {{measured using}} microarrays usually {{suffer from the}} missing value problem. However, in many data analysis methods, a complete data matrix is required. Although existing missing value imputation algorithms have shown good performance to deal with missing values, they also have their limitations. For example, some algorithms have good performance only when strong local correlation exists in data while some provide the best estimate when data is dominated by global structure. In addition, these algorithms do {{not take into account}} any biological constraint in their imputation. In this paper, we propose a set theoretic framework based on projection onto convex sets (POCS) for missing data imputation. POCS allows us to incorporate different types of a priori knowledge about missing values into the estimation process. The main idea of POCS is to formulate every piece of prior knowledge into a corresponding convex set and then use a convergence-guaranteed iterative procedure to obtain a solution in the intersection of all these sets. In this work, we design several convex sets, taking into consideration the biological characteristic of the data: the first set mainly exploit the local correlation structure among genes in microarray data, while the second set captures the global correlation structure among arrays. The third set (actually a series of sets) exploits the <b>biological</b> phenomenon of <b>synchronization</b> loss in microarray experiments. In cyclic systems, synchronization loss is a common phenomenon and we construct a series of sets based on this phenomenon for our POCS imputation algorithm. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a significant reduction of error compared to the KNNimpute, SVDimpute and LSimpute methods. Full Tex...|$|R
