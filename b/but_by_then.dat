5|$|Iles {{remained}} as superintendent until 1957, and {{proved to be}} a good publicist for the zoo, taking part in radio and television programmes such as Children's Hour. A new attraction was introduced in 1963, a Chimps' Tea Party, which proved to be very popular. The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> the owners of Belle Vue had lost interest in the zoo, and closure seemed imminent.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revolution}} broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E

5|$|Although Gascoigne {{had always}} {{intended}} to study mathematics at Cambridge, an event occurred that significantly shaped his career. In 1931, an earthquake in New Zealand killed Michael Hiatt Baker, a young traveller from Bristol, {{and his parents}} established a postgraduate scholarship in his memory, for study at the University of Bristol, which Gascoigne won and took up in 1938. During his thesis studies at Bristol, Gascoigne developed a diffraction theory of the Foucault test that is used for evaluating the shape of large telescope mirrors. He completed his doctorate in physics in 1941, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> war had broken out in Europe, and he had already returned to New Zealand on the last available ship.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin is {{most often}} remembered {{for her role as}} a speaker, writer, and activist in the feminist anti-pornography movement. In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in {{organizing}} public pickets of Snuff in New York City and, during the fall, joined Adrienne Rich, Grace Paley, Gloria Steinem, Shere Hite, Lois Gould, Barbara Deming, Karla Jay, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Robin Morgan, and Susan Brownmiller in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group. Members of this group would go on to found Women Against Pornography in 1979, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach. Dworkin spoke at the first Take Back the Night march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the red-light district of San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E

5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> it was too late in the day to proceed.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander.

The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded.

5|$|For their part, the Sassanids {{struggled}} {{to establish a}} stable government. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius' ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrow's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other.

This became the haunt {{of a number of}} musicians, including the singer Sandy Denny. Another singer, Jacqui McShee, began performing with the two guitarists and, with the addition of Danny Thompson (string bass) and Terry Cox (drums), they formed the group, Pentangle. The venue evolved into a jazz club, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>then</b> the group had moved on.|$|E

The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, {{but this was not}} attractive to the rebels. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.|$|E
