5|$|Other {{units at}} Horn Island {{included}} No.28 Operational <b>Base</b> <b>Unit,</b> {{which had been}} located there since being formed in May 1942; No.112 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters (formerly No.12 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters); and a detachment of No.7 Squadron (headquartered at Townsville), operating Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance bombers. No.33 Operational <b>Base</b> <b>Unit,</b> formed at Townsville in April 1943, established itself at Higgins Field on 23October. No.1 Repair and Salvage Unit was also headquartered at Higgins, but maintained a detachment on Thursday Island. No.23 Air Stores Park, based on Thursday Island, was responsible for logistical support of No.75 Wing units.|$|E
5|$|Póvoa de Varzim {{is home to}} the Escola dos Serviços, a Portuguese {{military}} <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> for logistics, military {{education and}} training, and financial resources. It includes a command, army staff, the Commander and Services Company, and the Battalion of Service and Support to Military Instruction. The unit is hair to the Battalion of Military Administration that was transferred to Póvoa de Varzim in December 1914 to prepare for the Portuguese participation in World War I. The current <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> was built in 1994 and it increased in military personnel, duties and responsibilities in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} candela, all the <b>base</b> <b>units</b> will {{be defined in}} terms of {{universal}} physical constants, but without an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the constants and the <b>base</b> <b>units.</b> Thus six physical constants will be needed to define the six <b>base</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of SI <b>units,</b> <b>base</b> <b>units</b> and derived <b>units.</b> <b>Base</b> <b>units</b> are the simple {{measurements}} for time, length, mass, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and light intensity. Derived units are constructed from the <b>base</b> <b>units,</b> for example, the watt, i.e. the unit for power, is defined from the <b>base</b> <b>units</b> as m2·kg·s−3. Other physical properties may be measured in compound units, such as material density, measured in kg/m3.|$|R

5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical <b>base</b> <b>unit.</b> Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the <b>base</b> <b>unit,</b> with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Davis {{served in}} a number of {{administrative}} positions in the United States. On August 10, 1945, he was assigned to the 556th Air <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> at Long Beach, California. On August 24, 1946, he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant in the active duty Army Air Corps, demoting him from his temporary rank but effectively allowing him to stay in the military in spite of the demobilization and downsizing of the US military. Several weeks later on September 7, Davis was ordered to the 554th Air <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> in Memphis, Tennessee, where he served on one of the Army Air Corps aerobatic demonstration teams, the predecessors to the United States Air Force Thunderbirds.|$|E
5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E

50|$|A set of <b>base</b> <b>units</b> for {{a system}} of {{measurement}} is a conventionally chosen set of units, none {{of which can be}} expressed as a combination of the others, and in terms of which all the remaining units if the system can be expressed.

5|$|These {{changes will}} {{have the effect of}} redefining the SI <b>base</b> <b>units,</b> though the {{definitions}} of the derived SI units in terms of the <b>base</b> <b>units</b> will remain the same.|$|R
5|$|Gravitational metric systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> of force, {{with mass}} measured in a unit {{known as the}} hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} the International System of Units (SI).|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> {{moved to}} Oxnard Field in September 1945, {{where it was}} {{transferred}} to the Manhattan District's 9812th Technical Services Unit on 17 December 1945. Oxnard was later designated Sandia Base. The Special Ordnance Detachment took with it its special tools and equipment, and even some of its buildings. The test program resumed at Sandia in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} for the bomb code-named the Fat Man arrived by air the same day. The bomb's plutonium core (encased in its insertion capsule) and the beryllium-polonium initiator were transported from Kirtland to Tinian by C-54 {{in the custody}} of Project Alberta couriers. Three Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies designated F31, F32, and F33 were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s, two from the 509th and one from the 216th AAF <b>Base</b> <b>Unit,</b> and transported to North Field, arriving 2 August. The B-29s were Luke the Spook and Laggin' Dragon of the 509th, and 42-65386, a phase 3 Silverplate of the 216th AAF <b>Base</b> <b>Unit.</b> F33 was expended during the final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E
50|$|Despite some resistance, the {{experiment}} was destined to leave its mark on postwar organization of the United States Air Force. In September 1947, upon establishment of the U.S. Air Force, all AAF <b>base</b> <b>units</b> were re-designated as Air Force <b>Base</b> <b>Units</b> (AFBUs); but by mid-1948 the remaining <b>base</b> <b>units</b> were discontinued or re designated into {{a new type of}} four-digit T/D unit (Hobson Plan), the direct predecessor of the MAJCON system.|$|R

5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

2500|$|Derived units {{which are}} formed by {{operating}} on <b>base</b> <b>units</b> or combinations of <b>base</b> <b>units</b> and other derived units. For example, a C# tuning fork vibrates 261.6 times per second and therefore has a frequency of 261.6 {{cycles per second}} or 261.6 hertz. In this instance [...] "hertz" [...] is a derived unit as it is automatically defined from {{the definition of the}} second. Other derived units might be built up from one or more <b>base</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as <b>base</b> <b>units.</b> Derived units were built up from the <b>base</b> <b>units</b> using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both <b>base</b> and derived <b>units</b> were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|R
5|$|Other support {{units were}} {{activated}} at Wendover from personnel already present {{and working with}} Project Alberta or in the 216th AAF <b>Base</b> <b>Unit,</b> both affiliated with the Manhattan project. Project Alberta was {{the part of the}} Manhattan Project at Site Y in Los Alamos, New Mexico responsible for the preparation and delivery of the nuclear weapons. It was commanded by U.S. Navy Captain William S. Parsons, who would accompany the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later.|$|E
5|$|The wing began re-equipping with P-51D Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945. No.481 (Maintenance) Squadron {{was formed}} in December from {{elements}} of No.22 Repair and Servicing Unit, No.25 Air Stores Park, and other units based on Labuan. No.381 (Base) Squadron, established in January 1946, also utilised personnel and equipment from No.81 Wing's specialist units at Labuan, including No.47 Operational <b>Base</b> <b>Unit,</b> No.24 Medical Clearing Station, No.25 Air Stores Park and No.2 Airfield Defence Squadron. RAAF base squadrons were administrative and logistical units, intended to make their wings self-supporting and mobile for potential deployment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} metric system {{there were two}} <b>base</b> <b>units,</b> the metre for length and the gram for mass. The other units of length and mass, and all units of area, volume, and derived units such as density were derived from these two <b>base</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, barye, {{is related}} to the CGS <b>base</b> <b>units</b> of length, mass, and time {{in the same way as}} the SI unit of pressure, pascal, {{is related to}} the SI <b>base</b> <b>units</b> of length, mass, and time: ...|$|R
50|$|Different {{systems of}} <b>units</b> are <b>based</b> on {{different}} choices {{of a set}} of base units.The most widely used system of units is the International System of Units, or SI.

5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth <b>base</b> <b>unit</b> of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the <b>base</b> <b>unit,</b> so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
5|$|Reclassified as {{a repair}} ship on 16 August 1937, Asahi {{was taken out}} of reserve in November, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was used as a {{transport}} to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay. Afterwards she began conversion at Kure, Japan, into a repair ship; this was completed on 18 December 1938. Asahi was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December. In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940. She was transferred to Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th <b>Base</b> <b>Unit</b> from Kure to Camranh Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941.|$|E
5000|$|There are 7 SI <b>base</b> <b>units.</b> These are a {{coherent}} set of units defined to measure 7 basic physical properties: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela.
