5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial {{crops in}} Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, <b>bronzing</b> of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was indistinguishable from the agent of aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
25|$|Lutein is {{a natural}} part of human diet when orange-yellow fruits and leafy green {{vegetables}} are consumed. According to the NHANES 2013-2014 survey, adults in the United States average 1.7 mg/day of lutein and zeaxanthin combined. No recommended dietary allowance currently exists for lutein. Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6–10mg/day. The only definitive side effect of excess lutein consumption is <b>bronzing</b> of the skin (carotenodermia).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the centre}} of the [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall hall was an ornate bronze fountain, given by the Street Commissioners upon their {{retirement}} in 1851. The base was made from Yorkshire sandstone and was [...] in diameter. It was {{in the form of a}} Greek tazza and cost £900. On the inside of the bowl were eight lions' heads from which water was ejected. The entire fountain was [...] tall and in the centre was a [...] tall statue called the Messenger and Sons. The statue consisted of four children representative of each of Birmingham's main four industries; gun making, glass-blowing, <b>bronzing</b> and engineering. The fountain was inaugurated by the Chairman of the Market Committee, John Cadbury, on 24 December 1851. The fountain was removed in 1880 with the intention of re-erecting it in Highgate Park later that year but this did not happen and it was destroyed in 1923.|$|E

An Early <b>Bronze</b> Age is divided into three major phases, Early <b>Bronze</b> I, II and III, but copper and not <b>bronze</b> was the most common metal in use, while stone technology continued to contribute the bulk of tools. Early <b>Bronze</b> III is followed by another period, alternately named Early <b>Bronze</b> IV, Middle <b>Bronze</b> I, Intermediate <b>Bronze</b> or Early Bronze-Middle <b>Bronze.</b> In this period the name is apt; true <b>bronze</b> (a tin alloy of copper) makes its appearance in this time span.|$|R

6000|$|Ned {{generally}} married {{away from}} home. In fact his marriages {{were intended to}} cement the nations, torn asunder by Ned's military career.

60|$|He crept {{downstairs in}} the gray {{twilight}} of the scarce-awakened house, {{and made his way}} to the stables. Saddling his horse, and mounting, he paced forth into the crisp morning air. The sun, just risen, was everywhere bringing out the fresh color of the flower-strewn terraces, as the last night's shadows, which had hidden them, were slowly beaten back. He cast a last look at the brown adobe quadrangle of the quiet house, just touched with the <b>bronzing</b> of the sun, and then turned his face towards the highway. As he passed the angle of the old garden he hesitated, but, strong in his resolution, he put the recollection of last night behind him, and rode by without raising his eyes.|$|E
60|$|In those {{military}} manoeuvres {{the miller}} followed {{the fortunes of}} one man; Anne Garland of two. The spectators, who, unlike our party, had no personal interest in the soldiery, saw only troops and battalions in the concrete, straight lines of red, straight lines of blue, white lines formed of innumerable knee-breeches, black lines formed of many gaiters, coming and going in kaleidoscopic change. Who thought of every point in the line as an isolated man, each dwelling all to himself in the hermitage of his own mind? One person did, a young man {{far removed from the}} barrow where the Garlands and Miller Loveday stood. The natural expression of his face was somewhat obscured by the <b>bronzing</b> effects of rough weather, but the lines of his mouth showed that affectionate impulses were strong within him--perhaps stronger than judgment well could regulate. He wore a blue jacket with little brass buttons, and was plainly a seafaring man.|$|E

60|$|The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through deep lanes worn by {{centuries of}} wheels, high banks on either side, heavy with {{dripping}} moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns. <b>Bronzing</b> bracken and mottled bramble {{gleamed in the}} light of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge, and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the country-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.|$|E

5000|$|Abandonment of {{many sites}} {{at the end}} of the Chalcolithic period and major changes in {{material}} culture led archaeologists to name the post Chalcolithic period the [...] "Early <b>Bronze</b> Age," [...] a misnomer (only copper without tin {copper + tin = bronze} was in use) that has become an accepted convention. Pottery continued to be made in quantity and, until quite recently there was thought to have been a thoroughgoing break in traditions from earlier periods, in typology and morphology. While major differences are known and became greater as the Early <b>Bronze</b> Age progressed, the earliest phases show more than a modicum of continuity with Chalcolithic potting traditions. The Early <b>Bronze</b> Age may now be divided up into three sequential phases, Early <b>Bronze</b> I, Early <b>Bronze</b> II and Early <b>Bronze</b> III. Some scholars include an Early <b>Bronze</b> IV in the Early <b>Bronze</b> Age.
