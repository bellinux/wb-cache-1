5|$|The Merkle play {{remains one}} of the most famous in {{baseball}} history. The ball used in the Merkle play was sold at an auction in the 1990s for $27,500, making it one of the four most valuable baseballs based on purchase price. Evers' role in Merkle's <b>boner</b> cemented his legacy as a smart ballplayer.|$|E

Next to him is Seweryn <b>Boner,</b> an important burgher and banker. His face {{is one of the}} two self-portraits of Jan Matejko. The second is the face of the royal jester Stańczyk. As Berrecci, Matejko portrayed himself as a gray eminence, dominating the scene, with a royal scepter in his hand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the more}} popular {{versions}} of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles <b>Boner</b> added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions {{can be seen in}} various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all, and the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|E

5|$|The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs {{clinched}} the pennant after defeating the Giants {{in part due}} to Merkle's <b>Boner.</b> In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.|$|E

Neptune was donated by Sherman <b>Boner</b> on December 5, 1942 and was {{originally}} intended to be served at a fundraising pig roast until the local navy recruiter had another idea. Neptune was a Hereford swine, a breed characterized as mostly red, with a white face, ears and at least two white feet, {{similar to that of the}} Hereford breed of cattle.|$|E

In 1655, it was partly burnt by the Swedish troops, who -deployed here for almost two years- destroyed the buildings considerably. From 1669 on, the castle belonged to Stanisław Warszycki, the Cracow's castellan, who managed to partly rebuild the castle after the Swedish devastations.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its large}} size, Nashville {{has been in}} a single congressional {{district}} for most of the time since Reconstruction; it is currently the 5th District, represented by Democrat Jim Cooper. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874. Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing by a candidate from Wallace's American Independent Party kept the seat in Democratic hands. However, they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably Jo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was Speaker of the House for much of Franklin Roosevelt's first term as President. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was Percy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was House Majority Whip from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors Richard Fulton and Bill <b>Boner</b> also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.|$|E
25|$|The 1908 pennant {{races in}} both the AL and NL {{were among the most}} {{exciting}} ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, {{often referred to as the}} Merkle <b>Boner.</b> On September 23, 1908, the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs played a game in the Polo Grounds. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman Fred Merkle, later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, Johnny Evers, noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the World Series (the last Cubs Series victory until 2016).|$|E

500|$|Charles <b>Boner</b> was {{the first}} to {{translate}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of peas in an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey. [...] Boner's translation was published as [...] "The Princess on the Peas" [...] in A Danish Story-Book in 1846. [...] <b>Boner</b> has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the rhetorical question, [...] "Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?" [...] rather than Andersen's joke of the pea being placed in the Royal Museum. <b>Boner</b> and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, [...] "continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal".|$|E
500|$|Charles <b>Boner</b> also {{translated}} the tale in 1846 as [...] "Little Ellie" [...] while Madame de Chatelain dubbed the child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation.

His widely published volumes of Andersen's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866. Mrs. H.B. Paulli {{translated the}} name as 'Little Tiny' in the late-nineteenth century.|$|E

In the replayed game between the Giants and Cubs, Giants pitcher Christy Mathewson reportedly waved Seymour to move further back in the outfield; Seymour refused, only to see the ball hit over his head, allowing the Cubs to score three runs {{on their way to}} the win. [...] Mathewson later denied waving Seymour back, saying Seymour [...] "knew the Chicago batters as well as [...] did and how to play them." ...|$|E
