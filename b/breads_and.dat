5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark <b>breads</b> <b>and</b> schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|Israeli eating customs also {{conform to}} the wider Mediterranean region, with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, {{vegetables}} and salads, olives, hard-boiled eggs or omelets, pickled and smoked herring, a variety of <b>breads,</b> <b>and</b> fresh orange juice and coffee.|$|E

50|$|After {{the water}} is passed to the congregation, the water trays are covered with the bread trays for the {{remainder}} of the service. Usually, those who have prepared the <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> water prior to the meeting have the responsibility of disposing of them after the meeting.

Latter-day Saints believe the <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> water to be symbols, not the actual body and blood of Christ; therefore, discarding blessed <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> water is not considered sacrilegious.|$|R
40|$|Macroscopic pore {{structure}} parameters (bulk density, true density and porosity) and microscopic {{pore structure}} parameters (percentage closed pore volume and pore size distribution) for a highly expanded type (Wonder White Sandwich <b>Bread)</b> <b>and</b> a relatively compact type (Chessmen Butter Cookies) starch based food material were determined and their pore structures were compared. Bulk density determined by solid displacement and true density determined by pycnometry yielded porosity measurement s o f 0. 9 for <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> 0. 6 for cookies. Percentage closed pore volume calculated {{by comparing the}} true density of porous samples of <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> cookies with the true density of !heir compacted pellet s showed that both <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> cookies contained closed pores. Pore size distributions representative of the mercury porosimetry range (pores less than 200 um in diameter) indicated that the smallest pore diameter was 6 um for both <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> cookies. Pore size distributions obtained corresponded to about 16 % and 65 % of the total pore volume in <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> cookies, respectively. Both <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> cookie samples were found to undergo capillary hysteresis. Unidimensional mercury intrusion studies revealed a highly interconnected pore structure both in <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> cookies.

Sephardic dishes, with Balkan and Turkish influences incorporated in Israeli cuisine include burekas, yogurt and taramosalata. Yemenite Jewish foods include jachnun, malawach, skhug and kubane. Iraqi dishes popular in Israel include amba, {{various types of}} kubba, stuffed vegetables (mhasha), kebab, sambusac, sabich and pickled vegetables (hamutzim).|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade <b>breads</b> <b>and</b> the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{a typical}} Saint Joseph's Day altar, people place flowers, limes, candles, wine, fava beans, {{specially}} prepared cakes, <b>breads,</b> <b>and</b> cookies (as {{well as other}} meatless dishes), and zeppole. Foods are traditionally served containing bread crumbs to represent saw dust since Joseph was a carpenter. Because the feast occurs during Lent, traditionally no meat was allowed on the celebration table. The altar usually has three tiers, to represent the trinity.|$|E
25|$|The masonry oven {{is similar}} to a smoke pit; it allows for an open flame but cooks more quickly and uses {{convection}} to cook. Barbecue-baking can also be done in traditional stove-ovens. It can be used to cook meats, <b>breads</b> <b>and</b> other starches, casseroles, and desserts. It uses direct and indirect heat to surround the food with hot air to cook, and can be basted in much the same manner as grilled foods.|$|E
25|$|Oils can be {{flavored with}} garlic cloves. These infused oils {{are used to}} season all {{categories}} of vegetables, meats, <b>breads</b> <b>and</b> pasta. Garlic, along with fish sauce, chopped fresh chilis, lime juice, sugar and water, is a basic essential item in dipping fish sauce, a highly used dipping sauce condiment used in Indochina. In East and Southeast Asia, chili oil with garlic is a popular dipping sauce, especially for meat and seafood. Tuong ot toi Viet Nam (Vietnam Chili Garlic Sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia.|$|E

25|$|Wheat {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} {{mutation}} breeding, with the use of gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content was developed through gamma radiation breeding. Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to contain greater amounts of gluten, which affords significant advantages for improving the quality of <b>breads</b> <b>and</b> pastas from a functional point of view. Gluten is appreciated for its unique viscoelastic properties. It gives elasticity to dough and is responsible for dough’s gas-retaining properties.|$|E
25|$|On April 24, 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration {{announced}} that acrylamide {{can be found}} in baked and fried starchy foods, such as potato chips, <b>breads,</b> <b>and</b> cookies. Concern was raised mainly because of the probable carcinogenic effects of acrylamide. This was followed by a strong, but short-lived, interest from the press. On August 26, 2005, California attorney general Bill Lockyer filed a lawsuit against four makers of french fries and potato chips – H.J. Heinz Co., Frito-Lay, Kettle Foods Inc., and Lance Inc. – to reduce the risk to consumers from consuming acrylamide. The lawsuit was settled on August 1, 2008, with the food producers agreeing to cut acrylamide levels to 275 parts per billion in three years, to avoid a Proposition 65 warning label. The companies avoided trial by agreeing to pay a combined $3 million in fines as a settlement with the California attorney general's office.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mexico, Papantla celebrates Day of the Dead but has some local variations. “Ofrendas” (altars to the dead) {{can be set up}} on tables or on board which are {{suspended}} from the ceiling. The altar is called a pachau and the lack on one in the home can bring on social rejection for violating community norms. These are decorated with palm fronds, bananas, oranges, limes, anis and chocolate figures. Food stuffs include mole, candy, tamales, local <b>breads</b> <b>and</b> other regional specialties. A glass of water and “renio” (a type of local alcohol) are also placed. Day of the Dead celebrations begin on 31 October for those who had died of natural causes. On 1 November, the souls of deceased children (called Laqsq’at’an) are welcomed. Later on 1 November and 2 November the souls of adults are said to return. It is believed that the souls {{come in the form of}} insects to eat the meals laid out in offering. It is also believed that this food needs to be freshly prepared and hot. During the nights, groups of living children go house to house singing traditional songs.|$|E
