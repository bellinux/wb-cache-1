5|$|Colchester made a £200,000 {{offer for}} Jones in June 2007, which was rejected, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> another bid the {{following}} day, {{which was also}} turned down. QPR's West London derby rivals Fulham also bid for him, as did Derby County, who offered £5.75 million for him and teammate Lee Cook. He missed {{the start of the}} 2007–08 season, in the last month of his life, due to a foot injury.|$|E

5|$|Both Conte di Cavour and {{her sister}} ship, , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, where the latter was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers {{attacked}} the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and Conte di Cavour was torpedoed. She was deliberately grounded, with most of her hull underwater, and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. The ship was then captured by the Germans, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> no use of her. She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized seven days later. Conte di Cavour was eventually scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

5|$|The battle around Dak To {{became more}} costly as 4-503 of the 173rd {{was ordered to}} occupy Hill 823, south of Ben Het Camp, for the {{construction}} of Fire Support Base. Only the battalion's Company B was available for the attack, which was borne by helicopter. The company was able to take the hill but suffered 9 dead and 28 wounded. The following morning Bravo Company was relieved by Lieutenant Colonel David J. Schumacher's 1-503, which (against the admonitions of Colonel Livsey) was divided into two small task forces. Task Force Black consisted of Charlie Company supported by two platoons of Dog Company and Task Force Blue which was composed of Alpha Company and the remaining platoon of Dog. Task Force Black left Hill 823 to find the North Vietnamese who had attacked B/4-503. At 08:28 on 11 November, after leaving their overnight laager and following a PAVN communications wire, the force was ambushed by the 8th and 9th Battalions of the 66th PAVN Regiment and had to fight for its life. Task Force Blue drew the job of going to the relief of the beleaguered task force; however, Task Force Blue ran into resistance and was pinned down by enemy fire on all sides. C/4-503 was then assigned the mission of relieving Task Force Black and they too encountered significant enemy fire, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> it, reaching the trapped men at 15:37. U.S. losses were 20 killed, 154 wounded, and two missing.|$|E
25|$|That night, the Union {{officers}} {{realized they}} had less than 24 hours left, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> no attempt to recapture Maryland Heights.

25|$|Northamptonshire Steelbacks batted {{first at}} Bristol. Two quick wickets reduced them to 14 for 2. It {{was a slow}} pitch that was not conducive to a high score, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way to 202 for 7 off their 45 overs, {{thanks in part to}} Damien Wright smashing three sixes in four balls in the {{penultimate}} over, and thanks to Gloucestershire Gladiators dropping three catches.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Greek cities by Philip and Alexander also taught the Greeks that their city-states could never again be powers in their own right, and that the hegemony of Macedon and its {{successor}} states could not be challenged unless the city states united, or at least federated. The Greeks valued their local independence too much to consider actual unification, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> several attempts to form federations through which they could hope to reassert their independence.|$|E
25|$|Caught by {{unexpected}} currents {{the four}} folboats were pushed south of their landing area and came ashore amid a surf break. All boats were swamped and some items of equipment lost, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> it ashore and harboured up until morning. At daybreak they commenced their reconnaissance of the island, soon encountering Japanese who, unbeknownst to them, had found equipment that was washed ashore further along the island. Thus alerted, the island became a hunting ground, with almost 1,000 Japanese {{searching for the}} patrol. Attempts to communicate by radio with the HDML patrol boat failed, as their radios had been swamped and the batteries ruined.|$|E

25|$|In {{their last}} match on 21 August 1997 against Austria {{at the same}} stadium Portugal batted First like the two other matches. But this match Portugal could make a 240/7. Nazir Usman made the highest run of 45, while lower order batsman Daia and G Ramchande made a 39 and 27. They made 72 runs {{partnership}} in the 7th wicket. Austria did well. But they couldn't reached to the destination of 241 in 50 overs. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> a 214 in 46.1 overs. 1st down Batsman A Simpson-Parker made the highest score of Austria's innings.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} conflicts related to the Civil War in California occurred on November 29, 1861, at Minter Ranch, in the hills just south and west of the San Jose Valley, where Warner's Ranch and the military post of Camp Wright was located. Dan Showalter's party of secessionists, like some others, were attempting to avoid the post and make {{their way across the}} desert to join the Confederate Army in Texas. They were pursued from Temecula by a Volunteer Cavalry patrol from the camp, intercepted and captured without shots being fired. Later after being imprisoned at Fort Yuma, Showalter and the others were released after swearing loyalty to the Union, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> their way to the Confederacy later.|$|E
25|$|Orville and Wilbur Wright, {{who made}} {{their home in}} Dayton, had flown {{for the first time}} a decade earlier. They were {{developing}} aviation in their workshop and the area around Huffman Prairie adjacent to the planned Huffman Dam. They had meticulously documented the flight efforts by using a camera and had an extensive collection of photographic plates. The flood caused water damage in their workshop, creating cracks and blemishes on these photographic plates. Prints made from the plates prior to the flood were better quality than the prints made after the flood. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> few prints from the glass negatives before 1913 because the Wrights kept evidence of their pioneering work a secret from the public. Those images lost to flood damage were irreplaceable.|$|E

25|$|In December, Kurt von Schwerin's army {{advanced}} {{through the}} Sudetes into Moravia, occupying the capital at Olmütz on 27 December, while Prince Leopold's army besieged the fortress at Glatz {{on the edge}} of Bohemia. In early 1742, Frederick organized a joint advance through Moravia toward Vienna with the Saxons and French, which began after their forces met on 5 February at Wischau; the French, however, were reluctant and uncooperative, and, after the seizure of Iglau on 15 February, they withdrew into Bohemia. The Prussians and Saxons marched on toward Brünn, the main Austrian stronghold remaining in Moravia, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> little progress due to the substantial Austrian garrison and a shortage of supplies. This Moravian campaign achieved no significant gains, and the effort was finally abandoned on 5 April, after which the Prussians withdrew into Bohemia and Upper Silesia.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{decided to}} {{organize}} them in three-vehicle platoons {{assigned to the}} reconnaissance companies of the four Mobile (Rychlá) Divisions and assigned the extra platoons to support the border areas. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938. After the Munich Agreement two companies of OA vz. 30s were sent to reinforce Slovakia and Ruthenia where {{they were used to}} repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They helped to screen the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938. Ten armored cars, no longer needed once that the border areas had been annexed by Germany and Hungary, were sold to the Gendarmerie in February—March 1939. Two companies defended Carpatho-Ukraine in March 1939 from a Hungarian attack, but were forced to seek refuge in Slovakia and Romania. One OA vz. 30 was captured by the Hungarians during the fighting, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> no known use of it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} semi-final, Super Kings played the Chargers. The Super Kings won the toss and elected to bat first, <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>made</b> slow star from the {{starting}} also {{they lost their}} first three wickets in 29 runs. But later on contributions of 37 and 30 from middle order batsmen Subramaniam Badrinath and skipper Dhoni rescued Super Kings and helped to build up their innings. In later part of the innings a cameo of 24 runs from Srikkanth Anirudha helped Super Kings post a total of 142 for 7 on the board. Ryan Harris took three wickets for 29 runs. To chase down 142, the chargers started very slow. They lost their first wicket at 19 runs with skipper Adam Gilchrist departing after scoring 15 runs. Then they started losing wickets on regular interval. With this going on the Chargers lost all their wickets for 104 run in 19.2 overs. Andrew Symonds scored 23 runs which was the highest in Chargers innings. Super Kings bowler Doug Bollinger took four wickets for 13 runs in 4 over and was also named {{the man of the}} match. Chennai won the match by 38 runs and advanced to the final while Chargers were eliminated from the tournament and had to play the third-place playoff where their opponent was the Royal Challengers.|$|E
