The transition is accompanied by formation of disclination lines which nucleate {{at the edges of}} the cell. The lifetime of the metastable splay-bend state was found to depend on the cell thickness. On heating, anchoring transition from quasi-homeotropic to degenerate tilted alignment in form of circular domains takes place near the transition to the isotropic phase.

Results Comparatively, between the average values obtained for all analysed fatty acids by the two methods based on direct transmethylation without prior extraction no significantly difference was identified (p > 0. 05). The results of fatty acids for the same forage sample were more closely to their average value, being more homogenous for BF 3 /MeOH than HCl/MeOH, because of the better accuracy and repeatability of this method. Method that uses BF 3 /MeOH reagent produces small amounts of interfering compounds than the method using HCl/MeOH reagent, results reflected by the better statistical parameters. Conclusion The fast and non-expensive BF 3 /methanol method was applied with good accuracy and sensitivity for the determination of free or combined fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated) in forage matrix with low fat content from grassland. Also, the final extract obtained by this method, poorer in interfering compounds, is safer to protect the injector and column from contamination with heavy or non-volatile compounds formed by transmethylation reactions. </p...|$|R

In the present study, the anti-obesity activities of BOO and its inhibitory effects on lymphatic triacylglycerol (TAG) absorption were investigated in rats. Methods In Experiment 1, rats were fed either BOO or soybean oil (SO) diet for 6 weeks. In the BOO diet, 20 % of SO was replaced with an experimental oil rich in BOO. In Experiments 2 and 3, rats cannulated in the thoracic duct were administered an emulsions containing trioleoylglycerol (OOO) or an oil mixture (OOO:BOO, 9 : 1). Tri[1 - 14 C]oleoylglycerol (14 C-OOO) was added to the emulsions administered in Experiment 3. Results No observable differences were detected in food intake or body weight gain between the BOO and SO groups in Experiment 1. Plasma and liver TAG concentrations and visceral fat weights were significantly lower in the BOO group than in the SO group. The apparent absorption rate of fat was significantly lower in the BOO group than in the SO group. In Experiment 2, the lymphatic recovery of oleic and <b>behenic</b> <b>acids</b> was significantly lower at 5 and 6 h after BOO administration than after OOO administration.

In contrast to most normal cells, FASN is overexpressed {{in a variety of}} human cancers including cutaneous melanoma, in which its levels of expression are associated with a poor prognosis and depth of invasion. Recently, we have demonstrated the mitochondrial involvement in FASN inhibition-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Herein we compare, via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), free fatty acids (FFA) composition of mitochondria isolated from control (EtOH-treated cells) and Orlistat-treated B 16 -F 10 mouse melanoma cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the ESI-MS data and found to separate the two groups of samples. Mitochondria from control cells showed predominance of six ions, that is, those of m/z 157 (Pelargonic, 9 : 0), 255 (Palmitic, 16 : 0), 281 (Oleic, 18 : 1), 311 (Arachidic, 20 : 0), 327 (Docosahexaenoic, 22 : 6) and 339 (Behenic, 22 : 0). In contrast, FASN inhibition with Orlistat changes significantly mitochondrial FFA composition by reducing synthesis of palmitic acid, and its elongation and unsaturation products, such as arachidic and <b>behenic</b> <b>acids,</b> and oleic acid, respectively. ESI-MS of mitochondria isolated from Orlistat-treated cells presented therefore three major ions of m/z 157 (Pelargonic, 9 : 0), 193 (unknown) and 199 (Lauric, 12 : 0).
