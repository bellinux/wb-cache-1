5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow <b>biosphere,</b> a postulated microbial <b>biosphere</b> of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E
5000|$|No <b>biospheres</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} beyond the Earth; therefore, the existence of extraterrestrial <b>biospheres</b> remains hypothetical. The rare Earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare, save ones composed of microbial life only. On the other hand, Earth analogs may be quite numerous, {{at least in the}} Milky Way galaxy. Three of the planets discovered orbiting TRAPPIST-1 could possibly contain <b>biospheres.</b> [...] Given limited understanding of abiogenesis, it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop <b>biospheres.</b>|$|R

5|$|Polonium-210 is {{widespread}} in the <b>biosphere,</b> including in human tissues, because of {{its position in the}} uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive noble gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earth's surface, thus entering the <b>biosphere,</b> before finally decaying to stable lead-206.|$|E

5|$|The <b>biosphere</b> is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– {{including}} land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the <b>biosphere</b> is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the <b>biosphere.)</b> and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E

5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E

50|$|According to the theory, higher life forms, {{including}} intelligent life, descend ultimately from pre-existing {{life which}} was at least as advanced as the descendants.

5|$|Important {{ecological}} {{regions of}} South India are the Nilgiri <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve, {{located at the}} conjunction of the borders of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the Nilgiri Hills and the Anamalai Hills in the Western Ghats. Bird sanctuaries including Vedanthangal, Ranganathittu, Kumarakom, Neelapattu and Pulicat are home to numerous migratory and local birds. Lakshadweep has been declared a bird sanctuary by the Wildlife Institute of India. Other protected ecological sites include the mangrove forests of Pichavaram in Tamil Nadu, the backwaters of Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu and Vembanad, Ashtamudi, Paravur and Kayamkulam lakes in Kerala. The Gulf of Mannar <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve covers an area of 10,500km² of ocean, islands and the adjoining coastline including coral reefs, salt marshes and mangroves. It is home to Endangered aquatic species including dolphins, dugongs, whales and sea cucumbers.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, UNESCO {{recognized}} Huascarán National Park as a <b>Biosphere</b> Reserve, {{which covers}} the Santa River valley, {{well beyond the}} park's boundaries, encompassing many villages and towns. In 1985 the park was declared a World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|The {{pervasive}} and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response {{the system of}} national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988. India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen <b>biosphere</b> reserves, four of which {{are part of the}} World Network of <b>Biosphere</b> Reserves; twenty-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the <b>biosphere.</b> Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's <b>biosphere.</b>|$|E
