Recently, the term <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> applied in various contexts to identify strategies that experts believe to be clearly superior. For instance, some special education textbooks dedi-cate entire sections to <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> (e. g., Hanson & Lynch, 1989; Wallace, Cohen, 8 c Polloway, 1987), and conference presenters have used the term as a central theme (e. g., Polloway et al., 1990).

For decades he has collaborated closely with his MSU colleagues Wolfgang Bauer and Walter Benenson.

In 1992, they became early adopters of the Internet for teaching and learning by developing the first version of their online homework system. In subsequent years, they were instrumental in creating the LearningOnline Network with CAPA (LON-CAPA), which is now used at more than 70 universities and colleges in the United States and around the world. Since 2008, Bauer and Westfall have been part of a team of instructors, engineers, and physicists, who investigate the use of peer-assisted learning in the introductory physics curriculum.

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{employed}} extensively in environmental management. For example, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> employed in aquaculture such as recommending low-phosphorus feed ingredients, in forestry to manage riparian buffer zones, in livestock and pasture management to regulate stocking rates, and in particular, <b>best</b> management <b>practices</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> important to improving water quality relating to nonpoint source pollution of fertilizers in agriculture {{as well as}} the identification and adoption of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> for controlling salinity. However, in the context of complex environmental problems such as dryland salinity, there are significant challenges in defining what is best in any given context. Best management practice for complex problems is context specific and often contested against a background of imperfect knowledge. In these contexts, it is more useful to think of <b>best</b> management <b>practice</b> as an adaptive learning process rather than a fixed set of rules or guidelines. This approach to <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> focuses on fostering improvements in quality and promoting continuous learning.|$|R
