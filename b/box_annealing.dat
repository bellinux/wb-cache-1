The investigated GO steels for experiments were taken from one industrial line after final cold rolling reduction and subsequent <b>box</b> <b>annealing.</b> It was shown that application of short time heat treatment conditions could lead to complete abnormal grain growth in the investigated GO steel.

Amostras do material nas condiÃÃes laminado a frio, parcialmente recristalizadas a 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615 e 620 ÂC e recozidas a 730 ÂC por 12 horas (recozimento em caixa) foram analisadas quanto Ã microestrutura, textura cristalogrÃfica e perdas magnÃticas por histerese. O material tambÃm foi submetido a tratamentos tÃrmicos para crescimento de grÃo e estes tambÃm foram avaliados com respeito Ã microestrutura e a textura cristalogrÃfica. Os resultados mostraram o inÃcio da recristalizaÃÃo primÃria nas condiÃÃes parcialmente recristalizadas e os tratamentos tÃrmicos para crescimento de grÃo provocaram a ocorrÃncia de recristalizaÃÃo secundÃria. A textura cristalogrÃfica foi modificada pelas condiÃÃes parcialmente recristalizadas, pelo recozimento em caixa e pela recristalizaÃÃo secundÃria. Quanto Ãs perdas magnÃticas por histerese, o recozimento em caixa promoveu uma diminuiÃÃo destas. Non-oriented electrical steels {{are widely used}} {{in the manufacture of}} cores for electric motors being the performance of this equipment affected by the presence of crystallographic texture in these materials. In other hand, the grain size considerably affects the magnetic losses. The crystallographic texture and grain size are greatly influenced by the annealing process performed after cold rolling of these steels. Annealing promotes recrystallization in the microstructure of the material which is closely related with the crystallographic texture. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the influence of recrystallization on the evolution of crystallographic texture and hysteresis magnetic losses by in non-oriented grain electrical steel with 1. 28 % Si that was cold rolled with reductions of 50 and 70 % in an industrial plant. Samples of the material in the conditions cold rolled and partially recrystallized at 580, 585, 590, 595, 600, 605, 610, 615 and 620 ÂC and annealed at 730 ÂC for 12 hours (<b>box</b> <b>annealing)</b> were analyzed in the aspects of microstructure, crystallographic texture and magnetic hysteresis losses. The material was also subjected to heat treatment for grain growth and they were also evaluated with respect to the microstructure and crystallographic texture. The results showed the evolution of primary recrystallization and also the microstructure and texture when the material is subjected to final heat treatment that promotes grain growth and secondary recrystallization.

40|$|Strain {{localization}} {{is inevitable}} during the rolling process and this manifests itself most clearly in ferrite by {{the formation of}} shear bands and deformation and transition bands. Nucleation of recrystallisation is strongly associated with these microstructures {{and it is clear}} that nucleation is a process of subgrain growth out of these features. In this work it is shown that the γ fibre component of the rolling texture is most prone to strain localization, and that the rotation of materials in the shear bands and deformation bands is around /ND, which gives rise to the { 111 } rolling texture. For shear band and deformation band nuclei to dominate the final texture it is necessary to break the recrystallisation process into two stages, nucleation by growth of subgrains, and "impingement growth" of strings of small grains allowing invasion of all other material. The impingement growth provides, in effect, a super-nucleus, and these comprise strings of { 111 } recrystallised material in cold and warm rolled IF steel, and also in a low carbon steel alloy suitable for <b>box</b> <b>annealing.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The main process {{variable}} examined was {{the rate of}} heating to the annealing temperature. Interactions between precipitates, nuclei, and migrating grain boundaries resulted {{in a range of}} recrystallization textures in the Fe-Cu alloy from almost random after rapid heating to well-defined textures after slower heating rates. The most noticeable variation was in the amount of near- left brace 100 right brace orientation, which was very low in a simulated <b>box</b> <b>anneal,</b> but which was strong when the heating programme involved holding at a temperature high in the recovery range. The observed differences in recrystallization textures are ascribed to the heterogeneous precipitation of Cu and to different nucleation processes for near- left brace 111 right brace and near- left brace 100 right brace grains. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{implantation}} dose, energy, and annealing {{conditions on the}} microstructure and the formation and evolution of defects in the low-dose, low-energy SIMOX materials were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The quality of top Si layer and buried oxide layer (BOX) was also characterized with the electrical measurements. From the structural characterization of 100 keV implanted samples, {{it was found that}} the optimum dose window to form a continuous <b>BOX</b> layer after <b>annealing</b> was 3. 0 to 3. 5 x 10 ¹⁷ O⁺/cm². In addition, the formation mechanisms of dislocations and stacking faults in SIMOX materials were also proposed. The Hg-based pseudo-MOSFET technique was a very effective in-situ technique to evaluate the electrical quality of low-dose low-energy SIMOX. Based on the comparisons of device parameters of low-dose low-energy SIMOX and commercial SIMOX samples, we found that the quality of top Si layer of SIMOX sample prepared at 100 keV with a dose of 3. 5 x 10 ¹⁷ O⁺/cm² was excellent. However, the interface properties (interfacial trap density) needed to be improved. The dielectric quality of low-dose low-energy SIMOX evaluated by breakdown voltage measurements showed a strong dependency on the microstructure of samples...|$|R
30|$|A slurry {{of excess}} PbCl 2 in OLA (1 : 2 molar ratio) was {{prepared}} at 100 °C under {{a flow of}} N 2. The temperature was increased to 120 °C for 30  min. At the same time, elemental sulfur was dissolved in OLA (0.1 : 0.2 molar ratio) at 80 °C over 30  min. The sulfur-OLA solution {{was added to the}} PbCl 2 -OLA slurry, and the temperature was raised to the growth temperature of 100 °C and held there for 30  min. The mixture was then removed and quenched by pouring into cold toluene. OA was added to the PbS CQD suspension (20 : 3 volume ratio) at room temperature to exchange the OLA ligands for OA. The suspension was ultrasonicated and then centrifuged to remove the excess PbCl 2. Ethanol was added to the retained supernatant to precipitate the quantum dots. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, the precipitate was redispersed in toluene, and ethanol was added. The PbS CQDs containing OA ligands were isolated by centrifugation. Treatment with a methanol solution of CTAB was used to exchange OA ligands for the Br- ones in the PbS CQD solid films using layer-by-layer spin coating. A three-step spin coating cycle was used: (1) 50  mg/mL of the PbS CQD solution was spin-coated, (2) 0.5  mL of the CTAB methanol solution was coated onto the PbS CQD solid films, and (3) the films were washed with methanol. Experiments were conducted at room temperature in air and without annealing during the ligand exchange process. This spin coating cycle was repeated seven times. OA-treated PbS CQD solid films, on the other hand, were made by simply spin coating PbS CQDs seven times, without using the other steps. Solution-processed ZnO thin films were spin-coated onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and annealed at 500 °C for 4  h. The two types of PbS CQD solid films were then deposited. Chlorobenzene dispersions of P 3 HT and PCBM were spin-coated onto PbS CQD solid films in an argon-filled glove <b>box</b> and <b>annealed</b> at 120 °C for 10  min. Layers of MoO 3 (3  nm) and Au (100  nm) were deposited onto the active layer by thermal evaporation.|$|R
30|$|All {{chemicals}} {{were purchased}} from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The precursor solution of IGZO:Eu 3 + was prepared by dissolving {{zinc acetate dihydrate}} (Zn(CH 3 CO 2) 2 · 2 H 2 O), gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO 3) 3 ·x H 2 O), and indium nitrate hydrate (In(NO 3) 3 ·x H 2 O) in 2 -methoxyethanol (2 -ME) solvent. The precursors were mixed at an millimolar concentration of In/Ga/Zn/Eu = 0.045 : 0.0125 : 0.0275 : 0.02 in the final oxide films. Then, 2.0 M of monoethanolamine (MEA) was added as a sol stabilizer, and acetic acid CH 3 COOH was dropped to make a homogeneous solution while stirring. After vigorously stirring at 80 °C for 5 h, the IGZO:Eu 3 + sol was subsequently aged for 1 day before spin coating. The IGZO:Eu 3 + thin films were spin-coated on the substrates (0.7 -mm-thick glass) with spin rotation speeds of 3, 000 rpm for 30 s. The light-induced photochemical treatment was performed using a high-density ultraviolet treatment (254 nm) in N 2 atmosphere inside the glove <b>box.</b> Upon UV <b>annealing</b> process, the radiant thermal energy of UV lamp increases the surface temperature of the substrate to 110 °C to 120 °C. The output energy intensity of the lamp was 20 to 23 mW cm− 2. The total energy delivered to the sample surface is calculated to be approximately 125 J cm− 2. For comparative investigation, the as-spun films were thermally annealed at 500 °C for 1 h.|$|R
