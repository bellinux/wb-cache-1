Entanglement can involve floating rope or lines used to connect pots/traps along the ocean bottom (i. e. groundline). One modification to reduce entanglement in groundline is to lower the profile of groundline to the ocean bottom {{through the use of}} sinking/neutrally <b>buoyant</b> <b>line.</b> An alternative gear modification that has been suggested is lowering the profile of groundline to a specified height above the ocean bottom in certain rock, coral or wreck areas where sinking/neutrally <b>buoyant</b> <b>line</b> has been reported to be operationally infeasible. NMFS and others are presently researching “low profile ” groundline issues. Further information is needed on various aspects including what is know about prey distribution, as well as large whale distribution and behaviour, to help assist in discussions regarding “low profile ” groundline. Further specifics are needed on areas and circumstances that make the use of sinking/neutrally buoyant groundline not operationally feasible. Research updates and suggestions on the methods for reducing the profile of groundline are also needed. NMFS has stated previously that considerations for “low profile ” lin...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{laboratory}} {{study indicates that}} a turbulent <b>buoyant</b> <b>line</b> plume discharging into a rotating strati-fied fluid provides a natural mechanism for generating a series of anticyclonic geostrophic vortices [Bush and Woods 1999]. Here we examine {{the implications of these}} experimental results {{in the context of the}} thermohaline convection which develops when saline water is released as leads freeze over in the polar oceans. Using the exper-imental results in conjunction with a simple numerical model of plume dynamics in a non-uniformly stratified environment, we develop a model which characterizes the geometry of the eddies which would develop owing to lead-induced convection. The model predicts that, in the absence of strong currents, lead-induced thermoha-line convection may generate anticyclonic geostrophic vortices of characteristic radius 2 - 10 km at the base of the mixed layer; however, this mechanism cannot account for the arctic eddies observed at substantial depths beneath the mixed layer, cyclonic, or strongly ageostrophic eddies...|$|E

50|$|Divers {{should be}} well trained in general diving skills before {{attempting}} {{this type of}} search. The search diver is responsible for maintaining sufficient tension on the search line so the signals can be transmitted and received.

This is easiest if a reel is used to control the line, or alternatively the <b>line</b> should be <b>buoyant,</b> to keep it as far from the divers as possible, but <b>buoyant</b> <b>lines</b> will still tend to wrap around the shotline in the centre if there is enough slack.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation of the generation of coherent vortical structures by <b>buoyant</b> <b>line</b> plumes in rotating fluids. Both uniform and strati ed ambients are considered. By combining the scalings describing turbulent plumes and geostrophically balanced vortices, we develop a simple model which predicts the scale of the coherent vortical structures in excellent accord with laboratory experiments. We examine the motion induced by a constant buoyancy flux per unit length B, released for a nite time ts, from a source of length L into a fluid rotating with angular speed Ω = f= 2. When the plume discharges into a uniformly stratied environment characterized by a constant Brunt{Väisäla ̈ frequency, N> f, the fluid rises to its level of neutral buoyancy unaected by the system rotation before intruding as a gravity current. Rotation has a strong impact on the subsequent dynamics: shear develops across the spreading neutral cloud which eventually goes unstable, breaking into a chain of anticyclonic lenticular vortices. The number of vortices n emerging from the instability of the neutral cloud, n = (0 : 65 0 : 1) Lf 1 = 2 =(t 1 = 2 s B 1 = 3), is independent of the ambient stratication, which serves only to prescribe the intrusion height and aspect ratio of the resulting vortex structures. The experiments indicate that the Prandtl ratio characterizing the geostrophic vortices is given by P = Nh=(fR) = 0 : 47 0 : 12; where h and R are, respectively, the half-height and radius of the vortices. The lenticular vortices may merge soon after formation, but are generally stable and persist until they are spun-down by viscous eects. When the fluid is homogeneous, the plume fluid rises until it impinges on a free surface. The nature of the flow depends critically on the relative magnitudes of the layer depth H and the rotational lengthscale Lf =...|$|E

[...] Webster added, [...] "In a sense she did not compete, but found in John Donne's serene musing on death the basis for another mood, another kind of music. That was an impressive achievement, for her music stayed in the ear, even after Verdi's titanic immersion in emotion and color." [...] Reviewing a later recording of the piece, Olivia Giovetti of WQXR-FM similarly wrote: In Jennifer Higdon's album-opening On the Death of the Righteous, you hear echoes of Verdian splendor with Britten-like modesty, unsurprising on both counts as Higdon wrote the work to accompany the former's Requiem and set it to the text of John Donne, a favorite source material for the latter.

40|$|Abstract: The reef-building coral Acropora cervicornis was a {{dominant}} ecosystem element on the Caribbean reef until the 1980 s, when it declined by some 97 % due primarily to anthropogenic ecosystem changes and disease. This branching species expanded its colony footprint and achieved local dominance largely through fragmentation and regrowth, thus is suited to nursery culture towards restoration. In this experiment, fragments of Acropora cervicornis of four lineages or genets were followed and measured {{for growth and}} health over 12 months in 2006 and 2007 on <b>buoyant</b> drop-loop <b>line</b> nurseries at one shallow and one deep fore-reef site in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Sixty-five of these corals were then out-planted to wild reef sites of similar depth and condition to their respective nurseries and monitored photographically for 11 months through 2007 and 2008. A period of rapid death {{was seen in the}} out-planted material at both sites over the first four months, followed by a period of relative stability or recuperation. Hermodice carunculata predation was the primary problem in the shallow fore-reef, and was combined with a banding syndrome at the deeper site. This syndrome was noted in the samples prior to planting, during a one week storage period on the seafloor. Continued slow decline occurred in the subsequent seven months in the shallow fore-reef site; however, regrowth was noted in the deeper site in the remaining material.

40|$|A new buoyant jet {{model is}} {{presented}} in this thesis to simulate the trajectory and dilution of a fluid from a single port or line source. The new features include: A generalised derivation of the governing equations so that buoyant jets discharged from a source of any shape can be modelled within the one framework, {{and the effects of}} high-frequency internal waves on the motion of the buoyant jet. Past buoyant jet models were constructed for specific cases and their application is necessarily restricted. In this thesis, a new model is developed in a Lagrangian framework that can be applied to buoyant jet discharges at any angle into ambient waters that may be stratified or unstratified, flowing or stagnant. The model is validated using both laboratory and field data. Furthermore, the model is applicable to the continuous discharge of a <b>buoyant</b> jet from <b>line,</b> axisymmetric or elliptic sources and to the instantaneous discharge of a spherical puff. No previously published model is capable of unifying and solving all of these problems within the one framework. Transforming the governing equations to their non-dimensional form shows that the trajectory and dilution of discharges from line or axisymmetric sources or of spherical puffs into a flowing, stratified ambient environment are uniquely specified using three parameters. These are: the non-dimensional size of the outlet port, the relative importance of the initial fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, and the number of orthogonal planes through which entrainment can occur. This is a significant advance in the understanding of the processes affecting buoyant jets. When high-frequency internal waves are present in the receiving waters they can have significant effects on the buoyant jet. These effects are incorporated into the present model. Using data obtained from an experiment conducted off Sydney the effects of internal waves on the height of rise and dilution of the buoyant jet were found to exceed a factor of two. Consequently, {{it is important that the}} effects of internal waves (when present) be incorporated into any buoyant jet model...|$|R
40|$|This thesis covers four {{different}} {{problems in the}} understanding of vortex sheets, and these are presented in four chapters. In Chapter 1, free streamline theory is used to determine the steady solutions of an array of identical, hollow or stagnant core vortices in an inviscid, incompressible fluid. Assuming the array is symmetric to rotation through π radians about an axis through any vortex centre, there are two solutions or no solutions depending on whether A^(1 / 2) /L is less than or greater than 0. 38 where A is the area of the vortex and L is the separation distance. Stability analysis shows that the more deformed shape is unstable to infinitesimal symmetric disturbances which leave the centres of the vortices undisplaced. Chapter 2 is concerned with the roll-up of vortex sheets in homogeneous fluid. The flow over conventional and ring wings is used to test the method of Fink and Soh (1974). Despite modifications which improve the accuracy of the method, unphysical results occur. A possible explanation for this is that small scales are important and an alternate method based on "Cloud-in-Cell" techniques is introduced. The results show small scale growth and amalgamation into larger structures. The motion of a <b>buoyant</b> pair of <b>line</b> vortices of opposite circulation is considered in Chapter 3. The density difference between the fluid carried by the vortices and the fluid outside is considered small, so that the Boussinesq approximation may be used. A macroscopic model is developed which shows the formation of a detrainment filament and this is included as a modification to the model. The results agree well with the numerical solution as developed by Hill (1975 b) and show that after an initial slowdown, the vortices begin to accelerate downwards. Chapter 4 reproduces completely a paper that has already been published (Baker, Barker, Bofah and Saffman (1974)) on the effect of "vortex wandering" on the measurement of velocity profiles of the trailing vortices behind a wing. ...|$|R
