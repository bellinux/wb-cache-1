25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E

Along these lines, the naval historian David Cordingly categorized pirate attacks that had been reported along the North American seabord between 17101730. by the numbers of recorded attacks, with an overwhelming 55% involving sloops, 25% in the larger ships, 10% in brigs and brigantines, 5% in schooners, 3% in open sail-less boats, and 2% in snows.|$|E
