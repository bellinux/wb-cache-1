50|$|Neurotoxicity {{does not}} {{increase}} down {{the series of}} para-halogenated amphetamine derivatives, even though serotonin releasing potency does follow this trend. For example, 4-iodoamphetamine is less toxic than is 4-chloroamphetamine. Hence, this property {{is not related to}} serotonin releasing potency as such, since PAL-287 was reported to be not at all neurotoxic even though it is a powerful 5-HT releasing agent. It is unclear where 4-methylamphetamine fits in on the neurotoxicity scale. The extensive serotonergic neurotoxicity of 4-chloroamphetamine (and its <b>brominated</b> <b>derivative),</b> and the increased serotonergic toxicity of 4-methylamphetamine suggest that para-substitution seems to increase overall serotonergic (neuro)toxicity, compared to amphetamine.

The diastereo- and regioselectivity of nucleophilic attack, using sodium methylmercaptan, on the Baylis-Hillman products and selected <b>brominated</b> <b>derivatives</b> was investigated. The allylic hydroxy compounds favour conjugate addition with the generation of a new chiral centre, while the allylic bromo derivatives favour substitution (SN and SN) with consequent loss of chirality.

40|$|Disinfection {{byproducts}} (DBPs) {{are formed}} when disinfectants used in water treatment plants (WTPs) react with natural (or anthropogenic) organic matter {{present in the}} source water. Many studies have addressed health risks posed by a life-time exposure to DBPs through chlorinated drinking water or through dermal or inhalation exposure routes. Experimental studies have revealed genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of some DBPs and epidemiological studies evidenced potential associations between chlorinated drinking water and bladder or colorectal cancer. In addition, a possible link between chlorinated drinking water and reproductive/developmental effects has been hypothesized. 	Many DBPs {{have been identified in}} chlorinated water, which justifies the growing concern about the potential health effects of emerging unregulated DBPs, some of which appear to be more genotoxic, in some assays, than the regulated DBPs. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most persistent contaminants detected in environmental samples such as river sediments and tap water. A few studies have already proven that water disinfection can lead to the formation of halogenated derivatives of PAHs, such as chlorinated (Cl-PAHs) and brominated PAHs (Br-PAHs). The available toxicological studies have shown that these compounds possess, in general, greater mutagenicity than the corresponding parent PAHs. Our investigation group have also showed that exposure of HepG 2 cells to a dose-range of 6 -Cl-benzo[a]pyrene (6 -Cl-BaP) and BaP resulted in cytotoxicity above 50 µM and that, at the equimolar doses of 100 and 125 µM, 6 -Cl-BaP was able to induce a significantly higher level of DNA damage than BaP. 	The present study had two main objectives: 1) identification of the major chlorinated and <b>brominated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of benzo[a]anthracene (BaA) and pyrene (Pyr) formed as disinfection by-products and 2) evaluation of their potential hazard to humans, through the characterization of their potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in a human cell line. To synthesize Cl-PAHs and Br-PAHs the method of Mitchell was developed for BaA and Pyr. 1 -Cl-Pyr and 1 -Br-Pyr were obtained as the major chlorinated and <b>brominated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of Pyr, and 7 -Cl-BaA and 7 -Br-BaA as the reaction products of BaA. Cell viability and DNA integrity of those derivatives were assessed by the neutral red uptake (NR) and the comet assay, respectively, allowing the comparison of their genotoxic potential. Although health risks of DBPs are small compared to the health risks of waterborne diseases, the formation of hazardous halogenated-PAHs in chlorinated water water emphasizes the need of development of new and safer water disinfection methods.

40|$|International audienceWe {{theoretically}} {{describe in}} this work the n-type semiconducting behavior {{of a set of}} bis(arylene-ethynylene) -s-tetrazines ((ArCC) (2) Tz), by comparing their electronic properties with those of their parent diaryl-s-tetrazines (Ar(2) Tz) after the introduction of ethynylene bridges. The significantly reduced internal reorganization energy for electron transfer is ascribed to an extended delocalization of the LUMO for (ArCC) (2) Tz as opposite to that for Ar(2) Tz, which was described mostly localized on the s-tetrazine ring. The largest electronic coupling and the corresponding electron transfer rates found for bis(phenyl-ethynylene) -s-tetrazine, as well as for some halogenated derivatives, are comparable to those reported for the best performing n-type organic semiconductor materials such as diimides and perylenes. The theoretical mobilities for the studied compounds turn out to be in the range 0. 3 - 1. 3 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1), close to values experimentally determined for common n-type organic semiconductors used in real devices. In addition, ohmic contacts can be expected when these compounds are coupled to metallic cathodes such as Na, Ca, and Sm. For these reasons, the future application of semiconducting bis(phenyl-ethynylene) -s-tetrazine and its fluorinated and <b>brominated</b> <b>derivatives</b> in optoelectronic devices is envisioned...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{has proved}} to be an {{excellent}} material for nanoscale construction because complementary DNA duplexes are programmable and structurally predictable. However, in the absence of Watson– Crick pairings, DNA can be structurally more di-verse. Here, we describe the crystal structures of d(ACTCGGATGAT) and the <b>brominated</b> <b>derivative,</b> d(ACBrUCGGABrUGAT). These oligonucleotides form parallel-stranded duplexes with a crystallographi-cally equivalent strand, resulting in the first examples of DNA crystal structures that contains four differ-ent symmetric homo base pairs. Two of the parallel-stranded duplexes are coaxially stacked in opposite directions and locked together to form a tetraplex through intercalation of the 5 ′-most A–A base pairs between adjacent G–G pairs in the partner duplex. The intercalation region is a new type of DNA ter-tiary structural motif with similarities to the i-motif. 1 H– 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and native gel electrophoresis confirmed the formation of a parallel-stranded duplex in solution. Finally, we modified spe-cific nucleotide positions and added d(GAY) motifs to oligonucleotides and were readily able to obtain simi-lar crystals. This suggests that this parallel-stranded DNA structure may be useful in the rational design of DNA crystals and nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the B-DNA hexamer d(CTCGAG) has been solved at 1. 9 A resolution by iterative single isomorphous replacement, using the <b>brominated</b> <b>derivative</b> d(CG 5 BrCGAG), and refined to an R-factor of 18. 6 % for 120 nonhydrogen nucleic acid atoms and 32 water molecules. Although the central four base pairs form a typical B-form helix, several parameters suggest a transition to an A-like conformation at the termini. Based on this observation, a B-to-A transition was modeled, maintaining efficient base stacking across the junction. The wide minor groove (approximately 6. 9 A) is reminiscent {{of that in the}} side-by-side double drug-DNA complexes and hosts a double spine of hydration. The global helix axes of the pseudo-continuous helices are at an acute angle of 60 degrees. The pseudocontinuous stacking is reinforced by the minor groove water structure extending between the two duplexes. The crossover point of two pairs of stacked duplexes is at the stacking junction, unlike that observed in the B-DNA decamers and dodecamers. This arrangement may have implications for the structure of a four-way DNA junction.
