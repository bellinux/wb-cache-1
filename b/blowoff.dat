5|$|Forsythe Racing {{teammates}} Tagliani and Carpentier rounded {{out the top}} ten qualifiers; Carpentier was {{hampered by}} an electrical problem which overheated his engine {{and was unable to}} improve his time when his <b>blowoff</b> valve opened {{between the first and second}} turns. Adrián Fernández was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was more than two-tenths of a second slower than Bräck. Fittipaldi's car developed a large amount of oversteer and reduced his pace in turn four and he took 12th. Jimmy Vasser and Oriol Servià took the 13th and 14th positions; Servià's car had oversteer after his first timed lap and drove into the pit lane where his crew made adjustments allowing him to drive faster for his second attempt. Nakano, 15th, had a large amount of understeer which slowed him in turn four. Dixon moved from his back-up car to his primary vehicle for qualifying and took 16th. Manning worked on his race setup but gearbox issues before the session prevented his team from focusing on a qualifying tune and he qualified in 17th. Mario Domínguez and Jourdain completed the qualifiers; Jourdain reduced his speed through the third and fourth turns after he oversteered and his slower pace prevented him from spinning.|$|E
25|$|The GT-EX {{replaced}} the discontinued GT-R with a turbocharged engine, the L20ET. As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of <b>blowoff</b> valve, only an emergency pressure release valve. As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|E

50|$|Some steam tunnels have dirt floors, poor {{lighting}} and temperatures upwards of 45 C. Others have concrete floors, bright light, and more moderate temperatures. Most steam tunnels have large intake fans {{to bring in}} fresh air and push the hot air out the back, and these fans may start without warning. Most active steam tunnels do not contain airborne asbestos, but proper breathing protection may be required for other respiratory hazards. Experienced explorers are very cautious inside active utility tunnels, since pipes can spew boiling hot water or steam from leaky valves or pressure relief <b>blowoffs.</b> Frequently there are puddles of muddy water on the floor, making slips and falls a special concern near hot pipes.|$|R

Laser power densities near 10 to the 11 th/sq cm on solid targets generate thermalized plasma plumes which drift to a 15 -kV gridded extraction gap where the ions are extracted, accelerated, and electrostatically focused; the spatially defined ion beams are then magnetically analyzed to determine the charge state content in the beams formed from carbon, aluminum, copper, and lead targets.

2500|$|Mould and Hart have {{produced}} solo albums and formed the bands Sugar and Nova Mob, respectively. Mould also joined Richard Morel {{in the band}} <b>Blowoff.</b> [...] In 2005, {{after several years of}} eschewing playing shows with an electric band, Mould returned to touring with a band and included Hüsker Dü and Sugar songs in his sets. [...] His album Silver Age, which came soon after the reissue of Sugar's two full-length albums in 2012, was widely acclaimed as a return to form. Mould's backing band currently features Jason Narducy (Verbow, Split Single) and Jon Wurster (Superchunk, The Mountain Goats) on bass and drums, respectively. [...] Norton formed the band Grey Area, played with Shotgun Rationale, and became a chef. He and his ex-wife Sarah owned a restaurant in Red Wing, Minnesota, called The Nortons', until 2010. In addition to his restaurant duties, in 2006 Norton returned to music as the bassist for the Minnesota-based band The Gang Font, featuring Interloper. The group released an eponymous album in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2002, {{he began}} running a monthly dance event in Washington, DC with friend and veteran punk/alternative/indie icon Bob Mould, titled <b>Blowoff.</b> The <b>Blowoff</b> dance event {{was so popular}} that it spurred <b>Blowoff</b> events in other cities such as New York City, Chicago, and San Diego. <b>Blowoff</b> is also {{the name of an}} {{electronic}} duo that Morel and Mould have been recording an album under.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>blowoff</b> valve, (sometimes [...] "hooter valve" [...] or BOV) {{performs}} the same task but releases the {{air into the}} atmosphere instead of recirculating it. This type of valve is typically an aftermarket modification. The <b>blowoff</b> action produces a range of distinctive hissing sounds, depending on the exit design. Some <b>blowoff</b> valves are sold with a trumpet-shaped exit that intentionally amplifies the sound. Some turbocharged vehicle owners may purchase a <b>blowoff</b> valve solely for the auditory effect even when the function is not required by normal engine operation. Motor sports governed by the FIA have made it illegal to vent unmuffled <b>blowoff</b> valves to the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blowoff</b> valve is {{connected}} by a vacuum hose to the intake manifold after the throttle plate. When the throttle is closed, the relative manifold pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the resulting pressure differential operates the <b>blowoff</b> valve's piston. The excess pressure from the turbocharger is then vented into the atmosphere or recirculated into the intake upstream of the compressor inlet.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} method for utilizing both a MAF and a <b>blowoff</b> valve {{is to have}} the MAF located down stream between the intercooler and the throttle plate. This is known as Blow-through rather than the traditional Draw-through set up. Care must be taken as to the position of the MAF to prevent damage to the sensitive element. For example, on a SR20DET engine, the MAF must be at least 12" [...] from the throttle plate, and the <b>blowoff</b> valve must be 6" [...] from the MAF sensor. By using a blow-through method, the MAF won't be affected by the <b>blowoff</b> valve opening as the pressure is vented before the air reaches the MAF.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blowoff</b> valve (BOV), {{dump valve}} or {{compressor}} bypass valve (CBV) is a pressure release system present in most turbocharged engines.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his solo work, Mould also worked as a live DJ in collaboration with Washington DC-area dance music artist Richard Morel, under the collective banner <b>Blowoff.</b> They frequently staged at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. A <b>Blowoff</b> CD was released in September 2006, consisting of songs recorded together by the two. Mould has also done remixes {{for a variety of}} dance and alternative rock artists, including a remix of the Interpol song [...] "Length of Love." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A typical piston-type dump valve, used in auto racing. Unlike a <b>blowoff</b> valve, {{this one}} does not vent to the atmosphere. The small hose at the top is a feed from the intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|This {{pressure}} wave can cause major problems, from {{noise and vibration}} to pipe collapse. It is possible to reduce {{the effects of the}} water hammer pulses with accumulators, expansion tanks, surge tanks, <b>blowoff</b> valves, and other features.|$|E
50|$|Some {{military}} diving rebreathers have a diffuser {{over the}} <b>blowoff</b> valve, which helps {{to conceal the}} diver's presence by masking the release of bubbles, by breaking them up to sizes which are less easily detected. A diffuser also reduces bubble noise.|$|E
50|$|Often a match {{will take}} place under {{additional}} rules, usually serving as a special attraction or a climactic point in a feud or storyline. Sometimes {{this will be the}} culmination of an entire feud, ending it for the immediate future (known as a <b>blowoff</b> match).|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} where a mass airflow sensor (MAF) is used and is located {{upstream}} from the <b>blowoff</b> valve, the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements. The engine then briefly operates with a fuel-rich mixture after each valve actuation.|$|E
50|$|Both gel and AGM {{designs are}} sealed, {{do not require}} watering, {{can be used in}} any orientation, and use a valve for gas <b>blowoff.</b> For this reason, both designs can be called {{maintenance}} free, sealed and VRLA. However, it is quite common to find resources stating that these terms refer to one or another of these designs, specifically.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, a [...] "Technical Update" [...] {{was applied}} to the N63, {{resulting}} in the N63TU variants (also known as N63B44O1). The main upgrade was the addition of Valvetronic. Other changes include revised turbochargers, removal of the <b>blowoff</b> valve, lighter pistons, forged conrods and crankshaft, addition of an oil catch can system, revised fuel system and addition of a second coolant pump.|$|E
50|$|Dealkalizers {{are most}} often used as {{pre-treatment}} to a boiler and are usually preceded by a water softener. Alkalinity is a factor that most often dictates the amount of boiler blowdown. High alkalinity promotes boiler foaming and carryover and causes high amounts of boiler <b>blowoff.</b> When alkalinity is the limiting factor affecting the amount of blowdown, a dealkalizer will increase the cycles of concentrations and reduce blowdown and operating costs.|$|E
50|$|The engine has a 14-stage axial-flow compressor, {{producing}} compression ratios between 9:1 to 13:1 {{depending on}} altitude, also controlled by variable {{inlet guide vanes}} and <b>blowoff</b> valves. The combustion system used is a cannular-type: each flame tube is centrally mounted on a downstream injector that ends in an annular secondary region. The contra-rotating propellers and compressor are driven by the five-stage axial turbine. Mass flow is 65 kg (143 lb) per second.|$|E
50|$|His next solo album, Body of Song, {{had been}} {{originally}} scheduled to closely follow {{the release of}} 2002's Modulate. Instead, Mould worked on the album {{for the next three}} years, resulting in a 2005 release. By this time, he had changed his mind on touring with a band, and announced his first band tour since 1998. The tour lineup included bassist Jason Narducy (of Verbow), drummer Brendan Canty (of Fugazi), and Mould's <b>Blowoff</b> collaborator, Morel, on keyboards.|$|E
50|$|Bottom {{blowdown}} piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a <b>blowoff</b> tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the <b>blowoff</b> tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the sealing valve, and the other as the blowdown valve. The sealing valve is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces. Care is taken to avoid trapping scale or rust particles within the valve by reopening a valve to flush the particles through if resistance is encountered when attempting to close it. Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|On {{turbocharged}} {{internal combustion}} engines, a fluid hammer {{can take place}} when the throttle is closed while the turbocharger is forcing air into the engine. A pressure relief valve placed before the throttle prevents the air from surging against the throttle body by diverting it elsewhere, thus protecting the turbocharger from pressure damage. This valve can either recirculate the air into the turbocharger's intake (recirculation valve), or it can blow the air into the atmosphere and produce the distinctive hiss-flutter of an aftermarket turbocharger (<b>blowoff</b> valve).|$|E
5000|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, such testing has been carried out in non-nuclear form. One such test style uses silver acetylide-silver nitrate composition (SASN) explosives deposited in a thin layer on the outside of a W76s re-entry vehicle and detonated using an intense flash of light. SASN is an atypical chemical explosive that releases heat, without very much gaseous products. The resulting uniform blast of moderate intensity emulates the [...] "cold x-ray <b>blowoff</b> impulse generated by an exo-atmospheric hostile nuclear encounter".|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic of {{the stages}} of {{inertial}} confinement fusion using lasers. The blue arrows represent radiation; orange is blowoff; purple is inwardly transported thermal energy.1. Laser beams or laser-produced X-rays rapidly heat {{the surface of the}} fusion target, forming a surrounding plasma envelope.2. Fuel is compressed by the rocket-like <b>blowoff</b> of the hot surface material.3. During the final part of the capsule implosion, the fuel core reaches 20 times the density of lead and ignites at 100,000,000 ˚C.4. Thermonuclear burn spreads rapidly through the compressed fuel, yielding many times the input energy.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} {{outdated}} methods of boost control, such as intake restriction or bleed off. For instance, {{it is possible}} to install a large butterfly valve in the intake to restrict airflow as desired boost is approached. It is also possible to actually release large amounts of already compressed air similar to a <b>blowoff</b> valve but on a constant basis to maintain desired boost at the intake manifold. The currently popular exhaust gas bypass via wastegate is quite superior if compared to creating intake restriction or wasting energy by releasing air that has already been compressed. These methods are rarely used in modern system due to the large sacrifices in efficiency, heat, and reliability.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of any ICF device is to rapidly heat the outer layers of a [...] "target", {{normally}} a small plastic sphere containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of deuterium and tritium. The heat burns the plastic into a plasma, which explodes off the surface. Due to Newton's Third Law, the remaining portion of the target is driven inwards, eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid <b>blowoff</b> also creates a shock wave that travels towards {{the center of the}} compressed fuel. When it meets itself {{in the center of the}} fuel, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot is raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.|$|E

50|$|Next, Chris Benoit {{defended his}} Intercontinental Championship against Chris Jericho in a ladder match, {{which was to}} serve as the <b>blowoff</b> to their longstanding on-and-off rivalry. Both men {{performed}} a number of attacks and maneuvers on one another in an attempt to disable their opponent long enough to climb the ladder and retrieve the title belt suspended above the ring. At one point in the match, Benoit dove through the ropes headfirst at Jericho, but Jericho struck him in the face with a steel chair. Jericho also applied the Walls of Jericho {{at the top of the}} ladder onto Benoit. The end of the match came when Jericho pushed over the ladder while Benoit was ascending it, causing Benoit to fall out to the outside of the ring. Jericho then climbed the ladder and retrieved the Intercontinental Championship belt.|$|E
50|$|After {{settling}} into {{a new home in}} Washington, DC and furthering his interest in club music by forming the monthly <b>Blowoff</b> event with friend and dance music artist Richard Morel, Mould began writing new guitar-based material in 2004, often trying out new songs on audiences when giving solo vocal-and-guitar performances in clubs all over the United States. After reviving four of the recordings from the 2002 album sessions, Mould began writing and recording material in his home studio setup in his DC home, then went into DCs venerated Inner Ear Studio in March 2005 with Fugazi drummer/Garland Of Hours multi-instrumentalist Brendan Canty and Inner Ears owner/engineer Don Zientara (who worked on most of the Dischord Records catalog, including Fugazi and Minor Threat) and cut several new songs. Cantys occasional Fugazi collaborator and Garland Of Hours bandmate Amy Domingues was tapped to contribute cello to two songs on the album.|$|E
