5|$|The Last of Us: Left <b>Behind</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{video game}} developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released worldwide for the PlayStation 3 on February 14, 2014, as a downloadable expansion pack to The Last of Us; it was later bundled with The Last of Us Remastered, {{an updated version of}} the game released for the PlayStation 4 on July 29, 2014, and was released as a standalone expansion pack for both consoles on May 12, 2015. Players control Ellie, a young girl who spends time with her friend Riley after her unexpected return, within a post-apocalyptic world.|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E

5|$|The Last of Us: Left <b>Behind</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the basic {{gameplay}} of The Last of Us. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat {{is the ability to}} focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.|$|E

25|$|A goal umpire judges {{whether a}} goal or <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> scored. The goal umpire {{shows that a}} goal has been scored by {{pointing}} both index fingers {{in front of him}} at waist level and then waving two flags above his or her head to indicate the score to the other goal umpire. A <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> signalled by pointing one finger and waving one flag.|$|E

25|$|Juvenile {{birds are}} paler than the adults and are mottled white below rather than barred. The spot {{in front of}} the eye is tinged with brown while the stripe <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> shorter than in the adult. The bill and iris are {{brownish}} and the legs and feet are yellow-ochre.|$|E
25|$|Checking from behind: Hitting an {{opponent}} from <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> a penalty. It carries an automatic minor penalty and misconduct, or a major penalty and game misconduct if {{it results in}} injury. See checking. This is generally allowed in the NHL unless it's covered by another penalty such as boarding or illegal check to the head.|$|E

The album debuted at number one in 32 countries, {{including}} Canada where first-week sales totaled 71,470 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 4.4 million copies in the US through March 2014. All That You Can't Leave <b>Behind</b> <b>is</b> the fourth-highest-selling U2 album, with total sales of over 12million.|$|E

25|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} are {{used to describe the}} dynamic behavior of a multibody system. Each multibody system formulation may lead to a different mathematical appearance of the {{equations of motion}} while the physics <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> the same. The motion of the constrained bodies is described by means of equations that result basically from Newton’s second law. The equations are written for general motion of the single bodies with the addition of constraint conditions. Usually the equations of motions are derived from the Newton-Euler equations or Lagrange’s equations.|$|E
25|$|The {{floor tiles}} are {{decorative}} and the Virgin's throne {{sits on a}} Memling carpet that extends almost {{to the front of}} the pictorial space. <b>Behind</b> <b>is</b> a cityscape, in the far background a landscape. The city is probably 15th-century Bruges and contains contemporary scenes as well as episodes from the lives of two Johns. John the Baptist is shown in a wilderness, preaching to a crowd, led to prison, and burning on a fire. The Evangelist is placed in a church with his wife and disciples kneeling behind him, leaving for Patmos, and immersed in burning oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, {{and surrounded by}} a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren's wishes, in 1718. The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> of only one storey (at the aisles of both nave and choir) the upper storey of the exterior wall is sham. It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of {{the height of the}} 17th century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the River Thames.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the series}} narrative, Jackie is a widow who lives {{alone with her}} {{daughter}} Rose until Rose leaves her mundane life behind to travel through time and space with the Doctor. Jackie's feeling of loss and of being left <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> explored in subsequent episodes. As the character is brought into danger by her proximity to the Doctor, she resents his influence over Rose. However, once he undergoes a regeneration, effectively becoming a new man, Jackie has a more cordial relationship with him. The character was written {{out at the end}} of the 2006 series, along with Rose, in a storyline which sees them trapped in a parallel universe where Jackie forms a new relationship with an alternate version of her deceased husband Pete Tyler.|$|E
25|$|A behind, worth 1 point, is scored {{when the}} ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by {{touching}} it with {{any part of the}} body other than a foot. A <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a goal is not scored) this is termed a rushed behind. As of the 2009 AFL season, a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.|$|E
25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, 2 new {{television}} ads (Crowd, Color Shift) were produced by Lexus' agency of record, Team One, with Original music from Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, and directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The 'Crowd' ad emphasizes that things designed to draw a crowd are good, but leaving the crowd <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> more rewarding. The 'Color Shift' ad shows it's more fun and exciting to blend out than blend in. The Two additional ads (This is Your Move, Intense) were created by Lexus' multicultural agency, Walton Isaacson, {{as part of the}} campaign. 'This is Your Move' was geared to the African-American audience, features Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp as he searches for something that matches his ambitious and driven personality. 'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E
25|$|Funakoshi {{changed the}} names of many kata {{and the name of}} the art itself (at least on {{mainland}} Japan), doing so to get karate accepted by the Japanese budō organization Dai Nippon Butoku Kai. Funakoshi also gave Japanese names to many of the kata. The five pinan forms became known as heian, the three naihanchi forms became known as tekki, seisan as hangetsu, Chintō as gankaku, wanshu as enpi, and so on. These were mostly political changes, rather than changes to the content of the forms, although Funakoshi did introduce some such changes. Funakoshi had trained in two of the popular branches of Okinawan karate of the time, Shorin-ryū and Shōrei-ryū. In Japan he was influenced by kendo, incorporating some ideas about distancing and timing into his style. He always referred to what he taught as simply karate, but in 1936 he built a dojo in Tokyo and the style he left <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> usually called Shotokan after this dojo.|$|E
25|$|On {{the early}} April, the Massacre of Cólua occurs. The village of Cólua, near Aldeia Viçosa, Uíge had been {{attacked}} and its inhabitants massacred by UPA. A military column from the Provisional Battalion {{is sent to the}} village to try to collect the dead bodies. However an isolated group of soldiers (including two officers) which remained <b>behind</b> <b>is</b> ambushed, with their bodies being latter found horribly mutilated. Another military patrol that was sent to the area is also ambushed, with some of their members falling into UPA's hands and being also tortured, mutilated and killed. 30 civilians and 11 military are eventually killed at Cólua. Later testimonies refer that the UPA militants practiced acts of cannibalism, eating parts of the dead bodies of the soldiers. The Cólua events had an important psychological effect in the Portuguese forces, not only due to horrifying acts practiced against its soldiers, but also because they realized that the insurgents now dared to attack military forces and not just defenseless civilians.|$|E
