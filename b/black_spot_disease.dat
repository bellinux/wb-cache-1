50|$|Citrus <b>Black</b> <b>Spot</b> {{was first}} found in Sydney, Australia in 1879 and then {{appeared}} in South Africa {{along the coast}} of Natal in 1929. It can be found in many countries around the world. These countries include: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, Mozambique, Philippines, South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Taiwan, The United States and Uruguay. Whether or not Citrus <b>Black</b> <b>Spot</b> is present in Japan and New Zealand is controversial. In both countries the fungus was thought to have been found, but after further testing it was identified as the non-pathogenic strain, Guignardia mangiferae, rather than the pathogenic strain Guignardia citricarpa which causes Citrus <b>Black</b> <b>Spot.</b> This <b>disease</b> is relatively new to North America; it was first seen in Southern Florida March, 2010.

40|$|ABSTRACT Citrus <b>black</b> <b>spot,</b> a fungal <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} the {{quarantine}} fungus Guignardia citricarpa, restricts the exportation of fresh fruit to countries in the European Union. The occurrence of latent infections and the time required for diagnosis using conventional methods have brought {{about the need to}} validate fast, efficient and reproducible molecular techniques to detect the pathogen in asymptomatic tissue. As such, this study aims to detect G. citricarpa in the symptomatic fruit and asymptomatic leaf tissue of sweet oranges by conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specificity and limit of detection (LOD) were assessed in tissue samples of fruit lesions and asymptomatic leaves. Low concentrations of the fungus were found in asymptomatic leaves. Under these conditions, real-time PCR proved to be viable, reproducible and highly sensitive to detection of the pathogen...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of roses with resistance to <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> and doubling the genome of diploid roses to facilitate hybridization with tetraploid cultivars are both important in rose breeding and were investigated in this thesis. Thirty five rose species and cultivars were challenged with four pathotypes of Diplocarpon rosae, the causal agent of <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> in roses. Patterns of resistance and susceptibility in leaf disc assays identified novel sources of genetic resistance and indicated crosses {{that might give}} insight into the inheritance of <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> resistance. Only roses from the section Cinnamomeae, or with Cinnamomeae ancestry, were susceptible to pathotype DA 2, suggesting a relationship between resistance to <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> and the phylogeny of the sub-genus Eurosa. The possibility that the pathosystem involving pathotype DA 2 {{differs from that of}} the other three pathotypes, DAl, ZM 1 and CW 1, is discussed. Hybrids between a resistant and a susceptible variety of Rosa rugosa proved susceptible, indicating that the resistance was not inherited as a single dominant gene in this case. Chromosome doubling was induced in vitro in a R. rugosa hybrid using oryzalin as the spindle inhibitor. Nodal sections, 2 mm long, were exposed to 2. 5 μM or 5 μM oryzalin and 10 mm nodal sections were exposed to 5 uM oryzalin for 0 (controls), 6, 12, 24 and 48 h.

40|$|Pear <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> (PBS) <b>disease,</b> {{which is}} caused by Alternaria alternata (Aa), {{is one of the}} most serious {{diseases}} affecting sand pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) cultivation worldwide. To investigate the defense mechanisms of sand pear in response to Aa, the transcriptome of a sand pear germplasm with differential resistance to Aa was analyzed using Illumina paired-end sequencing. Four libraries derived from PBS-resistant and PBS-susceptible sand pear leaves were characterized through inoculation or mock-inoculation. In total, 20. 5 Gbp of sequence data and 101, 632, 565 reads were generated, representing 44717 genes. Approximately 66 % of the genes or sequenced reads could be aligned to the pear reference genome. A large number (5213) of differentially expressed genes related to PBS resistance were obtained; 34 microsatellites were detected in these genes, and 28 genes were found to be closely related to PBS resistance. Using a transcriptome analysis in response to PBS inoculation and comparison analysis to the PHI database, 4 genes (Pbr 039001, Pbr 001627, Pbr 025080 and Pbr 023112) were considered to be promising candidates for sand pear resistance to PBS. This study provides insight into changes in the transcriptome of sand pear in response to PBS infection, and the findings have improved our understanding of the resistance mechanism of sand pear to PBS and will facilitate future gene discovery and functional genome studies of sand pear...|$|R
40|$|Number {{of plants}} per {{experimental}} unit {{and number of}} replications for the efficient and precise assessment of <b>black</b> sigatoka leaf <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis in East African Highland bananas were determined. Two representative cultivars were used. Host response to black sigatoka infection was measured by recording the youngest leaf with necrotic spots.

The optimum experimental plot size was 3 plants (18 m 2) for the beer banana cultivar 'Igitsiri', and 30 plants (180 m 2) for the cooking banana cultivar 'Igisahira Gisanzwe', using the comparison of variances method. However, the optimum plot size was 15 plants (90 m 2) for both cultivars using the method of maximum curvature. The latter statistical method was preferred because of the low precision of the estimates in the former method.

40|$|The pear is an {{important}} temperate fruit worldwide that is produced {{by a group of}} species in the genus Pyrus. Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana Decne) is characterized by high resistance to multiple diseases, good adaptability, and high ornamental value, and is therefore widely planted in pear orchards for edible fruit production or as stock. Plant pathogens are a major threat to pear yield. <b>Black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease,</b> caused by the filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata, {{is one of the most}} serious diseases in pear. Elucidation of resistant genes to <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> is extremely important for understanding the underlying mechanisms as well as for the development of resistant cultivars. In this study, high-throughput single-strand RNA-sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome profiles of Callery pear leaves before and after A. alternata incubation for 7 days. The analysis yielded 73. 3 Gb of clean data that were mapped onto the reference genome of the Chinese pear, and differentially expressed gene(DEG) s were identified with |log 2 FC| ≥ 1. Functional annotation demonstrated that <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> promoted great changes in the overall metabolism, and enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms showed that most of them are closely linked to signalling network and photosynthesis. Specifically, the genes included mainly transcription factors and genes involved in calcium signalling and ethylene and jasmonate pathways. Eight members of the ethylene response factor transcription factor gene family Group IX, including ERF 1, ERF 7, and ERF 105, were up-regulated to 2. 03 - 3. 37 -fold compared with CK, suggesting their role in the defence response to pathogen infection. Additionally, multiple transcription factors involved in biotic stresses, such as NAC 78, NAC 2, MYB 44, and bHLH 28, were up-regulated. Furthermore, we identified 144 long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, providing new insight into the involvement of lncRNAs in the response to <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease.</b> Our study provides valuable data on the molecular genetics and functional genomic mechanisms of resistance to <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> in Callery pear.

Contrary to their sexual relatives, asexual amazon mollies significantly avoided images of males infected with <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease.</b> We propose that amazon molly females have direct fitness benefits from choosing healthy males. The adaptive significance of the preference for BSD-uninfected males in the asexual amazon molly is yet unclear but may involve avoidance of predation or parasite infection as well as increased sperm availability...|$|E
