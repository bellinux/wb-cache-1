5000|$|O2/1, Introduced 1921. Development of {{experimental}} Gresley GNR 3-cylinder locomotive (LNER 3921). Subsequently rebuilt with side-window cab and reduced <b>boiler</b> <b>mountings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{class was}} {{introduced}} in 1928 and was a post-grouping development of the Midland Railway 483 Class with modified dimensions and reduced <b>boiler</b> <b>mountings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The last batch {{had reduced}} <b>boiler</b> <b>mountings</b> and detail {{differences}} to the cab {{to conform to}} the new LNER loading gauge. These were classified B7/2. The earlier batches were classified B7/1.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} subclasses: D11/1 were the {{original}} GCR engines and D11/2 were those built in 1924 by the LNER to a reduced loading gauge with smaller <b>boiler</b> <b>mountings</b> for hauling passenger trains in Scotland.|$|E

Several {{concrete}} pipe, hold-down footings exist at various locations on the gorge bank. They were probably supplying water to the mill and railway station. The steam water tower was sited near the Einasleigh station but there is no indication of the water source.|$|E
5000|$|The GCR built 21 {{locomotives}} at Gorton Works {{in three}} batches between 1911 and 1917. They ordered a fourth batch of ten from Gorton, {{but this was}} not built until after the 1923 Grouping, under which GCR became part of the newly formed London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER then ordered a fifth batch of 13 to a modified design, incorporating reduced <b>boiler</b> <b>mountings</b> and detail differences, and these were built by the outside contractors Hawthorn, Leslie & Co. during 1925-26 (works numbers 3616-28).No. 5447 was withdrawn in 1942, because the frames were badly cracked. In 1943, the others were allocated new numbers in the 9800-42 block, but these were not applied until 1946. Forty-three locomotives passed to British Railways in 1948, and between 1948 and 1951 their numbers were increased by 60000. The class was divided into two parts in December 1948 as follows: ...|$|E
