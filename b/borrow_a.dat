5|$|LARPs {{can have}} any genre, {{although}} many use themes and settings derived from genre fiction. Some LARPs <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> setting from an established work in another medium (e.g., The Lord of the Rings or the World of Darkness), while others use settings {{based on the}} real world or designed specifically for the LARP. Proprietary campaign settings, together with rulesets, are often the principal creative asset of LARP groups and LARP publishers.|$|E
5|$|Margaret's {{mother is}} falling ill. Mrs. Hale desires {{to see her}} son, Frederick (Rupert Evans), before she dies. Frederick, a naval officer, was {{involved}} in a mutiny and he cannot return to England without risking his life. However, without telling her father, Margaret writes to her brother in Cádiz, Spain, to tell him that their mother is dying. Margaret calls on the Thorntons to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> water mattress for her mother and is trapped while mill workers riot during a strike. When the angry mob threatens John's safety as he confronts them after Margaret's goading, Margaret defends him from the rioters and is injured by a thrown stone.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E

James' team has a tense encounter with their leader, who reveals that they are private military contractors and British mercenaries. They have captured two prisoners featured on the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, {{the leader of the}} mercenaries shoots them, as they are valuable dead or alive. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader. Sanborn and James <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> gun to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth.|$|E
5|$|Within {{their limited}} jurisdictions, {{municipalities}} are autonomous, responsible and accountable to their citizens, to the province and their future {{residents in the}} case for the unpopulated Jumbo Glacier Mountain Resort Municipality. Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. They have the power of a natural person, the power to expropriate, and the power to establish and enforce bylaws. They are able to raise funds through property taxes and user fees, and <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> limited amount through the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia to pay for capital costs.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E

He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours. She initially denied that they had made the trip, but eventually admitted that it was true, although she said she had no chance to escape during that time.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1968, {{at the age}} of 15, Dupas, still {{attending}} school in Waverley High in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visited his next-door neighbour, requesting to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> knife for the purpose of peeling vegetables. Dupas was apprehended after he stabbed the woman in the face, neck, and hand as she attempted to fight off his attack. He later told police he could not help himself and did not know why he began to attack the woman. He was placed on 18 months probation and admitted to the Larundel Psychiatric Hospital for evaluation; he was released after two weeks and treated as an outpatient.|$|E
25|$|In {{his next}} fight, Aerts faced fellow K-1 legend Ernesto Hoost (the fifth and final {{meeting between the}} pair) at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Amsterdam on May 13, 2006. The {{circumstances}} surrounding the match were rather bizarre as Hoost was scheduled to face Bob Sapp that night and Aerts was only there to commentate for television. However, Sapp ran from the Amsterdam ArenA and Aerts stepped in to replace him, and had to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> pair of fighting shorts from Semmy Schilt (which had Schilt's name written on them and displayed the Golden Glory gym's logo). Despite having not trained for the fight, Aerts {{was still able to}} last all three rounds with Hoost and lost a majority decision (30-29, 30-28, 30-30).|$|E

25|$|In autumn 1903 Childers {{travelled}} to the United States {{as part of}} {{a reciprocal}} visit between the Honourable Artillery Company of London and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts of Boston. At the end of the official visit he elected to remain and explore New England on a hired motor cycle. One day by chance the machine broke down outside the Beacon Hill home of Dr Hamilton Osgood, a prominent physician in the city. Childers diffidently knocked to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> spanner and was invited in for dinner and introduced to Dr Osgood's younger daughter, Mary ("Molly") Alden Osgood. The well-read republican heiress and Childers found each other congenial company. Dr Osgood organised the rest of Childers's stay, with much time shared with Molly, and the pair were married at Boston's Trinity Church on 5 January 1904.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 1947, a {{group of}} Irgun men {{retrieved}} weapons, chloroform, cloths and ropes from a hidden cache. After the recent failures, the Irgun militants in Netanya were skeptical regarding the chances of this kidnapping attempt. Because of this they {{did not go to}} any great lengths to cover their tracks, considering the complicated operation they were planning: they did not steal or <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> vehicle or bring in non-local members who {{were less likely to be}} recognized. Furthermore, Yosef Meller, a longtime Netanya resident and newly recruited Irgun member, volunteered to use his black taxi cab, which was well known around town, for the kidnapping. The abduction operation was led by Benjamin Kaplan, who had been freed in the Acre Prison break. At nightfall one basic precaution was taken; the taxi's license plates were changed in an attempt to prevent it being recognized in the course of the abduction.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E
