50|$|When Robert's brother, Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford, died in {{the latter}} half of 1214, Robert succeeded to his title and estates and the {{hereditary}} office of Master Chamberlain <b>of</b> England. The <b>dower</b> <b>of</b> Earl Aubrey's second wife, Alice (possibly his cousin, a daughter of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk), had not been formalized. In 1215 Oxford settled his sister-in-law's dower by lot, the earl drawing two knights' fees for every one drawn by Alice. This is the only known instance <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> being settled in this manner.|$|R
5000|$|During the pre-Reformation period, a man {{who became}} a monk and made his {{religious}} profession in England was deemed civilly dead, [...] "dead in law" [...] consequently his heirs inherited his land forthwith {{as though he had}} died a natural death. Assignment <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> in his hand would nevertheless be postponed until the natural death of such a man, for only by his wife's consent could a married man be legally professed in religion, and she was not allowed by her consent to exchange her husband for dower. After the Reformation and the enactment of the English statute of 11 and 12 William III, prohibiting [...] "papists" [...] from inheriting or purchasing lands, a Roman Catholic widow was not held to be debarred <b>of</b> <b>dower,</b> for dower accruing by operation of law was deemed to be not within the prohibitions of the statute. By a curious disability of old English law a Jewish widow born in England would be debarred <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> in land which her husband, he having been an Englishman of the same faith and becoming converted after marriage, should purchase, if she herself remained unconverted.|$|R
50|$|Property {{brought to}} the {{marriage}} by the bride is called a dowry. But the word dower has been used since Chaucer (The Clerk's Tale) {{in the sense of}} dowry, and is recognized as a definition <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> in the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|R
50|$|The {{elective}} {{share is}} the modern {{version of the}} English common law concepts <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> and curtesy, both of which reserved certain portions of a decedent's estate which were reserved for the surviving spouse {{to prevent them from}} falling into poverty and becoming a burden on the community.|$|R
50|$|<b>Of</b> <b>dower</b> (douaire) as {{it existed}} in the old French law no trace {{is to be found}} in the {{existing}} law of France. But brought to Canada from the mother country in pre-Revolutionary times, customary dower accruing by operation of law is yet recognized in the law of the former French province of Quebec. The civil death which by English law seems to have applied to men only, might be by the French law incurred by women taking perpetual religious vows. Therefore, a widow entering into religion would lose her dower, although in some regions she was allowed to retain a moderate income. And now by the law of Quebec a widow joining certain religious orders of the province is deemed civilly dead and undoubtedly would suffer loss <b>of</b> <b>dower.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under Virginia law, {{the legal}} status of a slave was traced through the female, so all the {{children}} of an enslaved mother were born enslaved, no matter who the father was. Multiple generations <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> slaves were born at Mount Vernon. The July 1799 Mount Vernon Slave Census lists 153 dower slaves.|$|R
40|$|Dower was {{a rather}} {{peculiar}} institution of the old French customary law that, according to some, still subsists in modern Quebec law. At first blush, dower {{seems to be in}} complete opposition to the main thrust of old French law, whose primary- concern for the protection of lineage allowed hardly any right to be created in favour <b>of</b> spouses. Indeed, <b>dower</b> granted to the wife important rights, bearing on the husband's biens propres, i. e. property coming from his lineage or not included in the community and therefore normally entitled to the strictest protection. The wife's rights consisted in a usufruct on one-half of the husband's bien propres. Considering both the basis and the extent of those rights, therefore, dower appears as a most unusual provision in favour of the wife. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> were, however, more apparent than real. This comes out clearly when one examines the rights of children under the dower, as well as {{the manner in which the}} institution was transformed. Dower then appears as a mere reduction of the rights of full ownership previously vested in the wife. Such reduction favoured the children, who emerged as the main beneficiaries <b>of</b> <b>dower.</b> They were the owners of the property upon which bore the wife's usufruct. And their rights were safeguarded as against every other party, including their mother and father, as well as the latter's creditors. The history <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> therefore illustrates the manner in which legal institutions may be transformed to suit changing ideas and mores...|$|R

50|$|Dower was a {{property}} arrangement for marriage first used in early medieval German cultures, and the Catholic Church drove its adoption into other countries, {{in order to}} improve the wife's security by this additional benefit. The practice <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> was prevalent in those parts of Europe influenced by Germanic Scandinavian culture, such as Sweden, Germany, Normandy and successor states of the Langobardian kingdom.|$|R
50|$|In 1558, John Lyte {{made over}} his {{property}} to Henry who managed the Somerset estate until his father's death in 1576, when his stepmother brought a writ <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> against him.

50|$|In equity, any {{provision}} {{made for}} a wife before marriage and accepted by her (not being an infant) in lieu <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> was a <b>bar</b> to such. If the provision was made after marriage, the wife was not barred by such provision, though expressly stated to be in lieu of dower; she was put to her election between jointure and dower.|$|R
40|$|Vectorcardiograms are {{not usually}} {{recorded}} in clinical practice and must be derived from the conventional 12 lead ECG, for example by making use <b>of</b> <b>Dower’s</b> transform. However, its accuracy for the derivation of the P wave is questionable. We tested the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>Dower’s</b> transform on the P-wave and compared with a P-wave optimized transform in a database of 123 simultaneous recordings of ECGs and VCGs. This new transform achieved a lower error when we compared derived vs. true measured P-waves (12. 2 ± 7. 96 µVRMS) than Dower’s transform (14. 4 ± 9. 5 µVRMS) and higher correlation values (Rx= 0. 93 ± 0. 12, Ry = 0. 90 ± 0. 27, Rz= 0. 91 ± 0. 18 vs. Dower’s: Rx= 0. 88 ± 0. 15, Ry= 0. 91 ± 0. 26, Rz= 0. 85 ± 0. 23). We concluded that derivation of P-waves and QRS complexes VCGs were optimized {{by the use of}} different transform matrices for each wave in this database. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The general {{establishment}} of the principle <b>of</b> <b>dower</b> in the customary law of Western Europe, according to Maine, is to {{be traced to the}} influence of the Church (no evidence <b>of</b> this whatsoever <b>dower</b> payments evolved from Germanic custom of paying a brideprice, which over centuries morphed into the bridegift, was in place long before the church became seriously involved in marriage practice), and to be included perhaps among its most arduous triumphs. Dower is an outcome of the ecclesiastical practice of exacting from the husband at marriage a promise to endow his wife, a promise retained in form even now in the marriage ritual of the Established Church in England. Dower is mentioned in an ordinance of King Philip Augustus of France (1214), and in the almost contemporaneous Magna Carta (1215); but it seems to have already become customary law in Normandy, Sicily, and Naples, as well as in England. The object of both ordinance and charter was to regulate the amount <b>of</b> the <b>dower</b> where this was not the subject <b>of</b> voluntary arrangement, <b>dower</b> by English law consisting of a wife's life estate in one-third of the lands of the husband [...] "of which any issue which she might have had might by possibility have been heir".|$|R
50|$|Some well-born {{persons have}} been prone to marry an ineligible spouse. Particularly in European {{countries}} where the equal birth of spouses (Ebenbürtigkeit) was an important condition to marriages of dynasts of reigning houses and high nobility, the old matrimonial and contractual law provision <b>of</b> <b>dowering</b> was taken into a new use by institutionalizing the morganatic marriage. Marriage being morganatical prevents {{the passage of the}} husband's titles and privileges to the wife and any children born of the marriage.|$|R
