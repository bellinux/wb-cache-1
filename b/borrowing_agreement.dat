While {{over the years}} the county wide Miami-Dade Public Library System has taken over the {{libraries}} of most of the cities in the county, the North Miami public library has remained independent.The North Miami Public Library was first opened in 1932 by the Biscayne Park Woman’s Club.

The library was closed during World War II and it was reopened in September 1945 in the same location at the town hall and still {{under the supervision of the}} City Clerk E. May Avil. At this time the library was funded by donations and member fees.“In 1948 the Biscayne Park Woman’s Club turned the library over to the city of North Miami and in 1949 a public referendum established a free Public Library under provisions of the Florida Statutes, setting up a Library Fund and a Library board to administer the operation. Twin sisters, Mrs. Edla Lunden and Mrs. Alma Anderson, were appointed as Librarian and Assistant Librarian, respectively”. After the twins retired, Miss Phyllis Gray served from 1955-1959 as the library’s first professional Librarian. Today Lucia M.

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} if “Big Deal” journal subscription packages are a cost-effective {{way to provide}} electronic journal access to academic library users versus individual subscriptions, pay-per-view, and interlibrary loans (ILL). Design – Cost-per-article-use analysis. Setting – Public research university in the United States of America. Subjects – Cost-per-use data from 1) journals in seven Big Deal packages, 2) individually subscribed journals, 3) pay-per-view from publishers’ websites, and 4) interlibrary loans. Methods – The authors determined cost-per-use for Big Deal titles by utilizing COUNTER JR 1 metric Successful Full-Text Article Request (SFTAR) reports. Individual journal subscription cost-per-use data were obtained from individual publishers or platforms. Pay-per-view cost was determined by recording the price listed on publishers’ websites. ILL cost-per-use was established by reviewing cost-per-article obtained from libraries outside of reciprocal <b>borrowing</b> <b>agreement</b> networks. With the exception of pay-per-view numbers, title cost-per-use was averaged {{over a three-year period}} from 2010 through 2012. Main Results – Cost-per-article use for journals from Big Deals varied from 2. 11 to 9. 42. For individually subscribed journals, the average cost-per-article ranged from 0. 25 to 84. 00. Pay-per-view charges ranged from 15. 00 to 80. 00, with an average cost of 37. 72. Conclusion – The authors conclude that Big Deals are cost effective, but that they consume such a large amount of funds that they limit the purchase of other resources. The authors go on to outline the options for libraries thinking about Big Deal packages. First, libraries should keep Big Deal packages in place if the average cost-per-article is less than individual subscriptions. Second, libraries could subscribe only to the most-used journals in Big Deals, cancel the packages, and rely on ILL and pay-per-view access. Third, consortia could be joined to favourably negotiate Big Deal package prices. Fourth, Big Deals could be dropped completely. Fifth, individual libraries armed with JR 1 reports can negotiate with publishers for bette...|$|E

40|$|We {{look into}} Brazil''s public sector {{accounts}} {{during the two}} administrations of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso: 1995 - 98 and 1998 - 2002. We underline {{the fact that the}} authorities'' attitude was as important as the pace of the structural reforms for understanding the dynamics of the public sector debt and deficit. The high deficit of the first administration (1995 - 98) resulted from an expansionary policy, while the adjustment of 1999 is seen as proof of a commitment to fiscal rigor and the need to finance public spending adequately. We present a detailed breakdown of the fiscal outcomes. Two important messages come out: (a) the principal cause of the fiscal deterioration in the first Cardoso administration was the deterioration in the primary balance rather than the increase in the interest payments on public debt; and (b) the fiscal adjustment was entirely on account of increased revenues, as the federal primary public expenditure grew in real terms during the eight years of the two administrations. We consider the outlook for fiscal sustainability, and conclude that, to preserve the hard-won fiscal discipline, the authorities'' recent austere fiscal attitude should be permanently embedded into the fiscal institutions.
