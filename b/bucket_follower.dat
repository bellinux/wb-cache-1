5000|$|These engines were {{developed}} before Nissan used the D to denote [...] "double over head cam". The FJ {{is indeed a}} DOHC 16 valve design with mechanically actuated cam on <b>bucket</b> <b>follower</b> design. The head is aluminium and the block is iron.|$|E

50|$|A helical {{camshaft}} must operate {{through a}} lift-multiplying pivoting follower. The Helical Camshaft could not really {{be used with}} an inverted <b>bucket</b> type of <b>follower.</b> Even though the inverted bucket is still used, it is being increasingly replaced both in road and racing engines by the pivoting “finger” follower. As well as needing a pivoting follower, if the engine has four valves per cylinder then the follower must be forked so that the one Helical Camshaft lobe operates two valves. This is more a characteristic than a problem. If a really wide duration range is required, because axial space is somewhat limited along the camshaft, usually only room for one Helical Camshaft lobe (and its operating space) can be found.|$|R
