25|$|Dieting is the {{practice}} of eating food in a regulated and supervised fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight. In other words, it is conscious control or restriction of the diet. A restricted diet is often used <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> overweight or obese, sometimes in combination with physical exercise, to reduce body weight. Some people follow a diet to gain weight (usually {{in the form of}} muscle). Diets {{can also be used to}} maintain a stable body weight and improve health. In particular, diets can be designed to prevent or treat diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} required by an organism {{as a vital}} nutrient in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must {{be obtained from the}} diet. Thus, the term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems but there is little evidence of benefit when used <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> otherwise healthy.|$|E

25|$|The Reut Institute expands {{on these}} {{concerns}} of many Israeli Jews {{and says that}} a one-state scenario without any institutional safeguards would negate Israel's status as a homeland for the Jewish people.

They argue that the absorption of millions of Palestinians, along with a right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the generally high birthrate among Palestinians would quickly render Jews an ethnic minority and eliminate their rights to self-determination.|$|E

In the United States, Child Protective Services (CPS) may investigate even if no laws have been allegedly broken. Although such incidents are rare among its members, the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) has an attorney on hand to assist. Many private nudist venues require that one or both parents, including absent parents, be consulted regarding the documentation of their minor children. This may also include situations with partial custody, stepchildren, etc.|$|E

25|$|Explicit {{extrinsic}} {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.|$|E
25|$|Daepyeong {{became a}} large central {{settlement}} in the Early Middle Mumun (c. 850-700 BC). The focus of the settlement was a large nucleated group of 144 pit-houses in Eoeun. Another nucleated settlement of 115 pit-houses developed in Okbang {{at about the same}} time. Archaeological evidence from the Middle Mumun indicates that prominent individuals in Eoeun and Okbang probably competed for dominance in the local area. For example, greenstone production and distribution began in Eoeun and was traded to Okbang and areas outside of Daepyeong. Many ditches and ditch-enclosures appeared in Eoeun and Okbang beginning in the Early Middle Mumun. Perhaps this was due to conflict between Okbang and Eoeun, or the whole of Daepyeong with distant outside settlements. Eventually, 8 substantial ditch-and-palisades were constructed at Okbang. Interestingly, this sub-period sees a pattern in which greenstone artifacts that are made in Eoeun are consumed <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> buried in the ditch-and-palisade precinct of Okbang.|$|E

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius sanguifluus are edible, and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his {{original}} {{description of the}} species, who wrote: [...] "This fungus is highly prized for use <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to cook it in the frying pan or on the grill with oil or butter & salt: {{it does not take}} long to cook". The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France, Spain, Turkey, and Yunnan Province, China. They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the Serchio River in central Italy. In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus). In India, young specimens are consumed along with L.deliciosus; and some consider L.sanguifluus to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative. Its English common name is the [...] "bloody milkcap".|$|E
