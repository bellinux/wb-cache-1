5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E

5|$|At the Republican State Convention on March 22, 2014, Baker {{received}} 2,095 votes (82.708%), Fisher received 374 votes (14.765%) {{and there}} were 64 blank votes (2.527%). The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Baker {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Italy, Baker became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged Italian thrillers, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> been invited to the Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in Her Harem (1967). This was followed with the horror films The Sweet Body of Deborah (1968) and The Devil Has Seven Faces (1971). Baker also starred in So Sweet...

5|$|Nigel Kneale {{wrote the}} first draft of the {{screenplay}} in 1961, but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film did not go into production until 1967. The director, Roy Ward Baker, was chosen because of his experience with technically demanding productions such as A Night to Remember; this was the first of six films that he directed for Hammer. Andrew Keir, playing Quatermass, found making the film an unhappy experience, believing <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> wanted Kenneth More to play the role. Owing to a lack of space, the film was shot at the MGM studios in Elstree, Borehamwood rather than Hammer's usual home at the time, which was the Associated British Studios, also in Elstree.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August, Baker led {{a patrol}} of six {{aircraft}} over Lys. Five days later, he shot down a German balloon {{while on a}} lone mission in poor weather, scoring his third aerial victory. At dawn on 30 August, Baker took off on a sortie with Lieutenants Roy King and Oscar Ramsay. Over Laventie, the trio encountered three DFW C.Vs; Baker and King each disposed {{of one of the}} aircraft. Baker was granted two weeks' leave to the United Kingdom in early September. Towards the end of that month, No.4 Squadron relocated to Serny and was soon after re-equipped with the Sopwith Snipe. By the time of the conversion, <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> achieved flying ace status on the Sopwith Camel, having been credited with shooting down six German aircraft by early October.|$|E
5|$|Various {{delays in}} the arrival of planes and {{equipment}} meant that Baker's squadron was unable {{to participate in the}} final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The planes and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> the planes painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports {{at the time of his}} death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but <b>Baker</b> <b>had</b> a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E
