5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a small one, a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage {{of his or her}} own, which is only revealed {{at the end of the}} show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include <b>bad</b> <b>habits,</b> strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in {{distinguishing}} a bad habit from an addiction or mental disease is willpower. If a person has control over the behavior, then it is a habit. Good intentions can override the negative effect of <b>bad</b> <b>habits,</b> but their effect seems to be independent and additive—the <b>bad</b> <b>habits</b> remain, but are subdued rather than cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Harmful habits such as thumb sucking or tongue {{thrusting}} {{can result}} in or exaggerate an alveolar prognathism, causing teeth to misalign.

25|$|Many {{techniques}} {{exist for}} removing established <b>bad</b> <b>habits,</b> e.g., withdrawal of reinforcers—identifying and removing factors that trigger and reinforce the habit. The basal ganglia appears {{to remember the}} context that triggers a habit, so habits can be revived if triggers reappear. Recognizing and eliminating <b>bad</b> <b>habits</b> {{as soon as possible}} is advised. Habit elimination becomes more difficult with age because repetitions reinforce habits cumulatively over the lifespan. According to Charles Duhigg, there is a loop that includes a cue, routine and reward for every habit. An example of a habit loop is TV program ends (cue), go to the fridge (routine), eat a snack (reward). The key to changing habits is to identify your cue and modify your routine and reward.|$|E

25|$|Close wrote {{a letter}} to Lister apologising, and gave a copy to a Yorkshire committeeman. But the letter was never {{presented}} to the committee as a whole, which voted to sack him as the first agenda item at their next meeting. In November 1970 Close was summoned to see Sellers, and given the choice of either resigning or being sacked. To begin with, he chose to resign. Later that day, and after speaking to his legal adviser, he retracted this, leaving Yorkshire to sack him. The reason, according to Yorkshire, was Close's dislike for the new 40-over one-day cricket league that was first played in 1969 (Close thought it led to <b>bad</b> <b>habits</b> and negative play), and because Close had supposedly not brought on the younger players.|$|E
25|$|In his old age Yan {{also found}} {{time to work on}} a {{dictionary}} and related literary projects. In his 26 chapter book Yanshi jiaxun 顏氏家訓 ("The Family Instructions of Master Yan") Yan Zhitui left an entire written compendium of his own philosophy and life-advice to his sons, advising them on which paths to take and which paths to avoid in order to gain success in life. In addition, he also made observations about the differences between Northern and Southern China of his time, especially in regards to language, customs, and culture. He wrote that he formed many <b>bad</b> <b>habits</b> in life that took years to overcome because his elder brother had not been strict enough with him in the absence of their father. He stressed the need to acquire a good education, since well-educated ministers were chosen for posts, while others who had prestigious family lines for centuries wound up working on farms or tending to horses in the stable if they were not properly educated. Although he stressed the need for mastering calligraphy, painting, and playing the musical instrument of the lute (guqin), he warned against them from practicing too much and gaining too much skill. This was because those of higher rank, in a degrading and humiliating fashion, could easily call upon them to constantly entertain and produce fanciful calligraphy, poetry, or a musical song on the spot. Yan Zhitui was an antiquarian {{when it came to the}} prized calligraphy in his family's collection, with written pieces in his possession that were originally penned by the masters of early calligraphy, Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi.|$|E

25|$|Ethiopia faces many historical, cultural, {{social and}} {{political}} obstacles that have restricted progress in education for many centuries. According to UNESCO reviews, most people in Ethiopia feel that work {{is more important than}} education, so they start {{at a very early age}} with little to no education. Children in rural areas are less likely to go to school than children in urban areas. Though gradually improving, most rural families cannot afford to send their children to school because parents believe that while their children are in school they cannot contribute to the household chores and income. Social awareness that education is important is something that Ethiopia lacks but has improved gradually. There is a need to change the importance of education in the country's social structure, and children should be encouraged and required to attend school and become educated. The society of Ethiopia expects teachers and parents to use corporal punishment to maintain order and discipline. Most believe that through punishing children for <b>bad</b> <b>habits</b> they in turn learn good ones. Also since the mid-1970s there was a drastic loss of professionals who left the country, mostly for economical reasons. Many educated Ethiopians sought higher salaries in foreign countries thus many of those who managed to finish higher education emigrated from Ethiopia creating an endless shortage of qualified professionals in every sector of the country. Now the custom of sending academics abroad with the risk of a brain drain is being replaced by expansion of masters and doctoral programs to up-grade academic staff. Instead, foreigners have been funding programs for leadership, management and pedagogic skills or sending staff to help strengthen teaching and management practices.|$|E
