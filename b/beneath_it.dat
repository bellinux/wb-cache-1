5|$|Regency Square was a prestigious, high-class development, {{attracting}} the social elite. The square gradually lost its prestige status after World War I as hotels {{started to move}} in, and by the mid-20th century, most of the houses had become hotels. During World War II air-raid shelters were built on the square, and an underground car park was built <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark uses {{bioluminescence}} to camouflage its underside by counterillumination, but a {{small patch}} near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming <b>beneath</b> <b>it.</b> When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.|$|E

5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents <b>beneath</b> <b>it.</b> Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E

5|$|Between 2004 and 2007, ground {{inflation}} {{began in}} the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a sill <b>beneath</b> <b>it.</b> The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as Uturunku in Bolivia and Yellowstone in the United States and {{has been accompanied by}} anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.|$|E
5|$|In the KÃ¶nig-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
5|$|The dome, {{octagonal}} in shape, stands prominently {{on top of}} {{the centre}} of the cella. It was supported by four now-destroyed columns which were located directly <b>beneath</b> <b>it.</b> The integrated bell tower has been built {{on top of the}} narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and extends from the rectangular main structure. The bell tower was originally rectangular, though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase.|$|E

5|$|The earthen mound {{that once}} covered the tomb is now visible {{only as an}} {{undulation}} approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 inches) in height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on {{the western end of}} the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens <b>beneath.</b> <b>It</b> is probable that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|The linking of the GN and B routes at Holborn {{meant that}} {{the section of the}} GN south of Holborn became a branch from the main route. The UERL began {{constructing}} the main route in July 1902. Progress was rapid, so that it was largely complete by the Autumn of 1906. Construction of the branch was delayed while the London County Council carried out slum clearances to construct its new road Kingsway and the tramway subway running <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> and while the UERL decided how the junction between the main route and the branch would be arranged at Holborn.|$|E

5000|$|The {{figure at}} Cherhill was first cut in 1780 by a Dr Christopher Alsop, of Calne, and {{was created by}} {{stripping}} away the turf to expose the chalk hillside <b>beneath.</b> <b>Its</b> original size was 165 ft by 220 ft. Dr Alsop, who was Guild Steward of the Borough of Calne, has been called [...] "the mad doctor", and {{is reported to have}} directed the making of the horse from a distance, shouting through a megaphone from below Labour-in-Vain Hill. His design may have been influenced by the work of his friend George Stubbs, notable for his paintings of horses.|$|R
5000|$|The cabinet is 8 feet (2.44 m) high, 42 inches (1.07 m) wide, and 20 inches (0.51 m) deep. It {{is made of}} walnut and maple, with poplar {{and white}} pine {{secondary}} woods. It features a shingled [...] "roof," [...] ebonized compressed columns, and carved and incised decoration throughout. Its two sets of doors are separated by a highly-carved drawer front. Its eight inset panels - four on {{the doors of the}} front, and a pair on each of the sides - are of veneered maple, cameo-carved to reveal the darker walnut <b>beneath.</b> <b>Its</b> strap hinges and hardware are of brass.|$|R

5|$|The name of {{the theatre}} changes with {{the sex of the}} monarch. It first became the King's Theatre in 1714 on the {{accession}} of George I. It was renamed Her Majesty's Theatre in 1837. Most recently, the theatre was known as His Majesty's Theatre from 1901 to 1952, and it became Her Majesty's on the accession of Elizabeth II. The theatre's capacity is 1,216seats, and the building was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1970. Really Useful Theatres has owned the building since 2000. The land <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> is on a long-term lease from the Crown Estate.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{existing}} fortifications in this location. The main existing fort, King Charles's Castle, {{had been built}} in the 1550s but was poorly sited and had been blown up by its defenders when Blake's forces took the island. There was also a small blockhouse <b>beneath</b> <b>it,</b> dating from the 16th century, and the new castle was built on top of this preexisting site.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
50|$|An {{open air}} terrace was once {{provided}} {{on top of}} the station's platform canopy for afternoon tea. However, this only lasted until 1920 as the steam and soot from the trains <b>beneath</b> rendered <b>it</b> unprofitable.|$|R

6000|$|The {{sanguine}} Sunrise, {{with his}} meteor eyes, And his burning plumes outspread, Leaps {{on the back}} of my sailing rack, When the morning star shines dead; As on the jag of a mountain crag, [...] 35 Which an earthquake rocks and swings, An eagle alit one moment may sit In the light of its golden wings. And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea <b>beneath,</b> <b>Its</b> ardours of rest and of love, [...] 40 And the crimson pall of eve may fall From the depth of Heaven above. With wings folded I rest, on mine aery nest, As still as a brooding dove.|$|R
5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water <b>beneath</b> <b>it.</b> It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period {{and there are many}} peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and <b>beneath</b> <b>it</b> is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E
5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists <b>beneath</b> <b>it,</b> which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
