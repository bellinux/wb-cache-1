30|$|The {{mechanism}} of hydrogen generation during the mechanochemical treatment of biotite was examined by grinding experiments using a <b>ball</b> <b>mil</b> in H 2 O or D 2 O as a grinding media. From the linear {{relationship between the}} amount of generated hydrogen and the increase of the surface area of ground powders, the hydrogen productivity of biotite is estimated to be 0.036 μmol/m 2, which agrees with the previous results in spite of the difference in the grinding conditions. D 2 analyses by a mass spectrometry indicate that the produced amount of D 2 accounts for only 10 % of the total hydrogen and that more than 90 % of hydrogen takes a form of a mixture of HD and H 2. The observed isotope distribution clearly indicates that hydroxyls within the crystal structure can be a major source for the generation of hydrogen. Hydrogen generation originated from hydroxyls may indicate the higher hydrogen productivity of phyllosilicates than those of quartz and alkali feldspar.|$|E

In this study, we investigated the size reduction {{influence of the}} acetaminophen (C 8 H 9 O 2 N) particles by mechanical activation using a dry ball mill. The activated samples with the average size of 1 &micro;m were then investigated in different time periods with the infrared (IR), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. The results of the IR and XRD images showed {{no change in the}} drug structure after the mechanical activation of all samples. With the peak height at full width at half maximum from XRD and the Scherrer equation, the size of the activated crystallite samples illustrated that the AFM images were in sound agreement with the Scherrer equation. According to the peaks of the AFM images, the average size of the particles in 30 hours of activation was 24 nm with a normal particle distribution. The ICP analysis demonstrated the presence of tungsten carbide particle impurities after activation from the powder sample impacting with the ball and jar. The greatest reduction in size was after milling for 30 hours. Keywords: acetaminophen, mechanical activation, structure investigation, nanoparticles, <b>ball</b> <b>mil...</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{a vast amount of}} {{literature}} published on the characterization of the shear strength of solder balls attached to ball grid array (BGA) substrates. This has allowed {{for the establishment of a}} quasi-defacto specification of 1000 grams-force shear strength on packages with 30 <b>mil</b> diameter solder <b>balls</b> and 25 <b>mil</b> pads for BGA components. There is significantly less data on the expected shear strength values of the solder ball to printed wiring board (PWB) attachment. This prevents contract manufacturers and their customers from benchmarking the robustness of their material sets and reflow processes. An extensive amount of shear testing has been performed to quantify the performance of the solder ball joint at the PWB, under a variety of materials and designs. These includ...|$|R
40|$|Uniaxial {{and ball}} burst {{toughness}} for eight commercial polyethylene balloon films {{have been investigated}} and compared. Uniaxial toughness was measured in both machine and transverse directions using a rectangular sample 25. 4 mm wide by 50. 8 mm gage length with an average nominal thickness of 20. 32 microns (0. 8 <b>mils).</b> <b>Ball</b> burst toughness was measured using a ball burst test fixture with 127 mm hole diameter and 50. 8 mm ball diameter resulting in a 0. 4 ball to hole diameter ratio. Both {{the size and shape}} of the deformed area were observed and the ball burst toughness was calculated based on the deformed area of the film instead of the full area. Specimens were tested at 23 C and - 80 C and cross head speed was maintained at 508 mm per minute. The uniaxial toughness were in general, higher than the ball burst toughness. The toughness of the films varied from 12 to 365 MPa when measured uniaxially and from 24 to 73 MPa when measured in the ball burst test. Further investigation showed an apparent correlation between film performance in flight as measured by its stress index and its toughness...|$|R
40|$|O montelucaste de sodio (MLK), muito usado no tratamento da asma, apresenta como limitacoes ao uso e formulacao a baixa solubilidade e a instabilidade a luz e a humidade. De forma a contornar estas limitacoes, neste trabalho foram formados compostos de inclusao entre o MLK e a γ-ciclodextrina (γ-CD). O composto MLK: γ-CD foi formado atraves de mecanoquimica, tendo-se usado tres variantes: (1) moagem de uma mistura equimolar num moinho planetario, 600 rotacoes. minuto- 1; (2) repeticao do ensaio 1 com pre-amorfizacao da γ-CD; (3) repeticao do ensaio 1 a baixa velocidade (50 rotacoes. minuto- 1) num forno de rolos. Amostras foram recolhidas a intervalos de tempo pre-determinados e analisadas por difracao de Raios-X de pos, ressonancia magnetica nuclear 13 C{ 1 H} CP-MAS, microscopia eletronica de varrimento, espectroscopia de infravermelho, termogravimetria e calorimetria diferencial de varrimento. Os resultados mostram que a formacao do composto de inclusao MLK: γ-CD ocorre preferencialmente em condicoes de elevada transmissao de energia mecanica, tais como as que ocorrem no moinho planetario. Verificou-se ainda que a interacao entre MLK e γ-CD se inicia mais cedo quando a γ-CD nao e sujeita a pre-moagem. De facto, este tratamento altera a morfologia da γ-CD, o que parece condicionar a interacao com o MLK. No seu conjunto os resultados sugerem que a abordagem 1 e a mais indicada para a obtencao de compostos de inclusao MLK: γ-CD por mecanoquimica. Verificou-se ainda que a dissolucao do MLK a partir destes compostos atinge mais do dobro dos valores de solubilidade do que o MLK puro, o que podera contribuir para melhorar a sua eficacia terapeutica. Montelukast sodium (MLK), {{a widely}} used {{anti-asthmatic}} drug, presents low solubility and some instability to light and humidity, which limit its formulation. In the present work, we investigate {{the formation of}} inclusion compounds of MLK and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) as a possible solution for these issues. The MLK: γ-CD inclusion compounds were formed by mechanochemistry, using three different processes: (1) co-milling an equimolar quantity in a <b>ball</b> <b>mil</b> at 600 cycles. minute- 1; (2) pre-milling γ-CD and co-milling with MLK as in 1; (3) co-milling, with amounts as in 1, in a roll oven at low speed, 50 cycles. minute- 1. Aliquots were collected at defined timelines and analyzed by powder X-Ray diffraction, solid-state 13 C{ 1 H} CP-MAS NMR, scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The {{results show that the}} formation of MLK: γ-CD inclusion compounds occurs preferably under high mechanical energy conditions, as provided by the ball mill. Moreover, it was shown that MLK and γ-CD interact earlier when γ-CD is not pre-milled. In fact, the pre-milling of γ-CD alters the shape of the particles making them more round and thus limiting the interaction with MLK. These results suggest that the process 1 is the most effective, allowing the formation of a MLK: γ-CD inclusion compound from which over twice the amount of MLK dissolves into water as compared to dissolution of pure MLK. MLK: γ-CD co-milled adducts are thus a promising solution for improving the therapeutic effectiveness of this drug. γγMestrado em Bioquímic...|$|E
