Indeed, there are relatively few examples of where compensation for violations of NZBORA have been awarded. In Udompun v Attorney General, Glazebrook J of the Court of Appeal stated that monetary compensation will not be awarded where a more suitable remedy exists. Most significantly, in Taunoa v Attorney-General the Supreme Court of New Zealand awarded compensatory damages for breaches of NZBORA by the Department of Corrections’ <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Management</b> Regime.|$|E

Two-hundred and eighty-one participants completed the Time <b>Management</b> <b>Behaviour</b> Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale - Student Version, and the Big Five Aspect Scales. Linear regression analyses revealed that time <b>management</b> <b>behaviour</b> was positively predicted by the Conscientiousness aspects, Industriousness and Orderliness. Work engagement variables were also predicted by Industriousness, and both aspects of Openness/Intellect. Openness significantly predicted vigor and dedication, while Intellect predicted absorption. These findings indicate that those higher in both time <b>management</b> <b>behaviour</b> and work engagement are more likely to use time effectively and minimise distractions. While individuals higher on time <b>management</b> <b>behaviour</b> are more likely to work in an orderly fashion, individuals higher in work engagement might be quicker to understand information.

One other strength of this study is that it assessed reported weight <b>management</b> <b>behaviours</b> of type 2 diabetes patients irrespective of their weight status.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the value of behavioural psychology when considering the effects of legislation on senior <b>management</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Use is made of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the corporate failures that led to its passage. Design/methodology/approach – The insights of behavioural psychology are discussed and then applied to the situation of senior management faced with reacting to new legislation. Findings – It is found that this approach predicts that the effects on <b>management</b> <b>behaviour</b> may be greater than (and in any case will be different from) the effects resulting from using a more traditional approach of law and economics Research limitations/implications – No original research is performed. It does however show that further research using this approach has much potential. Practical implications – As the paper looks at the effect of legislation on <b>management</b> <b>behaviour</b> this paper shows the value of the behavioural approach to both those who propose legislation and those who study its effects. Originality/value – No original work is presented but the paper is useful in showing readers not familiar with this approach of its usefulness.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between organisational support for career development (OSCD) and employees' career satisfaction. Based on an extended model of social cognitive career theory (SCCT) and an integrative model of proactive behaviours, the study proposed that career <b>management</b> <b>behaviours</b> would mediate the relationship between OSCD and career satisfaction, and between proactive personality and career satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach – Public and private sector employees (N= 90) participating in career development activities completed a survey regarding their proactivity, OSCD, career <b>management</b> <b>behaviours</b> and career satisfaction. Findings – OSCD, proactive personality and career <b>management</b> <b>behaviours</b> were all positively related to career satisfaction and career <b>management</b> <b>behaviours</b> mediated the relationship between proactive personality and career satisfaction. There was no support for the career <b>management</b> <b>behaviours</b> mediating between OSCD and career satisfaction. Research limitations/implications – This study provided support for the extended SCCT model by testing a subset of its proposed relationships using a cross-sectional approach. The sample surveyed (employees participating in career development activities) and the large proportion of full-time employees, may limit the generalisability of the findings. Future longitudinal research could more fully test the relationships proposed by the extended SCCT model and include a greater representation of part-time and casual employees. Practical implications – The results suggest that there are benefits for organisations and individuals investing in career development [...] First, from an organisational perspective, investing in OSCD may enhance employees' career satisfaction. Second, employees may enhance their own career satisfaction by participating in career <b>management</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Originality/value – This study integrated the predictions of two models (an extension of SCCT and a model of proactive behaviours) to test the influence of environmental (OSCD) and individual difference (proactive personality) variables on career satisfaction. Exploring how organisational and individual variables together influence career satisfaction provides a more balanced approach to theoretical development...|$|R
