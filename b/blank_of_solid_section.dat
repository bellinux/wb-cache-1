Column jacketing with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials has been extensively studied in recent years but it is uncertain how FRP jackets may perform when retrofitting hollow concrete columns since the topic has been little researched.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the value of two quantitative indicators, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the exponent apparent diffusion coefficient (EADC), of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the differential diagnosis of ovarian epithelial tumors. Materials and Methods: Clinical and MRI data from ovarian epithelial tumors were analyzed after pathology confirmation of 85 lesions from 76 cases (47 lesions from 41 benign cases; 38 lesions from 35 malignant cases). Patients underwent routine MRI examination and DWI before surgery. The average ADC and EADC values <b>of</b> the <b>solid</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the tumors were measured when the b value was 1000 s/mm 2. Results: The mean ADC value <b>of</b> the <b>solid</b> <b>sections</b> in the benign group was 1. 28 ± 0. 23 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s; the average EADC value was 27. 96 ± 5. 78 × 10 − 2. In the malignant group, the mean ADC value <b>of</b> the <b>solid</b> <b>sections</b> was 0. 86 ± 0. 17 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s; the average EADC value was 42. 37 ± 5. 96 × 10 − 2. When the b value was 1000 s/mm 2, there was a statistically significant difference in ADC and EADC values between benign and malignant ovarian tumors (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: ADC and EADC values of DWI can be used to differentiate benign and malignant ovarian epithelial tumors...|$|R

A unified theory for confinement of circular hollow sections is proposed herein, that can be extended to the case <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> and noncircular <b>sections.</b> The main aim of the model is to trace step-by-step {{the evolution of the}} three dimensional stresses in confined concrete and confining devices (i. e.

The iterative model is able to estimate confinement effectiveness and to plot stress-strain relationships, which are different in the case <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> and hollow <b>sections.</b> Through the proposed improved model, a simplified closed form solution has been also derived to directly determine ultimate confined concrete properties and stress-strain curves.

5000|$|Since {{the first}} {{publication}} {{on the subject}} in 1680 it has mostly been accepted that the cage cups were made by cutting and grinding a <b>blank</b> vessel <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> thick glass, a laborious technique at which the Greeks and Romans were very experienced from their passion for hardstone carvings and engraved gems in semi-precious stones. An alternative theory, once rejected but recently revived, suggests that this is only true of {{the rim of the}} vessels and the cutting of the fixed cage, but not for the joining of beaker and its cage; these would have been made separately and fused when hot. [...] For example, it is claimed that the smooth joins on the Munich cup show the fusion of the cage to the main cup, though the cage itself is carved. These smooth joins also show the Cologne and Pljevlja cups above. However this remains controversial, and a fragmentary cup found in Corinth in the 1960s is said to show no evidence of joints where the cage meets the main cup when examined under a microscope.|$|R

The key topics are the concepts of surface depletion, threshold, and inversion; MOS capacitor C–V; gate depletion; inversion-layer thickness; and two imaging devices—charge-coupled device and CMOS (complementary MOS) imager. This chapter builds the foundation for understanding the MOSFETs (MOS Field-Effect Transistors). he acronym MOS stands for metal–oxide–semiconductor.

However, prevailing stringent design requirements to mitigate impact damage in a limited space have advocated a need for superior energy absorbing materials and versatile and compact structures. In this thesis, an intelligent compact energy absorbing structure is presented that alleviates the impact by distributing load over finite displacement (stroke). The structure 2 ̆ 7 s geometry is observed in the cross-section of a banana peel that has a specific graded cellular packing in a confined space. This packing enables the thin peel to protect the internal soft core from external impact loads. The cellular pattern observed in a banana peel is used to construct a finite element analysis model of the structure. The energy absorbing characteristics of the structure are evaluated and compared to the energy absorbing characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>solid</b> <b>section</b> by means <b>of</b> finite element simulations using ABAQUS.

The energy absorbing characteristics of peel structure were also compared to regular hexagonally shaped cellular honeycombs. The peel structure resulted in lower impacts and severity of deceleration-acceleration phase over regular honeycombs for higher velocity range under the same space/stroke constraints. Analytical models for low and high impact velocities were also developed to calculate the crushing strength and stroke of the graded structure...|$|R
