"Here, my dear, try {{if you can}} eat a bit o' this," [...] {{said the}} younger woman, handing some of the stew on a <b>brown</b> <b>dish</b> with an iron spoon to Maggie, who, remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her for not liking the bread-and-bacon, dared not refuse the stew, though fear had chased away her appetite. If her father would but come by in the gig and take her up! Or even if Jack the Giantkiller, or Mr. Greatheart, or St. George who slew the dragon on the half-pennies, would happen to pass that way! But Maggie thought with a sinking heart that these heroes were never seen in the {{neighborhood}} of St. Ogg's; nothing very wonderful ever came there.|$|R
6000|$|Meg in the {{meanwhile}} went to a {{great black}} cauldron that was boiling on a fire on the floor, and, lifting the lid, an odour was diffused through the vault which, if the vapours of a witch's cauldron could in aught be trusted, promised better things than the hell-broth which such vessels are usually supposed to contain. It was, in fact, the savour of a goodly stew, composed of fowls, hares, partridges, and moor-game boiled in a large mess with potatoes, onions, and leeks, and from {{the size of the}} cauldron appeared to be prepared for half a dozen of people at least. 'So ye hae eat naething a' day?' said Meg, heaving a large portion of this mess into a <b>brown</b> <b>dish</b> and strewing it savourily with salt and pepper. [Footnote: See Note 4.] ...|$|R
50|$|Kentucky's cuisine is {{generally}} similar to traditional southern cooking. Although {{in some areas}} of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest. One original Kentucky dish is called the Hot <b>Brown,</b> a <b>dish</b> normally layered in this order: toast, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with mornay sauce. It was developed at the Brown Hotel in Louisville. The Pendennis Club in Louisville is the birthplace of the Old Fashioned cocktail.

60|$|Sometimes {{you may see}} him on Sundays, at {{the hour}} when tavern doors open, whence issue little girls with great jugs of porter; when charity-boys walk the streets, bearing <b>brown</b> <b>dishes</b> of smoking {{shoulders}} of mutton and baked 'taturs; when Sheeny and Moses are seen smoking their pipes before their lazy shutters in Seven Dials; when a crowd of smiling persons in clean outlandish dresses, in monstrous bonnets and flaring printed gowns, or in crumpled glossy coats and silks that bear the creases of the drawers where they have lain all the week, file down High Street,--sometimes, I say, you may see Hugby {{coming out of the}} Church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, with a stout gentlewoman leaning on his arm, whose old face bears an expression of supreme pride and happiness as she glances round at all the neighbours, and who faces the curate himself and marches into Holborn, where she pulls the bell of a house over which is inscribed, 'Hugby, Haberdasher.' It is the mother of the Rev. F. Hugby, as proud of her son in his white choker as Cornelia of her jewels at Rome. That is old Hugby bringing up the rear with the Prayer-books, and Betsy Hugby the old maid, his daughter,--old Hugby, Haberdasher and Church-warden.|$|R

50|$|A {{salamander}} is {{a culinary}} grill characterized by very high temperature overhead electric or gas heating elements. It is used primarily in professional kitchens for overhead grilling (US: broiling).

5000|$|Qabuli {{is made by}} cooking basmati or long grained rice in a brothy sauce (which {{makes the}} rice <b>brown).</b> This <b>dish</b> may be made with lamb, chicken, or beef. Qabuli palaw is baked {{in the oven and}} may be topped with fried sliced carrots, raisins, orange peel strips, and chopped nuts like {{pistachios}} or almonds. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the rice mixture.Qabuli is popular in other countries, including Saudi Arabia, where it is also known as roz Bukhari (Arabic: رز بخاري), meaning [...] "Bukharan rice"; which is a simpler form introduced by Afghan immigrants living in Saudi Arabia.|$|R
5000|$|Bak kut teh (肉骨茶) - A Chinese-influenced dish {{found only}} {{in the region as}} well as {{neighboring}} Singapore and Malaysia. Bak kut teh means meat tea bone. Bak kut itself is pork ribs, while the word teh, whicn means tea in Hokkien, comes from the <b>dish</b> <b>brown</b> sauce which is similar to the color of a tea. This gravy is a pork broth, with spices such as garlic and strong pepper.|$|R

In the Canadian province of Quebec, French fries are often served with cheese curds and hot <b>brown</b> gravy, a <b>dish</b> called poutine.|$|R
50|$|If {{pieces of}} meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk {{and the process}} stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called gulai. If the process {{continues}} until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to <b>brown,</b> the <b>dish</b> is called kalio. For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: gulai is light yellow, kalio is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{consisting}} of potatoes, onions, and {{any kind of}} chopped or minced meat such as sausage, ham or meatballs, diced and then pan fried, it is often served with a fried egg, pickled beetroot, sour pickled gherkin, capers and sometimes ketchup or <b>brown</b> sauce. The <b>dish</b> was originally made from leftovers of past meals {{but now it is}} far more common to prepare pyttipanna from prime ingredients. Frozen pyttipanna of many varieties can be bought in almost every Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish supermarket. Many variants of the dish exist, including vegetarian and vegan dishes.|$|R
60|$|A goose, {{when it is}} swimming, is a very {{handsome}} bird, and it is most admirable when it appears on the table roasted of a delightful <b>brown,</b> with a <b>dish</b> of apple-sauce to keep it company. But, for some reason, the goose has never been treated with proper consideration. It has for hundreds of years, I expect, been considered as a silly bird. But {{there never was a}} greater mistake. If we looked at the thing in the proper light, we would not be at all ashamed to be called a goose. If any one were to call you an ostrich, I don't believe you would be very angry, but in reality it would be much more of an insult than to call you a goose, for an ostrich at times is a very silly bird.|$|R
2500|$|Poutine ( [...] ; Quebec French: [...] ) is a Canadian dish {{originating}} from {{the province of}} Quebec, originally made with French fries and cheese curds topped with a <b>brown</b> gravy. The <b>dish</b> emerged in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec area. For most of its existence, poutine was negatively perceived and mocked, which is in drastic contrast with its later popularity. In the past, poutine was even used {{as a means of}} stigmatization against the Quebec society. Today, poutine is celebrated both within Quebec and throughout the rest of Canada. It has also gained popularity in the United States. Poutine festivals are held in Drummondville, Montreal, and Quebec City, as well as in Toronto, Ottawa, Chicago and New Hampshire. Poutine is now served using different toppings and ingredients beyond the original French fries, cheese curds, and brown gravy. Nicolas Fabien-Ouellet, the author of [...] "Poutine Dynamics" [...] (a peer-reviewed article published in the journal CuiZine), suggests that with its increasing variations, poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, just like sandwiches, dumplings, soups and flatbreads.|$|R
