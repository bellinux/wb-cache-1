40|$|Monolithic Solid-state microrefrigerators have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} attention during the last ten years since they have the potential to solve some of the problems related to localized heat generation and temperature stabilization in optoelectronic, microelectronics or even <b>biological</b> <b>microchip</b> applications. Combination of the solid-state cooling with other conventional techniques like liquid cooling, offers an additional degree of freedom to control both the overall temperature of the chip and to remove hot spots. We present a new approach based on Thermal Quadrupoles Method to model the behavior of a single stage Si/SiGe microrefrigerator in the DC operating regime. The sensitivity and precision of this method come from its analytical expressions, which are based on the solution of Fourier’s heat diffusion equation in the Laplace domain. The microrefrigerator top surface temperature is calculated by taking into account all possible mechanisms of heat generation and conduction within the entire device. The 3 D heat and current spreading in the substrate is taken into account. The parasitic heat leakage to the cold junction due to heat generation and heat conduction within the metal lead is also considered. The theoretical results are then compared with experimental ones for several microrefrigerator sizes. A good agreement is found between them. Based on the simulations, the structure of the microrefrigerator is optimized for lowering the overall chip temperature and removing high power density hot spots in several applications in conjunction with liquid cooling techniques...|$|E
40|$|Presence of {{polymorphism}} in genes coding biotransformation {{system may}} {{play an important}} role in formation of primary childhood acute leukemia, and affects the incidence and features of relapse. We developed a <b>biological</b> <b>microchip</b> which allows to analyze 14 mutations in eight genes of biotransfor mation system: cyp 1 a 1, cyp 2 d 6, gstt 1, gstm 1, nat 2, mthfr, cyp 2 c 9 and cyp 2 c 19. This biochip has been used to study DNA samples from 332 children with diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) and 71 children with diagnosis of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). it was obtained that variant genotype cyp 1 a 1 * 1 /* 2 а more often occur in children with relapse of disease than in children with primary diagnosed leukemia (or = 2, 11, p = 0, 0291). Also it has been shown, that «null» gstt 1 genotype is less frequent in children with relapse of disease than in children with primary diagnosed leukemia (or = 0, 55, p = 0, 0265). Upon sex stratification, boys with relapse of all demonstrated an increased occurrence of the cyp 1 a 1 genotype * 1 /* 2 а in combination with the gstt 1 «nonnull» genotype relative to patients with primarily diagnosed all (or = 3, 09, p = 0, 0254). In addition, girls with relapse of acute leukemia displayed a 2, 4 _fold lower frequency of the «null» gstm 1 genotype as compared with the girls group with primary leukemia (or = 0, 41, p = 0, 0175). Thus, it was shown that studied genotypes cyp 1 a 1 and GST might be prognostic risk factors of relapse in childhood acute leukemia. Key words: acute leukemia, drug resistance, cytochrome p 450, glutathione-s-transferases, polymorphism, oligonucleotide biochips. </strong...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{synthetic}} nano/microscale propulsion devices has been rapidly expanding {{because of their}} ability to possess many key features necessary for bioanalytical applications on <b>biological</b> <b>microchip</b> devices and targeted in vivo delivery. Past studies focused on developing powerful and easily controllable motors by investigating different propulsion schemes (e. g. electrophoretic, bubble release, magnetically propelled) for use in physiological environments. These engineering advancements and the nanomotors inherit capabilities have allowed for their use in three research areas: motion-based biosensing, cellular and biomolecular isolation, and targeted drug delivery. The first research area investigates a unique speed increase of electrophoretically propelled nanomotors when in the presence of silver ions. Au/Pt nanomotors propel by the electrocatalytic decomposition of H 2 O 2 fuel. While most metal ions resulted in a decrease in speed to near Brownian levels, Ag+ has shown a steady increase in speed from 10 μm/s to 52 μm/s over the micro-molar range. This phenomenon was exploited by tagging nucleic acid detector probes with Ag nanoparticles when conducting simple sandwich assays. This resulted in a cheap, fast, and sensitive, motion-based readout of the concentration-dependent DNA target present on the sandwich assay. The second area of research involved the bioisolation of nucleic acids, protein, bacteria, and cancer cells by bubble-based microrockets. These microrockets contain a platinum interior to catalyze peroxide fuel and can be easily functionalized with antibodies and nucleic acid capture probes to isolate target biomolecules. The motion of these micro-isolation devices creates convection for faster isolation and can be used to transport the biomolecules to a clean environment. The third area of research is focused on targeted drug delivery by variouspropulsion methods. The ability of nanomotors to transport PLGA and liposome drug vesicles to cancer cells is shown in vitro. A powerful ultrasound-triggered propulsion mechanism is used to fire microscale bullets through various tissues, which is necessary for more advanced delivery methods. Future experiments including modeling the behavior the micro-isolation devices, developing collective behavior nanomotor schemes, and using ultrasound microbullets for in vivo bladder cancer studies are still necessary to develop true commercial applications from this promising field...|$|E
