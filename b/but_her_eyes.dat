60|$|The Princess was {{outwardly}} calm, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{were like}} steel.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{was very}} pale, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were hard and steely.|$|E
60|$|Isobel {{answered}} her steadily, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{were filled with}} shrinking fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir!" [...] replied drily the narrator, [...] "her back being {{towards the}} portrait, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fixed on its {{reflection}} in the glass." ...|$|R
60|$|Nance {{expressed}} a polite interest, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> was on Mr. Archer, who was reading his letter {{with a face}} of such extreme indifference that she was tempted to suspect him of assumption.|$|R
60|$|Miss Evers strolled on, and her Captain {{of course}} {{kept pace with}} her; so that Bernard and Miss Vivian were left {{standing}} together. He looked at her a moment in silence, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> still avoided his own.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand. She was smiling, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were grave.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed his}} hand and smiled at him, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were wet.|$|E
60|$|She was {{flushing}} {{a little}} under his stare, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were shining.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{beneath the}} picture half turned <b>her</b> body <b>but</b> not <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone. Her cheeks {{had lost}} {{a great deal of}} their healthful fire from the very {{seriousness}} of <b>her</b> position; <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> was bright with the excitement of a triumph--though it was a triumph which had rather been contemplated than desired.|$|R
60|$|Betty {{bowed to}} Alfred, <b>but</b> lowered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{instantly}} on encountering the young man's gaze.|$|R
60|$|Miss Wilson {{addressed}} the class in general, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> rested on Joe.|$|E
60|$|She laughed, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> sought her sister's with {{a certain}} watchfulness of expression.|$|E
60|$|She {{was careful}} not to {{interrupt}} him, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were full of mute questions.|$|E
60|$|Now Van Vooren went mad indeed; so mad that, forgetting {{he was not}} on {{the lonely}} veldt, he lifted his gun and fired {{straight}} at Sihamba. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> was quick, and seeing the muzzle rise, she threw herself upon the ground, so that the ball passed over her.|$|R
60|$|Carmen de Haro contritely buried {{everything}} <b>but</b> <b>her</b> black <b>eyes</b> in <b>her</b> shawl.|$|R
60|$|Amy held <b>her</b> tongue, <b>but</b> used <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and saw Meg slip a fan {{into her}} pocket.|$|R
60|$|Flora {{struggled}} for calm, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> flashed {{and the blood}} came to her skin.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Yeobright was not demonstrative, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> involuntarily glanced {{towards his}} {{singular}} though shapely figure.|$|E
60|$|Frona's {{face was}} quite pale, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were hard, brilliantly hard, and she nodded approval.|$|E
60|$|She again muttered {{something}} {{which was all}} but inaudible, <b>but</b> kept <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed upon <b>her</b> work.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} face towards him, <b>but</b> kept <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted, {{looking out of}} the window. She was flushed.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} head. She was pale, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes</b> had an indignant sparkle in them.|$|R
60|$|Diana bit {{her lips}} to {{restrain}} a frown, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which he was avoiding, flashed wickedly.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed at}} him. Her {{face was a}} little drawn with pain <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were very soft.|$|E
60|$|Her face flamed scarlet, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> met mine boldly. Between {{us there}} was a flash of {{complete}} understanding.|$|E
60|$|Once {{he pressed}} his lips lightly upon her forehead, {{and she did not}} move, <b>but</b> closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and sighed.|$|R
60|$|Maria made no reply, <b>but</b> turned <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on Delafield, with an {{affected}} {{expression of}} melancholy that excited another laugh in her friend.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>her</b> kind <b>eyes,</b> resting {{with obvious}} pride on the dainty figure beside her, belied the {{severity}} of her words.|$|R
60|$|Roger frowned. Freda's {{face was}} solemn enough <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{looked as if}} she might be {{laughing}} at him.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes seemed}} to have {{stiffened}} in their sockets, to have become dilated. Her lips trembled, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> remained steadfast.|$|E
60|$|An {{expression}} of irresolution passed {{for an instant}} over her face, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> had hardened again when she answered me.|$|E
60|$|She made no reply, <b>but</b> covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with <b>her</b> {{hand and}} turned to leave the room. He rushed forward and caught her arm.|$|R
6000|$|He {{held the}} door for <b>her,</b> <b>but</b> as she passed Sylvia lifted her face for the good night caress without which she had never left him since she became his wife. She did not speak, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> humbly besought this token of forgiveness; nor was it denied. Moor laid his hand upon her lips, saying, [...] "these are Adam's now," [...] and {{kissed her on the}} forehead.|$|R
60|$|Florence, {{without knowing}} why, felt almost afraid to hear <b>her</b> proceed, <b>but</b> kept <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> riveted on the {{beautiful}} face so fixed upon her own.|$|R
