30|$|The German Accounting Law Modernization Act {{significantly}} increased disclosure requirements {{to guarantee that}} certain information was included in financial statements. Therefore, we investigate disclosure compliance for two important changes in German GAAP. First, we extend our prior investigation of companies’ R&D activities, since capitalizing companies must provide mandatory disclosures related to their R&D activities in their notes. Second, we randomly select 300 companies and investigate their disclosures for other provisions, which are found in a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> whose measurement principles fundamentally changed after {{the adoption of the}} requirements.

Other provisions offer an appropriate possibility to investigate companies’ willingness to disclose information because § 285 (12) German GAAP only provides the vague formulation that companies must disclose more information on specific other provisions when there is no separate presentation in the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and recent other provisions are worth a substantial amount.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to formulate and model a multi period scenario optimisation problem and to obtain recommendations for optimal <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> portfolio. To do this the study gathers data from the public financial statements of the case company Aktia PLC, explains the relevant framework and model specifications, describes the actual optimisation model and finally presents the analysis of the results. The process combines many aspects of finance, decision making and optimisation. The portfolio optimisation problem is done over multiple periods with simulated future scenarios by formulating a tree representing the possible future outcomes. The academic background combines aspects from information management and finance. The frameworks are selected from several different journals and fields in business studies and economics. The study explains the theoretical framework around the main topics of financial portfolio management, decision making and scenario optimisation. For the methodology the thesis aims to form qualitative research on the theories behind the model and the case company data in the form of literature review. The more quantitative research is done on the actual optimisation model and the analysis of these results. The case company was selected to allow for quantitative research and to show that the model works in real life. The results from the model conclude with an optimal solution and a suggestion for changes made in one year for the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> portfolio. The results were heavily affected by the inputs and thus different solutions could be obtained easily. The base line model performed very well in comparison to other options. When comparing to the actual realisation for the most recently published data, the model showed a slight reduction in profits with the strong positive effect on <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> growth.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the {{mandatory}} adoption of IFRS in Europe in 2005 on conditional conservatism. To capture conditional conservatism, we use three measures: the Basu (1997) measure, the Khan and Watts (2009) measure, and a measure controlling for potential shifts in unconditional conservatism and cost of capital after the adoption of IFRS. From a sample of 7, 251 firm-year observations drawn from 16 European countries, we document an overall decline of the degree of conditional conservatism across our three measures. While there is no change in weak enforcement/governance countries which remain less conditionally conservative than strong enforcement/governance countries, the latter exhibit a significant decrease. Further, we demonstrate that the decline is more significant for firms carrying intangible assets and goodwill in their <b>balance</b> <b>sheets,</b> <b>items</b> for which impairment tests rely on unverifiable fair value estimates. We argue that IFRS are conceptually conditionally conservative but that inappropriate application of conditional conservatism principles may have prevented financial reporting from reaching the level of conservatism targeted by the IASB...|$|R

Here, ‘credit-related practices’ are, first, the bank <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> called ‘loans’ in general, and second, loans in terms of their types. By ‘theory’ we mean Islamic economics. In attaining the {{aim of this}} paper, we use comparative methodology depending on quantitative and qualitative research. In this context, we utilize quantitative methods like collecting calculating and representing -through figures and charts- relevant data, and qualitative methods such as searching through, selecting, summarizing and evaluating relevant literature and documents like agreements and reports concerning the subject. Some of the outstanding results of this paper are as follows; loans are the dominant use of funds for Turkish Islamic banks with changing ratios between 60 - 75 % for the period of December 2005 -June 2015 and the main method used for loans is murabahah with 99. 7 % as of June 2015. Secondly, 91 % of household loans are in the form of consumer credits as of June 2015, among which house loans are sweepingly dominant.

40|$|Cash pooling is a {{bank service}} that allows {{corporates}} to externalise the intra-group cash management, and thus manage their global liquidity effectively with lower costs. Although {{there is little}} quantitative information on {{the significance of the}} phenomenon, cash pooling appears to have become increasingly popular after the onset of the financial crisis when, in an environment characterised by limited access to capital markets, reduced bank lending, low returns and higher risks on banks' deposits, corporate groups started to maximise their use of internal sources of financing. In particular, cash pooling is currently very relevant in Western and Northern European countries, and is mainly offered in the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. This paper first analyses cash pooling agreements with a focus on the aspects that are relevant from a statistical viewpoint. It then addresses their statistical recording in compliance with ESA 2010 and, specifically, the methodological framework of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFI) <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>item</b> statistics. It is proposed that positions related to cash pooling shall be recorded on a gross basis vis- 0 -vis the actual beneficiaries and obligors of the corresponding accounts. However, the proposed treatment goes beyond MFI <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> statistics and affects other data domains as well, ranging from financial accounts to balance of payments and international investment positions. While the statistical approach may seem straightforward, applying it in practice is more difficult, not least because of the treatment of cash pooling contracts in accounting terms. The analysis is complemented by numerical examples and also includes data for the Netherlands, which show the importance of clarifying the statistical treatment of cash pooling in light of the large impact it may have on macroeconomic aggregates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a financial statement analysis that distinguishes leverage that arises in financing activities from leverage that arises in operations. The analysis yields two leveraging equations, one for borrowing to finance operations {{and one for}} borrowing {{in the course of}} operations. These leveraging equations describe how the two types of leverage affect book rates of return on equity. An empirical analysis shows that the financial statement analysis explains cross-sectional differences in current and future rates of return as well as price-to-book ratios, which are based on expected rates of return on equity. The paper therefore concludes that <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> line <b>items</b> for operating liabilities are priced differently than those dealing with financing liabilities. Accordingly, financial statement analysis that distinguishes the two types of liabilities informs on future profitability and aids in the evaluation of appropriate price-to-book ratios...|$|R
