5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by rinsing and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was to develop an {{innovative}} food product with nutritional properties as well as appealing organoleptic qualities. The product, a jam, was prepared with the beans’ cooking water combined with fresh apple or carrot, without the addition of any conservatives. Three different jams were produced: <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> carrot, <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> apple <b>and</b> <b>bean,</b> apple <b>and</b> cinnamon. The developed products underwent a sensorial analysis that revealed that the <b>bean,</b> apple <b>and</b> cinnamon jam was globally better accepted. However, with this study, the consumers determined that the <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> carrot jam had the most attractive color <b>and</b> the <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> apple jam the better consistency. Additionally, it was possible to analyze the jams for their chemical components, namely fat, fiber, protein, sugars and antioxidant activity. The obtained results showed that the <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> carrot jam had the highest lipid content, while the <b>bean,</b> apple <b>and</b> cinnamon jam had the highest fiber content, when compared to the other two jams. Regarding the sugar content, both jams with apple revealed similar sugar values, which were higher than the sugar content of the <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> carrot jam.

The experimental treatments consisted of sole cropping of corn, white bean, bush bean, red <b>bean,</b> pinto <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> sword <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> 50 : 50 ratio of corn <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> types. In this experiment, the corn-bush <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> corn-pinto <b>bean</b> intercropping had the highest seed yield (5734. 4 and 5674. 3 kg/ha- 1, respectively) and land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 13 and 1. 21, respectively). Evaluated intercropping indices indicated that red bean (k= 1. 85), pinto bean (k= 2. 41) <b>and</b> sword <b>bean</b> (k= 2. 80) had the highest crowding coefficient whereas the maximum aggressivity value was belonged to pinto bean intercropped with corn (A= - 0. 02). Also, both the red <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> pinto <b>bean</b> (CR= 0. 75 and CR= 0. 98, respectively) had the maximum competitive ratio.

5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, <b>beans,</b> <b>and</b> potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|By 6000 BC, {{the early}} {{inhabitants}} of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, {{a process that}} {{eventually led to the}} establishment of sedentary agricultural societies. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, <b>beans,</b> <b>and</b> squashes. All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage, but various grains, <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E

Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla.
