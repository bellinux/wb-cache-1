40|$|This study {{examines}} the affect of <b>business</b> <b>segment</b> <b>industry</b> specialization {{as a supplement}} to portfolio complexity on forecast error and Tobin’s Q. After controlling for diversification and growth potential, forecast error is negatively related to <b>business</b> <b>segment</b> <b>industry</b> specialization. Diversification (high growth firms) increases (decreases) forecast error. High growth, focused firms are associated with noncomplex portfolios and <b>business</b> <b>segment</b> <b>industry</b> specialization. Within a simultaneous equation model, forecast error does not predict the firm’s Tobin Q ratio; however, Tobin’s Q does predict whether analysts forecast accurately...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{corporate}} product diversification as {{a dynamic}} process. Consistent with prior research, {{we find that}} the average diversification discount is about 8 % when using the standard value-multiple approach. However, we find that {{a significant portion of the}} diversification discount arises from benchmark comparisons of value ratios of mature firms with those of very young firms that are more likely to have high value multiples. The magnitude of the diversification discount falls by 15 % to 30 % when we control for firm age. We also show that diversification reduces the mortality rate of firms, and we provide evidence that mature firms pursue diversification strategies partly as a means to exit stagnant <b>business</b> <b>segments</b> for <b>industries</b> that are more highly valued.

40|$|A {{profession}} must be {{built upon}} a sound {{body of knowledge}} in order for its professional status to be recognized and considered credible by society (Zeigler, 1987). The body of literature should also reflect and define the field (Fielding, Pitts, & Miller, 1991). To that end, examining the state of a body of literature is essential as the findings can reveal such significant information as content, trends, author collaboration, and topical gaps and disparities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the European Sport Management Quarterly and its predecessor the European Journal for Sport Management. A content analysis of the journal from 1994 to 2012 was the methodology employed. Results determined that a vast majority of the papers are in four content areas – “Management and Organizational Skills in Sport”, “Sport Business in the Social Context”, “Sport Marketing”, and “Sport Economics”. Sport <b>business</b> <b>industry</b> <b>segments</b> as a focus of the papers stayed relatively the same over the years, although “International Sport” increased much more than any other <b>industry</b> <b>segment.</b> The gender focus of the articles was primarily male, and the authorship and editorial membership was also male-focused. The geographical dispersion of both authors and editorial review board members has broadened over time to be less European. Academics may find information from this study useful in developing strategies and lines of inquiry in research agendas. As well, editors of journals may utilize the findings to plan strategies related to addressing gaps or disparities...|$|R
30|$|The main {{observations}} from the detailed {{results of the}} survey can be summarized as follows. All the studied Wild Cards {{were found to be}} relevant by the experts in terms of their potential impact on the transport industries, the breadth of their effect and the vulnerability of the various <b>industry</b> <b>segments.</b> Based on the median of the experts’ responses, 12 Wild Cards will have “high” or “very high” impact on at least one <b>industry</b> <b>segment,</b> if they occur. For only two Wild Cards the fullest impact, on at least one <b>industry</b> <b>segment,</b> is “medium”. The time by which the full impact is reached varies among the Wild Cards.|$|R
40|$|Within an industry, stock {{returns of}} larger firms lead those of smaller firms, {{suggesting}} an intraindustry information diffusion process. Most <b>industry</b> leaders, however, have <b>business</b> <b>segments</b> in other <b>industries</b> (henceforth, minor-segment industries), whereas most small firms are pure players operating in one industry only. If investors cannot filter out the irrelevant {{information from the}} leaders' minor segments, the pure players will be mispriced due to spurious cross-industry information diffusion (SCIID). Consistent with the SCIID hypothesis, we document both a strong contemporaneous and a lead–lag relation in stock returns between firms from industry leaders' minor-segment industries and pure players in the industry leaders' major-segment industry. Our results are not due to potential missing common factors or economic relationships between pure players and firms in the minor-segment industries...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} profit-maximizing neoclassical model of optimal firm size and growth across {{different}} industries based on differences in industry fundamentals and firm productivity. In the model, a conglomerate discount {{is consistent with}} profit maximization. The model predicts how conglomerate firms will allocate resources across divisions over the business cycle and how their responses to industry shocks will {{differ from those of}} single-segment firms. Using plant level data, we find that growth and investment of conglomerate and single-segment firms is related to fundamental <b>industry</b> factors and individual <b>segment</b> level productivity. The majority of conglomerate firms exhibit growth across <b>industry</b> <b>segments</b> that is consistent with optimal behavior. SEVERAL RECENT ACADEMIC PAPERS and the business press claim that conglomerate firms destroy value and do a poor job of investing across <b>business</b> <b>segments.</b> 1 Explanations for this underperformance share {{the idea that there is}} an imperfection either in firm governance ~agency theory! or in financial markets ~incorrect valuation of firm <b>industry</b> <b>segments!.</b> These studies implicitly assume that the conglomerates and single-industry firms possess similar ability to compete, and that they differ mainly in that conglomerate...|$|R

This exploratory research investigates open innovation practices which are evident in metal fabrication <b>industry</b> <b>segment</b> in Sri Lanka, determines whether the <b>industry</b> <b>segment</b> has perceived a need for practicing activities suggested by open innovation framework, and challenges for implementation. Drawing a sample of 31 companies from metal fabrication industry in Sri Lanka, the open innovation practices were surveyed basically under technology exploration and technology exploitation, perceived need for collaborations are surveyed with respect to nine external parties, and challenges were surveyed with respect to forming effective collaborations and networks. Under the technology exploitation, forming joint ventures, start up companies or outward licensing are practiced in very low scale in the metal fabrication <b>industry</b> <b>segment.</b> The collaborations with customer and, the supplier are relatively higher whereas collaborations with universities and R&D labs are lower. In general, the metal fabrication industry has perceived a need for implementing practices suggested by open innovation framework. The <b>industry</b> <b>segment</b> has basically given an average rating on the eleven challenges which were surveyed as against forming effective collaborations and networks. Out of. the eleven, cultural mismatch has seen as the lowest influence for collaborations whereas competition for market share has seen as the highest.
