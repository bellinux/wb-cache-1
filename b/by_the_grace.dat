In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian cuneiform of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E
5|$|In Orissa, {{the goddess}} is worshipped in the lying-in {{room on the}} sixth day after {{childbirth}}, on the 21st day after childbirth and on every subsequent birthday of the child until he or she reaches the age of sixteen.

By these rites, it is believed a childless woman may gain offspring, while a mother may secure the longevity and welfare of her child <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of the goddess.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} Tudor monarchs, {{including}} Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> of God alone. The crown could also {{rely on the}} exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative. These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons {{and the power to}} summon and dissolve parliament as and when required. Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch worked within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and parliament (representing the gentry).|$|E
5|$|Walter Raleigh Gilbert (16 September 1853 – 26 July 1924) was an English amateur cricketer {{who played}} {{first-class}} cricket for Middlesex and Gloucestershire between 1873 and 1886. A cousin of W. G. Grace, {{he played for}} Gloucestershire when, dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> family, it was the leading county. Gilbert's best season was 1876, when he scored 205 not out for the county, but he was subsequently less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional touring team of which he eventually became secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining interest in such teams. With insufficient income to continue as an amateur he became a professional in 1886, but played only one match before he was caught stealing from teammates in a minor match, ending his first-class career. After serving a 28-day prison sentence Gilbert moved to Canada, where {{he worked for the}} Land Titles Office in Calgary while remaining a prominent cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, {{there seemed to be a}} conspiracy of silence over his fate.|$|E
