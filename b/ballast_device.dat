50|$|The Zeppelin NT has {{no special}} {{facilities}} {{to offset the}} extra buoyancy by fuel consumption. Compensation takes place by using a start-weight that {{is higher than the}} buoyancy lifting level at the start and during the flight, the extra dynamic buoyancy needed for lift-off and flight is produced with engines. If, during the trip, the ship becomes lighter than air because of fuel consumption, the swivel engines are used for down pressure and landing. The relatively small size of the Zeppelin NT and a range of only 900 kilometers compared to the historical Zeppelins allowed the waiver of a <b>ballast</b> extraction <b>device.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{lighting}} system having a high pressure {{gas discharge lamp}} intended to be operated on a stabilization ballast further includes a low loss device to reduce the current through the ballast and lamp, thereby reducing system wattage for energy savings. For a lead-type ballast, the current reducing device is a capacitive device in parallel with the discharge lamp. For a lag-type <b>ballast,</b> the <b>device</b> is an inductive device in parallel with the lamp. The device {{may be in a}} housing connected between the lamp ballast and the lamp, or may be included within the outer envelope of the discharge lamp. This enables an existing system to be easily retrofit without disturbing the existing ballast...|$|R
25|$|A {{lighting}} <b>ballast</b> is a <b>device</b> {{to provide}} proper starting and operating electrical conditions to light {{one or more}} fluorescent lamps, while also limiting the amount of current. A familiar and widely used example is the traditional inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps, to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube's negative resistance characteristic. A disadvantage of using an inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor power factor.|$|R
50|$|Vessels {{are also}} subject to ocean surface waves and sea swell {{as well as}} effects of wind and weather. These {{movements}} can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by <b>ballasting</b> or by <b>devices</b> such as fin stabilizers. Pitching movement {{is more difficult to}} limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.|$|R
2500|$|An {{electrical}} <b>ballast</b> is a <b>device</b> {{which limits}} the current through an electrical load. These {{are most often}} used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases. [...] If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it will be destroyed or caused the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive resistance or reactance that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.|$|R

Thus {{it can be said}} that a system of ship ballast water treatment has, correctly or incorrectly, sufficiently or insufficiently, neutralized unwanted organisms in ship ballast water. The water analysis, to check live biomass on board the ship, has to be performed by the recirculation of the ballast tank by tank in purpose to achieve effective and credible measurement. The use of such a device by one of the crew members would require an additional training.|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} the ship ballast water {{treatment}} systems neutralization need to be verified in a transparent and trustful way before the ship enters a port. Some researches and results, explained in this article, confirm {{a need for a}} good verification. If there is no good methodology agreed, then it would not be accepted the solution that the BWMC (Ballast Water Management Convention) 2004 did protect the sea environment in full meaning. The main problem of ballast neutralization are remaining microorganisms (algae blooms, bacteria) ≥ 10 and < 50. Autonomy of the future <b>ballast</b> water detection <b>device</b> has been explained and newest detection methods analyzed. The ranking analysis has been done thru PROMETHEE II (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) and results were shown by D-Sight software projections.|$|R
40|$|Track {{performance}} was assessed {{in terms of}} vertical track settlement, and the {{factors that contribute to}} these settlements at specific field sites. The sites consisted of: (1) in-service revenue track having concrete and wood cross-ties and (2) wood and concrete tie sections from the DOT Facility for Accelerated Service Testing. ^ Field tests were conducted to assess the physical states of the ballast materials prior to a track maintenance operation. The physical state tests were repeated after the surfacing to determine the resulting changes in the ballast properties. Standard penetration tests, Dutch cone tests, and undisturbed tube sampling for laboratory tests were used to investigate the subgrade. ^ The dynamic wheel load distributions at each site were measured. A method was presented to account for the mix of wheel loads that contributed to the track deformations. ^ The stress-dependent resilient moduli of the ballast materials were derived from repeated load triaxial tests, with and without shear stress reversals. The resilient moduli of the subgrades were determined from repeated load triaxial tests and site-specific correlations with the standard and Dutch cone penetration tests. ^ A three dimensional, nonlinear, elastic, multilayer model, GEOTRACK, was used to estimate the stresses and deformations in the track foundations. The model was validated by comparing the predicted elastic foundation responses with those measured at FAST. Comparisons of measured and predicted track modulus were also made for the revenue field sites. ^ The inelastic behavior of the soil was investigated using repeated load triaxial tests and a <b>ballast</b> box <b>device</b> for simulating field conditions. A strain superposition method was developed to account for the deformations that resulted from repeated applications of the mixed field loading conditions. The predicted values of track settlement were compared to field measurements obtained using soil strain gages and surveying from benchmarks. ^ The track modulus and settlement predictions were of the same order of magnitude as the measured values. However, some differences in trends were observed. The study concludes with a discussion of the factors that were not accounted for in the methodology, and the implications of these factors in track performance. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} single stage electronic ballast for a conventional 250 W High Pressure Sodium (HPS) street lighting. Historically the HPS street lighting operating hours is from sunset to dawn which is 12 hours in full brightness. The existing conventional street lighting HPS are powered by magnetic ballasts. The magnetic <b>ballast</b> is a <b>device</b> which consists of coil and core. It is an uncontrolled device, not energy efficient and generate flicker before it can give steady light. The use of electronic ballast provides a rapid start and energy efficient but will create electromagnetic interference and harmonic. This will reduce the circuit performance. To overcome the problems, the single stage design electronic ballast {{is used for the}} HPS lamp. The effect of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) and harmonic to the designed system is assessed. This is performed in three different stages; (i) with and without EMI filter, (ii) the half-bridge and (iii) the full-bridge inverter. For stage (ii) and (iii), the comparison of harmonic produced in electronic ballast was evaluated. The operating frequency for electronic ballast is 68 kHz. The findings show that the Total Harmonic Distortion current (THDi) of 5. 55 % for full bridge inverter compared to the half bridge inverter with THDi of 8. 73 %. A reduction of 36 % of THD is obtained when full bridge inverter is applied. The current waveform result indicates a reduction of 25 % without EMI filter from the original waveform. The reduction of both EMI and THDi can give benefit to street lighting system and energy efficiency...|$|R
50|$|To power an HMI bulb, special {{ballasts}} {{act as an}} ignitor {{to start}} the arc, and then regulate it by acting as a choke. Two types of ballasts exist: magnetic and electronic (square-wave or flicker-free). Magnetic ballasts are generally much heavier and bulkier than electronic ballasts, as they consist primarily {{of a network of}} large inductors. They are usually cheaper than electronic ballasts. Since the magnetic type of ballast does not maintain the discharge continuously, the lamp actually extinguishes at zero-crossings of the mains waveform; unless the camera is locked to the mains waveform, the difference in frequency between the lamp and the shutter will produce a beat frequency that is visible in the resulting recording. This is why TV standards typically use the power grid frequency as their basic frame rate. Magnetic <b>ballasts</b> are simple <b>devices</b> compared to electronic ballasts. Essentially, a magnetic ballast is a large, heavy transformer coil that uses a simple principle to generate the high startup voltages needed to create an arc in a cold lamp. Input power is routed to a choke coil connected between the main input and the lamp. The coil may be tapped in several places to provide for various input voltages (120 V or 240 V) and a high start-up voltage. Capacitors are also included to compensate for the inductance of the coil and improve the power factor. Because of the high amount of current through the ballast, a low humming sound is often heard due to magnetostriction of the ballast iron laminations. Some magnetic ballasts have insulation around the coil for silent operation.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{consider}} the possibility and provide specific solutions to create the automated system of track maintenance on the example of automation of technological operations to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper foundation. The relevance of the work {{stems from the fact}} that the modern and perspective requirements to the track maintenance in the conditions of the transition to high-speed, high-speed, high-tonnage traffic can be implemented only by switching to a new system of track maintenance based on the performance of work of specialized high-performance machines and on the new system with maximum opportunity for automation technology. More than half of the volume of works on the current maintenance of the tracks are the works on the removal of splashes, straightening and tamping of track, the technology of which can be divided into two components: calculation-evaluation and the generation of control actions on the railway track. Track machines are used extensively at the local bearing places of the occurrence of splashes on track sections or for continuous bearing plot ways to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper base and reduce the degree of non-uniformity deviations in rails’ position on level and in plan, as well as track subsidence. The bunker for filling the ballast may be mounted on additional frame or on offset brackets of the machine. The device for measuring the position of a railway track includes the means for measuring the deflections of the road, bending rise the track in the longitudinal profile and the position of the track on level (elevation of one rail in relation to another) and the adjacent block determining the actual position of a railway track in plan, in longitudinal profile and on level. The block of determining the amount of ballast consists of interconnected devices for determining the value of shifts and raise of the track and the block of comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling of <b>ballast.</b> A <b>device</b> for determining the magnitudes of the shifts and the track raise consists of the interconnected unit for comparing the actual position of the track with a given (estimated) position of the track and a block determining the values of the track shifts and raise, which also provides the conversion of the recorded deflections of the track in the longitudinal profile in the track subsidence. The block comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling the ballast, compares the magnitude of the track raise, determines changes in the transverse area of a prism in case of track raise and determines the amount needed for ballast filling. It also controls the control unit of the device for filling the ballast. The authors developed and tested the schemes of using the elements of technological processes automation during the operation of hopper dispenser with the track surfacing, which will allow reducing the duration of track possessions and will speed up the track maintenance...|$|R
