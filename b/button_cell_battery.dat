50|$|A typical blinky is a {{small metal}} two piece {{cylinder}} wide enough to accept a <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery</b> with a very small etched circuit board on the face and threads on the open end, paired with a cylinder cap which screws on to seal and secure as one. The flashing LED circuit board face can be round and enclosed by cylinder, or a variety larger colored shapes such as logos that are glued to the outside face of the cylinder end. Common designs utilize a rubber ring gasket as an on/off switch - when placed between the batteries and circuit board inside the front cover, tightening the screw base deforms and flattens the gasket forcing the battery tip to contact {{the back of the}} printed circuit board which completes the circuit.|$|E
50|$|The Liberator {{was based}} on a Zilog Z80A {{microprocessor}} and a Gate array implementing the screen controller, keyboard interface and other I/O logic. The LCD display had a resolution of 480 x 128 pixels, or 80 columns by 16 lines of text. Interfaces comprised two S5/8 serial ports and two expansion buses, one specifically for extra RAM. Two battery packs were available, a NiCad rechargeable pack giving 12 hours operation, or one holding four AA cell giving 16 hours. The Liberator had 40 kB of internal RAM as standard, plus an optional 24 kB which could be write-protected by means of an external switch and had its own <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery</b> to provide non-volatile storage. Another 24 kB of non-volatile RAM could be plugged into the external RAM expansion bus.|$|E
50|$|The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition was {{released}} in 2004 as an upgrade to the TI-83 Plus. Like the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, it features a 15 MHz Zilog Z80 processor and 24 kB user available RAM. The chip has 128 kB, but TI has not made an OS that uses all of it. Newer calculators have a RAM chip that is only 48 kB. All calculators with the letter H or later as the last letter in the serial code have fewer ram pages, causing some programs to not run correctly. There is 1.5 MB of user-accessible Flash ROM. Like the standard TI-84 Plus, the Silver Edition includes a built-in USB port, a built-in clock, and assembly support. It uses 4 AAA batteries and a backup <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery.</b> The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition comes preloaded {{with a variety of}} applications. These programs are also available for the TI-84 Plus, but some must be downloaded separately from TI's website. It is manufactured by Kinpo Electronics.|$|E

40|$|A {{miniature}} intra-oral {{dental implant}} system including a built-in biosensor device is proposed in this article. The dental implant system, or platform, is replaced over maxilla and allows relatively non-invasive procedures for a novel biosensing scheme for human blood analysis. Due to {{placement of the}} implant fixture, periodontal ligaments and the pulp structure, which are regarded as the main origin of pain, are thus removed, and long-term, continuous blood analysis and management through maxillary bone marrow becomes achievable through the dental implant platform. The new pathway of biological sensing is {{for the first time}} presented to realize an accurate and painless approach without injections. The dental implant system mainly consists of an implant fixture and a prosthetic abutment, a biosensor module, a bluetooth 4. 0 wireless module and a dc <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> <b>battery.</b> The electrochemical biosensor possesses three electrodes, including working, reference and counter ones, which are arranged to pass through the titanium implant fixture below the biosensor module. The electrodes are exposed to the blood pool inside the maxillary bone marrow and perform oxidation/reduction reactions with the coating of biosensing enzyme. To prove the proposed platform, the immobilization process of glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme and in vitro detections of glucose levels are successfully carried out, and proven sensitivity, linearity and repeatability of the glucose biosensor system are obtained. Moreover, a preliminary canine animal model adopting the new pathway shows significant consistency with the traditional method through dermal pricks for blood sugar detection. Despite the prospective results, further challenges in engineering implementation and clinical practices are addressed and discussed. In brief, the novel biosensing pathway and intra-oral biosensor platform may increasingly reveal their promising value and feasibilities in current bio-medical analysis, diagnosis, drug release and even healthcare technologies...|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine.

40|$|<b>Button</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are used}} in clocks, thermometers, remote controls, toys and other devices, and they are usually {{discarded}} in the trash once its useful life is over.

First, silver determination is performed in different models of these batteries and leaching with nitric acid is carried out. Affinity study is done between several commercial ex-tractants for silver. The best performing extractant is the bis(2 -ethylhexyl) dithiophosphoric acid (D 2 EHDTPA). Furthermore, {{a study of the}} extraction yields as a function of extractant concentra-tion and time is performed. The distribution isotherm is determined; complex extracted in organic phase and stripping conditions have been identified. With the aim of obtaining industrial applica-tion, a number of steps for a countercurrent process were defined by the McCabe-Thiele method. Finally, a study was done in micropilot scale.

40|$|Using {{a variety}} of the latest micropower, high-precision IC components, it’s {{possible}} to design a low power heart rate monitor (HRM) that also packs in additional features. This article discusses these components and features. T he rigors of designing a portable heart rate monitor are enough to give anyone a case of angina. For starters, cardiac monitors must meet the highest standards for safety, reliability, and accuracy. Designers must also contend with the power constraints of <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> <b>batteries.</b> Add the market demand for added functionality but no increase in space, power, or cost to the requirement list and the heartburn sets in. Fortunately, there’s relief. Using {{a variety of}} the latest micropower, high-precision IC components, it’s possible to design a low power heart rate monitor (HRM) that also packs in additional features. The most critical function of the low power ICs is extending the battery life of an HRM, which measures a patient’s heart rate in real time or records it for later study. Portable HRMs operate from batteries {{for long periods of}} time, and require low current consumption. Low voltage batteries have been used for decades as the single power source in Holter monitors and other portable ECG systems to ensure safety. The last thing a heart patient or the sensitive equipment needs is a zap of “hot ” line voltage. Micropower ICs operate on low voltage and current, thus conserving battery power. ANALOG FRONT-END OF HRM Calculating heart rate and displaying ECG waves is the primary purpose of an HRM, which should also provide lead off detection. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of an HRM design. The analog front end uses micropower instrumentation amplifiers (in-amps) and operational amplifiers (op amps), as well as a microconverter, which includes a 12 -bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), sample-and-hold amplifier, and digital processor. The processed data is sent to a PC for display...|$|R
