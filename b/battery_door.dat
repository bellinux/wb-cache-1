5000|$|That same year, Electric Engineering & Supply Company were {{manufacturers}} and dealers in electric lighting and street railway supplies and specialized {{in the manufacture}} of switchboards, cut outs and [...] "all special designs." [...] The company advertised they could supply <b>batteries,</b> <b>door</b> bells, electric gas lighting outfits, lamps, sockets, switches, rosettes, telephones, fan motors, automatic clocks and electric clocks as well as electric motors and dynamos. They were located at 308 and 310 West Jefferson Street. The manager was H. J. Gorke. and Jesse Lorenzo Hinds was superintendent and former mechanic for the firm.|$|R
5000|$|... 19 December 1973. Ealing rail crash. No. 1007 Western Talisman derailed while hauling {{an express}} {{passenger}} train, after an unlocked <b>battery</b> box <b>door</b> fell open, broke off and changed points under the locomotive. Ten people died.|$|R
50|$|Two {{models of}} motor winder were produced. The {{original}} 110 Winder took 2 AA batteries and could wind through 100 cartridges of 110 film with {{one set of}} batteries. It worked only in single-shot mode. It took about 1.5 s to wind a frame. The 110 Winder II, introduced in 1982, added a continuous shooting mode and improved the <b>battery</b> cover <b>door,</b> which was fragile on the original.|$|R
5000|$|A known {{issue with}} the camera was the battery {{compartment}} door, which was made from plastic. A somewhat cumbersome dual-action latching mechanism for the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> often complicated this issue and, if operated incorrectly, could result in damage. Any damage to the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> was troublesome, as the camera would not work at all if the door is unlatched. Fortunately, the door was and is an inexpensive part and could be replaced simply. Otherwise the (new to the 950) magnesium body proved a durable and rugged upgrade from the 900.|$|E
50|$|The {{calculator}} {{had many}} functions {{buried in a}} menu structure. The clamshell design was fairly robust, but the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> is the shortcoming of this whole line; 18C, 19B, and 28C/S.|$|E

50|$|The Series 2000 was a {{complete}} rework of the Reference and Commande lines of pedals. These were higher quality pedals, with electronic FET switching and dual LED indicators. They had a new contoured shape, an all-metal chassis and an easily removable plastic <b>battery</b> compartment <b>door.</b> These were fully rubberized on the bottom surface and were remote-controllable. Most of the pedals had two outputs that provide two distinctly {{different versions of the}} same pedal.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Mooney made further {{incremental}} {{improvements to}} the M20B and named it the M20C Ranger. Major changes from the M20B includes greater deflection on control surfaces, reduced the cowl flap opening for greater engine cooling, improved exhaust scavenging with a Hanlon & Wilson exhaust system, new <b>battery</b> access <b>door,</b> more powerful landing light, lightweight floor, increased gross weight to 2575 pounds, lighter empty weight, new instrument panel layout, and increased wing flap angles to 33 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Other {{additions}} on the Canon 40D include interchangeable focusing screens, an AF-ON button, the EOS Integrated Cleaning System for sensor dust reduction, rubber strips {{around the}} <b>battery</b> and CF <b>doors</b> for improved weather sealing and three new optional accessories: an IS {{version of the}} 18-55mm kit lens; a new backward-compatible, live view mode, and a weather-sealed battery grip.|$|R
5000|$|Some users {{experienced}} random resets at {{one time}} or another. Although the cause was unknown, a complete reset via the Reset button {{on the back of the}} phone under the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> could keep the phone stable and running most of the day.|$|E
50|$|The rear of {{the camera}} {{features}} a flashbulb eject button, the viewfinder, and a red disc to protect the film from accidental exposure while providing readout of the current film position. It also features a <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> to power the flash, requiring two 1.5 volt Penlite batteries of at least 3.5 amperes each.|$|E
50|$|The ATIV S is {{available}} with 16 or 32 GB of internal storage with micro SDXC expansion {{for up to}} an additional 128 GB or more. It further features a 2300mAh removable battery and a brushed-metal look of the <b>battery</b> <b>door.</b> Overall, the hardware {{is very similar to}} the Android-based Galaxy S III.|$|E
50|$|Some {{fire doors}} are held open by an electromagnet, {{which may be}} wired to a fire alarm system. If the power fails or the fire alarm is activated, the coil is de-energized, and the door closer closes the <b>door.</b> Wireless, <b>battery</b> {{operated}} fire <b>door</b> retainers {{can also be used}} to safely and legally hold fire doors open.|$|R
50|$|The Rio PMP300 {{suffers from}} a few notable design flaws. The <b>battery</b> {{compartment}} <b>door</b> flap is notorious for breaking. The battery cover is difficult to repair due to the stress caused by the spring-loaded battery compartment and the fragile plastic used for the door clips. The metal hinge used to hold the compartment {{to the base of}} the unit would also put strain on the plastic casing, causing cracks around the SmartMedia slot. Furthermore, the silver coating applied to the main central control button in the original 32 MB unit would often peel and flake off with use. The control disc would commonly fall off.|$|R
50|$|The male Scavengers must wire up a <b>battery</b> {{to their}} <b>door</b> before {{describing}} {{a series of}} six symbols to their partners. If the female Scavengers input the correct symbols in a keypad the correct order of these symbols will be revealed. They can now describe these back to their partners who can input their symbols on their own keypad, in the right order, and open the doors.|$|R
50|$|As a lower-end camera, the AL-1 did {{not offer}} {{a long list of}} features. Instead, Canon focused on {{providing}} core functionality and lowering price. The AL-1 provides focus-confirmation, aperture-priority autoexposure (controlled by a through-the-lens silicon photocell), and a small selection of manual shutter speeds, including 10 second self-timer. It also added a larger grip, and the convenience of using of AAA cells for power. However the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> is one of its weakness as most of the cameras that are found today on the market have their <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> broken or that has been changed. Its body was constructed from a special polycarbonate that was then painted to imitate metal. An ISO hotshoe, motor-drive connections, and cable-release socket provide an acceptable level of compatibility with accessories. It was also the last SLR camera to carry Canon's 1960s-era logo on the pentaprism.|$|E
50|$|At first glance, {{the most}} notable {{difference}} between the Palm III and its predecessor, the PalmPilot, is the more rugged and streamlined case. Other differences include a removable hard cover to protect the screen, removal of the memory door, a more recessed contrast adjustment knob, an infrared port, and a <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> less prone to accidentally falling off.|$|E
5000|$|The {{activity}} meter is a pedometer included with Personal Trainer: Walking (also named [...] "Walk With Me"). It communicates with the DS using an infra-red transceiver {{built into the}} top of the Meter and one in {{the end of the game}} cartridge, meaning it works with all DS consoles. Its only display is an LED which changes its colour and flashing pattern once the user reaches their daily step goal; all other information has to be viewed by transferring it to the Nintendo DS cartridge. The device will store the last 7 days of detailed activity statistics, and the last 60 days of total step counts. There is a clip built into the Meter's <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> allowing it to be attached to a person's clothes or a dog's collar; a flat <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> without the clip is also included. The Meter is available in various colours to allow them to be distinguished.|$|E
50|$|In this challenge, {{the contestants}} must build a shelf that will house {{a set of}} speakers, their {{electrical}} panel, {{as well as the}} two batteries that will be storing the power to their sheds. To protect the <b>batteries</b> from dust, <b>doors</b> must be installed where they are housed. The contestants also have access to a chop saw (although a crew member will do the cutting on the chop saw). Meanwhile, the floor is to be cleaned in preparation for installing the floor later.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive, Class 52 diesel-hydraulic number 1007 Western Talisman, {{had spent}} the {{previous}} night at Old Oak Common depot and had had its <b>batteries</b> recharged. A <b>door</b> on the <b>battery</b> box had been left unlocked and fell open shortly into the journey. It hit the platform at Ealing Broadway, breaking the arms supporting it and allowing it to swing down and hit a point operating machine. The points moved under the locomotive, throwing it onto its side and derailing the coaches, which came to rest across the tracks.|$|R
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} {{the design and}} construction of a solar operated gate. A solar panel is used to charge a battery, and then an inverter is used to run a garage door opener off the <b>battery.</b> The garage <b>door</b> opener operates a short lever arm which is connected to a longer lever arm which {{is connected to the}} gate. Each component and mounting mechanisms were designed and built to effectively provide the gate opening function. The finished product operates well, the gate opens in about 8 seconds after the button is pressed on the remote controller or wall mount entry...|$|R
50|$|A redeco of the Voyager class mold. The figure {{still comes}} with {{safeguard}} and a cyber planet key, although the code {{has been removed}} from the back of this. Also, all of the electrics have been removed from the figure so there are no longer any sound effects, (although the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> is still visible on the nosecone the screw has been replaced with a rivet) and because of this, the cyber planet key serves no purpose at all.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to having specification differences, the Trophy and 7 Trophy have slight design differences as well. The 7 Trophy features a bright yellow battery compartment (typical of HTC Windows Mobile devices in the past), whereas the Trophy has a bright red battery compartment (to acknowledge the phone's Verizon ties). Press images of the Verizon device also appear to show a small circular cutout beneath the <b>battery</b> <b>door,</b> and above the Windows Phone logo. This circle is an external antenna port cover.|$|E
50|$|The 950 {{incorporated}} improvements {{over the}} 900 {{such as a}} stronger swivel hinge, a magnesium case (except the plastic <b>battery</b> <b>door)</b> and increased sensor resolution. The 950's ability to capture directly in TIFF format was unusual for the time, although the file transfer time (depending on CF card write speed available at the time) could be over 30 seconds in this mode. The 950 came with a 8MB CF card, and the card could contain only 1 image file shot in the TIFF mode (~5.6MB). The maximum CF capacity for the 950 is 64MB.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} {{portable}} power {{has created a}} run-time gap with conventional <b>batteries</b> opening the <b>door</b> for leading edge technologies such as micro fuel cells. Emerging companies like Tekion attempting to enter the market face psychological and economical adoption barriers to commercialization. Examining innovation adoptive characteristics allows Tekion to identify niche markets. Fuel cell technology has capacity to displace current battery applications where more power and mobility are desired. Penetration into mainstream portable power market requires the ability to meet consumer power needs and establish standardized technologies. Firms that establish themselves as leaders in the target market and provide product integration will flourish. New markets have the highest potential for micro fuel cell adoption when targeting consumers with no access to power grids. The potential for dominance and availability of non-consumers makes Country X attractive. However the presence of adoption deterrents and lack of augmenters make acceptance low. Tekion should benchmark Country X&# 146;s valuation with other regions before developing a marketing plan...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the muscle}} car market took shape, Ford {{introduced}} a Ford Fairlane in 1963 few Fairlane two door hard tops prepared for drag racing during the 1963 season. These cars were running the 289 {{is known that}} ran the 260 and {{there may have been}} more and were set up in the Tubing works plant that built the special cars for Ford racing. These soon evolved into the [...] "Thunderbolts" [...] for 1964. Thunderbolt for drag racing for 1964, was a heavily modified two door post to incorporate Ford's new 427 CID (7.0 L) V8 race engine with two four-barrel carburetors on a high-riser manifold, ram-air through the openings left by deleting the inboard headlights, equal-length headers, trunk-mounted <b>battery,</b> fiberglass hood, <b>doors,</b> fenders, and front bumper, acrylic glass windows, and other lightweight options, including deleted rear-door window winders, carpeting, radio, sealant, sun visors, armrests, jack, lug wrench, heater, soundproofing, and passenger-side windshield wiper. The cars wore Fairlane 500 trim, and were only offered with the two-door sedan body. This special model, of which 111 to 127 total were made (sources disagree), delivered 657 hp (490 kW) at 7,500 rpm and was known as the Thunderbolt.|$|R
5000|$|The AE-1 {{had only}} one pointer needle used to {{indicate}} the light meter recommended f-stop, and neither a follower needle to indicate the actual lens set f-stop, nor plus/minus indicators for over/underexposure. The shutter-priority system of the AE-1 was more suited to sports action than to preserving depth-of-field, yet the 1/1000 s top speed of its horizontally traveling shutter limited its use for such activities. The <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> design was subject to frequent breakage, and over time owners have reported instances of shutter and mechanical gremlins, including mirror linkage wear (the [...] "Canon squeal"). Canon's eventual abandonment of the FD lens mount for the EOS autofocus design also {{had an effect on}} prices for the AE-1 on the used market.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the MessagePad line, the eMate 300 {{features}} {{an internal memory}} expansion slot. It {{is located in the}} hatch under the <b>battery</b> <b>door,</b> next to the ROM card. Both cards fit into both slots, but the ROM card is larger. The expansion card is on the left. Companies like Newertech produced cards for the eMate. Most cards expanded the data bus from 16 bits to 32 bits, as well as providing additional DRAM (program memory), and flash (storage). When one of these cards is installed, the internal DRAM is disabled, but the internal flash RAM is combined with the flash on the card. For example: If a memory card were to have 4 MB of DRAM and 2 MB of flash, the Newton would report having 4 MB of flash, and 4 MB of DRAM, not 5 MB of DRAM.|$|E
50|$|The {{work was}} done on {{the eastern edge of}} the river Becquerel, at the Thebes gate to the bastion Nobltur. The king {{personally}} led the siege. On 11 August Lunette, located in front of the gate Thebes, was taken by storm. On the night of 19 August preparations were completed. The attack was carried out simultaneously on the right by the Guard against the gates of Thebes and on the left by Picardy Orleans shelves at Bastion Nobltur. On 21 August the battery was finished. Their fire soon destroyed the <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> at Thebes, leading the defenders to build batteries on the bastions of St. Maurice and St. Mary Magdalene. In the latter was a famous battery Meunier that shelled longitudinal approaches to the position of the besieged. During this time, many fires were set. On 23 August besiegers built 4-gun batteries against Becquerel.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} evaluation, {{the focus on}} Jaime's {{imperfect}} trimwork was on {{the mind of the}} experts, when Andrew raised the issue of whether Jaime's interaction with Sheilla should be considered to be the main critique. Although the experts validate Andrew, they also state that the perfectly finished floor vindicates him somewhat. The work on Terry's shed is criticized as being wasteful (having destroyed 40 cork tiles in his false start and not waiting until the contact cement was dry before adhering tiles causing more, and also having six persons working on his shed in the group challenge with little to show for it), while the main criticisms in Jeff's shed is his visible gap between his cork tiles and his <b>battery</b> <b>door</b> not closing all the way (due to, as Greg puts it, hinge-bound hinges). Ruth's shed is critiqued for its overall incompleteness (including her hinge-bound hinges), while Candace's shed is critiqued over the fact that to this point Justin had been doing much of the work, leaving the contestant to do virtually nothing except yell at her nominator when he is either doing too little or too much of the work.|$|E
