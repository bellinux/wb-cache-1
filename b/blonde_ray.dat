40|$|In {{the present}} study the life history of <b>blonde</b> <b>ray</b> Raja {{brachyura}} from Sardinian waters (central-western Mediterranean) was investigated and the results compared with previously published data on this species. The age, growth and reproduction were studied using 1792 specimens caught between 2005 and 2013. Females ranged from 13. 1 to 105. 5 cm in Total length (TL) and males from 18 to 96. 5 cm TL. This species was sexually dimorphic, with TL females attaining a larger size than males. Both females and males showed allometric growth (b> 3) and we found {{significant differences in the}} relationship between length and weight among sexes. The von Bertalanffy growth function (3 parameters), which provided the following values: L∞ = 111. 14 cm TL, k = 0. 10 and t 0 = - 1. 3 for females, and L∞ = 108. 81 cm TL, k = 0. 11 and t 0 = - 1. 2 for males, was the best-fit age model. R. brachyura showed a relatively slow growth rate with males slightly more rapid than females. Length and age at maturity were 87. 2 cm and 14 years for females and 80. 8 cm and 10 years for males. This ray exhibited a restricted reproductive cycle from late May to August, confirmed by the seasonal evolution of GSI values. Ovarian fecundity reached a maximum of 44 yolked follicles. Given the relative abundance in the Sardinian seas, it is hoped that the results can be useful in the implementation of basic management measures in order to ensure the sustainability of catches of this species in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
40|$|The dorsoventrally {{flattened}} morphology of benthic ray and flatfish {{species is}} perhaps {{assumed to be}} a constraint on their locomotory ability, suggesting these sit-­‐and-­‐wait predators may exhibit reduced movement and low activity with all species exploiting similar niches. Advancing our understanding of ray and flatfish movement behaviour in relation to the environment is required however, because many commercial and non-­‐ commerical populations are threatened by demersal fisheries. The movement patterns and behaviour of the electronic tagged ray species <b>blonde</b> <b>ray</b> Raja brachyura and spotted ray Raja montagui, and benthic teleosts turbot Psetta maxima and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, were investigated off southwest Britain. Mark-­‐recapture data showed some evidence for site fidelity or increased residence time in preferred locations to some degree in all species investigated. Time-­‐series of waiting times (intervals between periods of activity) were analysed statistically, revealing complex movement patterns and behavioural structure over a wide range of temporal scales. Overall, R. brachyura displayed greater horizontal and vertical ranging behaviour with longer waiting times than R. montagui, who inhabited deeper more restricted depths. Comparatively, however, teleosts showed more extensive vertical ranging and much shorter waiting time behaviour, with P. maxima displaying surface swimming, whilst P. platessa performed substantial circa-­‐diel and tidal rhythms. The differences in behaviour patterns observed was attributed to feeding niche differences, among intraspecific variation such as sexual segregation and ontogenic changes. This integrated statistical approach to understand the behavioural strategies of these sit-­‐ and-­‐wait predators helps to assess aspects of behaviour such as decision-­‐making (waiting time between activities) in relation to habitat availability and quality. A deeper understanding of spatiotemporal movements and behaviour, including where species are distributed, how long they stay there and why, will inform better management of populations.

40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; <b>blonde</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
40|$|Skates and rays {{represent}} one of {{the most}} vulnerable components of fish communities in temperate demersal fisheries such as the Irish Sea. They also tend to be data poor in comparison to commercially exploited teleost fish. Spatial management has been suggested as an important tool to protect these species, but requires an understanding of the abundance distribution, and the relationship the abundance distribution has with the environment at both adult and juvenile life history stages. Here we modelled bottom trawl survey data using delta log-normal boosted regression trees on to derive rays’ spatial abundance, and environmental links. The modelling approach allowed the development of high resolution predictive maps of abundance of four skate and ray species targeted by fishing activity: thornback, spotted, cuckoo and <b>blonde</b> <b>rays.</b> The distributions of these species were driven by a general preference for sand and coarser substrates as well as higher salinities, temperatures and currents speeds. Spatial comparisons between abundance distributions and locations of skate and ray commercial landings indicated that the main hotspots for the investigated species are outside of the main commercial fishing areas and overlap with potential MPAs proposed for wider ecosystem protection. The method offers a useful tool for selecting potential MPA’s to assist the management and conservation of data-poor species...|$|R
50|$|In 1961 Roy Shire {{started a}} rival wrestling {{promotion}} in San Francisco called Big Time Wrestling, in direct competition with NWA: San Francisco. Shires' promotion created its own World Tag Team Championship in 1961, with Guy and Joe Brunetti {{as its first}} champions. Initially Shire {{was associated with the}} American Wrestling Alliance, but in 1968 he {{became a member of the}} NWA. At that point the Big Time Wrestling tag team championship was given the NWA suffix. Big Time Wrestling abandoned the tag team championship in 1979 and two years later the promotion closed. While it is possible that there were shorter reigns, the seven-day reign of the Great Mephisto and Kinji Shibuya in April 1973 is the shortest documented title reign. The <b>Blonde</b> Bombers's (<b>Ray</b> Stevens and Pat Patterson) reign that started in April 1965 was the longest reign on record, a total of 623 days.|$|R
40|$|This Fisheries Science Partnership {{project was}} {{developed}} to estimate the survival of rays, which are caught commercially in a target trawl fishery in the Bristol Channel, and subsequently discarded. The study was proposed by the NFFO and categorized by Defra and Cefas as priority for support. All ray and skate species are commonly marketed as skate. The status of several skate and ray stocks in the Northeast Atlantic is of concern, with some species classified as depleted while others are locally extirpated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) estimate the short-term discard survival rates of thornback rays; (2) estimate the longterm discard survival rates of the most commercially important ray species; and (3) investigate the effect of codend weight on ray discard survival. The short-term survival estimates were made using specially designed holding tanks to retain thornback rays on board during three 4 -day trips on the FV ‘Our Olivia Belle’. These holding tank experiments were supplemented with a tagging programme in which 900 thornback, small-eyed, <b>blonde</b> and spotted <b>rays</b> were caught, tagged and released. Information on tagged rays, when caught again in the future, will be used to estimate the longer-term survival of discarded rays. Consequently, the results from the tagging programme can only be presented once sufficient tags have been returned, and will be included in a future report. The short-term survival experiments showed that for every three thornback rays returned to sea in the Bristol Channel ray fishery, an estimated two survive for at least 3 days. The few tag returns received so far show that discarded rays are surviving for at least 45 days. The study indicated that as total catch weight and tow duration increases, the survival rate for discarded rays decreases; also, that large thornback rays do not have greater rates of survival than small rays. The implications of these results for the management of ray fisheries are discussed. ...|$|R
