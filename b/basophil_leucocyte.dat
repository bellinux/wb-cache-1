40|$|Changes of <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> {{counts of}} the {{peripheral}} blood in bronchial asthma were investigated mainly by our improved method of KOVACS (4). The results are as follows. I) The basophils in bronchial asthma generally show a higher count than in healthy controls. 2) During the interval of repeated asthmatic attacks the basophil count {{is higher than}} in the asymptomatic period. 3) Particularly in an episode of asthmatic attack, the basophils increase immediately before the attack and decrease to the normal level or lower after the attack has begun. 4) During asthmatic attacks {{it may be possible to}} expect another attack, if the basophil count again tends to increase from the previous low count. 5) This counting method of basophils is easy enough for the routine examination like calculation of peripheralleucocytes. 6) Observation of the changes of peripheral basophils appears to be a useful laboratory aid for the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of bronchial asthma, making possible an early detection of the next attack. A discussion is given of the behavior of the basophils in bronchial asthma. </p...|$|E
40|$|A type of microscopical chamber is {{described}} which enables monolayers of cells {{to be examined}} at 37 °C by phase-contrast microscopy at high magnification and which can be perfused semi-automatically. Such chambers {{have been used to}} observe morphological changes in the <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> of atopic subjects when challenged with an extract of Timothy grass pollen. The appearance of <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in monolayers prepared from both washed and defibrinated blood cell suspensions has been studied. Basophils taken from non-atopic subjects or atopic subjects who were not hypersensitive to grass pollen showed no reaction to Timothy grass pollen extract. By contrast, basophils taken from pollen sensitive atopic subjects reacted to Timothy grass pollen extract with an acute change in motility and many degranulated. The morphological changes observed are described and illustrated in detail. No significant changes were seen in other types of cell. Some immunological and cellular mechanisms which may underlie this degranulation of human <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{methods were}} made to count the {{absolute}} numbers of basophils and eosinophils by adding phosphate buffer to Kovacs staining fluid. The improved method has following advantages. 1) Both <b>basophil</b> and eosinophil <b>leucocytes</b> can be easily recognized and identified simultaneously. 2) The staining fluid is stable {{for more than one}} year at room temperature. 3) Within two hours after filling a pipette, precipittates or ghost cells still do not appear. 4) This method is simple and convenient for the routine examination like calculation of peripheral <b>leucocytes.</b> Changes of <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in the peripheral blood in various diseases were investigated with above described method. Basophilia was shown in allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, parasite infection, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, acquired hemolytic anemia, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency anemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and Addisons disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{histology}} of skin {{responses to}} infestations with female Ixodes holocyclus ticks {{was investigated in}} naive and previously infested cattle. In the latter hosts, infiltration of the skin site with <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> was an early event. Concurrent spongiosis and vesiculation occurred in the epidermis adjacent to the tick mouthparts. This was followed by infiltration of the upper dermis by eosinophils and other leukocytes. Such reactions were evident one hour after attachment of ticks in hosts which had received two prior infestations. Pronounced epidermal vesiculation and bulla formation with eventual serous exudation followed in previously infested cattle, leading to entrapment of ticks...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} changes which {{occur in}} blood, bone marrow, and small intestines of guinea-pigs during a primary infection {{and after a}} challenge infection with Trichostrongylus colubriformis are described. These studies show that (1) the dominant haematological and histological changes which follow infection with the parasites are proliferation of eosinophil and <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in the bone marrow, a circulating eosinophilia and basophilia, and an accumulation and degranulation of these cells {{at the site of}} infection. (2) The eosinophil and basophil changes occur at an accelerated rate in animals reinfected with T. colubriformis. These reach their peak 5 – 7 days after reinfection compared with 21 – 28 days in previously uninfected animals, and these peaks are correlated with the time of rejection of the parasite...|$|R
40|$|Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (Staph A) induces {{histamine}} secretion {{from human}} <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in the concentration range 10 (- 4) - 10 micrograms/ml. This reaction has great similarities {{to that of}} antigen or anti-IgE-induced release. It {{is characterized by a}} two stage reaction, requires extracellular calcium and is optimal at 37 degrees C. The rate of release {{is similar to that of}} IgE-mediated reactions. Histamine release induced by Staph A is inhibited by metabolic inhibitors, drugs which increase intracellular cyclic AMP levels, inhibitors of lipoxygenase pathways and a phospholipase A 2 inhibitor. D 2 O and cytochalasin B which affect microtubules and microfilaments respectively, enhance histamine release induced by Staph A. These results suggest that Staph A-induced release is modulated by intracellular cyclic AMP, arachidonic acid metabolites, requires energy and is enhanced by the disruption of microfilaments and stabilization of microtubules...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare in vitro leucocyte histamine release in patients with a history of previous radiographic contrast media (RCM) reactions and normal controls. Peripheral leucocytes of ten patients with a positive history of RCM imcompatibility and nineteen normal volunteers were stimulated in vitro with different RCM in different concentrations and the amount of histamine released was measured in the supernatant. There was a significant increase in histamine release induced by RCM in low doses (0. 02 - 0. 1 M) in the patients as compared to the normals. At the high doses (0. 2 - 0. 3 M), no significant differences were found. Leucocytes from four of the patients were stimulated preferentially by the dye responsible for the incompatibility. Six patients showed no such preference. The increased "releasability" of the patients' leucocytes could not be transferred by serum. Normal leucocytes, when incubated with serum from "high releasing" patients did not show increased histamine release after stimulation with the respective dye. It is suggested that an excessive non-immunological response of <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> to RCM stimulation might, in part, account for the adverse clinical reactions observed. Furthermore, leucocyte histamine release might be a useful diagnostic tool for detecting patients with a high risk of developing contrast media reactions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a commercial preparation of low molecular weight (MW) B-cell growth factor (BCGF), a product of activated human T cells, on histamine release from stimulated human basophils. In all the 23 cases tested, BCGF enhanced significantly the histamine release from stimulated human <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> After leucocyte incubation with 1 % v/v BCGF, anti-IgE-induced histamine release increased from 11. 9 +/- 1. 9 % to 31. 8 +/- 3. 3 % (mean +/- SEM; P less than 0. 001), formyl-methionine peptide-induced histamine release increased from 24. 9 +/- 3. 9 % to 50. 3 +/- 5. 3 % (P less than 0. 001) and complement-mediated (i. e. induced by zymosan-activated human serum) histamine release increased from 10. 7 +/- 1. 8 % to 29. 2 +/- 5. 2 % (P less than 0. 001). The enhancing effect of BCGF on histamine release was related to dose, temperature and time, since it was optimal after incubation with 10 % v/v BCGF at 37 degrees for 60 min. BCGF activity persisted when the cells were washed after incubation and could also be observed when leucocyte incubation was carried out in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +. It is noteworthy that basophils which showed a low response to activating agents released significant amounts of histamine after incubation with BCGF. These observations support the hypothesis that lymphocytes and lymphocyte-derived products may play a role in triggering and maintaining allergic reactions...|$|R
40|$|Histamine {{release from}} washed {{peripheral}} blood basophils of thirty-three subjects {{with varying degrees}} of periodontal disease was studied. Dental plaque, serum and <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> were collected from individual patients. There was no histamine release when autologous, washed sonicated plaque was added to leucocytes. However, the incubation of autologous plaque with serum at 37 degrees C for 30 min generated a factor which induced histamine release from basophils. This serum factor was stable to heat (56 degrees C, 30 min), eluted from a Sephadex G- 100 column at a volume corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 16, 000 daltons and its action was inhibited by antibody to C 5. This factor, therefore, is probably C 5 a. There was a variation in the degree of histamine release seen with the leucocytes of different donors. This variability was a property of the basophil rather than a function of the serum. Basophils from patients with gingival indices of 0. 5 to 1. 0 had significantly more histamine release than basophils from patients with gingival indices of less than 0. 5 or greater than 1. 5 (P less than 0. 001). These experiments demonstrate that dental plaque activates serum to form C 5 a which in turn releases histamine from basophils. However, these experiments do not indicate a role for IgE in this reaction since the direct interaction of plaque with basophils did not cause histamine release. The release of mediators from mast cells could {{play an important role in}} the induction of the inflammatory response in periodontal disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the factors that {{determine}} outcome in asthma. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the relation of various factors of potential importance to the rate of decline in lung function in adults with intrinsic and extrinsic asthma. METHODS: Of 180 asthmatic patients, 143 (79 %) participated in a 10 year follow up examination. At the time of enrollment all patients underwent certain tests for asthma (case history, total IgE, skinprick tests, the radioallergosorbent test (RAST), histamine release from <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes,</b> and specific bronchial provocations). On the basis of these tests 94 patients had intrinsic asthma and 49 extrinsic asthma. RESULTS: Patients with intrinsic asthma had an annual decline in FEV 1 of 50 ml, whereas those with extrinsic asthma had a decline of 22. 5 ml; the rate of decline of lung function increased with increasing age in both groups. An inverse relation between initial FEV 1 and decline in FEV 1 (the "horse racing effect") was found for the patients with extrinsic asthma but not for the patients with intrinsic asthma. There was no relation between rate of decline in lung function and number of cigarettes smoked. A high degree of airway variability [...] that is, reversibility in FEV 1 [...] at the time of enrollment was found to be associated with a steeper decline in lung function in patients with intrinsic asthma, whereas increasing degrees of obstruction (decreasing FEV 1 /VC ratio at enrollment) and need for treatment with corticosteroids were associated with a more pronounced decline in FEV 1 in patients with extrinsic asthma. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of decline in lung function is greater in patients with intrinsic asthma than in patients with extrinsic asthma; the prognosis for intrinsic and extrinsic asthma is to some extent influenced by different factors, which suggests that the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying intrinsic and extrinsic asthma may differ...|$|R
40|$|The {{models for}} {{exposure}} to house dust {{in research and}} clinical practice are selected {{with respect to their}} role in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. The use of isolated major allergens instead of complex allergen extracts is becoming increasingly popular as it offers some important advantages for quantitative measures in diagnosis and research. To compare house dust mite extract and isolated mite major allergens with respect to their ability to induce early and late asthmatic responses and bronchial hyperreactivity. Bronchial responses to house dust mite (HDM, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) extract and isolated major allergens from HDM (Der p 1 and Der p 2) were compared in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study in 20 patients with mild to moderate asthma who were allergic to HDM. Allergen was titrated to a standardized early asthmatic response. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness to histamine (PC 20 histamine) was determined before and after allergen inhalation to assess allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness and IL- 5 was measured in serum. In addition, the allergens were applied in intracutaneous skin tests and activation of <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> and proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was tested in vitro. After a similar early asthmatic response (mean Deltaforced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1),max - 29. 4 (SD 7. 2) vs. - 33. 1 (8. 6) %; mean difference 3. 6 (95 % CI - 0. 9 to 8. 2) %), the late asthmatic response (mean DeltaFEV 1,max - 45. 9 (21. 9) vs. - 32. 7 (22. 3) %; mean difference 13. 2 (3. 8 - 22. 3) %), the degree of allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness (mean DeltaPC 20 histamine, 1. 8 (1. 0) vs. 1. 2 (0. 9) doubling dose; mean difference 0. 6 (0. 2 - 1. 1) doubling dose) and serum IL- 5 at 6 h were found to be significantly higher after bronchial challenge with HDM extract than after challenge with an isolated HDM major allergen. Likewise, there was an increased late skin reaction with HDM compared with isolated major allergen after a similar early skin reaction. Constituents of HDM extract, other than Der p 1 or Der p 2, with no significant influence on the IgE-mediated early asthmatic response contribute significantly to the allergen-induced late asthmatic response and bronchial hyper-reactivit...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} β blockers used in ophthalmology on the release of histamine from mixed cell preparations containing human <b>leucocytes</b> and <b>basophils.</b>  METHODS—A mixed <b>leucocyte</b> and <b>basophil</b> preparation was obtained from venous blood of healthy non-atopic volunteers. Cell preparations were then incubated with betaxolol, metipranolol, timolol, or carteolol. After incubation for 1  hour the histamine content of the supernatant was analysed by automated fluorometric analysis. Cell viability was tested by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations.  RESULTS—Betaxolol and metipranolol in concentrations between 10 - 2  M and 10 - 3  M liberated histamine from human blood cells in a dose dependent manner. Carteolol and timolol {{had no effect on}} histamine at these concentrations. At the same concentrations LDH was also detected in the supernatants of cell suspensions incubated with metipranolol or betaxolol.  CONCLUSIONS—Betaxolol and metipranolol induce substantial histamine release from human leucocytes, probably {{as a result of their}} cytotoxic effect. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} binding of radiolabelled IgE to {{a tissue}} culture lymphoblastoid cell line (Wil- 2 WT) was confirmed. The binding of IgE and Hamburger's IgE-derived pentapeptide Asp-Ser-Asp-Pro-Arg (HEPP) to Wil- 2 WT cells and to human leucocytes was compared. HEPP inhibition of IgE binding to leucocytes averaged 24 % but with Wil- 2 WT cells only 12 % inhibition was observed with {{double the amount}} of HEPP. Using myeloma IgE to inhibit the binding of tritiated HEPP to leucocytes and Wil- 2 WT cells confirmed the specificity of the peptide binding {{as well as the}} greater affinity of HEPP for <b>leucocytes</b> (<b>basophils)</b> compared to Wil- 2 WT lymphoblastoid cells. Based upon the extent of binding and the maximum inhibition attainable with HEPP it is suggested that the receptors for IgE on Wil- 2 WT cells, basophilic leucocytes and mast cells are not identical but that they share specificities in common. A new hypothesis for the mechanism of action of HEPP is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Surgical stress causes {{changes in}} the {{composition}} of white blood cells (WBCs). Ketorolac is believed to have analgesic effects and to reduce the stress response and may therefore improve postoperative outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of preoperative ketorolac on the WBC subsets in patients who had laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis. Fifty patients who had laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the ketorolac group (n = 25) received ketorolac 0. 5 mg/kg before the induction of anesthesia, and the control group (n = 25) received saline. White cell count, differential, and pathology studies were done immediately after surgery, on postoperative day 1, and on postoperative day 3. We compared the baseline values within and between the two groups. We also assessed postoperative pain and side effects. The time that elapsed before the first patient request for analgesia, total meperidine dose and VAS (Visual Analog Scale) for postoperative pain were significantly lower in the ketorolac group than in the control group. Compared to the pre- surgical values, there was an increase in total WBC count and percentage of neutrophils, but a decrease in percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, <b>basophils,</b> and <b>leucocytes.</b> Total WBC count, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and leucocytes showed significant differences between the two groups. The incidences of postoperative side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, headache, and shoulder pain were not different between the groups. Preoperative ketorolac reduced postoperative pain and influenced the WBC response in laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis.

40|$|Human <b>leucocytes</b> (<b>basophils)</b> release {{histamine}} {{when exposed}} to ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE. The present study shows that when leucocytes from BCG-positive donors are first incubated with PPD and then challenged with anti-IgE, histamine release is enhanced. In contrast, when leucocytes from BCG-negative donors are incubated with PPD and then challenged with anti-IgE there is no enhancement of histamine release. The enhancement of histamine release was detected within 24 hr after addition of PPD, but was maximal at 48 to 72 hr. Supernatant fluids collected from these leucocyte cultures revealed {{the presence of a}} soluble mediator(s) which, when incubated with leucocytes from BCG-negative donors, enhanced the release of histamine. Examination of the supernatant fluids from BCG-positive leucocyte cultures stimulated with PPD showed a correlation between histamine-release enhancing activity and interferon. Treatment of the culture fluids at pH 2. 0 abolished the anti-viral activity, indicating that the interferon was of the type II or 'immune' class. The same treatment only partly abolished the histamine-release enhancing activity. It is concluded that immune-specific stimulation of leucocytes results in the release of soluble mediators that are capable of enhancing IgE-mediated histamine release...|$|R
40|$|Os autores antigos e atuais não deram a devida consideração aos basófilos do líquido céfalorraqueano (LCR) apenas havendo referências isoladas e imprecisas na literatura. Alguns pesquizadores referem-se a estas células simplesmente como basófilos; outros afirmam que só há basófilo de tecido (mastócito) no LCR. O propósito do presente trabalho foi o de relatar os resultados dos estudos sobre os basófilos do LCR. O {{material}} é constituído pelas observações de 300 pacientes neurológicos com moléstias ou condições mórbidas diversas em cujo LCR foi assinalada a presença destas células basófilas. Os resultados destes estudos permitiram a seguintes conclusões: 1) os basófilos do LCR são morfologicamente identificáveis com os basófilos sangüíneos; 2) a falta de correlação percentual entre as células do LCR e sangue sugere que estes basófilos têm a sua origem nas leptomeninges e, neste sentido, são basófilos de tecido; 3) deve ser considerada a hipótese da presença simultânea de basófilo e de mastócito no LCR; 4) os basófilos foram encontrados no LCR de numerosos pacientes com processos inflamatórios agudos do sistema nervoso central, particularmente nas meningites linfocitárias, meningo-encefalites e meningo-mielites, em percentagem que variou de 0. 1 a 18 %; 5) em muitos casos em que existe um quadro agudo de alterações do LCR conseqüentes à reação a corpo extranho, tais como casos de parasitoses do sistema nervoso central, de hemorragia e de Insuflação de ar no espaço sub-aracnóide, os basófilos foram observados em percentagem que variou de 0. 1 a 11 %; 6) em muitos destes pacientes, nos quais é provável haver uma reação imuno-alérgica, os eosinófilos e as células plasmocitárias estavam presentes em associação com os basófilos; 7) a presença dos basófilos no LCR é de duração efêmera durante o curso da moléstia ou condição mórbida; 8) habitualmente os basófilos aparecem em casos com pleocitose, mas não é excepcional o achado destas células com contagem global normal; 9) ainda nada se sabe sobre a significação dos basófilos no LCR em relação com as moléstias do sistema nervoso central, assunto que constitui campo aberto para pesquisa clínica e investigação experimental; 10) seria tentador sugerir que a presença dos basófilos no LCR faça parte das alterações citológicas indicadoras de reação imuno-alérgica em sua fase aguda. The {{references to}} the basophil type of granulocyte of the abnormal cerebrospinal fluid are strictly limited and deficient. Some authors describe them as tissue basophils (mast cells) stating {{that there are no}} basophil granulocytes in the spinal fluid. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribut to the study of this subject. The material of the study consisted of the clinical records of 300 neurologic patients whose spinal fluid cytologic examinations revealed the basophils. The results of these studies showed that the basophils of the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood basophils are morphologically identical. However, the lack of correlation between the number of basophils in the blood and in the spinal fluid suggests that the basophil of the spinal fluid comes from the leptomeninges and in a sense it is a tissue basophil. In the group of patients with inflammatory diseases of the nervous system (Group 1), mostly cases of lymphocytic meningitis, meningo-encepha- litis, and meningomyelitis, the basophils ranged between 0. 1 and 18 per cent. In the cases of purulent and tuberculous meningitis the basophils were observed in a lesser number (0. 1 to 5 per cent). In the group of patients with changes in the cerebrospinal fluid due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain cysticercosis and air injected into the subarachnoidal space (Group 2), the basophils ranged between 0. 1 and 11 per cent. In several patients plasma cells and eosinophils were frequently observed in association with the <b>basophil</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> There was a good correlation between basofils and eosinophils in the group of patients with problable immune-allergic reactions (Group 2). Basophils disappear rapidly from the spinal fluid after the onset of the disease. Usually basophils are seen in cases with spinal fluid pleocytosis, but it is not uncommon to observe them in cases with normal cell count. We know nothing about the meaning of the spinal fluid basophil in relation to central nervous system diseases and this is a field open to clinical and experimental investigations. It would be tempting to suggest that basophils do appear in the spinal fluid as part of the cytologic changes which point out to an immune-allergic reaction in its acute phase...|$|R
