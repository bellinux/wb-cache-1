The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them.

25|$|They {{appear to}} {{represent}} boxers, archers and warriors, all standing upright, barefoot and with legs slightly parted. Feet are clearly defined, {{resting on a}} square base. A further characteristic {{is the presence of}} geometrical, decorative chevron (zig-zag) patterns, parallel lines and concentric circles, in cases where it was not possible, for statics reasons, to represent such motives in relief. This happens both for the object and for bodily features. As an example, the braids coming down at the sides of the face are represented in relief, but the hair is rendered with incised fish-bone patterns. The archers’ <b>brassard</b> is slightly in relief, while the details are rendered with geometrical engravings. These peculiarities– together with other evidences– demonstrate that the Mont'e Prama statues draw heavily on the Sardinian statuettes.|$|E
