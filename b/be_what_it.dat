There {{is nothing in the}} Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized.

Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E

[...] According to Squire, the group {{wanted to make}} a [...] "very natural sounding record." [...] As such, the band and Squire spent a [...] "lot of time" [...] working on pre-production. After finishing the pre-production process, drums were recorded. On previous records, Squire had used Beat Detective to keep drums [...] "perfectly in time." [...] However, for The Same Old Blood Rush with a New Touch Squire did not use it as he wished to [...] "preserve the 'groove" [...] of Tom Falcone's drumming. After this, bass and guitars were recorded during the day, and vocals during the night. Squire purposefully staggered the instruments [...] "so that every song [...] have a unique feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Bird later {{recalled}} that he clashed with executives {{who wished to}} add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop. This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, [...] "If {{they were interested in}} telling the story, they should let it <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> wants to be." [...] The film was also initially going to released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo for which featured mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts. He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion.|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, {{and it was a}} most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, I see that [...] always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E
500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth is out there, the authors are damned if they can find it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{direction}} of the band is dominated by chief guitarist, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter Billy Corgan. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, [...] "The music [...] would not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers." [...] Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, [...] "Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy —who he has on board." [...] In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band [...] "as sort of an open source collective" [...] noting that [...] "It's whoever feels right at the time.". Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times article that Corgan's lyrics [...] "too often sound like sophomoric poetry", although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement. Corgan responded to DeRogatis' words with [...] "fuck the Sun-Times", at the band's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago.|$|E

With the way I sang it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, Paul was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie Gattaca, Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier, the Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper.

2500|$|In {{response}} to the early-to-mid-17th century [...] "continental rationalism" [...] John Locke (1632–1704) proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) a very influential view wherein the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding {{the proposition that the}} human mind is a tabula rasa, a [...] "blank tablet", in Locke's words [...] "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which {{is very different from the}} quest for certainty of Descartes.|$|E
2500|$|International {{sporting}} {{events such as}} the Tour de France got little mention except when there was a scheduled interview or major story. Both Russo and Francesa have admitted to not being experts in hockey, but playoff games involving the local teams were discussed and noted NHL guests sometimes appeared. Boxing was not talked about much, as both hosts consider the sport not to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> once was. Although Freddy Adu and a few other soccer celebrities did interviews on the show, the FIFA World Cup and the sport itself received little to no attention on the program; the local MLS team, the New York Red Bulls, were rarely mentioned at all.

2500|$|At the {{invitation}} of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno {{took part in the}} Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called Darmstadt school, which included composers like Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Karel Goeyvaerts, Luciano Berio and Gottfried Michael Koenig, soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, [...] "The Aging of the New Music", where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism {{in much the same way}} as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend Eduard Steuermann, Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a [...] "musique informelle", which would possess the ability [...] "really and truly to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the feminist {{movement}} in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to become more divergent. For some critics, [...] "Kate's taming was no longer as funny as it had been [...] her domination became, in George Bernard Shaw's words 'altogether disgusting to modern sensibility'." [...] Addressing the relationship between A Shrew and The Shrew from a political perspective, for example, Leah S. Marcus very much believes the play to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> seems. She argues A Shrew is an earlier version of The Shrew, but acknowledges that most scholars reject the idea that A Shrew was written by Shakespeare. She believes {{one of the reasons for}} this is because A Shrew [...] "hedges the play's patriarchal message with numerous qualifiers that do not exist in" [...] The Shrew. She calls A Shrew a more [...] "progressive" [...] text than The Shrew, and argues that scholars tend to dismiss the idea that A Shrew is Shakespearean because [...] "the women are not as satisfactorily tamed as they are in The Shrew." [...] She also points out that if A Shrew is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare [...] "may have increased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials", something which, she believes, scholars find difficult to accept.|$|E
2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like {{to be a member of}} Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks.

Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk."
