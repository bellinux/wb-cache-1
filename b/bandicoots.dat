5|$|If Crash, Coco or Crunch win the race, Velo, {{having lost}} his {{influence}} over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the <b>Bandicoots.</b> Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo {{in exchange for}} sending the <b>Bandicoots</b> back to Earth. If Cortex, N. Gin or Tiny win the race, Velo struggles with Cortex over the possession of his scepter, only to be stopped by Tiny. Cortex uses the scepter's power {{in an attempt to}} return to Earth, but the scepter breaks and sends Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny to Terra instead. When they are confronted by the natives (all of which resemble Krunk), Tiny repairs the scepter and is subsequently revered as a king, much to Cortex's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The <b>Bandicoots</b> decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or <b>bandicoots</b> when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E
50|$|The long-nosed <b>bandicoot</b> is {{the largest}} member of its genus, which also {{includes}} the eastern barred <b>bandicoot</b> and the western barred <b>bandicoot.</b> It is most {{closely related to the}} eastern barred <b>bandicoot,</b> the two species having diverged from one another in the late Pliocene. Their ancestors diverged from the ancestor of the western barred <b>bandicoot</b> in the Miocene.|$|R

5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote control device controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the <b>Bandicoots</b> escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bandicoots</b> {{have been}} {{recorded}} as present on the peninsula since the first Europeans settled in the area, {{at one point during}} the history of the peninsula the population of <b>bandicoots</b> dwindled due to the introduction of rabbits to the area. The Mount Henry Conservation Group has eradicated all rabbits from the area and there are records of <b>bandicoots</b> re-inhabiting the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Mouse spiders prey {{mainly on}} insects, {{though they may}} consume other small animals as {{opportunity}} presents. The primary predators of the mouse spider include wasps, <b>bandicoots,</b> centipedes, and scorpions.|$|E

25|$|Paralysis ticks {{are found}} in many types of habitat {{particularly}} areas of high rainfall such as wet sclerophyll forest and temperate rainforest. The natural hosts for the paralysis tick include koalas, <b>bandicoots,</b> possums and kangaroos.|$|E
25|$|The mother {{develops}} {{a kind of}} yolk sack in her womb that delivers nutrients to the embryo. Embryos of <b>bandicoots,</b> koalas and wombats additionally form placenta-like organs that connect them to the uterine wall, although the placenta-like organs are smaller than in placental mammals {{and it is not}} certain that they transfer nutrients from the mother to the embryo.|$|E
25|$|The {{reserve is}} a very {{important}} habitat for native fauna, particularly small mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Southern brown <b>bandicoots,</b> swamp wallabies, echidnas, and brushtail and ringtail possums are present but are often hard to find as they are not all active during the day. The reserve is also a potential habitat for the endangered New Holland mouse.|$|E
50|$|This {{species can}} be set apart from other {{marsupials}} by two traits. It is both polyprotodont (i.e., several pairs of lower front teeth) and syndactylous. The northern brown <b>bandicoot</b> has typical body and tail lengths of 40 and 15 cm, respectively. On average it weighs 1200 g. This marsupial has a thick harsh coat but is not spiny. The dorsal pelage is light brown in appearance with speckled black patterns throughout. On the ventral surface it is solid white. The northern brown <b>bandicoot</b> has a reverse pouch so it won't fill with soil when digging. This <b>bandicoot</b> also has short, rounded ears and a short nose. One can easily mistake northern brown <b>bandicoot</b> for the southern brown <b>bandicoot.</b> The two species differ in both size, with the northern brown <b>bandicoot</b> larger, and regional locality, in that the southern brown <b>bandicoot</b> is found only on the southern coastline of Australia.|$|R
50|$|Crash Bandicoot: Warped (known in Europe as Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> 3: Warped) is a {{platform}} game developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It is the third game in the Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> video game series following Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> 2: Cortex Strikes Back.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> is {{an eastern}} barred <b>bandicoot</b> {{and the main}} protagonist of the Sony Playstation game, chosen to compete as a mascot with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Mario. Paleontologists have named an extinct <b>bandicoot</b> from the Miocene of Australia after the character, Crash <b>bandicoot.</b> Although somewhat unusual for the scientific community, the name was used in an entirely unaltered form, without attempting to return to Latin or Greek roots.|$|R
25|$|The <b>bandicoots</b> and bilbiesorder Peramelemorphiaare {{marsupial}} omnivores. There {{are seven}} species in Australia, {{most of which}} are endangered. These small creatures share several characteristic physical features: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, large upright ears, long, thin legs, and a thin tail. The evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, because they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the similar}} dietary habits {{and methods of}} {{consumption}} to those of an anteater, {{there is no evidence}} supporting the idea that echidna-like monotremes have been myrmecophagic (ant or termite-eating) since the Cretaceous. The fossil evidence of invertebrate-feeding <b>bandicoots</b> and rat-kangaroos, from {{around the time of the}} platypusâ€“echidna divergence and pre-dating Tachyglossus, show evidence that echidnas expanded into new ecospace despite competition from marsupials.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of mammal species present on the island range from 25 to 50. Mammals found on Fraser Island include swamp wallabies, echidnas, {{ringtail}} and brushtail possums, sugar gliders, squirrel gliders, phascogales, <b>bandicoots,</b> potoroos, flying foxes and dingoes. The swamp wallaby finds protection from dingos in the swampy areas which have dense undergrowth. There are 19 species of bats which live on or visit Fraser Island.|$|E

25|$|A common {{example of}} {{polyandrous}} mating {{can be found}} in the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and groundhoppers). Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as marmosets, mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and <b>bandicoots,</b> around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as pipefish.|$|E
25|$|The newborn {{marsupial}} {{uses its}} forelimbs (with relatively strong hands) {{to climb to}} a nipple, which is usually in a pouch on the mother's belly. The mother feeds the baby by contracting muscles over her mammary glands, as the baby is too weak to suck. The newborn marsupial's need to use its forelimbs in climbing to the nipple was historically thought to have restricted metatherian evolution, as {{it was assumed that}} the forelimb couldn't become specialised intro structures like wings, hooves or flippers. However, several <b>bandicoots,</b> most notably the pig-footed bandicoot, have true hooves similar to those of placental ungulates, and several marsupial gliders have evolved.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{infestation}} {{with the}} larva, as occurs in rural and wooded suburban areas where <b>bandicoots</b> are common, rapidly {{leads to the}} development of hypersensitivity. Dramatic local erythema, hypoesthesia and oedema and pruritus may develop within 2â€“3 hours of attachment of even one larva if a person has been sensitised by a previous bite. In this case attachment of the larvae leads to formation of intra-epidermal blebs and eventually vesicles. These eventually rupture and the larvae detach and are lost. Frequently, a tick embedded over an eyelid will result in gross facial and neck swelling within a few hours. The person can go on to develop very severe signs of tracheopharyngeal compression within 5â€“6 hours after the first onset of symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the release}} of Crash <b>Bandicoot,</b> Naughty Dog created two sequels, Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> 2: Cortex Strikes Back (1997) and Crash Bandicoot: Warped (1998), {{as well as a}} kart racing game titled Crash Team Racing (1999). Each {{installment}} was also made for the PlayStation, and Crash Team Racing was the final Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> game the company developed before moving onto the Jak and Daxter series. After Crash Team Racing, Eurocom developed the final Crash <b>Bandicoot</b> game for the PlayStation, the party game Crash Bash.|$|R
50|$|Large {{birds are}} the primary, natural {{predator}} {{of the golden}} <b>bandicoot,</b> but many predatory species have been introduced within its range. The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats, and feral dogs all prey upon the golden <b>bandicoot.</b> When feral cats were introduced to Hermite Island, the golden <b>bandicoot</b> quickly became extinct just before 1912. On Marchinbar Island, hair samples from the golden <b>bandicoot</b> have been recovered in scat samples from feral dogs, and Aborigines {{have been known to}} hunt them as well.|$|R
50|$|Changes in fire regimes {{have been}} cited as another {{major factor in the}} decline of the golden <b>bandicoot.</b> Reduced groundcover due to fires makes the golden <b>bandicoot</b> more exposed to predation, but it has been {{reported}} that the golden <b>bandicoot</b> prefers areas that have been burnt relatively recently, as these have fresh new vegetation close to the ground.|$|R
500|$|Crash, Coco and Crunch Bandicoot are {{relaxing}} {{while their}} nemesis, Doctor Neo Cortex, ponders his next {{course of action}} in regards to defeating the <b>Bandicoots</b> and achieving world domination. Suddenly, both groups are abducted by a mysterious white light that takes them to a large coliseum somewhere in another galaxy. This galaxy is ruled by Emperor Velo XXVII, who plans on having the teams race for the entertainment of his subjects. He promises the Earthlings that winning the races will win their freedom, but threatens them with the destruction of Earth if they refuse to race.|$|E
500|$|At {{the home}} of the <b>Bandicoots,</b> Aku Aku senses Uka Uka's {{emergence}} and orders Crash and Coco inside. Aku Aku tells the two that Uka Uka is his twin brother and that he locked in an underground prison centuries ago [...] "to protect the world from his malice". Crash, Coco and Aku Aku go to the Time-Twisting Machine, where Aku Aku gives Crash and Coco the task of recovering the Crystals before Uka Uka and Doctor Cortex do so. Crash and Coco proceed to travel through time and collect the crystals and gems, thwarting Cortex's minions (including Tiny Tiger, Dingodile and Doctor N. Gin) along the way. Doctor Nefarious Tropy is also defeated, throwing the Time-Twisting Machine into disarray. Having obtained the crystals and gems throughout time, Crash eventually faces off against Cortex in the Time-Twisting machine's core while Uka Uka and Aku Aku fend each other off. Following Cortex's defeat, the Time-Twisting Machine implodes on itself. Crash, Coco, and Aku Aku manage to escape from the implosion whereas Cortex and Tropy are transformed into infants and along with Uka Uka are left to remain in a prison of time.|$|E
500|$|Crash: Mind over Mutant {{takes place}} {{a year later}} after the events of where Crash of the Titans left off. The Titans, free from the control of Doctor Neo Cortex, have spread {{throughout}} the Wumpa Islands and cultivated their own societies and towns. All seems well until a rejuvenated Doctor Neo Cortex teams up with his old partner Doctor Nitrus Brio to invent a personal digital assistant, the [...] "NV", that can control the minds of both mutants and <b>bandicoots</b> by transmitting bad Mojo, forcefully siphoned from Cortex's former boss Uka Uka. Crash and Aku Aku are not affected by the device, but their family members Coco and Crunch, are soon transformed into monstrous version of themselves who seek Crash's destruction. After Coco is freed from the NV's control, the <b>Bandicoots</b> learn of Doctor Cortex's plot by accessing his blog, and decide {{to go to the}} Evil Public School, where Nina was placed by Doctor Cortex. Nina in return for Crash saving her science fair project, informs the heroes of Cortex's and Brio's alliance and reveals their location in the Junkyard, where Brio is recycling parts to create a new space station, the [...] "Space Head", for Cortex and new NV devices. Crash and Aku Aku find Crunch and Brio at the Junkyard and manage to break Crunch free from the NV's control. After learning of Uka Uka's whereabouts from Brio, Crash and Aku Aku go to Mount Grimly, where Uka Uka is being drained of all his Mojo. After being freed, Uka Uka informs Crash that his voodoo bones, his source of power, have been stolen and given to six of the worst Titans on the Island, and tells them to go and retrieve the bones for him. When the bones have been gathered, Uka Uka uses his restored power to send Crash to the Space Head and Crash can enact Uka Uka's vengeance on Cortex. Crash engages in a fight against Cortex, who uses a mutation formula stolen from Brio to empower himself for the battle. Upon losing to the Bandicoot, Cortex throws a tantrum, causing the Space Head to fall towards the Earth. Cortex, having returned to normal, makes his escape from the plummeting Space Head, while Crash and Aku Aku brace themselves for a crash-landing on Wumpa Island. Crash and Aku Aku manage to survive the crash and reunite with Coco and Crunch as parts of the Space Head rain down from the sky. As the story ends, Coco tells Aku Aku that they're not going to help clean up, much to his chagrin.|$|E
