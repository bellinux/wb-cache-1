5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is oceanography. This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical oceanography. Marine biology (<b>biological</b> <b>oceanography)</b> studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical oceanography, which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E

50|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{marine life}} is a field of study both in marine biology and in <b>biological</b> <b>oceanography.</b> In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species {{that live in the}} sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. <b>Biological</b> <b>oceanography</b> is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the physics, chemistry, and geology of the oceanographic system. <b>Biological</b> <b>oceanography</b> mostly focuses on the microorganisms within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem. <b>Biological</b> <b>oceanography</b> is similar to marine biology, but is different because of the perspective used to study the ocean. <b>Biological</b> <b>oceanography</b> takes a bottom up approach (in terms of the food web), while marine biology studies the ocean from a top down perspective. <b>Biological</b> <b>oceanography</b> mainly focuses on the ecosystem of the ocean with an emphasis on plankton: their diversity (morphology, nutritional sources, motility, and metabolism); their productivity and how that plays a role in the global carbon cycle; and their distribution (predation and life cycle). <b>Biological</b> <b>oceanography</b> also investigates the role of microbes in food webs, and how humans impact the ecosystems in the oceans.|$|E

An effort is underway to bring into the light, dark data about zooplankton collected in the 1970 s and 1980 s as part of the cold-core and warm-core rings multidisciplinary programs and other related projects.

40|$|Undersea gliders offer {{a unique}} {{alternative}} to {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) propulsion {{through the use of}} buoyancy change and wings, as propulsive power is generally the largest component of an underwater vehicle’s electrical power draw. This approach affords the opportunity for long term endurance. With operations at slow speed (< 0. 5 m. s- 1) and extremely frugal use of the electrical power available within the vehicle (typically less than 1 W on average), very long endurance can be achieved (over six months, or 3000 km). Two-way satellite communications, allow gliders to send data ashore and receive new mission commands, enabling powerful new concepts in ocean data collection. So far, Glider missions have concentrated on gathering data in support of <b>biological</b> and physical <b>oceanography.</b> They have contributed to studies on ecosystem dynamics, algal blooms, ocean circulation and climate-related research.
