40|$|Sex ratio, reproduction, body {{condition}} and morphology of banded (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and rufous (Lagorchestes hirsutus) hare-wallabies were assessed on Dorre and Bernier Islands. Data {{are derived from}} 236 <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> and 161 rufous hare-wallabies captured between 1959 and 1999. The sex ratio of captured <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> tended to be female-biased (0. 79 : 1 male: female) but {{was not a significant}} departure from parity. In contrast, pouch young tended towards a male bias at 1. 35 : 1. Females produced 1 - 2 young per year. They were capable of producing young at 1000 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 39 % for females of 1000 - 1400 g to 80 % for females of 1401 - 1800 g, then decreased slightly to 76 % for females > 1800 g. Births occurred throughout the year but there was some indication of a decline {{in the latter half of}} the year. Captured <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallabies</b> ranged in weight from 850 to 2300 g. Animals on Dorre Island were in significantly better {{body condition}} than those on Bernier Island, although this could be an artefact of their shorter pes length. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism and no differences in morphological measurements taken, other than pes length, between the two island populations. The sex ratio of captured rufous hare-wallabies was close to parity at 0. 99 : 1 and for pouch young tended to be male-biased at 2 : 1. The smallest female with young weighed 1215 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 43 % for females of 1215 - 1660 g to 61 % for females of 1661 - 2015 g and 100 % for females > 2015 g. Females carried pouch young in all months sampled (March-September) and one incidence of twinning was noted. Captured rufous hare-wallabies weighed 600 - 2550 g. Body condition was similar for males and females and between islands, but smaller females of reproductive age were in poorer body condition than larger females. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism but pes lengths of animals on Dorre Island were significantly shorter, head lengths longer and tail lengths shorter, than those on Bernier Island. Rufous hare-wallabies appear to show regional variation in body size, being smaller in the wetter and warmer Tanami/Alice Springs region and larger on the drier and cooler Shark Bay islands...|$|R
40|$|The diet of Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax was {{assessed}} {{from a single}} nest on Bernier Island and two nests on Heirisson Prong at Shark Bay, Western Australia. The nests and their immediate surrounds were searched for mammalian skulls and the numbers of each species recorded. The nest at Bernier Island was examined annually between July 1992 and October 1995 and the two nests on eirisson Prong in October 1995. <b>Banded</b> <b>Hare-wallabies</b> were the most abundant prey item found in the Bernier Island nest over the four year period comprising 53. 0 % of all skulls, followed by Rufous Hare-wallabies at 35. 9 %, Burrowing Bettongs at 8. 5 % and fish at 2. 6 %. On Heirisson Prong, one bettong skull and 91 rabbit skulls were collected. Wedge-tailed Eagles displayed a preference for larger prey items on both Bernier Island and Heirisson Prong. They are diurnal predators but on Bernier Island their prey species are largely nocturnal. Possible hunting techniques are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> is nocturnal {{and tends}} to live in groups at nesting sites; this species is quite social. Nesting occurs in {{thickets}} under very dense brush. This macropod prefers to live in Acacia ligulata scrub. Males are extremely aggressive. The average <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> weighs 1.7 kg, with females weighing more than males. It measures about 800mm from the head {{to the end of}} the tail, with the tail almost the same length (averaging 375mm) as the body. The <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> has a short nose. Long, grey fur is speckled with yellow and silver and fades into a light grey on the underbelly. There is no color variation on the face or head, the coloring is solid grey. Dark, horizontal stripes of fur start at the middle of the back and stop at the base of the tail.|$|E
50|$|The two living subfamilies in {{the family}} Macropodidae are the Lagostrophinae, {{represented}} by a single species, the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby,</b> and the remainder, about 60 species, which make up the subfamily Macropodinae.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} {{home to one of}} the few {{remaining}} colonies of the <b>Banded</b> <b>Hare-wallaby</b> (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and the endangered Shark Bay mouse of which there is an estimated 5,000 to 9,000 individuals.|$|E
40|$|As {{evidence}} mounts {{that the}} feral Cat (Felis catus) {{is a significant}} threat to endemic Australian biodiversity and impedes reintroduction attempts, uncertainty remains about the impact a residual population of cats following control will have on a mammal reintroduction programme. Also, behavioural interactions between cats and their prey continue to be an area of interest. Within the framework of an ecosystem restoration project, we tested the hypotheses that successful reintroductions of some medium-sized mammals are possible in locations where feral cats are controlled (but not eradicated) {{in the absence of}} European Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), and that hare-wallabies that dispersed from their release area are more vulnerable to cat predation compared with those that remain at the release site. We used radiotelemetry to monitor the survivorship and dispersal of 16 Rufous Hare-wallabies (Lagorchestes hirsutus spp.) and 18 <b>Banded</b> <b>Hare-wallabies</b> (Lagostrophus fasciatus fasciatus) reintroduced to four sites within Shark Bay, Western Australia. Nearly all foxes were removed and feral cats were subject to ongoing control that kept their indices low relative to prerelease levels. All monitored hare-wallabies were killed by cats within eight and 10 months following release. Significant predation by feral cats was not immediate: most kills occurred in clusters, with periods of several months where no mortalities occurred. Once a hare-wallaby was killed, however, predation continued until each population was eliminated. Animals remaining near their release site survived longer than those that dispersed. The aetiology of predation events observed offers new insights into patterns of feral cat behaviour and mammal releases. We propose a hypothesis that these intense per capita predation events may reflect a targeted hunting behaviour in individual feral cats. Even where feral cats are controlled, the outcome from consistent predation events will result in reintroduction failures. Managers considering the reintroduction of medium-sized mammals in the presence of feral cats should, irrespective of concurrent cat control, consider the low probability of success. We advocate alternative approaches to cat-baiting alone for the recovery of cat-vulnerable mammals such as hare-wallabies...|$|R
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> or munning (Lagostrophus fasciatus) is a {{marsupial}} that {{is currently}} found on the Islands of Bernier and Dorre off western Australia. A small population has recently been established on Faure Island and {{it appears to have}} been successful. It has also been reintroduced to Wadderin Sanctuary, near Narembeen in the central wheatbelt, in 2013. Evidence suggested that the mernine was the only living member of the sthenurine subfamily, and a recent osteology-based phylogeny of macropodids found that the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> was indeed a bastion of an ancient lineage, agreeing with other (molecular) appraisals of the evolutionary history of L. fasciatus. However, the authors analysis did not support the placement of the mernine within Sthenurinae, but suggest it belongs to a plesiomorphic clade which branched off from other macropodids in the early Miocene and put forward the new subfamily Lagostrophinae. Recent analysis of mtDNA extracted from fossils of the sthenurine Simosthenurus supports this conclusion. This new subfamily includes the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> and the fossil genus Troposodon.|$|E
50|$|The {{species were}} once {{found on the}} mainland, in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia and South Australia, but they are now restricted in their distribution to Bernier Island and Dorre Island in Western Australia. Although the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> was once found across the south-western portion of Australia, it {{is believed to have}} been extinct on the mainland since 1963, and the last recorded evidence of the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> on the Australian mainland was in 1906. It is possible that the devastation of the species can be attributed to the loss of habitat to the clearing of vegetation, the loss of food (due to competition with other animals), and predators.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>{{hare-wallaby}}</b> and {{rufous hare-wallaby}} are both threatened mammal species {{that were once}} found on the mainland but are now both restricted to Dorre and Bernier Island. The rufous hare-wallaby is being reintroduced to mainland Australia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} native mammal fauna of Faure Island did {{not survive}} the introduction of livestock {{and the presence of}} feral cats. [...] However, sub-fossil evidence of the former presence of native mammals has brought reintroduction of the boodie, Shark Bay mouse, <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> and western barred bandicoot and greater stick-nest rat.|$|E
50|$|Macropodinae is a {{subfamily}} of marsupials in {{the family}} Macropodidae, which includes the kangaroos, wallabies, and related species. The subfamily includes about ten genera and at least 51 species. It includes all living members of the Macropodidae except for the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> (Lagostrophus fasciatus), the only surviving member of the subfamily Lagostrophinae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> (Lagostrophus fasciatus) {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} member of the once-numerous subfamily Sthenurinae, and although once common across southern Australia, is now restricted to two islands off the Western Australian coast which are free of introduced predators. It is not as closely related to the other hare wallabies (genus Lagorchestes) as the hare wallabies are to the other wallabies.|$|E
50|$|Bruce Leake, {{a farmer}} from nearby Kellerberrin, {{documented}} the rich past fauna {{of the eastern}} wheatbelt in the late 1800s. These included possum, phascogale, tammar wallaby, brush wallaby, rock-wallaby, nailtail wallaby, <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby,</b> rufous hare-wallaby, woylie, boodie, pig-footed bandicoot, dalgite, numbat and chuditch. Many of these species would {{have occurred in the}} Narembeen district also. Unfortunately, very little of this fauna remains. It has only been comparatively recently that this loss of fauna has been attributed largely to predation by introduced foxes and feral cats.|$|E
50|$|Mating season {{starts in}} December and ends in September. The <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> reaches {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age, breeding usually starts in the second year. Gestation appears to last several months and mothers generally raise one young each year, although {{it is possible for}} females to produce two young per year. Young remain in their mother's pouch for six months and continue to be weaned for another three months. In situations where a mother's young dies, some mothers have an extra embryo to possibly rear another.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the little}} eagle {{has a large}} range {{and can be found}} in most parts of Australia, except heavily forested parts of the Great Dividing Range (Marchant and Higgins, 1993). Like so many Australian natives, it faces a deteriorating {{population}} due to a loss of habitat and competition from other species. One of the biggest factors to the decline of the little eagle is the decline of rabbits due to the release of the calicivirus, interestingly the eagle relied heavily on the rabbit population due to the extinction and massive decline of native terrestrial mammals of rabbit size or smaller such as large rodents, bandicoots, bettongs, juvenile <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> and other wallabies (Sharp et al. 2002).|$|E
5000|$|Osteological {{information}} (predominantly cave floor surface finds) {{has yielded}} that Simosthenurus {{is part of}} the same family as that of modern kangaroos. However, modern kangaroos are plantigrade hoppers, using jumping as their means of locomotion, while Simosthenurus was a bipedal unguligrade, walking {{in a manner similar to}} that of hominids. Although members of Simosthenurus were no taller than most modern species of kangaroo, their robust bones, broad pelvis, long arms and short necks were unique adaptations to their browsing mode of feeding. They had single-toed hind feet had small hoof-like nails more typical of animals adapted to moving over relatively flat terrain. Simosthenurus is a highly distinct lineage of macropods, with no living descendants. However, it is possible that their closest living cousin is the <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby,</b> which is now restricted to small isolated islands off the coast of Western Australia.|$|E

40|$|The only {{substantial}} wild {{populations of}} banded Lagostrophus fasciatus and rufous Lagorchestes hirsutus hare-wallabies occur on Bernier and Dorre Islands, {{off the coast}} of Western Australia. Banded hare-wallabies were widespread in southwestern Australia but have not been recorded there since 1906; rufous hare-wallabies had a broad distribution across arid Australia but now have a single mainland population in the Tanami Desert. We assessed distribution and abundance of hare-wallabies on Bernier and Dorre Islands from spotlight sightings of animals on a series of east-west transects across each island. Abundance was estimated using line transects. The <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> is the more abundant species on both islands with a population of about 3, 900 on Bernier and 3, 800 on Dorre Island. This species depends on the shelter afforded by low-spreading shrubs of Heterodendrum oleifolium, Acacia coriacea, A. ligulata, Diplolaena dampiera, and Ficus platypoda. Wallabies occur mainly on the dunes that form the spine of Dorre Island and the travertine of its west coast. On Bernier Island they occur in the north, where dense thickets of Acacia coriacea, A ligulata, H. oleifolium and D. dampiera, and a tall heath of Abutilon exoneum and Scaevola crassifolia are best developed. The rufous hare-wallaby has a population of about 2, 600 on Bernier and 1, 700 on Dorre Island. It occurs throughout both islands in most habitats, but is most abundant in the south of each. It burrows extensively on the inland sandplain and in the dunes...|$|E
40|$|First {{published}} online: December 18, 2014 Understanding {{the evolution}} of Australia's extinct marsupial megafauna has been hindered by a relatively incomplete fossil record and convergent or highly specialized morphology, which confound phylogenetic analyses. Further, the harsh Australian climate and early date of most megafaunal extinctions (39 - 52 ka) means {{that the vast majority}} of fossil remains are unsuitable for ancient DNA analyses. Here, we apply cross-species DNA capture to fossils from relatively high latitude, high altitude caves in Tasmania. Using low-stringency hybridization and high-throughput sequencing, we were able to retrieve mitochondrial sequences from two extinct megafaunal macropodid species. The two specimens, Simosthenurus occidentalis (giant short-faced kangaroo) and Protemnodon anak (giant wallaby), have been radiocarbon dated to 46 - 50 and 40 - 45 ka, respectively. This is significantly older than any Australian fossil that has previously yielded DNA sequence information. Processing the raw sequence data from these samples posed a bioinformatic challenge due to the poor preservation of DNA. We explored several approaches in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in retained sequencing reads. Our findings demonstrate the critical importance of adopting stringent processing criteria when distant outgroups are used as references for mapping highly fragmented DNA. Based on the most stringent nucleotide data sets (879 bp for S. occidentalis and 2, 383 bp for P. anak), total-evidence phylogenetic analyses confirm that macropodids consist of three primary lineages: Sthenurines such as Simosthenurus (extinct short-faced kangaroos), the macropodines (all other wallabies and kangaroos), and the enigmatic living <b>banded</b> <b>hare-wallaby</b> Lagostrophus fasciatus (Lagostrophinae). Protemnodon emerges as a close relative of Macropus (large living kangaroos), a position not supported by recent morphological phylogenetic analyses. Bastien Llamas, Paul Brotherton, Kieren J.
