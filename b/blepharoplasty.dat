Full-thickness skin grafts were harvested from 40 bilateral upper lid <b>blepharoplasties.</b> Before surgery the face was sterilised, {{the head of the}} patient was packed with sterile, single-use surgical drapes and the whole face was left exposed. The harvested full-thickness skin grafts were conserved in sterile containers at 4 degrees C for 6 days, rolled in gauze moistened with either 4 ml of sterile saline solution (group I) or with 4 ml of gentamicin solution (2 mg/ml) (group II). The degree of contamination, expressed in colony forming units (CFU), was evaluated on days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Identification of the microorganisms was done to species level following standard procedures and commercial methods. In group I 2 grafts (5 %) were negative during the whole observation period while the other 38 grafts (95 %) presented a degree of contamination ranging from 10 (2) to 10 (4) CFU. Microorganisms isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (24 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 cases), Serratia liquefaciens (1 case) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2 cases). In group II, 26 grafts (65 %) were negative during the whole observation time while in 14 cases (35 %) a few colonies (3 to 6) of Candida albicans were isolated on day 2 and remained constant in number for the whole observation time. The storage of full-thickness skin graft with an antibiotic cover is more reliable than the storage of full-thickness skin graft without an antibiotic cove...|$|R

2500|$|In Japan, being cute is {{acceptable}} {{for men and}} women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the neotenic look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men.

Women also employ a look of innocence {{in order to further}} play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large contact lenses, false eyelashes, dramatic eye makeup, and even have an East Asian <b>blepharoplasty,</b> commonly known as double eyelid surgery.|$|E

Sequentially, lower eyelid <b>blepharoplasty</b> can successfully address the anatomic matters of excess eyelid skin, slackness of the eye-muscles and of the orbital septum (palpebral ligament), excess orbital fat, malposition of the lower eyelid, and prominence of the nasojugal groove, where the orbit (eye socket) meets {{the slope of the}} nose.|$|E
