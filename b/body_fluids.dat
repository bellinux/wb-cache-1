5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} protein on the {{nucleation}} and {{growth rate of}} calcium phosphate precipitation, including hydroxyapatite (HA) and octacalcium phosphate (OCP) precipitation, in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> were analyzed based on the classical nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth theory. To obtain quantitative results for analysis, a model system of bovine serum albumin and lysozyme added to revised simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> was studied. The parameters, such as the concentration of protein binding to calcium and phosphorous ions and the viscosity of the revised simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> with protein additions, were experimentally measured to assist quantitative analysis. The analysis focused {{on the effects of}} protein on calcium phosphate nucleation including changes in the ion concentration, interfacial energies and pH values of the simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> system. The protein effects on calcium phosphate growth were also analyzed based on a diffusion-controlled growth model. The analysis results indicate that proteins present in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> act to increase the free energy of nucleation and reduce the nucleation rates by reducing the effective level of supersaturation in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid.</b> The proteins also affect calcium phosphate nucleation by changing the interfacial energies in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid.</b> However, the analysis indicates that the effects of protein on the interfacial energies could be to either promote or retard the nucleation. The protein effects on the nucleation induced by altering the pH value of the simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> can be neglected. The analysis also indicates that protein addition in revised simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> does not change the basic thermodynamic nature of HA and OCP formation; that is, HA precipitation is more thermodynamically favourable than OCP while OCP precipitation is more kinetically favourable than HA. Proteins presenting in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> always exhibit an inhibitory effect on the growth rate of calcium phosphate precipitates because proteins increase the diffusion resistance of calcium and phosphate ions by increasing the revised simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> viscosity...|$|R

There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.

5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in trace amount in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb.

40|$|Phosphate {{groups on}} {{materials}} surfaces {{are known to}} contribute to apatite formation upon exposure of the materials in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> and improved affinity of the materials for osteoblast-like cells. Typically, polymers containing phosphate groups are organic matrices consisting of apatite–polymer composites prepared by biomimetic process using simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid.</b> Ca 2 + incorporation into the polymer accelerates apatite formation in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> owing because of increase in the supersaturation degree, with respect to apatite in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid,</b> owing to Ca 2 + release from the polymer. However, the effects of phosphate content on the Ca 2 + release and apatite-forming abilities of copolymers in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> are rather elusive. In this study, a phosphate-containing copolymer prepared from vinylphosphonic acid, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate was examined. The release of Ca 2 + in Tris-NaCl buffer and simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> increased as the additive amount of vinylphosphonic acid increased. However, apatite formation was suppressed as the phosphate groups content increased despite the enhanced release of Ca 2 + from the polymer. This phenomenon was reflected by changes in the surface zeta potential. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} the apatite-forming ability of vinylphosphonic acid- 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate-triethylene glycol dimethacrylate copolymer treated with CaCl 2 solution was governed by surface state rather than Ca 2 + release in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid...</b>|$|R

Transmission can occur when: <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E

40|$|When {{cultural}} {{sea water}} is diluted, prawn must be accommodated their <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> to different salinity {{of the water}} by being regulated by the osmotic pressure. Concentration of free amino acids in <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> of prawn Penaeus japonicus is decreased to adapt itself to the environment according as salinity of cultural sea water is gradually decreased. This phenomenon is explained by the function of osmo-regulation. The prawn changes composition of free amino acids in the <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> with salinity of the cultural sea water. Main amino acids, which change their concentration and act as osmo-regulation factor, are glycine, proline, arginine and alanine. When the cultural sea water is diluted drastically, the prawn is obliged to be confuged the free amino acid composition in its <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> for a few days...|$|R
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp lineages, {{including}} those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and {{they appear to be}} feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
40|$|A {{bioactive}} {{glass and}} its corresponding glass-ceramic {{have been used}} to investigate the possibility to load a common antibiotic (carbenicillin) on their surface during the reactivity processes which occur by dipping these materials in a simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid.</b> The materials bioactivity in the early stage of simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> treatment has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction. The uptake of carbenicillin has been performed by dipping the samples in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid</b> solution with a drug concentration of 500 mg/l for 6, 12 and 24 h. Some glass samples underwent a pre-treatment in simulated <b>body</b> <b>fluid,</b> for different time frames, in order to form a silica gel layer before the surface exposition to antibiotic. The carbenicillin release has been measured in water up to 36 h. The amount of incorporated and released antibiotic has been estimated by UV visible spectrophotometer.

5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The blood-brain barrier is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in <b>body</b> <b>fluids,</b> such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E

5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in <b>body</b> <b>fluids</b> are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in <b>body</b> <b>fluids.</b> The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E
5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence, including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and <b>body</b> <b>fluids.</b> Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E
