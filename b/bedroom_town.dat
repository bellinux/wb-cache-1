50|$|Primarily a farming {{community}} {{until the early}} part of the 20th century, Sherborn now is a <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> for Boston and the surrounding hi-tech area.|$|E
50|$|It {{used to be}} a farming village {{located between}} Kyoto and Shiga, but Yamashina has now become a <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> for those {{commuting}} to urban area of Kyoto and Osaka because of its convenient location.|$|E
50|$|Seelze {{is a town}} in the {{district}} of Hanover, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated on the river Leine, approx. 10 km west of Hanover. Today Seelze mainly plays the role of a <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> for commuters working in Hanover.|$|E
50|$|The Furano Line (Furano-sen) {{is part of}} the Hokkaido Railway Company {{network in}} Hokkaidō, Japan. It connects Furano Station in the city of Furano and Asahikawa Station in the city of Asahikawa. Popular with tourists, it has {{recently}} come to serve commuters in the <b>bedroom</b> <b>towns</b> that are developing as suburbs of Asahikawa.|$|R
50|$|Time {{passes and}} Sam becomes worse. One night, Henry arrives {{at home and}} finds Sam dead in his <b>bedroom.</b> The <b>town</b> falls into {{mourning}} at Sam's death. He built every house in town, and was closely connected {{to each and every}} one. Though Dean comforts Henry, Pike does the opposite by secluding himself. A funeral is held for Sam, where everyone shows up except for Pike.|$|R
50|$|While {{the town}} has managed to {{maintain}} its New England mill-town charm and culture, {{it is also a}} <b>bedroom</b> commuter <b>town</b> feeding into larger area communities. Many residents drive into Hartford, Manchester, and Enfield, Connecticut, as well as Springfield, Massachusetts, all of which can be reached in about a 30-mile auto commute. It is also about a half-hour drive to the University of Connecticut's main campus in Storrs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{commuter}} town {{may also be}} known as an exurb (short for [...] "extra-urban"), or a bedroom community (Canada and northeastern U.S. usage), <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> or bedroom suburb (U.S. usage), a dormitory town, dormitory suburb, or less commonly a dormitory village (British English/Commonwealth/Ireland). The phrase [...] "bedroom town" [...] has also been adopted into the Japanese wasei-eigo word bed town (beddotaun).|$|E
50|$|The town {{originally}} {{formed as}} one of many farming communities in the area, but also developed an industrial centre on the Northern Railway of Canada's mainline, which ran through what became the downtown area starting in the 1850s. It also became a thriving market town {{with the arrival of}} the Metropolitan Street Railway in 1899. Over time, the town developed into a primarily residential area, and the expansion of Ontario Highway 400 to the west and the construction of Ontario Highway 404 to the east increasingly turned it into a <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> since the 1980s. The Official Plan, however, includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.|$|E
50|$|Niedernhausen is {{generally}} {{said to be}} a <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> for the cities in Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. At 30%, Wiesbaden has the greatest share of commuters from Niedernhausen, followed closely by Frankfurt am Main. The number of jobs has risen along with the population, although given the local commuting structure, the share of the population employed locally has always been rather slight, at about 10%. In June 1987, 1,192 persons were employed in Niedernhausen. By June 2002 this had risen by about 21% to 1,443. The share engaged in service businesses in 1987 was about 65%, and in 2002, 71%. The local purchasing power is about €21,346 for each inhabitant, putting it roughly 28.5% above the national average, and thereby also making it the highest figure for the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{reports of}} the trial in those confounded papers,' thought Mr. Pickwick. 'They have heard all about me.' 'You are the gentleman {{residing}} on Clapham Green,' resumed Bantam, 'who lost {{the use of his}} limbs from imprudently taking cold after port wine; who could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering, and who had the water from the king's bath bottled at one hundred and three degrees, and sent by wagon to his <b>bedroom</b> in <b>town,</b> where he bathed, sneezed, and the same day recovered. Very remarkable!' ...|$|R
50|$|Residential {{communities}} are typically communities that help support more commercial or industrial communities with consumers and workers. That phenomenon is probably {{because some people}} prefer not {{to live in an}} urban or industrial area, but rather a suburban or rural setting. For that reason, they are also called dormitory <b>towns,</b> <b>bedroom</b> communities, or commuter towns.|$|R
50|$|The Highland Railway belatedly {{set about}} {{building}} its own {{hotel in the}} town, {{but that did not}} open until 1911. Strathpeffer experienced a remarkable increase in seasonal visitors, and with the Highland Railway hotel there were more than 500 hotel <b>bedrooms</b> in the <b>town,</b> more than anywhere else on the Highland Railway system except Inverness and Pitlochry. The town was named The Harrogate of the North by the Weekly Scotsman newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|Grain Wharf {{is located}} at the centre of the Quays, and {{consists}} of three matching developments: Winnipeg Quay and Vancouver Quay to the west of Mariners Canal, and St. Lawrence Quay to the east. Its name derives from the land's previous use, when imported grain was delivered by ship and transferred to the railway network that ran the length of Pier 8 (Central Wharf). Built between 1985 and 1995, Grain Wharf consists of a combination of two and three <b>bedroom</b> <b>town</b> houses and apartments, none exceeding four storeys in height. Many properties have views over Huron and Erie Basin (Dock 9) and Mariners Canal, with a number of town houses in Winnipeg and Vancouver Quay facing a landscaped garden square. The development is noted for its distinctly symmetrical layout. Mariners Canal was added to link the cleaned water of Ontario Basin to the south and Erie Basin to the north for water sport; the watersports centre is opposite Vancouver Quay. Vancouver and St. Lawrence Quays are linked by a footbridge over the canal, and by the Quays road.|$|E
50|$|The nearby Longmeadow Business Park {{has made}} Greenstone Hill a {{convenient}} place to purchase residential property {{and as a}} result, a lot of residential development has been constructed or is still under construction here. These properties are mostly {{in the form of}} town houses and apartments within a Body Corporate, but there are also many free standing houses within gated communities. A 3 <b>bedroom,</b> 2 bathroom <b>town</b> house can be purchased for around R1,350,000 (approx. US$113,000).|$|R
5000|$|The town {{possesses}} a gun. It is a brass piece, made in 1549 by the Owine Brothers, John and Robert, {{so that the}} town might be defended from French invasion. The gun was never used in action, but {{was taken to the}} top of Brading Down in 1832 so that it could be fired to celebrate the passing of the Reform Bill. Unfortunately it exploded and split, putting a stop to celebrations for the day. In the 1950s, it was stolen from the [...] "Gunne House" [...] behind St. Mary's Church and was found in a sale room in Kent. It was returned, however, not to the town, but to the Oglanders at Nunwell House, where it remains beneath Fanny Oglander's <b>bedroom</b> window. The <b>Town</b> Trust has asked for it back, but Fanny Oglander has said that security arrangements should be improved and the matter remains unresolved.|$|R
5000|$|An {{underground}} explosion {{killed two}} miners instantly and two later from burns received at the Jerome mine on July 29, 1932, {{the single largest}} accident in the mine's history uncovered in research to date. The coal mine closed in the 1954. Jerome rapidly became a <b>bedroom</b> community. The <b>town</b> retained much of its close-knit ethnic character and its spirit well into the 1990s, however. As an example, the Jerome Volunteer Fire Department was founded in 1952 with Steve Gironda as its first president. The Volunteer Fire Department remains today as an anchor of community activity. In 1955, the Dorfman and Hoffman Company established a garment factory in the former Hillman company store building, bringing 200 needed jobs to Jerome. The factory continued operation until 1964. [...] A lumber mill operated out of former mining-operations buildings in the 1970s. A wind-whipped fire destroyed the lumber mill in 1975, and remaining mining buildings were demolished subsequently.|$|R
5000|$|During the Scotland Yard {{investigation}} into the murder, Selina's accounts were regarded as the most truthful owing {{to the fact that}} she was the last person to see the minister to his <b>bedroom.</b> Former Kisumu <b>Town</b> East MP Gor Sunguh says the death of the witness is a possible pointer to the end of the inquiry and the revelation of truth. Gor Sunguh, who chaired the commission that probed Ouko's death, says more than 100 witnesses have so far disappeared in questionable circumstances. He says this will make it impossible for Kenyans to ever find out the truth. However, some argue that truth will be known, considering that majority of the witnesses had spoken before various investigating bodies. Selina was one of the few remaining witnesses. Some of the living witnesses include former DC Jonah Anguka, Zablon Agallo who was an Administration Police officer, Ouko's bodyguard Gordon Okoth, Phillip Ogutu (the gate keeper), Eric Ouko and James Onyango K'Oyoo. Many witnesses have died in mysterious circumstances over two decades since Ouko's murder, however in a recent documentary series aired on Citizen TV in March 2017, the idea of the [...] "mysterious deaths" [...] surrounding the killing of Dr Robert Ouko has been robustly challenged.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, the band revealed they spent two months writing and recording their third album with producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange in his recording studio in Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Lead singer Adam Levine, spoke about the experience of working with Lange: [...] "He worked me harder than anyone ever has," ... "I would {{come in with a}} finished song, and he'd say, 'That's a good start. Now strip it down to the drums and start over.' The coolest thing about him is that not only has he been a huge, legendary producer, but he also is a legit, serious writer."Rolling Stone has said that the resulting disc is the band's brightest-sounding and poppiest yet and that it delivers Lange's mix of catchy hooks and punchy rhythms. Levine has also said about the album: [...] "Our first record was a reflection of my love for Stevie Wonder. With the second I kept going back and forth between Prince and The Police. But there was no one on my mind for this album. It's just great pop." [...] In a separate interview, however, Levine said that the album was influenced by Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye. The album artwork was revealed on July 1, 2010. The cover photo for the album was taken by 19-year-old photographer Rosie Hardy, who also serves as the model in the photo. Hardy took the photo herself, in just under an hour, in her own <b>bedroom</b> in the <b>town</b> of Buxton in the United Kingdom.|$|R
