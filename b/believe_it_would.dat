5|$|Since Archie Comics {{partnered with}} Marvel Comics for the 1994 {{one-shot}} comic Archie Meets the Punisher, the Archie characters {{have had a}} tradition of team-ups with characters from other fictional universes. Following the success of Archie meets KISS in 2012 and Archie meets Glee in 2013, the Archie Creative Summit held in March 2014 included a brainstorming session for new crossovers. Godzilla and Friday the 13th were considered, but the Predator received the most support. Artist Fernando Ruiz was at the summit and liked the premise, but did not <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> actually be made, or {{that he would be}} involved if it was.|$|E

There was an agreement among the parties not to discuss the issue before the 2010 general election. In a poll from May 2007, 33.3% were in favour, while 53.8% were against and 13.0% were uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} theism, God {{is characterized}} as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is {{devoid of any}} anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists {{do not believe that}} God can be completely defined. They <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{proposal}} was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log-processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line {{would be used for}} transporting sawn timber from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. Forest industry people did not express an interest in this option, as they did not <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> bring any new opportunities to them.|$|E

Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E
25|$|Amon began 1969 {{with success}} driving the Dino engined Ferrari 246T in the Tasman Series that {{included}} winning both the New Zealand and Australian Grands Prix. He would ultimately win the seven race Tasman Series, finishing with four wins, two thirds and one retirement, but in Formula One his poor luck continued. Despite six starts from top-six positions, {{he was only}} able to achieve a third-place at the Dutch GP. Ferrari's F1 V12 engine was too unreliable and although its replacement had proven very fast in testing, it had suffered many mechanical breakages. Amon {{had no reason to}} <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be any more dependable than the V12, so although the new engine was clearly more powerful, he decided to leave Ferrari for a Cosworth DFV powered team. Ironically, the new flat-12 engine would become one of the best Formula One engines of the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Her former friends aren't {{doing much}} better: Annie (Diane Keaton), meanwhile, is separated, {{suffering}} extreme self-esteem issues, {{and going through}} therapy with her husband. Brenda (Bette Midler) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise (Goldie Hawn), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited {{for the first time}} since college, Annie's husband, Aaron (Stephen Collins), leaves her for her younger therapist (Marcia Gay Harden) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty (Dan Hedaya) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill (Victor Garber), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After each one reads her letter from Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris (Jennifer Dundas) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.|$|E

Upon further investigation, Phlox learns that the Valakians suffer from the illness because their gene pool has reached a [...] "dead end" [...] and that the Menk are undergoing an [...] "awakening process." [...] He also finds that the Valakians have been stifling and underestimating the Menk. He has found a cure, but does not <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be ethical to administer. Archer considers how a [...] "primary directive" [...] would be helpful, and provides the Valakians with medicine that will diminish the symptoms for a decade, anticipating the Menks' natural evolution and new levels of understanding between them.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of these rumours and arguments, the belief {{strengthened}} among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin explicitly advised Edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying Simpson, indicating that if he did, in direct contravention of his ministers' advice, the government would resign en masse. The King responded, according to his own account later: [...] "I intend to marry Mrs. Simpson as soon as she is free to marry... if the Government opposed the marriage, as the Prime Minister had given me reason to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> then I was prepared to go."

500|$|The plan's {{supporters}} {{state that}} a consumption tax would increase savings and investment, ease tax compliance and increase economic growth, increase incentives for international business to locate in the US and increase US competitiveness in international trade. [...] The plan {{is intended to}} increase cost transparency for funding the federal government. Supporters <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> increase civil liberties, benefit the environment and effectively tax illegal activity and undocumented immigrants. Opponents contend that a consumption tax of this size would be extremely difficult to collect, and would lead to pervasive tax evasion. They also argue that the proposed sales tax rate would raise less revenue than the current tax system, leading to an increased budget deficit. Other concerns include the proposed repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, removal of tax deduction incentives, transition effects on after-tax savings, incentives on credit use {{and the loss of}} tax advantages to state and local bonds.|$|E

500|$|Several game modes in Backbreaker {{can also}} be played as local or online multi-player over the Internet. In Exhibition mode, a second player can join the game and can play either against or with the first player. Two players may also compete against one another in Tackle Alley for the most points. Games against other players are played in splitscreen format {{as opposed to the}} usual single-camera view of other {{football}} game series. This is due to Backbreakers [...] "on the field" [...] camera angle, set close to the players, making it difficult for a single-camera two-player setup. Although this setup differs from most modern football games, the developers <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> add realism to the player's experience. [...] "One of the benefits of having this down-on-the-field camera view is that it really makes playing as the quarterback like the passing mechanic feel really natural," [...] said producer Rob Donald.|$|E

[...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

[...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation".
