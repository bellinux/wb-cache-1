25|$|Wakefield {{had learned}} from Barrett the {{complicated}} nature of land ownership in the Port Nicholson area because of past wars and expulsions and from late October Wakefield was informed of—but dismissed—rumours that Māori had sold land that did not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Problems with some of their purchases were emerging, however. Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha boarded the Tory near Kapiti to tell Wakefield that in its October agreement Ngāti Toa intended the company to have not millions of acres {{at the top of}} the South Island, but just the two small areas of Whakatu and Taitapu. And in December, a week after arriving at Hokianga to inspect the land bought from the 1825 New Zealand Company, Wakefield was told by Ngāpuhi chiefs that the only land the New Zealand Land Company could claim in the north was about a square mile at Hokianga. Further, there was nothing at all for them at either Kaipara or Manukau Harbour. There was a prize for him, however, with his purchase on 13 December of the Wairau Valley in the north of the South Island. Wakefield bought the land for ₤100 from the widow of whaling Captain John Blenkinsopp, who had claimed to have earlier bought it off Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha. That sale would lead to the 1843 Wairau Affray in which 22 English settlers and four Māori would be killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{protected}} mode of the 80286 was not utilized until {{many years after}} its release, {{in part because of}} the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a RAM disk driver included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. A DOS could utilize the additional RAM available in {{protected mode}} (extended memory) either via a BIOS call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a RAM disk, or as emulation of expanded memory. The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64kB segments, just like in real mode.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of EdwardIV in 1483, the notorious murder of the Princes in the Tower is {{traditionally}} believed to have taken place. The incident {{is one of the most}} infamous events associated with the Tower of London. EdwardV's uncle Richard Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule. Traditional accounts have held that the 12-year-old Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother Richard. The Duke of Gloucester was proclaimed King RichardIII in July. The princes were last seen in public in June 1483; it has traditionally been thought that the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483. Bones thought to <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> were discovered in 1674 when the 12th-century forebuilding at the entrance to the White Tower was demolished; however, the reputed level at which the bones were found (...) would put the bones at a depth similar to that of the recently discovered Roman graveyard found [...] underneath the Minories a few hundred yards to the north. Opposition to Richard escalated until he was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 by the Lancastrian Henry Tudor, who ascended to the throne as HenryVII.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Rose {{slips out}} of the TARDIS and uses a lab coat she found to {{masquerade}} as an employee to explore Torchwood. [...] She gains access to the sphere chamber with the Doctor's psychic paper, but is detained by a Dr. Singh. He discovers that Rose is an imposter and informs Ms. Hartman of her presence. Dr. Singh then asks his colleague Samuel, whom Rose recognises as Mickey Smith, to seal the doors. Ms. Hartman questions the Doctor, who admits that {{the woman in the}} sphere chamber is really Rose and that the woman with him in her office is Rose's mum Jackie. In the command centre, the three employees under manipulation initiate an unscheduled ghost shift and forcibly open the breach. The extended shift causes millions of ghosts to appear across the globe before they materialise into their true form, the Cybermen. At the same time the Cybermen arrive the Void ship suddenly activates and begins to open. The Cybermen take control of Torchwood and order the complete surrender of humanity for conversion. The Doctor, puzzled at how the Cybermen could have created an advanced piece of technology like the Void ship, asks the Cyber Leader how they were able to build it. The Cyber Leader responds that the sphere does not <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The Cybermen are similarly oblivious to the origins of the sphere and that they merely followed its course through the breach.|$|E

The settlement also requires them to provide clear and prominent disclosure on the packaging of future CDs of any limits on copying or restrictions {{on the use of}} playback devices, and ban the company from installing content protection software without obtaining consumers’ authorization. FTC chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras added that, [...] "Installations of secret software that create security risks are intrusive and unlawful.

2500|$|Since {{a central}} tenet {{of the flat}} tax is to {{minimize}} the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad [...] special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. [...] The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> [...] If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed. [...] It's a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. [...] A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible. Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.|$|E
