Materials and Methods: The effect of baffle geometry on the efficiency of membrane clarification of pomegranate juice in a flat-sheet module was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The geometry of the membrane unit was plotted and meshed with Gambit software, and was solved using FLUENT software. A two-dimensional double-precision method at steady state was selected to simulate the membrane process. The convective terms were discretized with a standard first-order upwind scheme in computational solution. The RNG k-  model was used due to its high accuracy in eddy flows with a low Reynolds number.

In most fluidized beds, the local bubble gas flux varies greatly over the cross-section. A novel triboelectric method is developed {{to measure the}} bubble gas distribution in a fluidized bed. A correlation relates the local bubble gas flux to the triboelectric signal generated by {{the impact of the}} gas bubbles on a triboprobe. Several signal analysis tools, such as power spectrum, cycle analysis and signal moments, were used to determine the best experimental fit for the profile of the bubble gas flux. The triboelectric method is used to study the impact of baffle and fluxtube on the distribution of the gas bubbles. Efficient and uniform liquid feed distribution in Fluid CokersTM enhances the yield of valuable products and the coker operability by reducing the formation of wet agglomerates. A promising method to improve liquid distribution could be the modification of bed hydrodynamics and mixing characteristics using ring baffles with and without fluxtubes. In small scaled-down bed, such a baffle changed the fluidized bed hydrodynamics by redirecting gas bubbles above the baffle region, directed towards the jet spray, which improved liquid distribution by reducing agglomerate formation.

40|$|Coating of {{particulate}} solids by a {{thin film}} layer is of interest in many industrial applications such as seed and tablet coating. In seed processing, seeds are commonly coated with a protective coating layer consisting of fertilisers and disease control agents, such as pesticides and fungicides. Batch coaters are commonly used for this purpose. A typical coater consists of a vertical axis cylindrical vessel with a rotating base and a spray disc in the centre, onto which the coating liquid is fed to atomise and spray-coat the seeds. The seeds are driven around the vessel by its rotating base, and are mixed by two baffles; one {{on either side of}} the vessel. In the present study, Distinct Element Method (DEM) simulations are used to model the seed coating process. Corn seed are used as a model material and their shape is captured using X-Ray Tomography (XRT), which is approximated in the DEM by clumped spheres. The coating uniformity of the seeds is predicted by implementing a coating model in the DEM, whereby the coating droplets are simulated as very fine spheres projecting tangentially from a ring at the edge of the spinning disk. The size and velocity of droplets leaving the spray disk are measured using high speed video imaging and implemented into DEM simulations. The coating mechanism is represented in the DEM by considering that once a droplet contacts a corn seed, it is removed from the simulation and its mass is attributed to the coating of the corn seed. The distribution of mass of sprayed spheres on the corn seeds and their coefficient of variation are evaluated for a range of process conditions, such as the base rotational speed, atomiser disc position relative to the base and baffle arrangement and designs.

Seed motion and mixing are important in ensuring uniform coating; hence {{the focus of this}} work is to address the mixing efficiency and coating uniformity of corn seeds in a rotary batch seed mixer. In the present study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to analyse the motion and coating uniformity of the seeds. A comprehensive study has been carried out addressing the influence of the shape of corn seeds for accurately simulating their flow in the mixer using two commonly used techniques: (i) manipulation of coefficient of rolling friction of spherical particles, and (ii) clumping multiple spheres. Both methods were successful in simulating the flow of seeds in the mixer, however the former method is found to be an empirical approach rather than predictive. A coating model is used for predicting the coating uniformity of corn seeds in the mixer. Effect of various process parameters on variation of coating mass among the seeds is investigated. For the seed mixer, the baffle clearance gap, baffle geometry and position of the atomiser disc were found to be the key influential process parameters affecting the coating uniformity of corn seeds. Other process parameters such as the base rotational speed, <b>baffle</b> <b>angle,</b> width and curvature had less effects on coating variability.

About 35 – 40 % of heat exchangers are of the STHXs, & this is primarily due to the robust construction geometry as well as easy maintenance & possible upgrades of STHXs. Segmental baffles are most commonly used in conventional STHXs to support tubes & change fluid flow direction. But, conventional heat exchangers with segmental baffles in shell-side have some shortcomings resulting in the relatively low conversion of pressure drop into a useful heat transfer. The Helixchanger- a heat exchanger with shell side helical flow eliminates principle shortcomings caused by shell side zigzag flow induced by conventional baffle arrangements. Both hydrodynamic studies & testing of heat transfer & the pressure drop on research facilities & industrial equipment showed much better performance of helically baffled heat exchanger when compared with conventional ones. The new design reduces dead zones within the shell space. These results in relatively high (Heat transfer co-efficient/Pressure drop) & low shell side fouling. Thus, the helixchanger exhibits much more effective way of converting pressure drop into a useful heat transfer than conventional heat transfer. This project is basically gives the performance of shell & tube heat exchangers with helical baffles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 3 D numerical analysis of fully developed periodic laminar flow {{in a circular}} tube fitted with 45 ° inclined baffles with inline arrangement. The computations {{are based on a}} finite volume method, and the SIMPLE algorithm has been implemented. The characteristics of fluid flow are presented for Reynolds number, Re = 100 – 1000, based on the hydraulic diameter (D) of the tube. The <b>angled</b> <b>baffles</b> were repeatedly inserted at the middle of the test tube with inline arrangement to generate vortex flows over the tested tube. Effects of different Reynolds numbers and blockage ratios (b/D, BR) with a single pitch ratio of 1 on flow structure in the tested tube were emphasized. The flows in baffled tube show periodic flow at x/D ≈ 2 - 3, and become a fully developed periodic flow profiles at x/D ≈ 6 - 7, depending on Re, BR and transverse plane positions. The computational results reveal that the higher of BR and closer position of turbulators, the faster of fully developed periodic flow profiles...|$|R
40|$|The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey's highest {{recommended}} space {{mission was}} a Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) to efficiently conduct {{three kinds of}} studies: dark energy surveys, exoplanet surveys, and guest surveys. In this paper we illustrate four potential WFIRST payloads that accomplish these objectives and that fully utilize optical and technical advances made since the community input to the Decadal Survey. These improvements, developed by our group, are: unobscured 1. 3 or 1. 5 m apertures; simultaneous dual focal lengths delivering pixel scales of 0. 18 " for imaging and 0. 38 " or 0. 45 " for slitless spectroscopy; {{the use of a}} prism in converging light for slitless spectroscopy; and payload features that allow up to 270 days/year observing the Galactic Bulge. These factors combine to allow WFIRST payloads that provide improved survey rates compared to previous mission concepts. In this report we perform direct comparisons of survey speeds for constant survey depth using our optical and exposure-time tools previously developed for JDEM. We further compare these four alternative WFIRST configurations to JDEM-Omega and to the European Space Agency's Euclid mission, and to an alternative Euclid configuration making use of the lessons learned here that delivers performance approaching that of WFIRST. We find that the unobstructed pupil is a major benefit to weak lensing owing to its tighter point spread function, improved signal to noise, and higher resolved galaxy count. Using two simultaneous plate scales in a fully focal system is practical and simplifies the optical train, and the use of a prism in converging light offers improved throughput compared to a grism. We find that a 45 degree outer <b>baffle</b> cutoff <b>angle,</b> combined with fully articulated solar panels and K-band antenna, substantially increase the exoplanet yield.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} particle trajectories in a gas turbine intake has been presented. computer model was written to simulate a particle behaviour flight in a theoretical flow which was assumed to inviscid, irrotational and incompressible. The model is also on other assumptions which imposes several limitations {{the accuracy of the}} predicted results. These limitations the objectives of the experimental investigation of particle trajectories which was carried out in a 30. 0 section of an axisymmetric helicopter inertial separator. The separator section was fully instrumented with pressure tappings to determine the near-wall flow condition. The flowfield at the central (vertical) plane of separator was also measured with a two spot laser anemometer. The dust particles used in the tests were the spherical ballotini and irregular quartz particles with diameter ranging f-rom 15. 0 to 150. 0 microns. These particles seeded locally into the separator at three initial positions. The restitution ratios for the quartz particle based on experimental data and the ballotini particle's were based on a simple relation, which was derived by and error matching of predicted and experimental results. The particle trajectories, velocities and <b>angles</b> in <b>separator</b> were measured at several stations using the anemometer. The measured results were compared with predicted values from the model which has been modified accept both the experimentally measured and inviscid flowfield. The particle shape factor was also included to account for the higher drag on the non-spherical particle. Further modification was also made to include the restitution ratios of the ballotini particle. Good agreement found between measured and predicted particle trajecto- velocities and angles for both the spherical and non- spherical particle. The trajectories of the large particles (> 100. Oum) are ballistic' in nature which are governed by the inertia forces. The trajectories of the smaller particles are influenced by the both aerodynamic and inertia forces...|$|R

The baffle wall was constantly heated {{and the other three}} walls of the channel were kept insulated. The experimentations were conducted to collect the data on Nusselt number (N u b) and friction factor (f b) by varying the Reynolds number (Re) [*]=[*] 3000 – 21, 000 and angle of attack (α a) from 30 ° to 70 °, for the kept values of relative baffle height (H b / H) = 0. 50, relative pitch ratio (P b / H) = 1. 0, relative discrete width (g w / H b) = 1. 5 and relative discrete distance (D d / L v) = 0. 67. As compared to the smooth wall, the V-pattern baffle roughened channel enhances the Nusselt number (N u b) and friction factor (f b) by 4. 2 and 5. 9 times, respectively. The present discrete V-pattern <b>baffle</b> shapes with <b>angle</b> of attack (α a) of 60 ° equivalent to flow Reynolds number of 3000 yields the greatest thermohydraulic performance.
