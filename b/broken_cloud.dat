He and his wingman Unteroffizier Heinrich Bosnin were flying at an {{altitude}} of [...] when they spotted a formation of nine Curtiss P-40's. Ostermann shot down the rear P-40. The two were reforming to make a second attack when they themselves were attacked from behind by a group of Soviet fighters emerging from the <b>broken</b> <b>cloud</b> cover. Ostermann's Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 10438—factory number) was hit in the cockpit by 41 IAP's (41st Fighter Aviation Regiment) Starshiy Leytenant (First Lieutenant) Arkadiy Sukov flying a LaGG-3. The aircraft rolled over and crashed into the edge of a small wood. After Werner Mölders and Leopold Steinbatz, Ostermann was the third of 45 recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords to die in World War II. This made him the first Swords recipient to be lost in air combat, as Mölders death was accidental and Steinbatz had only received the Oak Leaves before he died.|$|E

40|$|Introduction In the {{presence}} of <b>broken</b> <b>clouds</b> over snow or ice covered surfaces {{it is difficult for}} UV/VIS spaceborne sensors to distinguish between clouds and high reflecting surfaces. These uncertainties lead to problems in the ozone vertical column retrieval. A new approach presented here characterizes the inhomogeneous pixel area (with <b>broken</b> <b>clouds)</b> by deriving an effective albedo and cloud-top-height. These parameters are determined by minimizing the difference between GOME measured sunnormalized radiances and corresponding model spectra in the spectral range of O 4 absorption near 370 nm. Extrapolation of this effective albedo to short wavelengths enables us to improve the ozone vertical column retrieval. 2 GOME ozone retrieval The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment GOME was launched aboard ESA's 2 nd European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS- 2) in April 1995 into a polar sunsynchronous orbit.
