50|$|Second Chance is an American <b>body</b> armor <b>manufacturing</b> {{company and}} {{was the first one to}} use kevlar for body armor. The company was founded in the early 1970s by former U.S. Marine and pizza {{delivery}} owner/driver Richard Davis.

This incident was later documented in a 1995 book written by firearms instructor Massad Ayoob called The Ayoob Files: The Book.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} market for food {{products}} derived from cattle, chickens and pigs that are considered {{to have had a}} welfare-friendlier life. Welfare-friendly claims hold considerable ambiguity in meaning since there is no precise definition of what better ‘animal welfare’ means in practice. However, despite this ambiguity there are numbers of animals that are being made into food products which carry labelling that suggests higher animal welfare, and in addition many animals or parts of animals which experience the same living standards but which don’t ever get labelled to suggest welfare-friendliness. Through the development of an ‘economy of qualities’ (Callon et al 2002) within the food market {{there have been a number}} of private initiatives by major retailers, farmers’ cooperatives, independent standard <b>bodies,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> brands within the UK which has supported the development of a market for ‘welfare-friendly’ food products. How do these organisations work together to realise the economic potential through product labelling or corporate branding of meat/dairy or egg products from welfare-friendly production practices? Or in other words, by what mechanisms do some bodies or body-products of animals attain, retain or lose power as welfare-friendly as they move through the different organised spaces of the supply chain?<br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} technique for compensating manufacturing and environmental variability in subthreshold circuits using “canary flip-flop (FF), ” which can predict timing errors. A 32 -bit Kogge–Stone adder whose performance {{was controlled by}} body-biasing was fabricated in a 65 -nm CMOS process. Measurement {{results show that the}} adaptive control can compensate process, supply voltage, and temperature variations and improve the energy efficiency of subthreshold circuits by up to 46 % compared to worst-case design and operation with guardbanding. We also discuss how to determine design parameters, such as the inserted location and the buffer delay of the canary FF, supposing two approaches: configuration in the design phase and post-silicon tuning. Index Terms—Adaptive speed control, <b>body</b> biasing, <b>manufacturing</b> variability, subthreshold circuit, timing error prediction. I...|$|R
5000|$|The Denver Tramway Company used 39-foot trolley cars. Some {{were built}} by the company itself though most came from the Woeber Auto <b>Body</b> and <b>Manufacturing</b> Company. Type 1 cars were built for {{operation}} in a single direction, the entrance was {{on the center of}} the right side, and the rear of the cars were not completely enclosed. Type 2 cars were built to be reversible so they had controls at both ends and center entrances on both sides. The trolley cars had a distinct appearance, being painted [...] "Coach Painter’s Red" [...] on the main panel, and [...] "Dark Straw", (yellow) on the lower panels. Unpowered trailers could be pulled behind the trolleys in rush hour in order to carry an increased number of riders.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the origin}} of the company name is no longer known, several {{theories}} are known to exist. Most commonly, in the early 1930s, A.L. Luce was perceived to have been nervous about using the family surname for the company out of fears of it being mispronounced (i.e., [...] "the loose bus"). [...] When showing a blue and yellow demonstrator unit to school officials, Luce overheard the positive reception of school children who had seen the bus, who had nicknamed it [...] "a pretty blue bird"; Luce chose that name for his <b>body</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company, though school buses are painted yellow today.|$|E

50|$|As {{the first}} new Thomas {{full-size}} bus <b>body</b> since 1962, <b>manufacturing</b> techniques for the C2 were redesigned. To minimize the number of rivets and welds on the bus body, adhesive bonding was used for many body joints. In the cases where fasteners are needed, self-piercing rivets are used; ideally these do not punch completely through the bottom layer of the metals being joined together, thus reducing the likelihood that rivets will become the source of leaks in the future.|$|R
