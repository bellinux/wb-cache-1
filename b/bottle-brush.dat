40|$|Branched macromolecules are {{currently}} of great scientific interest. They are formed by a backbone carrying many closely spaced linear arms, and {{their most important}} property consists on their backbone stiffness due to the large branching density. From this property, one can reasonably expect lyotropic behaviour of these systems in solution and adsorbed on a surface. These molecules have a cylindrical shape and a characteristic size that ranges from a few nanometers (radius of their circular section) to hundreds of nanometers (contour length). Little is known at present {{about the nature of}} the backbone stiffness and its dependence on the monomers excluded volume and on the stereochemical constraints. The availability of high-performance computers allowed us to apply the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to a coarse-grained model to describe <b>bottle-brushes</b> in a diluted solution or adsorbed on a surface.

The formalism {{consists of three}} equations expressing the structural scattering in terms of three equations expressing the sub-unit scattering. The structural scattering expressions allows a composite structures {{to be used as}} sub-units within the formalism itself. This allows the scattering expressions for complex hierarchical structures to be derived with great ease.

This allows sub-units to be replaced by more complex structures. We illustrate the physical interpretation of the formalism diagrammatically. By applying a self-consistency requirement we derive the pair distributions of an ideal flexible polymer sub-unit.

A coarse-grained model, described by hard spheres connected by harmonic springs, was employed. Backbone lengths of up to 100 units were considered, and compared with the corresponding linear chains. The backbone molecular size was investigated {{as a function of}} its length at fixed arm size, and {{as a function of the}} arm size at fixed backbone length. The apparent swelling exponents obtained by a power-law fit were found to be larger than those for the corresponding linear polymers, indicative of stiffening of the comb backbone. The probability distribution function for the backbone end-to-end distance was also investigated for different backbone lengths and arm sizes. Analysis of this function yielded the critical exponents, which revealed an increase in the swelling exponent consistent with values found from the molecular size. The apparent persistence length of the backbone was also determined, and was found to increase with increasing branching density. Finally, the static structure factors of the whole <b>bottle-brushes</b> and of their backbones are discussed, which provides another consistent estimate of the swelling exponents...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} cope with {{phosphate}} deficiency, white lupin produces <b>bottle-brushed</b> like roots, so-called cluster or proteoid roots which are specialized in malate and citrate excretion. Young, developing cluster roots mainly excrete malate whereas mature cluster roots mainly release citrate. Mature proteoid roots excrete four to six times more carboxylates compared with juvenile proteoid roots. Using a cDNA-amplified {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (AFLP) approach we identified a gene coding for a putative ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) up-regulated in young cluster roots. Cloning of the lupin ACL revealed that plant ACL is constituted by two polypeptides (ACLA and ACLB) encoded by two different genes. This contrasts with the animal ACL, constituted of one polypeptide which covers ACLA and ACLB. The ACL function of the two lupin gene products has been demonstrated by heterologous expression in yeast. Both subunits are required for ACL activity. In lupin cluster roots, our results suggest that ACL activity could be responsible for the switch between malate and citrate excretion in the different developmental stages of cluster roots. In primary roots of lupin and maize, ACL activity was positively correlated with malate exudation. These results show that ACL is implicated in root exudation of organic acids and hence plays a novel role in addition to lipid synthesis. Our results suggest that in addition to lipid biosynthesis, in plants, ACL is implicated in malate excretion...|$|R
40|$|Molecular <b>bottle-brushes</b> {{are highly}} {{branched}} macromolecules with side chains densely grafted {{to a long}} polymer backbone. The brush-like architecture allows focusing of the side-chain tension to the backbone and its amplification from the pico-Newton to nano-Newton range. The backbone tension depends on the overall molecular conformation and the surrounding environment. Here we study {{the relation between the}} tension and conformation of the molecular brushes in solutions, melts, and on substrates. In solutions, we find that the backbone tension in dense brushes with side chains attached to every backbone monomer is on the order of f 0 N 3 / 8 in athermal solvents, f 0 N 1 / 3 in θ solvents, and f 0 in poor solvents and melts, where N is the degree of polymerization of side chains, f 0 = kBT/b is the maximum tension in side chains, b is the Kuhn length, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Depending on the side chain length and solvent quality, molecular brushes develop tension on the order of 10 - 100 pN, which is sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. Significant amplification of tension occurs upon adsorption of brushes onto a substrate. On a strongly attractive substrate, maximum tension in the brush backbone is ∼f 0 N, reaching values on the order of several nano-Newtons, which exceeds the strength of a typical covalent bond.

60|$|An {{even more}} {{interesting}} series of experiments was made on the colours of pupae, which in many cases {{were known to be}} affected by the material on which they underwent their transformations. The late Mr. T.W. Wood proved, in 1867, that the pupae of the common cabbage butterflies (Pieris brassicae and P. rapae) were either light, or dark, or green, according to the coloured boxes they were kept in, or the colours of the fences, walls, etc., against which they were suspended. Mrs. Barber in South Africa found that the pupae of Papilio Nireus underwent a similar change, being deep green when attached to orange leaves of the same tint, pale yellowish-green when on a branch of the <b>bottle-brush</b> tree whose half-dried leaves were of this colour, and yellowish when attached to the wooden frame of a box. A few other observers noted similar phenomena, but nothing more was done till Mr. Poulton's elaborate series of experiments with the larvae of several of our common butterflies were the means of clearing up several important points. He showed that the action of the coloured light did not affect the pupa itself but the larva, and that only for a limited period of time. After a caterpillar has done feeding it wanders about seeking a suitable place to undergo its transformation. When this is found it rests quietly for a day or two, spinning the web from which it is to suspend itself; and it is during this period of quiescence, and perhaps also the first hour or two after its suspension, that the action of the surrounding coloured surfaces determines, to a considerable extent, the colour of the pupa. By the application of various surrounding colours during this period, Mr. Poulton was able to modify the colour of the pupa of the common tortoise-shell butterfly from nearly black to pale, or to a brilliant golden; and that of Pieris rapae from dusky through pinkish to pale green. It is interesting to note, that the colours produced were in all cases such only as assimilated with the surroundings usually occupied by the species, and also, that colours which did not occur in such surroundings, as dark red or blue, only produced the same effects as dusky or black.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to {{systematically}} investigate the physico-chemical properties of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) formed by bottle brush and linear polyelectrolytes in solution and at solid / liquid interfaces. Electrostatic self-assembly of oppositely charged macromolecules in aqueous solution is a versatile strategy to construction of functional nanostructures with easily controlled properties. Bottle brush architecture, introduced into the PEC, generates a number of distinctive properties of the complexes, related to {{a broad range of}} application, such as colloidal stability and protein repellency to name a few. To utilize these materials {{in a wide range of}} applications e. g. drug delivery, the understanding of the effects of polymer architecture and solution parameters on the properties of bottle brush PECs is of paramount importance. This thesis constitutes a systematic investigation of PECs formed by a series of cationic <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolytes and a series of anionic linear polyelectrolytes in aqueous solution. The focus of the first part of the thesis was primarily on formation and characterization of PECs in solution, whereas the adsorption properties and adsorption kinetics of <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolytes and their complexes was investigated in the second part of the thesis work. In particular, effects of the side-chain density of the bottlebrush polyelectrolyte, concentration, mixing ratio and molecular weigh of the linearpolyelectrolyte on formation, solution properties, stability and adsorption of PECs were addressed. The pronounced effect of the side-chain density of the <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolyte on the properties of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric PECs was demonstrated. Formation of PECs by <b>bottle-brush</b> copolymers with high density of side-chains results in small, watersoluble, molecular complexes having nonspherical shape, independent of concentration. Whereas formation of PEC-aggregates was revealed by <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolytes with low side chain density, the level of aggregation in these complexes is controlled by polyelectrolyte concentration. The structure of the PECs formed with low molecular weight polyanions is consistent with the picture that several small linear polyelectrolyte molecules associate with the large <b>bottle-brush.</b> In contrast, when complexation occurs between polyanions of high molecular weigh and the <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers considerably larger PECs are formed, consistent with several <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers associating with one high molecular weight polyanion.

Furthermore, <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers with longer side chains possess higher spherical symmetry compared to polymers with lower side-chain lengths in contrast to what one may intuitively expect, as the stretching of the side chains is less important than the increase of their length. At higher temperatures, always below the Theta (Θ) temperature, coil-like configurations, similar to a single polymer chain, or brush-like configurations, similar to a homogeneous cylindrical <b>bottle-brush</b> polymer with a rigid backbone, are observed, depending on the choice of the particular parameters N and σ. In the crossover regime between the collapsed state (globule) and the coil/brush regime the acylindricity increases, whereas for temperatures outside of this range, <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers maintain a highly cylindrical symmetry in all configurational states...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{characteristics}} of <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers, it became a challenge to develop an efficient algorithm for studying such macromolecules under various solvent conditions or some constraints in the space by using computer simulations. In the limit of a <b>bottle-brush</b> polymer with a rather stiff backbone (straight rigid backbone), we generalize the variant of the biased chain growth algorithm, the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method, for simulating polymers with complex architecture, from star polymers to <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers, on the simple cubic lattice. With the high statistics of our Monte Carlo results, we check the theoretical predictions of side chain behavior and radial monomer density profile. For the comparison of the experimental data for <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers with a flexible backbone and flexible side chains, based on the bond fluctuation model we propose another fast Monte Carlo algorithm combining the local moves, the pivot move, and an adjustable simulation lattice box. By monitoring the autocorrelation functions of gyration radii for the side chains and for the backbone, we see that for fixed side chain length there is {{no change in the}} behavior of these two functions as the backbone length increases. Our extensive results cover the range which is accessible for the comparison to experimental data and for the checking of the theoretically predicted scaling laws.

40|$|This thesis has {{the dual}} purpose of raising {{awareness}} {{of the importance of}} the mixing protocol on the end products of polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactant systems, and to contribute to a better understanding of the properties of <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolytes when adsorbed onto interfaces. In the first part of this thesis work, the effects of the mixing protocol and the mixing procedure on formed polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactant aggregates were investigated. It was shown that the initial properties of the aggregates were highly dependent on the mixing parameters, and that the difference between the resulting aggregates persisted for long periods of time. The second part of the studies was devoted to the surface properties of a series of <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolytes made of charged segments and segments bearing poly(ethylene oxide) side chains; particular attention was paid to the effect of side chain to charge density ratio of the polyelectrolytes. It was shown that the adsorbed mass of the polyelectrolytes, and the corresponding number of poly(ethylene oxide) bearing segments at the interface, went through a maximum as the charge density of the polyelectrolyte was increased. Also, it was found that <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolyte layers were desorbed quite easily when subjected to salt solutions. This observation was rationalized by the unfavourable excluded volume interactions between the side chains and the entropic penalty of confining them at an interface, which weaken the strength of the binding of the polyelectrolytes to the interface. However, it was shown that the same side chains effectively protect the adsorbed layer against desorption when the layer is exposed to solutions containing an oppositely charged surfactant. Investigation of the lubrication properties of the <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolytes in an asymmetric (mica-silica) system also related the observed favourable frictional properties to the protective nature of the side chains. The decisive factor for achieving very low coefficients of friction was found to be the concentration of the side chains in the gap between the surfaces. Interestingly, it was shown that a brush-like conformation of the <b>bottle-brush</b> polyelectrolyte at the interface has little effect on achieving favourable lubrication properties. However, a brush-like conformation is vital for the resilience of the adsorbed layer against the competitive adsorption of species with a higher surface affinity. QC 2010083...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{behaviour}} of two-component <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers with fully flexible backbones under {{poor solvent}} conditions is studied via molecular-dynamics simulations, using a coarse-grained bead-spring model and side chains {{of up to}} N= 40 effective monomers. We consider a symmetric model where side chains of type A and B are grafted alternately onto a flexible backbone. The {{aim of this study}} to explore the phase behaviour of two-component bottle-brushes depending on parameters, such as as the grafting density σ, the backbone length N_b, the side-chain length N, and the temperature T. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify for our range of parameters the regimes of fully phase separated systems, i. e., A-type side chains form one cluster and B-type chains another, while the interface that separates these two clusters contains the backbone monomers. We find that pearl-necklace or Janus-like structures, which normally occur for <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers with rigid backbones under poor solvent conditions, are fully attributed to the backbone rigidity, and, therefore, such structures are unlikely in the case of bottle brushes with fully flexible backbones. Also, a comparative discussion with earlier work on the phase behaviour of single-component <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers with flexible backbones is performed. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Conformations of a <b>bottle-brush</b> polymer {{with two}} types (A,B) of grafted side chains are studied by {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, using a coarse-grained bead-spring model with side chains {{of up to}} N = 50 effective monomers. Varying the solvent quality and the grafting density, the crossover from the “pearl-necklace ” structure to dense cylinders is studied. Whereas for small grafting density, A- and B-chains form separate collapsed chains, at intermediate grafting density, larger “pearls ” containing several chains are observed, exhibiting microphase separation between A and B in “dumbbell”-type configurations. At still larger grafting density, short-range order of “Janus dumbbell”-type is observed. It is argued {{that because of the}} quasi- 1 D character of <b>bottle-brush</b> polymers with stiff backbones, all phase changes occur gradually, and no sharp-phase transitions like in bulk polymer mixtures or block copolymer melts can be observed.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{preparation}} of microstructured poly(2 -oxazoline) <b>bottle-brush</b> brushes (BBBs) on nanocrystalline diamond (NCD). Structuring of NCD was performed by photolithography and plasma treatment {{to result in a}} patterned NCD surface with oxidized and hydrogenated areas. Self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization (SIPGP) of 2 -isopropenyl- 2 -oxazoline (IPOx) resulted in selective grafting of poly(2 -isopropenyl- 2 -oxazoline) (PIPOx) polymer brushes only at the oxidized NCD areas. Structured PIPOx brushes were converted by methyl triflate into the polyelectrolyte brush macroinitiator for the living cationic ring-opening polymerization (LCROP) of 2 -oxazolines. The LCROP was performed with 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline (EtOx) as well as 2 -(carbazolyl) ethyl- 2 -oxazoline (CarbOx) as monomers, resulting in structured <b>bottle-brush</b> brushes (BBB) with different pendant side chains and functionalities. FT-IR spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and AFM measurements indicated a high side chain grafting density as well as quantitative and selective reactions. Poly(2 -oxazoline) BBBs containing hole conducting carbazole moieties on NCD as electrode material may open the way to advanced amperometric biosensing systems...|$|E
