5|$|Although the {{campaign}} was decided by a final major action, May 1794 saw both fleets at sea with several subordinate squadrons, both admirals conducting a complicated series of convoy, commerce raiding and fleet manoeuvre operations. Numerous merchant ships and small warships were taken or destroyed during the month-long campaign <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> and there were also two partial fleet engagements as Howe and Villaret made first contact. Both admirals suffered from wilful disobedience {{by a number of}} their officers during the battle, as well as confusion in reading signals which caused an uneven series of melees to break out rather than the unified battleline Howe had envisaged when planning the action. Nevertheless, both commanders were highly praised on their return to their home ports and the battle was considered a success <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> with only a few dissenters amongst the naval establishments of both nations.|$|E
5|$|In the American Civil War, {{camouflage}} paint was applied <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> during the Union blockade of 1861–1865. Blockade runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist-gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white clothing {{for a night}} reconnaissance patrol up an enemy-held river.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lithuanian nobility opposed the growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar {{publicly}} advertised this option, either because he took the offer seriously, or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled expiration date of 1562) was respected <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|Beginning August 5, these {{divisions}} initiated numerous crossing {{attempts to}} assault the UN {{forces on the}} other side of the river in an attempt to capture Taegu and collapse the final UN defensive line. The U.S. forces were successful in repelling North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful. During this time, isolated reports and rumors of war crimes committed <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> began to surface.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E

5|$|The defense, {{to support}} their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse.

5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|As initial {{contract}} negotiations {{failed in the}} off-season, Cloutier filed for arbitration on July 16, 2004. Arbitration was avoided <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> when Cloutier agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract 11 days later. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, however, Cloutier spent the season mostly inactive until signing with EC KAC of the Austrian Hockey League on January 20, 2005. Replacing injured starter Andrew Verner, he appeared in 13 games with the Klagenfurt-based team, going undefeated with a 1.94 GAA. EC KAC finished the regular season second with the second-best record in the league. Cloutier appeared in 10 additional playoff games, recording a 2.75 GAA. EC KAC advanced to the finals, where they were defeated four-games-to-three by the Vienna Capitals.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles {{using the new}} ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> in the American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence {{on the development of}} ironclad design.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent {{through a combination of}} military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Under General Henri Guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E

5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov was {{transferred}} to the Sevastopol Port Authority on 1 April 1911, stricken from the Navy List and disarmed on 15 April. She became a depot ship for submarines in 1912. Renamed as Blokshiv (hulk) No. 8 on 4 September 1914, she was used on various harbour duties. Immobile, she was captured by the Germans in Sevastopol in May 1918 and handed over to the Allies in December 1918. She was captured <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> during the Russian Civil War, but was abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea. Her machinery was removed in 1921. She was used as a stand-in for the Potemkin during the filming of The Battleship Potemkin, while reportedly serving as a mine storage hulk, before she was sold for scrap on 28 January 1931.|$|E

Later, they were captured <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> during the Russian Civil War, but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920.

5|$|Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust {{were reduced}} to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol.

The British wrecked both ships' engines on 22–24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. They were captured <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> during the Russian Civil War, but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920.

5|$|In 1771, the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} {{erupted from}} Bình Định Province. In 1777, {{the last of}} the Nguyễn lords was deposed and killed. His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of the country, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his adviser and played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the United States had renounced {{its trade}} treaty with Japan; and, {{beginning}} with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure. During this time, Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. Despite several offensives <b>by</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> {{the war between}} China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces {{in the event of}} a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina. Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan. Other sanctions soon followed.|$|E
