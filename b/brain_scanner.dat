How is sexuality re-described and re-produced when studied in <b>brain</b> <b>scanners?</b> This article explores the cultural production of sexuality in the growing field of neuroimaging research. In focus is the neural framing of sexuality, i. e. the process by which sexuality is understood as a matter of brain activity and visualizable with medical imaging technologies. The neuroframing of sexuality enables a reproduction of socio-cultural notions of difference, but also of neuroscience’s own notions of agency. The neural framing of sexuality re-mediates an idealized sexuality: ageless, neatly oriented, bodiless although haunted by the de-animated body, unfolding neatly as a sequential response of a psychological inside to an inanimate outside, and essentialized as independent from its feelers and objects.

A fiberoptic displacement sensor, commonly used in industrial applications, was coupled to the TAC-Cell to measure the glabrous skin’s kinematic response to different stimulus amplitudes. Skin displacement was significantly dependent on stimulus amplitudes and sex (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Power spectrum and kinematic analysis of skin displacement showed that the pneumatic TAC-Cell stimulus consists of a spectrally rich, high velocity signal.

40|$|Abstract—When {{transmission}} {{images are}} obtained using con-ventional reconstruction methods in stand alone PET scanners, such as standard clinical PET, microPET, and dedicated <b>brain</b> <b>scanners,</b> {{the results may}} be noisy and/or inaccurate. For example, the popular penalized maximum-likelihood method effectively reduces noise, {{but it does not}} address the bias problem that results from the incorporation of a penalty function and con-tamination from emission data due to patient activity. In this paper, we present an algorithm that simultaneously reconstructs transmission images and performs a “soft ” segmentation of voxels into the classes: air, patient bed, lung, soft-tissue, and bone. It is through the segmentation step that the algorithm, which we refer to as the concurrent segmentation and estimation (CSE) algorithm, provides a means for incorporating accurate attenua-tion coefficients. The CSE algorithm is obtained by applying an expectation-maximization like formulation to a certain maximum a posterior objective function. This formulation enables us to show that the CSE algorithm monotonically increases the objective function. In experiments using real phantom and synthetic data, the CSE images produced attenuation correction factors and emis-sion images that were more accurate than those obtained using a popular segmentation based attenuation correction method, and the penalized maximum likelihood and filtered backprojection methods.

40|$|Many {{contemporary}} neuroscientific investigations face significant {{challenges in}} terms of data management, computational processing, data mining and results interpretation. These four pillars define the core infrastructure necessary to plan, organize, orchestrate, validate and disseminate novel scientific methods, computational resources and translational healthcare findings. Data management includes protocols for data acquisition, archival, query, transfer, retrieval and aggregation. Computational processing involves the necessary software, hardware and networking infrastructure required to handle large amounts of heterogeneous neuroimaging, genetics, clinical and phenotypic data and meta-data. In this manuscript we describe the novel high-throughput neuroimaging-genetics computational infrastructure available at the Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics (INI) and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at University of Southern California (USC). INI and LONI include ultra-high-field and standard-field MRI <b>brain</b> <b>scanners</b> along with an imaging-genetics database for storing the complete provenance of the raw and derived data and meta-data. A unique feature of this architecture is the Pipeline environment, which integrates the data management, processing, transfer and visualization. Through its client-server architecture, the Pipeline environment provides a graphical user interface for designing, executing, monitoring validating, and disseminating of complex protocols that utilize diverse suites of software tools and web-services. These pipeline workflows are represented as portable XML objects which transfer the execution instructions and user specifications from the client user machine to remote pipeline servers for distributed computing.

40|$|This work investigates two new Anger-logic {{detector}} {{models to}} improve the performance of PET scanners. The first model investigates using a slotted front surface in a position-sensitive NaI(Tl) detector. The sensitivity of an unslotted detector increases with crystal thickness, but the spatial resolution worsens due to increased spreading of light. A slotted detector reduces the light spreading {{which leads to a}} reduction of pulse-pileup, thereby extending the count-rate capability of the PET scanner. Experimental measurements were performed with a 12 ̆ 6 inches; thick, slotted Nal(TI) detector to validate the model developed through simulations, and optimize the tradeoff of the slot depth and spatial resolution. ^ The count-rate performance of NaI(TI) detectors is also limited by the long decay time of NaI(T 1) signal. A pulse shaping circuit was developed which narrows the NaI(T 1) signal and improves the energy resolution at short integration times and high count-rate. A high count-rate simulation program predicts a doubling of the peak performance rate of the current whole-body scanner (CPET), using the slotted detector together with the pulse shaping circuit. ^ For the second detector model, a new scintillator (GSO) with a high attenuation coefficient, good energy resolution, and short signal decay time was chosen. Detector simulations and measurements helped in designing a lightguide which optimizes the discrimination of 4 x 4 x 10 mm 3 crystals. The pulse shaping circuit was modified for the GSO signal to achieve good signal sampling with the digitizers used in the electronics. High count-rate simulations show that a GSO-based <b>brain</b> <b>scanner</b> using this detector will result in a five fold increase in the peak performance rate over the current Nal(Tl) -based <b>brain</b> <b>scanner</b> (HPET). ^ A <b>brain</b> <b>scanner</b> based upon the GSO Anger-logic detector has been almost completed. Initial results show that the image resolution is 3. 5 mm with very little pulse pileup in the energy spectrum at high activity levels. These results are consistent with the simulation results for the scanner. ...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{rules have}} been {{developed}} on the minimum increases in public spending needed {{to cover the costs}} of aging and the costs of new technology. In practice elderly people only use certain kinds of service and much of the increase has had to be used to finance changes in other services. From 1978 to 1982 {{the number of people in}} England over 75 grew by 250, 000, needing an extra £ 220 million at 1982 / 3 prices but spending on age sensitive services rose by £ 116 million. Such spending should be evaluated separately and allowance for the extra costs of aging should actually be spent on those services. The problems of ‘technology’ really involves a small number of treatments which have heavy demands on in-patient resources.
