40|$|We {{consider}} energy-constrained infinite-dimensional quantum channels from a given system (satisfying {{a certain}} condition) {{to any other}} systems. We show that dealing with <b>basic</b> <b>capacities</b> of these channels we may assume (accepting arbitrarily small error ε) that all channels have the same finite-dimensional input space [...] the subspace corresponding to the m(ε) minimal eigenvalues of the input Hamiltonian. We also show that for the class of energy-limited channels (mapping energy-bounded states to energy-bounded states) the above result is valid with substantially smaller dimension m(ε). The uniform finite-dimensional approximation allows to prove the uniform continuity of the <b>basic</b> <b>capacities</b> {{on the set of}} all quantum channels with respect to the strong (pointwise) convergence topology. For all the capacities we obtain continuity bounds depending only on the input energy bound and the energy-constrained-diamond-norm distance between quantum channels (generating the strong convergence on the set of quantum channels).

30|$|Developmental {{psychology}} has convincingly documented for a {{long time}} that neither the development of children nor the development of infants is a homogeneous endeavor. Since the time of Piaget’s (1970) overarching stage theory of development, it has been empirically demonstrated that development is domain-specific, i.e., demands, prerequisites, effective environmental stimulations differ according to the developmental domain under study (e.g., the acquisition of language, of mathematical competencies, of competencies in natural science, or of an intuitive psychology) (Karmiloff-Smith 1999). Even in infancy domain-specific precursors of e.g., mathematical and psychological knowledge and competencies are observable (Goswami 2008). Determining how educationally relevant competencies emerge from the interplay of these domain-specific precursors and domain-general <b>basic</b> <b>capacities</b> of the child (like basic reasoning abilities, speed of information processing, or executive functions including cognitive flexibility, inhibition, working memory) on the one hand and of the environmental conditions in the family and in child care on the other is an important issue to be addressed by educational studies. It is important to note that (interindividual differences in) <b>basic</b> <b>capacities</b> also change with age and environmental conditions, although not to the same extent as culture- and education-dependent competencies, and that stimulation of and progress in one developmental domain may enhance, hinder, or compensate for those in other domains.|$|R
40|$|We obtain {{continuity}} bounds {{for basic}} information characteristics of quantum channels {{depending on their}} input dimension (when it is finite) and on the input energy bound (when the input dimension is infinite). We pay a {{special attention to the}} case when the input system is a multi-mode quantum oscillator. First we prove continuity bounds for the output conditional mutual information for a single channel and for $n$ copies of a channel. Then we obtain estimates for variation of the output Holevo quantity with respect to simultaneous variations of a channel and of an input ensemble. As a result tight and close-to-tight continuity bounds for <b>basic</b> <b>capacities</b> of quantum channels depending on the input dimension are obtained. They complement the Leung-Smith continuity bounds depending on the output dimension. Finally, we obtain continuity bounds for <b>basic</b> <b>capacities</b> of infinite-dimensional energy-constrained channels with respect to the energy-constrained Bures distance generating the strong (pointwise) convergence of quantum channels.

50|$|Since empathy {{involves}} {{understanding the}} emotional states of other people, {{the way it}} is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the <b>basic</b> <b>capacity</b> to recognize emotions is probably innate and may be achieved unconsciously.
