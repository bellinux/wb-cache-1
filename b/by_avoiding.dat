5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels.

5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed <b>by</b> <b>avoiding</b> triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of open quantum systems is determined <b>by</b> <b>avoided</b> and true crossings of eigenvalue trajectories of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The {{phases of the}} eigenfunctions are not rigid so that environmentally induced spectroscopic redistribution processes may take place and a dynamical phase transition may occur. Due to the formal equivalence between the quantum mechanical Schrödinger equation and the optical wave equation in PT symmetric lattices, the {{dynamics of}} the system is determined also in this case <b>by</b> <b>avoided</b> and true crossings of eigenvalue trajectories of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In contrast to the eigenvalues characterizing an open quantum system, the eigenvalues describing the PT symmetric optical lattice are real as long as the influence of the environment (lattice) onto the optical wave equation is small. In the regime of avoided level crossings, the symmetry is destroyed, the eigenvalues become complex and a dynamical phase transition occurs similar as in the open quantum system. The redistribution processes in the regime of avoided level crossings allow to design systems with desired properties in a broad parameter range. Comment: 8 page...|$|R

Although considered financially successful and well attended, the tour itself was critically dismissed. Bowie designed his next few tours specifically to avoid the problems that the Glass Spider Tour was criticized for <b>by</b> <b>avoiding</b> overly theatrical stage presentations and focusing on his music.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with his ideology, Arafat generally {{refused to accept}} donations to his organization from major Arab governments, in order to act independently of them.

However, to establish the groundwork for Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries, such as Libya and Syria.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced <b>by</b> <b>avoiding</b> rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that <b>by</b> <b>avoiding</b> asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and <b>by</b> <b>avoiding</b> the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
