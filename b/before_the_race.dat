5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E

5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into threeparts. The first part ran for 20minutes, and cars that finished the session 16th or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which {{failed to make the}} final session could refuel <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> were {{scheduled}} to take place, an unexploded Second World War bomb was discovered near Putney Bridge. [...] Although this threatened to postpone the event, the device was successfully removed and did not disrupt <b>the</b> <b>race</b> programme.|$|R
50|$|A {{gambling}} mode is {{also available}} in-game, in which the player can bet an amount of money on one or more drivers to win. This is an optional feature of the game, and is only accessible by pressing a specific key <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>races.</b> <b>The</b> gambling screen presents the list of drivers {{that are going to}} participate in <b>the</b> <b>race</b> to follow, as well as their respective winning odds.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>race</b> is run {{thirteen}} days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Melbourne Cup (which {{is always}} on the first Tuesday in November). <b>The</b> <b>race</b> has been run on this day since 1947. The day of <b>the</b> <b>race</b> is a public holiday in the city of Geelong. <b>Before</b> 1907 <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was run at <b>the</b> Marshalltown Racecourse. <b>Before</b> 1947 <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was run at various times during the year between January and July.|$|R
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into threeparts.

The {{second part of}} the qualifying session lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 16. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which failed to make the final session could refuel <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> so ran lighter in those sessions.

5|$|The {{team was}} one of 22 to receive an invite to the Vuelta a España. After having first been named only as a reserve, the {{returning}} Alexander Vinokourov {{was named to the}} squad five days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> began.|$|E
5|$|In the World Constructors' Championship, Williams led with 118 {{points and}} Ferrari were second on 100. Williams had {{therefore}} clinched the constructors' title <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> as even if Ferrari finished {{first and second}} in the race, thereby taking 16 points, and both Williams cars failed to score a point, they could not beat Williams.|$|E

5|$|The 17 UCI World Tour {{teams were}} {{automatically}} entitled and obliged {{to start the}} race; three UCI Professional Continental teams were invited as wildcards to form a twenty-team peloton. Each team entered eight riders to form a 160-rider peloton; one rider, 's Daniel Oss, withdrew <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> due to a fall in training, so 159 riders started the race.|$|E
5|$|The race {{marked the}} first {{positive}} drug test of the 2008 Olympic Games, by María Isabel Moreno of Spain. She was scheduled to compete in this event and the time trial to follow, but left Beijing on 31 July, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> The International Olympic Committee said on 11 August that she had tested positive for EPO. This left 66 cyclists to compete, one fewer than in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli provided {{teams with}} the hard, medium and soft compounds of tyre—the three hardest compounds available—for the race. Just {{as the year}} <b>before,</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> stewards warned drivers about exceeding the track limits around the circuit, stressing that lap times during qualifying would be disallowed should drivers not stay within the lines indicating the track borders.|$|E
50|$|NASCAR '98 {{included}} an instant replay feature, allowing {{the user to}} view <b>the</b> <b>racing</b> of his/her car back until about 30 seconds <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>racing</b> action was paused. It could be watched from any of several 'camera angles', such as front, back, left, right, top, and rotating. Non-user cars could not be focused on in instant replays.|$|R

5|$|About a month <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> took place, in February 2015, {{the race}} organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was {{a reference to}} Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is two days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers' Championship with 34 points, {{ahead of}} David Coulthard (14 points) and Mika Häkkinen (twelve). Rubens Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher were tied in fourth place with nine points each. In the Constructors' Championship Ferrari led with 43 points, {{seventeen}} points ahead of rival McLaren in second. Williams were third with twelve points, while Benetton and Jordan with eight points each contended for fourth place. Ferrari had dominated the championship, winning {{three out of}} the previous four races, with Coulthard winning the British Grand Prix. Barrichello, Häkkinen and Giancarlo Fisichella had second-place finishes, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen had finished third.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> Jeff Burton led the Drivers' Championship with 5,511 points, with Denny Hamlin {{second and}} Mark Martin third.

Barrichello and Fisichella had second-place finishes, and Ralf Schumacher and Heinz-Harald Frentzen had finished third.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> started, 78 riders {{had signed}} up for the race. Eighteen of those did not start the race, so the Tour began with 60 riders, {{including}} former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, but most of them rode with an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up {{to the start of the}} Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> Carl Edwards {{was leading}} the Drivers' Championship with 42 points, and David Gilliland stood in second with 41 points. Bobby Labonte {{followed}} in third also with 41 points, one ahead of Kurt Busch and two ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya in fourth and fifth. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Ford was leading with nine points, three points ahead of their rival Toyota. Dodge, with 4 points, was one point ahead of Chevrolet {{in the battle for}} third. Ryan Newman was the race's defending winner.|$|E
