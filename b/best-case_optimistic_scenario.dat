40|$|The {{technology}} of molecular genetics has profoundly altered {{the conduct of}} biomedical research. An entire universe of problems {{that in the past}} had been addressed only through conjecture, including whole genome analysis, can now be studied directly. The rapidity and scope of these changes in research capacity have in turn led to speculation that medicine will be radically altered by the application of genomics to everyday practice. To date, gene therapy and several new tests for genetic susceptibility have been successfully implemented, although their impact on medicine as a whole remains very limited and their future contribution is hotly contested. The potential of molecular genetics, like all technology, must be evaluated on the basis of established principles of clinical and epidemiologic research. The rhetoric of some enthusiasts fo-cuses instead on an <b>optimistic</b> <b>best-case</b> <b>scenario</b> of the future of DNA science, and many of their most far-reaching claims cannot be substantiated {{on the basis of what}} is currently known. The tension between the long-term goal of public health and medicine to identify and remove the causes of ill health, in contrast to the development of technological innovations that can cure disease or identify individual susceptibility, emerges as a major theme in this debate.

This strategy envisions three potential scenarios: optimistic, moderate, and critical. The <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> is characterized by the growth of GDP at the rate of 4.7% to 5.2% annually, by a sevenfold increase of investment in fixed capital for this period compared with the 2000 level, and by high world prices for oil and gas. The oil prices envisioned by this strategy in 2003, even for the <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario,</b> were about one-half of the 2005 oil prices. The moderate scenario is characterized by a GDP growth of 3.3% to 3.4% annually to 2020, an increase of investment in fixed capital by 3.6 times, and fixed prices for oil at a little more than one-half of the <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> and gas prices about 20% lower than in the <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario.</b> The critical scenario is characterized primarily by low world oil prices.|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{nature of}} the {{progenitors}} of type Ia supernova (SN) progenitors remains unclear. While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor systems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently suggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase. Aims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems being SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible durations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic population. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to examine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa assumptions, and 2) an <b>optimistic</b> <b>best-case</b> <b>scenario.</b> The latter case establishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate that unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, {{the vast majority of}} the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a combination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even with extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and retention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually become double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of time that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions, and the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible. Conclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that are SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of single-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray behaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN explosions.

40|$|Abstract: Cassava {{is a major}} staple that {{supplies}} more than 50 % of daily energy to more than 200 million persons in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Cassava roots {{are known to be}} low in micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc. Micronutrient deficiencies threaten the lives of millions of poor households and those located in remote rural areas of SSA often not targeted by fortification programmes. This paper presents results from an ex-ante evaluation of nutrition and health benefits of increased vitamin A status of cassava roots through biofortification for at-risk-target-groups using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) approach. Results showed that Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) causes an annual loss of about 553, 000 years of “healthy ” life in Nigeria with children constituting more than forty percent. Biofortified cassava would reduce VAD by 4. 42 %, 11. 73 %, and 3. 14 % for children, pregnant women, and lactating women respectively in the pessimistic scenario. Results for the <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> are 28. 79 %, 76. 39, and 20. 45 % respectively.

By comparing optimistic and pessimistic endogenous technological learning scenarios, it is found that diffusion of onshore wind energy is relatively robust, regardless of technological development, but diffusion rates of offshore wind energy and biomass gasification greatly depend on their technological development. Competition between these two options and (existing) biomass combustion options largely determines the overall costs of electricity from renewables and the choice of technologies for the individual member countries. In the <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario,</b> in 2020 the market price for RES-E is 1 €ct/kWh lower than in the pessimistic scenario (about 7 vs. 8 €ct/kWh).

Russia {{is one of the}} most polluted countries in the world, and the environmental problem is very important here. In spite of some decrease in pollution during the crisis period, nature does not have time to neutralize pollution accumulated before, and as a result, there is an increase in the pollution concentration. In 66 cities (40 million people) with excess 10 times and more than permitted maximum concentration level, the morbidity is above the average Russian level of 1. 6 — 2 times. The forecast of emission according to the various scenarios of Russian development has been done: a pessimistic scenario with a slowdown in economic growth and an <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> with the acceleration of economic growth. The <b>optimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> is realized under the hypothesis about the oil prices increase and the real rouble exchange rate strengthening at the end of 2015, the revival of investment processes, the successful policy of import substitution, and the competent using of the instruments of monetary and fiscal policy.

A methodology for doing such an analysis is Cost-Benefit analysis where all social benefits and costs are estimated, so they can be subtracted to arrive at the net social value.
