50|$|A <b>backdrive</b> is a {{component}} used in reverse to obtain its input from its output. This extends to many concepts and systems from thought based to practical mechanical applications.|$|E
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, <b>backdrive</b> from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flight control}} system on the 777 is {{designed}} to restrict control authority beyond certain range by increasing the back pressure once the desired limit is reached. This is done via electronically controlled <b>backdrive</b> actuators (controlled by ACE). The protections and augmentations are: bank angle protection, turn compensation, stall protection, over-speed protection, pitch control, stability augmentation and thrust asymmetry compensation. The design philosophy is: [...] "to inform the pilot that the command being given would put the aircraft outside of its normal operating envelope, but {{the ability to do}} so is not precluded." ...|$|E
50|$|Not every {{system can}} be <b>backdriven.</b> A DC {{electrical}} generator can be implemented by backdriving a DC electric motor, however a worm drive works only in one direction.|$|R
50|$|Conceptually, a {{hydraulic}} motor should be interchangeable with {{a hydraulic}} pump because it performs the opposite function - {{similar to the}} way a DC electric motor is theoretically interchangeable with a DC electrical generator. However, most hydraulic pumps cannot be used as hydraulic motors because they cannot be <b>backdriven.</b> Also, a hydraulic motor is usually designed for working pressure at both sides of the motor.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} motor is the rotary counterpart of the hydraulic cylinder.

However, most hydraulic pumps cannot be used as hydraulic motors because they cannot be <b>backdriven.</b> Also, a hydraulic motor is usually designed for the working pressure at both sides of the motor.

50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, <b>backdrive</b> from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|E
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such <b>backdrive</b> would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of low voltage technologies has grown significantly {{over the last}} decade as semiconductor device manufacturers have moved to satisfy market demands for more powerful products, smaller packaging, and longer battery life. By shrinking the size of the features they etch into semiconductor dice, IC manufacturers achieve lower costs, while improving speed and building in more functionality. However, this move toward smaller features has lead to lower breakdown voltages and increased opportunities for component overstress and false failures during in-circuit test. The chief reason is that testers designed for boards that traditionally operated with a power supply voltage of 5 V are still being used on new generation ICs, which operate on 2. 5 V, 1. 5 V, or even 0. 8 V. These traditional in-circuit testers often do not have the accuracy, safety, and reliability features that are required to test low voltage technologies. This paper discusses the challenges of performing powered-up vector testing of low voltage technologies on traditional in-circuit testers and describes the safeguards that are necessary to ensure that test vectors do not violate the increasingly tight specifications of low voltage parts. It also describes the in-circuit test features that are most important for testing low voltage technologies: independently programmable, high accuracy driver/sensors; real time dynamic <b>backdrive</b> current measurement, programmable <b>backdrive</b> control, specialized digital controller; and multiple level digital isolation...|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be <b>backdriven</b> with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be <b>backdriven</b> during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In the future, robotic {{surgical}} assistants may assist surgeons {{by performing}} specific subtasks such as retraction and suturing to reduce surgeon tedium {{and reduce the}} duration of some operations. We propose an apprenticeship learning approach that has potential to allow robotic surgical assistants to autonomously execute specific trajectories with superhuman performance in terms of speed and smoothness. In the first step, we record a set of trajectories using human-guided <b>backdriven</b> motions of the robot. These are then analyzed to extract a smooth reference trajectory, which we execute at gradually increasing speeds using a variant of iterative learning control. We evaluate this approach on two representative tasks using the Berkeley Surgical Robots: a figure eight trajectory and a two handed knot-tie, a tedious suturing sub-task required in many surgical procedures. Results suggest that the approach enables (i) rapid learning of trajectories, (ii) smoother trajectories than the human-guided trajectories, and (iii) trajectories that are 7 to 10 {{times faster than the}} best human-guided trajectories.

50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is <b>backdriven</b> by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} human {{operator}} {{control of a}} robotic gripper has been developed and preliminary evaluation has been performed. The JPL Force Reflecting Hand Trigger system features an instrumented index finger trigger with load cell detection of finger force, a servo-controlled, lead-screw-driven <b>backdrive</b> capability by which the trigger's position {{can be made to}} follow that of the remotely controlled gripper, and a novel feedback mechanism by which clamping force or some other signal can be fed back by a swiveling motion, also servo-controlled, of the trigger surface (force reflection). This system has undergone preliminary testing in which the amount of force reflection is varied and dynamic force-tracking response is observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Haptic display {{technologies}} are {{well suited to}} relay proprioceptive, force, and contact cues from a prosthetic terminal device back to the residual limb and thereby reduce reliance on visual feedback. The ease with which an amputee interprets these haptic cues, however, likely depends on whether their dynamic signal behavior corresponds to expected behaviors—behaviors consonant with a natural limb coupled to the environment. A highly geared motor in a terminal device along with the associated high back-drive impedance influences dynamic interactions with the environment, creating effects not encountered with a natural limb. Here we explore grasp and lift performance with a backdrivable (low <b>backdrive</b> impedance) terminal device placed under proportional myoelectric position control that features referred haptic feedback. Methods We fabricated a back-drivable terminal device {{that could be used}} by amputees and non-amputees alike and drove aperture (or grip force, when a stiff object was in its grasp) in proportion to a myoelectric signal drawn from a single muscle site in the forearm. In randomly ordered trials, we assessed the performance of N= 10 participants (7 non-amputee, 3 amputee) attempting to grasp and lift an object using the terminal device under three feedback conditions (no feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and joint torque feedback), and two object weights that were indiscernible by vision. Results Both non-amputee and amputee participants scaled their grip force according to the object weight. Our results showed only minor differences in grip force, grip/load force coordination, and slip as a function of sensory feedback condition, though the grip force at the point of lift-off for the heavier object was significantly greater for amputee participants in the presence of joint torque feedback. An examination of grip/load force phase plots revealed that our amputee participants used larger safety margins and demonstrated less coordination than our non-amputee participants. Conclusions Our results suggest that a backdrivable terminal device may hold advantages over non-backdrivable devices by allowing grip/load force coordination consistent with behaviors observed in the natural limb. Likewise, the inconclusive effect of referred haptic feedback on grasp and lift performance suggests the need for additional testing that includes adequate training for participants...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new actuator system {{consisting of a}} micro-actuator and a macro-actuator coupled in parallel via a compliant transmission. The system is called the Parallel Coupled Micro-Macro Actuator, or PaCMMA. In this system, the micro-actuator is capable of high bandwidth force control due to its low mass and direct-drive connection to the output shaft. The compliant transmission of the macro-actuator reduces the impedance (stiffness) at the output shaft and increases the dynamic range of force. Performance improvement over single actuator systems was expected in force control, impedance control, force distortion and reduction of transient impact forces. A set of quantitative measures is proposed and the actuator system is evaluated against them: Force Control Bandwidth, Position Bandwidth, Dynamic Range, Impact Force, Impedance ("Backdriveability'"), Force Distortion and Force Performance Space. Several theoretical performance limits are derived from the saturation limits of the system. A control law is proposed and control system performance is compared to the theoretical limits. A prototype testbed was built using permanenent magnet motors and an experimental comparison was performed between this actuator concept and two single actuator systems. The following performance was observed: Force bandwidth of 56 Hz, Torque Dynamic Range of 800 : 1, Peak Torque of 1040 mNm, Minimum Torque of 1. 3 mNm. Peak Impact Force was reduced by an order of magnitude. Distortion at small amplitudes was reduced substantially. <b>Backdriven</b> impedance was reduced by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude. This actuator system shows promise for manipulator design as well as psychophysical tests of human performance...|$|R
