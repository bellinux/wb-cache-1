2500|$|Ealing rail crash - 19 December 1973 - A {{train from}} Paddington to Oxford derailed after a loose <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> <b>cover</b> on the Class 52 [...] "Western" [...] {{locomotive}} hauling the train struck lineside equipment, causing {{a set of}} points to move under the train. Ten passengers were killed and 94 injured.|$|E
5000|$|MK48A1: offers slight {{improvements}} to the original MK48. Those improvements include a revised <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> and <b>cover,</b> an extra cab entry step for both sides, modified air intake cover, and added handles and steps to ease climbing {{on top of the}} power unit.|$|R
50|$|The GP38-2 differs {{externally}} {{from the}} earlier GP38 only in minor details. Its most distinctive identifying feature is the cooling water level sight glass {{on the right side}} of the long hood. The <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> <b>covers</b> of the Dash 2s are bolted down instead of hinged. It can be distinguished from the contemporary GP39-2 and GP40-2 in that its Roots blown engine had two exhaust stacks, one on each side of the dynamic brake fan, if equipped, while the turbocharged GP39-2 and GP40-2 has a single stack. The GP39-2 has two radiator fans on the rear of the long hood like the GP38-2, while the GP40-2 has three. It was also available with either a high-short-hood, common on Norfolk Southern units, or a low-short-hood, which is found on most other railroads.|$|R
5000|$|One {{problem with}} battery {{locomotives}} was battery replacement. This was simplified {{by use of}} removable <b>battery</b> <b>boxes.</b> Eventually, <b>battery</b> <b>boxes</b> were developed that included wheels {{so that they could}} be rolled off of the locomotive. [...] While the initial motivation had to do with battery maintenance, the primary use for this idea was at charging stations where a discharged <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> could be rolled off and replaced with a freshly charged box.|$|R
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> and air {{reservoirs}} were located {{forward of the}} fuel tank; in locomotives manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. The <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> returned to its original location in the F40PH-2. The F40PH-2s delivered to Caltrain incorporated Southern Pacific Railroad-style headlights.|$|R
50|$|This {{conversion}} significantly {{alters the}} external {{appearance of the}} locomotive, with the cab (which is actually brand new) being moved forward on the frame {{to make room for}} a large louvered <b>battery</b> <b>box,</b> which takes the place of the locomotive's long hood. The fuel tank is similarly replaced with another <b>battery</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{the reason}} of {{difficult}} to get <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> pose information, we research the <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> pose measure method based on visual information. We get the coplanar four points at the lines constraints which extracted form image. We get the pose relationship between the <b>battery</b> <b>box</b> coordinate system and camera coordinate system, and then calculate {{the average of the}} measure results to reduce noise effects for measure precision. Simulation results show that the method through calculate average of the measure results can effectively reduce noise effects for measure accuracy. The actual experimental results show that the pose estimate accuracy is meet robot requirements for battery swap...|$|R
