Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog wheel train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought that should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, {{which resulted in the}} album Catch a Fire.|$|E
500|$|Between 1850 and 1854 the U. S. Army {{explored}} the lower {{reach of the}} Colorado River from the Gulf of California, looking for the river to provide a less expensive route to supply the remote post of Fort Yuma. [...] First in November 1850 to January 1851, by its transport schooner, Invincible under Captain Alfred H. Wilcox and then by its longboat commanded by Lieutenant George Derby. [...] Later Lieutenant Derby, in his expedition report, recommended that a shallow draft sternwheel steamboat would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> send supplies up river to the fort. [...] The next contractors George Alonzo Johnson with his partner Benjamin M. Hartshorne, brought two barges and 250 tons of supplies arriving at the river's mouth in February 1852, on the United States transport schooner Sierra Nevada under Captain Wilcox. [...] Poling the barges up the Colorado, the first barge sank with its cargo a total loss. [...] The second was finally, after a long struggle poled up to Fort Yuma, but what little it carried was soon consumed by the garrison. [...] Subsequently, wagons again were sent from the fort to haul {{the balance of the}} supplies overland from the estuary through the marshes and woodlands of the Delta. [...] At last Derby's recommendation was heeded and in November 1852, the Uncle Sam, a 65-foot long side-wheel paddle steamer, built by Domingo Marcucci, became the first steamboat on the Colorado River. [...] It was brought by the schooner Capacity from San Francisco to the delta by the next contractor to supply the fort, Captain James Turnbull. [...] It was assembled and launched in the estuary, 30 miles above the mouth of the Colorado River. [...] Equipped with only a 20-horsepower engine, the Uncle Sam could only carry 35 tons of supplies, taking 15 days to make the first 120-mile trip. [...] It made many trips up and down the river, taking four months to finish carrying the supplies for the fort, improving its time up river to 12 days. Negligence caused it to sink at its dock below Fort Yuma, and was then washed away before it could be raised, in the spring flood of 1853. [...] Turnbull in financial difficulty, disappeared. [...] Nevertheless, he had shown the worth of steamboats to solve Fort Yuma's ls supply problem.|$|E

2500|$|Around 2004, after most {{computer}} software became compatible with Unicode UTF-8 or UTF-16 systems, use of Greeklish was strongly discouraged in many Greek online Web discussion boards (forums) where Greeklish was in use before.

Examples include the , the [...] , the [...] , the , the [...] forum, the [...] and the [...] Greek student forum.

2500|$|The teachings on Dharmam {{have two}} levels of understanding: a {{principle}} of 'righteousness', and a concrete activity of 'charity' or 'almsgiving'. As a principle, the followers of Ayyavazhi believed that the prime motive of the mission of Ayya Vaikundar was to establish Dharmam in this world by destroying the evil force of Kali. It is said in Akilattirattu that people, even while listening to the teachings of Ayya Vaikundar, 'realised' that the evil of Kali was gradually being withdrawn from {{the world and that}} Dharmam was being established in its stead. Transposed to the social plane, this principle of Dharmam was considered as the mission of [...] "protecting or salvaging the lowly, the oppressed." [...] As a practical activity, Dharmam meant charity and almsgiving. [...] This was taught to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> seek God. People were specially exhorted to undertake charity by means of material goods, and do it without discriminating among the beneficiaries.|$|E
