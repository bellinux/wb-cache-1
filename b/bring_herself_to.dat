Lois, unable to stand idly by as her son terrorizes the world, decides to assassinate him. After taking weapons from Stewie's own weapons vault, she engages him in a destructive battle in the Oval Office. Lois eventually gains the upper hand and prepares to kill Stewie, but cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> murder her own child.

5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|Seeking vengeance for Kureha's death, Ryu learns from Murai {{that the}} raiders were from Vigoor, so he stows away on an airship {{bound for the}} empire. Fighting {{his way through the}} streets of its capital city, Tairon, Ryu faces several bosses {{including}} the three Greater Fiends. He defeats Alma in a battle that wrecks the city, but leaves her to Rachel's mercy. Conversely, Rachel cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> kill her sister, and instead is taken by Doku, who prepares to sacrifice her in a ritual to enhance Alma's power. With Alma's help Ryu rescues Rachel and destroys Doku's spirit, but with his dying breath Doku casts the blood curse on Ryu. The only way for Ryu to lift the curse is to kill the emperor, so he storms the palace, defeating Marbus who bars his way to the emperor's personal realm. Two successive boss fights must be completed to destroy the Emperor and reclaim the Dark Dragon Blade—once this is accomplished his realm starts to destruct. Ryu must then be maneuvered up a series of ledges to escape, but in the process he loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade.|$|E

She pulls the boy off the road, to which she learns that he is missing his mother and that his name, coincidentally, is Boris. Veronika decides to informally adopt the boy, and takes him back to the community home.|$|R

He flies into a total rage, and conflict is inevitable.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the narrator}} will bid adieu to Mary Lowther, to Loring, and to Dunripple. The conduct of his heroine, as {{depicted}} in these pages, will, he fears, meet with the disapprobation of many close and good judges of female character. He has endeavoured to describe a young woman, prompted in all her doings by a conscience wide awake, guided by principle, willing, if need be, <b>to</b> sacrifice <b>herself,</b> struggling always <b>to</b> keep <b>herself</b> from doing wrong, but yet causing infinite grief to others, and nearly <b>bringing</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> utter shipwreck, because, for a while, she allowed <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> believe {{that it would be}} right for her to marry a man whom she did not love.|$|R

Francine has {{difficulty}} <b>bringing</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> make a romantic commitment to Katchoo, partly due to her Methodist upbringing and partly because of her childhood dream to become a wife and mother. Her fairytale marriage to Brad Silver comes crashing down when she realizes that he is unfaithful to her, leading her to reconsider choosing him over Katchoo. Francine was ranked 86th in Comics Buyer's Guide's [...] "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" [...] list.|$|R

25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs {{show that there is}} a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> believe her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E

Marital bliss ensues.|$|E
25|$|For Clara, {{the final}} straw comes when Lady Aylmer demands that she sever her ties with a friend. Mrs. Askerton, Lady Aylmer has learned, left an abusive drunken husband in India and lived with Colonel Askerton for several years before {{the death of her}} husband freed her to marry him. Clara is duly appalled by her friend's past immorality, but cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> cast off someone who has come to depend on her friendship. Pressed relentlessly on the subject by Lady Aylmer, she {{declares}} an end to her engagement and returns to Somersetshire, where she accepts the hospitality of the Askertons.|$|E

50|$|Heo infuses {{her poetry}} with the lyricism {{and the images}} taken from {{traditional}} Korean folktales and songs, thereby creating a uniquely Korean modern poetry free of western modernist influence. It {{can be said that}} distancing herself from her native tongue by living in a foreign environment is in itself the poet’s attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> closer <b>to</b> the essence of the Korean language. In Heo's poems life is broken into pieces, filled with agony, incoherent, and loveless.|$|R
50|$|Her {{decision}} to stop touring and recording {{at the end}} of the 1980s was not fueled by the grueling schedule, as some might guess, but by her desire <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> more of <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> the music, she turned her energies to songwriting.|$|R
25|$|Katerina Ivanovna Verkhovtseva (a.k.a. Katya, Katka, Katenka) is Dmitri's {{beautiful}} fiancée, {{despite his}} open forays with Grushenka. Her engagement to Dmitri is chiefly {{a matter of}} pride on both their parts, Dmitri having bailed her father out of a debt. Katerina is extremely proud and seeks {{to act as a}} noble martyr, suffering as a stark reminder of everyone's guilt. Because of this, she cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> act on her love for Ivan, and constantly creates moral barriers between him and herself. By the end of the novel, she too, begins a real and sincere spiritual redemption, as seen in the epilogue, when she asks Mitya and Grushenka to forgive her.|$|E

Jude manages to remain on the roof and begins to sing ("All You Need Is Love"). The police allow the band to {{accompany}} him, while Lucy tries {{to get back to the}} building, but is blocked by the police. Max draws Jude's attention to an opposite rooftop where Lucy is standing and looking at him.

25|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{notes in}} The Uses of Enchantment that the 18th-century fairy tale Beauty and the Beast is {{a version of}} Cupid and Psyche. Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, {{including}} Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin, in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from ash, and is aided by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella's sisters mutilate their own feet to emulate her, while Psyche's are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, {{in an attempt to}} end all the suffering she endured and to let her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is asleep with his new bride. She cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn't receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.|$|E
5000|$|The {{question}} remains of whether Hindley is indeed reformed [...] - [...] for example, in {{her decision to}} convert to Longford's own Roman Catholic faith [...] - [...] or whether she is merely manipulating him and feigning her rehabilitation in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> closer <b>to</b> release. Longford visits Brady twice; on both occasions, Brady tells him that she is manipulative {{and that he should}} turn his back on her, as she is only interested in winning release from prison.|$|R

60|$|When Mary died, Elizabeth was twenty-five, and the English {{were mostly}} {{willing to have}} her for their queen. She had read, thought, and learnt a great deal; and she took care to have the advice of wise men, {{especially}} of the great Thomas Cecil, whom she made Lord Burleigh, and kept as her adviser {{as long as he}} lived. She did not always follow even his advice, however; but, whenever she did, it was the better for her. She knew Robert Dudley was not wise, so, though she was so fond of him, she never let him manage her affairs for her. She would have wished to marry, but she knew her subjects would think this disgraceful, so she only made him Earl of Leicester: and her liking for him prevented her from ever <b>bringing</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> accept any of the foreign princes who were always making proposals to her. Unfortunately he was not a good man, and did not make a good use of her favor, and he was much disliked by all the queen's best friends.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E
500|$|Although Leslie {{plans to}} object during the ceremony, she cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> {{do it and}} comes to accept the marriage. Andy and April officially become husband and wife. Afterward, Ron {{explains}} to Leslie {{that she did not}} object because deep down she knew that Andy and April would get married no matter what, and that there is no correct way to do things when it comes to matters of the heart, using his own two former marriages as an example. During the reception, April privately tells Leslie how much she appreciates her, flattering Leslie. Andy makes a speech to the guests, where he calls Tom his [...] "best" [...] best man, much to Tom's delight. He tells the crowd that life is short and he and April simply did what made them happy. Taking Andy’s advice, Leslie asks Ben to stay in Pawnee, and he surprises her by revealing that he has already accepted Chris' job offer.|$|E

Football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) observes them, and warns Emma not to become Will's rebound girl. When Will asks her to meet with him after school again, Emma turns him down, having accepted a date with Ken. Terri discovers that she is actually experiencing a hysterical pregnancy, but she cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> tell Will, so she lies to him that they are having a son. She tells him to quit working as a janitor, offering up use of her craft room as a nursery for the baby so they do not need to move.|$|E

500|$|Mileena {{appeared}} in the 1999 episode [...] "Shadow of a Doubt" [...] of the television series , {{in which she had}} no direct relation to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his [...] "new daughter"). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> kill him during their night of passion and was also explicitly warned by Shang Tsung to not do it. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn. As punishment for her taking too much time in her mission, Kahn allows Mileena to keep her beauty with the exception of making her teeth exaggeratedly pointed. She then starts to wear her signature mask, which Kahn gives her before banishing her from his sight. In Konquest, Mileena was portrayed by Meg Brown and Audie England played Mileena pretending to be Kitana. Brown said she liked her sexy Mileena costume so much that she asked to be let [...] "wear the outfit home for her boyfriend." ...|$|E

After Rhys becomes suspicious of her behaviour and her friendship with her boss Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in [...] "Meat", Gwen reveals to him the truth about her responsibilities with Torchwood. Rhys then becomes involved in a mission to uncover and destroy an alien meat-trading racket, and ends up taking a bullet to protect Gwen's life. Because she enjoys finally being able to be honest with Rhys, Gwen cannot <b>bring</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> drug him for a second time, and so demands that Jack allow Rhys keep his memories of Torchwood. Rhys and Gwen marry in the episode [...] "Something Borrowed".
