In a {{turbofan}} engine, {{the high}} pressure rotor and the radial driveshaft, which transmit the {{power from the}} internal gear-box to the external gear-box, are geared by a spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair.</b> In this paper, a reasonably simplified dynamic model of the coupled rotors system is established, and then, the coupled stiffness matrix and coupled damping matrix of the spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> are deduced. A shaft element method is proposed to investigate the lateral-torsional coupled vibration equations of the gear-rotor system. Furthermore, the mode shapes and unbalance responses of this two rotors coupled system are simulated. The {{results indicate that the}} system derives many new modes and the exciting forces on a rotor of the system would be passed to the other rotor for the gears meshing. When the rotor dynamics of a turbofan engine is being analyzed, the high pressure rotor and the radial drive shaft must be viewed as a whole. The dynamic balance precision of the rotors should be qualified properly, in order to improve the dynamic quality of the turbofan engine...|$|E

40|$|Presented is Tredgold’s Approximation {{for using}} an {{equivalent}} cylindrical gear with spur teeth to “approximate” a bevel gear with straight teeth. This relation is extended to spiral bevel and hypoid gears by utilizing pitch surface curvature {{in the direction}} perpendicular to the gear tooth spiral to establish an equivalent gear. Subsequently, the envelope of a planar gear tooth profile in this perpendicular direction is presented. The envelope of the gear tooth profile is used to determine fully conjugate gear teeth profiles for spatial gear elements. This procedure is valid for any tooth profile along with circular and non-circular gears. To validate the methodology, a virtual model of a <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> (“presented model”) is created and an unloaded tooth contact analysis is performed.

Using the commercial {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) software ANSYS FLUENT modelling methodologies for regions within the IGB have been developed, applied and refined. The IGB is a bearing chamber that houses the bearings that support the low pressure, intermediate pressure and high pressure shafts and in addition the spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> that enable power to be taken from the high pressure shaft to power aircraft auxiliary systems. Within civil aeroengines parasitic power loss is a significant issue and as oil is used to lubricate and cool throughout the engine, this power loss largely manifests as increased heat-to-oil (HTO). A significant contributor to HTO is the IGB. The IGB contains complex geometry and a highly rotating two-phase flow consisting of films, droplets, ligaments and mist.

Thus the formulated problem became a nonlinear NP Hard problem with number of problem specific (approximate) heuristic procedures.

In this paper, we adopt target variable curvature crowning according to the specific conditions of bevel gears in order to obtain good modification effect, nevertheless, because of the complexity of the variable curvature crowning, the conventional method of using space spherical involute stretch and sweep standard gear model to remove tooth surface materials has been unable to meet the accurate requirements of the variable curvature crowned model, at the same time, this method can not realize parametric modeling of modification bevel gear.

The change in crack propagation plane generally occurs due to sudden change in the state of stress ahead of the crack tip such as during starting of the engine. Examination revealed that there were about 175 bands on the fracture surface. Assuming that each band is associated with a starting cycle of the engine and the average duration of each starting cycle as 50 s, the crack propagation time, after initiation, is estimated to be approximately 2. 5 hr. Also, since the engine had a total of 288 starting cycles, it is, therefore, stated that the fatigue cracks were initiated in the gear after about 115 starting cycles after the engine was inducted in service. The primary failure in the engine accessory gearbox (EAGB) has been identified as the fatigue failure of the bevel gear on O 11 axis. Once the fracturing took place in this gear, the smooth running of the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> in O 11 and O 1 axes was affected. This has led to resistance in power transmission from engine to the EAGB. During this time, the quill shaft on O 11 axis (part No. 104. 06. 52. 003) has failed by torsional overload. Hence, the failure in the quill shaft is secondary in nature and it occurred subsequent to the primary fatigue failure of the bevel gear on O 11 axis. The other damages seen on bevel gear on O 1 axis (part No. 104. 06. 52. 200) and the spur gear (part No. 104. 06. 52. 025) are also secondary in nature. Fatigue crack initiation regions in bevel gear on O 11 axis were largely damaged due to post fracture impact. However, the available fracture signatures and the location of fatigue crack origins did not suggest any specific abnormalities in the material which could be responsible for premature fatigue crack initiation. This was further confirmed through metallurgical examination of the gear wherein the material of construction was found to conform to specification with respect to composition, microstructure, surface hardening, hardness and case depth. Hence, the fatigue failure of the gear appears to be because of reasons other than metallurgical factors. From the laboratory examination and the analysis, {{it was not possible to}} identify the exact cause(s) for the premature fatigue crack initiation in the bevel gear in question. However, based on the failure evidences and the analysis, one or more of the following could be responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. It is suggested that these aspects be examined thoroughly by the investigation committee/court of inquiry before the conclusions are drawn. (a) 	The fatigue crack has initiated and propagated only when the bevel gear on O 11 axis has acted as a driven gear, that is, during the engine start-up. Hence, it needs to be examined whether or not there was any situation during the service life of the engine wherein the torque during starting cycle exceeded the design value. Examination of the run-down time in the engine log may provide valuable information in this regard. It is important to note that once the cracks initiate, they continue to propagate even if the engine running conditions are normal thereafter. (b) 	The meshing between the bevel gears of O 11 and O 1 axes needs to be examined. In this regard, the contact patterns on the flanks of the failed gear need to be analyzed. In case of abnormal meshing, tooth bending stresses at the fillet may be unfavourable and this can promote premature fatigue crack initiation in the gear. (c) 	Examination revealed discrete tool marks on the root region of the failed bevel gear. Comparative study suggested that such tool marks were not present in the root region of the bevel gear of O 1 axis. Possible stress concentration effect because of the presence of rough machining marks leading to premature fatigue crack initiation also needs to be examined...|$|E

This meshes with another <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> mounted on the drive shaft. The use of <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> allows the axis of the drive torque from the pedals to be turned through 90 degrees. The drive shaft then has another <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> near the rear wheel hub which meshes with a <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> on the hub where the rear sprocket would be on {{a conventional}} bike, and canceling out the first drive torque change of axis.|$|R
50|$|In {{straight}} <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{the teeth}} are straight and {{parallel to the}} generators of the cone. This is the simplest form of <b>bevel</b> <b>gear.</b> It resembles a spur gear, only conical rather than cylindrical. The gears in the floodgate picture are straight <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> In straight <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> sets, when each tooth engages it impacts the corresponding tooth and simply curving the gear teeth can solve the problem.|$|R
5000|$|Zerol <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{are very}} similar to a <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> only {{exception}} is the teeth are curved: the ends of each tooth are coplanar with the axis, but the middle of each tooth is swept circumferentially around the <b>gear.</b> Zerol <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{can be thought of as}} spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears,</b> which also have curved teeth, but with a spiral angle of zero, so the ends of the teeth align with the axis.|$|R
