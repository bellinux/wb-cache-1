We followed a sleepy man with a flaring torch, into a great, cold room, where there were two immensely broad beds, on what looked like two immensely <b>broad</b> <b>deal</b> dining-tables; another deal table of similar dimensions {{in the middle of the}} bare floor; four windows; and two chairs.

In the earlier part of his Metetemata (1830), he took up the question of written or unwritten literature, on which Wolf's entire argument turned, and showed that the art of writing must be anterior to Peisistratos.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{initiate}} {{the study of}} SSB in 3 + 1 dimensional rotating, charged, asymptotically AdS black holes. The theory living on their boundary, R × S 2, has the interpretation of a 2 + 1 dimensional rotating holographic superconductor. We study {{the appearance of a}} marginal mode of the condensate as the temperature is decreased. We find that the transition temperature depends on the rotation. At temperatures just below Tc, the transition temperature at zero rotation, there exists a critical value of the rotation, which destroys the superconducting order. This behaviour is analogous to the emergence of a critical applied magnetic field and we show that the superconductor in fact produces the expected London field in the planar limit. Over the past year or so, there has been considerable activity in the field of AdS/CMT, which attempts to bring a phenomenological approach to the AdS/CFT correspondence to bear on problems in condensed-matter physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

30|$|One such {{bottom-up}} {{approach is to}} enhance the resilience of the impacted system. The concept of resilience emerged from ecology in the 1960 – 1970 ’s (Holling 1973; Folke 2006). It was used {{in relation to the}} stability of ecosystems and the capacity of a system to recover following some shock or disturbance, without losing its characteristics. Resilience has since been adopted by numerous disciplines, ranging from ecology to psychology, engineering, and disaster studies. Recently, it has also been applied in the context of climate change adaptation. For instance, resilient development has become a central concept in IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 2014). The definitions of what resilience entails vary from narrow to broad (Adger 2000; Carpenter et al. 2001). Ecological resilience, for example, deals with withstanding shocks, counteracting damage, unpredictability, thresholds of system collapse, and persistence and change. Social-ecological resilience is <b>broader,</b> <b>dealing</b> with adaptive systems, the interplay between disturbance and reorganization, self-organization, and learning. Walker et al. (2004) define it as: “the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks”.|$|R
50|$|On May 5, 1994, Great American Communications (which {{would be}} renamed Citicasters {{following}} {{the completion of}} its debt restructuring later that year) agreed to sell WBRC and three of its sister stations - fellow ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina, NBC affiliate WDAF-TV in Kansas City and CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV in Phoenix - to New World Communications for $350 {{million in cash and}} $10 million in share warrants. As part of a <b>broader</b> <b>deal</b> between New World and Fox signed on May 23 of that year, New World agreed to affiliate five of its eight existing television stations and the four it had acquired from Great American with Fox, in a series of affiliation transactions that would take two years to complete due to the varying conclusion dates of their ongoing contracts with either ABC, NBC or CBS.

Although students initially emphasized people-oriented traits as important to the competent dentist, this emphasis gradually decreased as their professional socialization advanced, concomitant with an increase in importance placed on status-oriented traits. The people-oriented elements likewise decreased in importance with regard to the student's self-image as professionals as they became more accustomed to professional reality. The correlation between these variables indicates the changes occuring in the students' acceptance or rejection of various aspects of their chosen profession throughout their years of study. ...|$|R
