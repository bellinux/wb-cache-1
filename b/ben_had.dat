5|$|To {{film the}} final scene at Westminster, the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and Big <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5am. This {{was the first time}} the security-sensitive area (home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence) had ever been closed to {{accommodate}} filming. Prime Minister (at the time of filming) Tony Blair's son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal, stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies.|$|E
25|$|It {{was worth}} noting during the {{internal}} review that Ben claimed {{he tried to}} contribute {{as much as possible}} during the task, but ultimately it was felt <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> only done minor tasks and hadn't technically contributed anything during both weeks and this resulted in his dismissal.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, August 22, {{no other}} sign of <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> been found. A text message {{was sent to}} Edd Sorenson, a veteran cave diver and {{recovery}} specialist with hundreds of dives to his credit, on his yacht in the Bahamas, where he was leading an expedition. He came to Vortex Springs the next day. Other divers, and an official with an international cave-diving rescue organization, {{told him it was}} too dangerous to go any further than they already had.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> {{never shown}} {{interest}} in “boy” toys, {{they wanted to}} wear girl’s clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child’s gender identity is extremely important.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 2000s Ben McDaniel {{was going through}} a {{difficult}} period in his life. The oldest of three sons born to Shelby and Patty McDaniel, a wealthy couple who lived in Collierville, Tennessee, outside Memphis, he had returned to live with his parents after his marriage ended in divorce and his construction business failed, the latter leaving him with tax debts of almost $50,000 to the Internal Revenue Service and the state of Tennessee. He was also still grieving for his younger brother Paul, a frequent rock climbing partner during their youth, who died in 2008 at the age of 22 from a stroke. <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> found Paul unconscious in the family home and tried to revive him; he later became active in raising money for the foundation his parents established to support research into prevention and treatment of strokes.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of the slaveholders, Tubman was never captured, and neither were the fugitives she guided. Years later, she told an audience: [...] "I was {{conductor}} of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." [...] One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, <b>Ben,</b> <b>had</b> purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
2500|$|Nor does Shelby believe <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> any {{intention}} of abandoning his life. He had left his dog in Santa Rosa Beach and had not given Greer any indication of such plans. Shelby also noted that <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> seen the impact Paul's death had had on his parents. [...] "After what we went through with Paul, we know our son {{well enough to know}} he wouldn't put us through that again," [...] his mother told the Commercial Appeal.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1918, Fort <b>Benning</b> <b>has</b> {{served as}} the Home of the Infantry. Since 2005, Fort <b>Benning</b> <b>has</b> been {{transformed}} into the Maneuver Center of Excellence, {{as a result of}} the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's decision to consolidate a number of schools and installations to create various [...] "centers of excellence." [...] Included in this transformation was the move of the Armor School from Fort Knox to Fort Benning.|$|R
2500|$|Sorenson, who {{has been}} {{described}} by the Tampa Bay Times as being able to go where other divers cannot, persisted. He made three separate dives that day, going (by his account) [...] into the cave, [...] further than those sections <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> mapped, using a diver propulsion vehicle and smaller tanks to increase his range. He found nothing– no body, and no evidence of one such as increased activity by carnivorous aquatic scavengers, nor any evidence that <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> gotten into those sections, such as marks on the cave walls or disturbed silt.|$|E
2500|$|Shelby {{has taken}} umbrage at this depiction, calling it [...] "very misleading" [...] {{and said that}} {{bringing}} up Paul's autopsy report was [...] "a real real low blow". His two sons had been on prescription medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder since childhood, he allows, {{but they were not}} addicts or abusers. And, he added, <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> paid off his tax debts {{at the time of the}} disappearance. He also disputes Sorenson's contention, repeated in the film, that Ben is not in the cave. The veteran diver and other rescuers, he claims, went into the wrong section of the cave during their searches.|$|E
2500|$|Ben's dives at {{the site}} were regular enough that the dive shop {{employees}} and other frequent visitors came to know him. One of the employees, Chuck Cronin, believed that while <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> the proper equipment and considerable diving knowledge, he was often overly confident in his abilities and not shy about saying so. That opinion, the Memphis Commercial Appeal later reported, was shared by posters on a scuba diving website, scubaboard.com, who had also met Ben during trips to Vortex Spring. (According to a 2014 online comment by his father, {{he could not find}} anyone at Vortex Spring willing to be his diving partner, so he did his dives alone.) His parents later defended him from those criticisms by seeing them as positive traits. [...] "Ben was brave," [...] his father later said. [...] "Ben was fearless. He followed his passions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} month, amid increasing criticism, the McDaniels rescinded {{the reward}} offer. [...] "Not {{only did it}} endanger the lives of divers who would risk going farther than they should," [...] said Sorenson, who was by then even more firmly convinced that their son had not died in the cave, [...] "it put {{all of our lives}} at risk because we have to go in to recover the bodies." [...] By that time the McDaniels had also come to believe that, if he had not died in the cave, <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> been murdered. A phone tip line they set up had not received any calls, and no one who had not yet said anything was likely to be further motivated to do so, they said. (Ben's father elaborated the following year that the family was told to rescind the reward while in the Vortex Spring area for exactly this reason).|$|E
2500|$|The {{marathon}} {{was inaugurated}} on November 19, 2006, with 97 runners. [...] In the inaugural running, {{the first place}} male runner finished in 2:50:25, and the first place female finisher in 3:11:05. The marathon's second running took place on November 18, 2007 with 174 runners from 29 states, two Canadian provinces, and one from Italy. [...] In 2007, the overall male winner cut 4:50 off the course record by finishing in 2:45:35. [...] In 2008, four runners broke the previous course record, when Ben Schneider set a new 9:10 minute course record by winning with 2:36:25 on a sunny 30–40 degree day. [...] <b>Ben</b> <b>had</b> successes in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 {{when he returned to}} defend his title. In 2012, Olympic Trialist Leah Thorvilson became the first woman to break 3 hours on the course. The race is run in Percy Warner Park in Nashville, TN – one of the country's largest public city parks. It is one of the hardest road marathons in the country according to many runners, and has been named the best marathon in Tennessee.|$|E
