50|$|The raised rim at {{the border}} of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra runs through the shaft, {{providing}} an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> and the ischiocavernosus muscle, which aid urination and ejaculation. The penis has a foreskin that typically covers the glans; this is sometimes removed by circumcision for medical, religious or cultural reasons. In the scrotum, the testicles are held away from the body, one possible reason for this is so sperm can be produced in an environment slightly lower than normal body temperature.|$|E
50|$|The vaginal {{opening and}} the {{urethral}} opening are only visible when the labia minora are parted. These opening have many nerve endings {{that make them}} sensitive to touch. They are surrounded by a ring of sphincter muscles called the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle.</b> Underneath this muscle and {{on opposite sides of}} the vaginal opening are the vestibular bulbs, which help the vagina grip the penis by swelling with blood during arousal. Within the vaginal opening is the hymen, a thin membrane that partially covers the opening in many virgins. Rupture of the hymen has been historically considered the loss of one's virginity, though by modern standards, loss of virginity is considered to be the first sexual intercourse. The hymen can be ruptured by activities other than sexual intercourse. The urethral opening connects to the bladder with the urethra; it expels urine from the bladder. This is located below the clitoris and above the vaginal opening.|$|E

40|$|Several factors {{affecting}} EMG of <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> were studied on male rabbit. Affecting {{factors such as}} tensions of the bladder wall induced by variable pressures exerted on the bladder, rhythmic activity of the urinary bladder, electric stimulation of the pelvic nerve and the hypogastric nerve and stimulations to different portions of the bladder mucosa were studied by means of EMG of the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle.</b> EMG of vas deferens was also studied by occasion of electric stimulation of the pelvic nerve and the hypogastric nerve. The following results were obtained. (1) The activity of <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> had the closest relation to the tension of the 'bladder wall but had {{no relation to the}} rhythmic activity of the bladder itself.

40|$|A 5 -day Hershberger assay {{utilizing}} mature male {{rats and}} a pubertal male assay were evaluated for {{the ability to}} detect anti-androgenic compounds such as flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist. Six days after the operation, implantation with two silicon capsules containing testosterone (T) (30 mg/capsule) in castrated rats provided the ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weights as well as serum T and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels equivalent {{to those of the}} controls (non-castrated, non-implanted rats). Castrated rats implanted with two T-capsules (6 rats/dose) were treated by gavage for 5 days with vehicle (0. 5 % carboxy-methylcellulose) or flutamide (0. 15, 0. 6, 2. 5, or 10 mg/kg/day). Flutamide produced significant decreases in weights of the semi-nal vesicles and the levator ani plus <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscles</b> (> 0. 6 mg/kg/day) and ventral prostate (> 2. 5 mg/kg/day), and an increase in serum LH levels (> 2. 5 mg/kg/day), but no changes in serum T levels. When age-matched intact male rats were treated with 10 -mg/kg/day flutamide, a significant increase in serum T levels was observed concomitant with a tendency of increased LH. The organ weights were also decreased; however, the changes were less than those in the castrated, T-implanted rats. Immature intact male rats (10 rats/dose) were treated for 20 days with flutamide (0, 0. 15, 0. 6, 2. 5, or 10 mg/kg/day). Flutamide produced significant decreases in weights of the seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, and levator ani plus <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscles</b> at 2. 5 and 10 mg/kg/day. Serum LH levels, but not T levels, were increased at 10 mg/kg/day. Statistical significance of some of these changes was not observed in the 6 animals/dose examined.

Abnormal electromyograms of external vesical sphincters sharply revealed patho-physiological states of the sphincters.

40|$|Responses in the {{external}} anal and urethral sphincters {{as well as in}} the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> have been evoked by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the penis (or clitoris), perineum and the peri-anal region and recorded electromyographically in 82 male subjects 5 to 73 years old and in nine female subjects 18 to 55 years old, who had no systemic diseases or demonstrable sacral nervous system lesion. On perineal stimulation (including the penis or clitoris) reflex responses with a typical latency of 33 ms and which exhibit no habituation were obtained in all muscles examined. Stimulation of the peri-anal region gave habituating reflex responses with a typical latency of 55 ms in all muscles examined. On perineal, and sometimes also peri-anal stimulation, stable short latency responses with typical latencies of 5 and 13 ms were recorded; both were considered to be direct responses.

40|$|Background: The proper {{evaluation}} of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) is essential for choosing the correct treatment. Currently, there is no gold standard {{for the assessment of}} female PFM function. Objective: To determine the correlation between vaginal palpation, vaginal squeeze pressure, and electromyographic and ultrasonographic variables of the female PFM. Method: This cross-sectional study evaluated 80 women between 18 and 35 years of age who were nulliparous and had no pelvic floor dysfunction. PFM function was assessed based on digital palpation, vaginal squeeze pressure, electromyographic activity, bilateral diameter of the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscles</b> and the amount of bladder neck movement during voluntary PFM contraction using transperineal bi-dimensional ultrasound. The Pearson correlation was used for statistical analysis (p< 0. 05). Results: There was a strong positive correlation between PFM function and PFM contraction pressure (0. 90). In addition, there was a moderate positive correlation between these two variables and PFM electromyographic activity (0. 59 and 0. 63, respectively) and movement of the bladder neck in relation to the pubic symphysis (0. 51 and 0. 60, respectively). Conclusions: This study showed that there was a correlation between vaginal palpation, vaginal squeeze pressure, and electromyographic and ultrasonographic variables of the PFM in nulliparous women. The strong correlation between digital palpation and PFM contraction pressure indicated that perineometry could easily be replaced by PFM digital palpation in the absence of equipment...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} plastic {{surgical}} techniques {{may be used}} in the repair of vesicovaginal fistulas. The indication for their use include: (a) diameter greater than 4 cm; (b) involvement of the bladder neck/proximal urethra; (c) radiation-induced fistulas; and (d) previous failed repair(s). In the developing world the vast majority of complex fistulas are caused by obstetric trauma; elsewhere they occur mainly following radiotherapy or radical surgery for gynecologic malignancy. The majority of complex fistulas requiring tissue donation may be effectively treated using a vaginal approach and a modified Martius graft. There is probably little or no advantage in encorporating <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers in this graft. Although some concern exists regarding the long-term viability of these grafts in radiation-induced fistulas, in view of the relatively simple operative technique, together with the low associated morbidity, modified Martius grafts may be deemed suitable for first-time repairs. The gracilis muscle graft should be considered next in cases of exclusive transvaginal repair. The omental graft is undoubtedly the most versatile: it can be used in both abdominal and combined abdominovaginal procedures. The recently described posterosuperior sliding bladder flaps warrant further evaluation. For most fistulas involving the bladder neck/proximal urethra, there is no clear advantage in bladder flap reconstruction over vaginal flap reconstruction, the latter being augmented by an anti-stress incontinence procedure were appropriate.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} displacement of pelvic floor landmarks observed with transperineal ultrasound imaging and electromyography of the muscles hypothesised to cause the displacements. Three healthy men participated in this study, which included ultrasound imaging of the mid-urethra, urethra-vesical junction, ano-rectal junction and bulb of the penis. Fine-wire electromyography electrodes were inserted into the puborectalis and <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscles</b> and a transurethral catheter electrode recorded striated urethral sphincter electromyography. A nasogastric sensor recorded intra-abdominal pressure. Tasks included submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions, and Valsalva. The relationship between each of the parameters measured from ultrasound images and electromyography or intra-abdominal pressure amplitudes was described with nonlinear regression. Strong, non-linear relationships were calculated for each predicted landmark/muscle pair for submaximal contractions (R 2 - 0. 87 - 0. 95). The relationships between mid-urethral displacement and striated urethral sphincter electromyography, and bulb of the penis displacement and bulbocavernosus electromyography were strong during maximal contractions (R 2 - 0. 74 - 0. 88). Increased intra-abdominal pressure prevented shortening of puborectalis, which resulted in weak relationships between electromyography and anorectal and urethravesical junction displacement during all tasks. Displacement of landmarks in transperineal ultrasound imaging provides meaningful measures of activation of individual pelvic floor muscles in men during voluntary contractions. This method may aid assessment of muscle function or feedback for training...|$|R
40|$|The corpus cavernosus penis (CCP) and electromyographic (EMG) {{activity}} of the ex-ternal penile muscles were recorded during erection and ejaculation of the goat. The mean peak CCP pressures were 18, 83, and 7003 mm Hg for the quiescence, mild erection, and maximum erection stage of the penis. The contractions of the ischiocavernosus muscles (1 CM) were in phase with the peak pressures of the CCP. Anesthesia of the 1 CM prevented the high peak CCP pressures, indicating that these muscles {{are the source of}} energy for the high pressure recorded. The mechanism of erection in man and animals has been under investigation for many years. Explanations for the mechanism of penile erection have been primarily the-ories deduced from anatomical studies and limited physiological experimentation (Dey-sack, 1939; Denamur and Simonnet, 1950; Conti, 1952). It is generally considered that erection of the penis is produced by a com-bination of elevated arterial pressure, dila-tion of the arteries to the penis, restricted venous return, relaxation of the walls of the cavernous spaces, and contraction of the external penile muscles. The importance of each factor has not been delineated. The role of the ischiocavernosus muscles (1 CM) and <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscles</b> (BCM) is an example for consideration.

Seventeen laboratories from 7 countries participated in phase 1, and results were collated and {{evaluated by the}} OECD {{with the support of}} an international committee of experts. Five androgen-responsive tissues (ventral prostate, paired seminal vesicles and coagulating glands, levator ani and <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscles,</b> glans penis, and paired Cowper’s or bulbourethral glands) were evaluated. The standardized protocols used selected doses of a reference androgen, testosterone propionate (TP), and an antiandrogen, flutamide (FLU). All laboratories successfully detected TP-stimulated increases in androgen-responsive tissue weight and decreases in TP-stimulated tissue weights when FLU was co-administered. The standardized protocols performed well under a variety of conditions (e. g., strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding). There was good agreement among laboratories with regard to the TP doses inducing significant increases in tissue weights and the FLU doses decreasing TP-stimulated tissue weights. Several additional procedures (e. g., weighing of the dorsolateral prostate and fixation of tissues before weighing) and serum component measurements (e. g., luteinizing hormone) were also included by some laboratories to assess their potential utility. The results indicated that the OECD Hershberger protocol was robust, reproducible, and transferable across laboratories.

40|$|Objective: Late-onset hypogonadism, or {{androgen}} {{deficiency in}} the aging male, {{is a significant}} cause of morbidity in older men. Many men in the low normal or equivocal range for low testosterone level exhibit {{signs and symptoms of}} hypogonadism. Serum testosterone is an imperfect maker for hypogonadism as symptoms vary greatly within the low to low normal range in addition to variations among testosterone assays. Perineal ultrasound can be effectively used to examine the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> (BCM), an androgenized tissue that may be impacted by androgen receptor activity. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of men who underwent perineal ultrasound for hypogonadism. The ultrasound data were used to calculate the area of the BCM and correlate it with indices of hypogonadismin symptomatic men including free and total testosterone and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Results: The results demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between total and free testosterone and BCM area in hypogonadal patients. Comparison between BCM area and total testosterone showed R 2  =  0. 061 and p =  0. 0187 and comparison between BCM area and free testosterone showed R 2  =  0. 0957 and p =  0. 0034. In addition, low BCM was also correlated with DEXA results showing osteoporosis and osteopenia (R 2  =  0. 2239, p =  0. 0027). Conclusion: There has been recent controversy over the safety of testosterone replacement therapy. This might be particularly important in men with hypogonadal symptoms but a low normal testosterone level. Our study investigated the use of perineal ultrasound to measure BCM as a surrogate marker for poor androgenized men presenting with hypogonadism...|$|E
40|$|Ejaculation is {{controlled}} by a spinal ejaculation generator located in the lumbosacral spinal cord, consisting in male rats of lumbar spinothalamic (LSt) cells and their inter-spinal projections to autonomic and motor centers. LSt cells co-express several neuropeptides, including gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) and enkephalin. We previously demonstrated in rats that GRP regulates ejaculation by acting within the lumbosacral spinal cord. In the present study, the hypothesis was tested that enkephalin controls ejaculation by acting on mu (MOR) or delta opioid receptors (DOR) in LSt target areas. Adult male rats were anesthetized and spinalized and received intrathecal infusions of vehicle, MOR antagonist CTOP (0. 4 or 4 nmol), DOR antagonist (TIPP (0. 4, 4 or 40 nmol), MOR agonist DAMGO (0. 1 or 10 nmol), or DOR agonist deltorphin II (1. 3 or 13 nmol). Ejaculatory reflexes were triggered by stimulation of the dorsal penile nerve (DPN) and seminal vesicle pressure and rhythmic contractions of the <b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> were analyzed. Intrathecal infusion of MOR or DOR antagonists effectively blocked ejaculatory reflexes induced by DPN stimulation. Intrathecal infusion of DAMGO, but not deltorphin II triggered ejaculation in absence of DPN stimulation. Both MOR and DOR agonists facilitated ejaculatory reflexes induced by subthreshold DPN stimulation in all animals. Overall, these results {{support the hypothesis that}} enkephalin plays a critical role in the control of ejaculation in male rats. Activation of either MOR or DOR in LSt target areas is required for ejaculation, while MOR activation is sufficient to trigger ejaculation in the absence of sensory stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to describe perineal electrophysiological findings and to determine their diagnostic value in a type of lumbosacral plexopathy after vaginal delivery, which only involves {{the lower part of}} the plexus (S 2 -S 4).   Consecutive female patients referred to an outpatients' urodynamic clinic were the source. Nineteen previously healthy women, 13 multiparae and six para 1, were investigated. Mean age was 33. 7 (SD 5. 4) (range 28 - 41) years. All of them presented with urinary (stress incontinence 14, dysuria five), anorectal (faecal incontinence eight, dyskesia one), or sexual dysfunctions (hypoorgasmia or anorgasmia six) after vaginal delivery. No associated lower limb sensory or motor deficits were noted. All the patients had electrophysiological recordings (<b>bulbocavernosus</b> <b>muscle</b> EMG, measurements of the bulbocavernosus reflex latencies (BCRLs), somatosensory evoked potentials of the pudendal nerve (SEPPNs), and pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies (PNTMLs)). Cystometry and urethral pressure profile (UPP) were performed in the 14 patients with stress urinary incontinence.   Perineal electrophysiological examination disclosed signs of denervation in the perineal muscles in all the cases, prolonged BCRLs in 17 / 19, and abolished BCRLs in 2 / 19, abnormal SEPPN in 1 / 19, and normal PNTMLs in all the patients. Urodynamic investigations disclosed low urethral closure pressure for age (< 50 cm H 2 O) in half of the patients.   In conclusion, Lower postpartum lumbosacral plexopathy is evoked when perineal sensory disturbances whether or not associated with urinary or faecal incontinence persist after a history of a difficult vaginal delivery. Electrophysiological investigations precisely identify the site of the lesion and demonstrate distal innervation integrity. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAt present, {{apart from}} visual evoked {{potential}} testing, clinical neurophysiological testing is rarely used in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients at all. In MS patients with lower urinary tract, bowel and/or sexual dysfunction, which are highly prevalent in MS, clinical neurophysiological tests of the sacral nervous system have been introduced {{in the past and}} reported as abnormal. Their usefulness is – in selected patients – to substantiate the suspicion of the neurogenic nature of the pelvic organ dysfunction, but there is no specific recommendation for MS patients. Concentric needle EMG of the perineal <b>muscles,</b> <b>bulbocavernosus</b> reflex latency measurement and pudendal SEP may be particularly useful in those rare patients in whom MS may affect the conus medullaris, to demonstrate “directly” this lesion of the lower sacral segments. Clinical neurophysiological testing retains the potential to further clarify interesting research questions of correlation of nervous system function and pelvic organ dysfunction, particularly relevant for application of sophisticated new rehabilitative methods including electrical stimulation of the nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Coughing provokes stress urinary incontinence, and {{voluntary}} coughs are employed clinically to assess pelvic floor dysfunction. Understanding urethral dynamics during coughing in men is limited, {{and it is}} unclear whether voluntary coughs are an appropriate surrogate for spontaneous coughs. We aimed to investigate the dynamics of urethral motion in continent men during voluntary and evoked coughs. Thirteen men (28 – 42 years) with no history of urological disorders volunteered to participate. Transperineal ultrasound (US) images were recorded and synchronized with measures of intraabdominal pressure (IAP), airflow, and abdominal/chest wall electromyography during voluntary coughs and coughs evoked by inhalation of nebulized capsaicin. Temporal and spatial aspects of urethral movement induced by contraction of the striated urethral sphincter (SUS), levator ani (LA), and <b>bulbocavernosus</b> (BC) <b>muscles</b> and mechanical aspects of cough generation were investigated. Results showed coughing involved complex urethral dynamics. Urethral motion implied SUS and BC shortening and LA lengthening during preparatory and expulsion phases. Evoked coughs resulted in greater IAP, greater bladder base descent (LA lengthening), and greater midurethral displacement (SUS shortening). The preparatory inspiration cough phase was shorter during evoked coughs, as was the latency between onset of midurethral displacement and expulsion. Maximum midurethral displacement coincided with maximal bladder base descent during voluntary cough, but followed it during evoked cough. The data revealed complex interaction between muscles involved in continence in men. Spatial and temporal differences in urethral dynamics and cough mechanics between cough types suggest that voluntary coughing may not adequately assess capacity of the continence mechanism...|$|R
