25|$|Baldwin IV deposed Guy {{and took}} <b>back</b> <b>power</b> to himself, {{although}} he was by now blind and bed-ridden. For {{the next few months}} he attempted unsuccessfully to have Sibylla's marriage to Guy annulled. Raymond III was invited back, and the Haute Cour was summoned to decide on Baldwin IV's successor. His legal heir was his sister, Sibylla, but it was decided that her son Baldwin of Montferrat would inherit the kingdom, preceding Sibylla's claim. Baldwin V, aged 5, was crowned co-king.|$|E
25|$|In 260, {{the fourth}} Wei emperor, Cao Mao, {{attempted}} a coup to seize <b>back</b> <b>power</b> from the regent, Sima Zhao, {{who had been}} monopolising state power since 255. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan (司馬幹), heard of the coup and tried to enter the palace to help his brother. However, he was denied entry by Sun You (孫佑), an officer guarding the main gate, {{so he had to}} enter the palace through another gate. When Sima Zhao found out why Sima Gan showed up late, he wanted to execute Sun You and his family. However, Xun Xu advised him against it by pointing out that it would be unfair and unjust to punish Sun You's family as well. Sima Zhao heeded Xun Xu's advice and punished Sun You only, by demoting him to the status of a commoner.|$|E

25|$|During Tang Dynasty's 2nd reign, Wu Ruyi (Fan Bingbing) {{enters the}} palace at age 14 as an {{innocent}} Cairen (Talented Lady) and aspires to serve Emperor Taizong (Zhang Fengyi) as his consort. The Emperor Taizong soon takes notice {{of her and}} {{falls in love with}} her, inciting many to grow jealous of her. They set out to destroy her numerous times by falsely accusing her of theft, murder and treachery. She survives by her wits and intelligence but is kept at arm's length by Emperor Taizong due to a prophecy foretelling a woman of Wu stealing the Tang Dynasty. When Emperor Taizong dies, she is sent to a monastery to become a nun. However, the Emperor's youngest son Li Zhi (Aarif Rahman), who later becomes the Emperor Gaozong, has been in love with her since he was a child. He brings her back to the palace and makes her his concubine. During her time as a minor consort to Emperor Taizong, she learned how an effective Emperor rules his court. Using that knowledge, she helped Li Zhi take <b>back</b> <b>power</b> from his Regent, and herself into the position of Empress meanwhile revenging her daughter's death. She co-ruled with Li Zhi until his death, after which she ruled the country in her own right.|$|E
25|$|Man Changwu (滿長武) was Man Wei's {{eldest son}} and he resembled his {{grandfather}} Man Chong in character. When he was 23, he started {{served as an}} assistant under Sima Zhao, the regent and de facto ruler of the Cao Wei state in its final years. In 260, when the Wei emperor Cao Mao launched a coup {{in an attempt to}} seize <b>back</b> <b>power</b> from Sima Zhao, Man Changwu was in charge of guarding one of the palace gates. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan (司馬幹), led his men to the palace to assist Sima Zhao, but Man Changwu refused to let him pass and told him to enter through another gate instead. Later, when Sima Zhao asked Sima Gan why he was late, Sima Gan told him what happened. Wang Xian (王羨), a military adviser to Sima Zhao, was also denied entry so he bore a grudge against Man Changwu and later often spoke ill of him in front of Sima Zhao. In 257, when a rebellion broke out in Shouchun, Sima Zhao ordered Man Wei to join him in suppressing the rebellion. When Man Wei reached Xuchang, he fell sick so he remained in Xuchang and did not meet up with Sima Zhao at Shouchun. When Man Changwu, who was with Sima Zhao at Shouchun, heard about his father's illness, he left Shouchun and went to Xuchang to see his father. Sima Zhao was very unhappy with Man Changwu because of this. Later, he found an excuse to order Man Changwu's arrest and imprisonment. Man Changwu died under torture while in prison, while his father Man Wei was stripped of his titles and reduced to the status of a commoner. Many people saw this incident as a grievous injustice to Man Wei and Man Changwu.|$|E

On 27 July, Magdeburg's former {{administrator}} Christian Wilhelm von Brandenburg slipped into the city, seizing <b>back</b> <b>power.</b> Christian Wilhelm immediately declared his allegiance for Sweden. Falkenberg was appointed to the rank of Commandant and sent to Magdeburg, which he managed to enter in October by disguising himself as a sailor. He then presented the city's council with a letter reassuring them of Sweden's support in their struggle against the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League. Soon afterwards, Imperial general Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim chased Magdeburg's militia into the city, imposing a siege. In the meantime, Falkenberg became the head of Magdeburg's garrison, organized a recruitment drive and strengthened the fortifications. The majority of Magdeburg's population appeared reluctant as they have grown tired of the war, the exception being the local radical Protestant clergy.|$|E

He {{entered into a}} conspiracy with eunuchs Tang Heng, Zuo Guan, Dan Chao (單超), Xu Huang (徐璜), and Ju Yuan (具瑗) to overthrow Liang—sealing the oath by biting open Dan's arm and swearing by his blood. Liang Ji had some suspicions about what Emperor Huan and the eunuchs were up to, and began an investigation. The five eunuchs quickly reacted. They had Emperor Huan openly announce that he was taking <b>back</b> <b>power</b> from Liang Ji and mobilized the imperial guards to defend the palace against a counterattack by Liang. They surrounded Liang's house and forced him to surrender. Liang and Sun were unable to respond and committed suicide. The entire Liang and Sun clans (except for Liang Ji's brothers Li Buyi and Liang Meng , who had previously already died) were arrested and slaughtered. A large number of officials were executed or deposed for close association with Liang—so many {{that the government was}} almost unable to function for some time. Liang and Sun's properties were confiscated by the imperial treasury, which allowed the taxes to be reduced by 50% for one year. The people greatly celebrated Liang Ji's death.|$|E
