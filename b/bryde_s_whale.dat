40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} occurrence, behaviour, spatial distribution, and {{temporal}} distribution of cetaceans in the Greater Dyer Island area, Western Cape, South Africa. Three main methods were used in the study: Analysis of data from a local whale-watching vessel (WWV) (2000 2012), visual land-based theodolite tracking (during four southern right whale seasons (August December) from 2011 2014 and one summer/autumn season in 2013), and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) using a single bottom moored hydrophone (DSG-Ocean Loggerhead) in the months of January/February, September, and October, 2014). Methods were chosen, due to suitability, cost efficiency, and because they complement each other. Data from the WWV covered more than a ten-year period and provided indications of temporal and spatial distribution trends, but data were limited with respect to survey effort and behavioural data. Shore-based observations provided spatial, temporal, and behaviour patterns of the cetacean species in the area, but the method is labour intensive, requires daylight and is restricted by weather conditions. PAM could be conducted 24 hours a day and in poor weather conditions and enabled a temporal extension of the monitoring of cetaceans in the area, but individual hydrophones, are expensive and can break down or be lost. Simultaneous visual observations and PAM were used to investigate the vocalisation patterns of southern right whales and the possibility of using PAM to monitor presence of southern right whales. An analysis of the consistency and validity of the opportunistic data from the WWV was conducted before the data was used in a spatial and temporal analysis. The Consistency Index (CI) was defined as the proportion of times a data field was recorded per total number of trips during all years. The validity of the data were assessed to determine accuracy of the data. The validity and consistency analysis of the sighting records revealed that the dataset was useful but data fields varied considerably in their consistency of collection. The trip duration and route was recorded in less than 5 % of cases, making analysis of temporal and spatial patterns difficult. The validity of species identification was excellent with 100 % agreement between observer records and photographic documentation in 152 encounters of seven cetacean species. Behavioural data were described in overly subjective terms, thus not allowing for any analysis of patterns. The analysis also resulted in a list of suggestions for the design of future observation sheets, and data collection methods and {{the development and implementation of}} worldwide standards are encouraged (guidelines and protocols), which should address different levels and scenarios of data collection from WWV. This work has made a novel contribution to the global research field by submission of a paper and direct communication with the whale watching subcommittee at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) concerning content in the International guidelines for platform of opportunity guiding principles on data collection. An analysis of opportunistic cetacean sightings from the local WWV consisted of more than 5500 cetacean encounters during more than 2500 trips from 2003 to 2012. Results were twofold; 1) discovering that there are five main cetacean species using the area: Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), Bryde s whales (Balaenoptera brydeii), Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea), and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and providing spatial and temporal distribution patterns for these species as well as the first long-term, year round dataset for this area. Three other species of incidental visitors were: Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and Heaviside s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii). 2) Showing that opportunistic data of cetacean encounters collected regularly from a WWV constitute an important source of baseline information of the wildlife abundance and distribution. Caveats and limitations of data from the WWV are discussed and advice regarding data collection from platforms of opportunities are provided. Particularly, the lack of basic data on search effort and of clearly defined behavioural categories is emphasised and standardisation of guidelines for data-collection methods worldwide is suggested. Southern right whales were by far the most frequently occurring cetaceans with a marked seasonal presence from August to December. Numbers peaked consistently between June and January each year and only a single encounter was recorded between 31 January and 26 May in the entire dataset. They appeared either as unaccompanied adults (UAs), as part of surface active groups (SAGs) or as cows accompanied by their calves (cc-pairs). Single right whales were more commonly encountered at the beginning of high season (June September) while groups of two or more were most commonly encountered in the middle of the season (July September) and the modal group size was two. Cow-calf pairs were encountered most frequently late in the season with highest encounters in October December. All right whales were predominantly located close to shore, as were the two main dolphin species. Bryde s whales and humpback whales were located farther from shore. Bryde s whales were observed in all years, except 2006. The highest encounter of Bryde s whales were between March and May. <b>Bryde</b> <b>s</b> <b>whale</b> calves were encountered year round. The highest number of encounters occurred during 2003 (n= 25), dropping to 0 in 2006 and then slowly increased at 1 % per annum after 2006. Humpback whales showed two peaks in seasonality: the majority of animals were encountered in June (last month of low season), July and August, with a much smaller peak in late November and December. Most encounters with humpback whale cow-calf pairs occurred during October December. Humpback whale encounters varied considerably from year to year, with most encounters in 2008 (n= 28), 2011 (n= 15), and 2012 (n= 12), but showed a slow average increase at 0. 4 % per annum. Encounters of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins were more frequent during summer months, and most encounters occurred in 2003 - 2007 and in 2011, a slightly negative annual trend existed (0. 9 %). Calves were mainly encountered occurring in December (n = 25) and January (n = 12). Indo- Pacific bottlenose dolphins showed a clear seasonal peak occurred from December to April and most encounters occurred in 2004 - 2006 and in 2009 with a slightly negative annual trend over time (0. 2 %). Seasonality of calves followed the same pattern of as adults. This study was the first to reveal that there are five cetacean species using the area and provide temporal and spatial patterns based on long term data. Shore-based observations, using a surveyor s theodolite, enabled an analysis of behaviour in addition to confirming the spatial and temporal distributions of cetacean species obtained from the WWV-data. Hourly scans were conducted to provide information on species presence, location, group size, group composition, and surface behaviour. In addition, focal groups that were tracked provided and detailed information on movements and behaviours. Effort totalled 1558 hours and 26 minutes (1204 scans) over 270 days between 24 August 2011 and 11 December 2014. All sighting data were filtered to remove periods of poor weather conditions, only observations collected at sea state ? 2 for dolphin species, and ? 5 for baleen whales were analysed. The area is an important location for nursing and socialising southern right whales and it might be a summer feeding area for Bryde s whales. The primarily observed behaviour of humpback whales was travelling and 80 % of the tracked animals were travelling south-east towards Cape Agulhas. Finally, it was found that the area serves as a year round socialising and resting area for the two dolphin species. Swimming speed was calculated, using the longest focal follow from each day for southern right whales and all focal follow tracks of dolphin species. All southern right whales were found to be swimming at a speed less than 5. 1 km/h. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Zoology and EntomologyPhDUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|March 18 - 19, 2013 Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni Anderson, 1879) is a {{baleen whale}} that uses baleen plates to filter fish from {{seawater}} when feeding.

40|$|The vocal {{behavior}} of ziphiid whales is very poorly known. Free-swimming northern bottlenose whales, Hyperoodon ampullatus, {{have been recorded}} producing 3 - 16 kHz whistles and chirps (Winn et al. 1970; linear equipment frequency response 500 Hz- 14 kHz) and 20 - 30 kHz ultrasonic clicks (Fauchner and Whitehead, unpublished data; equipment response to 35 kHz). A free-swimming mesoplodont beaked whale (probably Mesoplodon hertori) produced ultrasonic clicks (Ljungblad, unpublished data; equipment frequency response to 32 kHz). Sounds have been recorded from a stranded Blainville 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whale,</b> Mesoplodon densirostris (Caldwell and Caldwell 1971; equipment frequency response 40 Hz- 20 kHz) and a post-stranding, captive Hubb 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whale,</b> Mesoplodon carlhubbsi (Lynn and Reiss 1992; equipment frequency response 70 Hz- 40 kHz). The latter two species produced low-frequency pulses (mostly 3 ̆c 2 kHz). The Hubb 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whale</b> also produced broadband clicks extending beyond the limit of the recording gear (3 ̆e 40 kHz) and a few weak whistles (3 ̆c 10. 7 kHz). During cetacean survey cruises conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service off the coasts of Oregon, U. S. A., and Baja California, Mexico, we recently made what {{we believe to be}} the first recordings of Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whales</b> (Berardius bairdii). On 27 July 1994 the NOAA Ship Snrveyor encountered a group of 30 - 35 Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whales</b> about 225 nmi west of Hecata Head, Oregon (at 44 ° 102 ̆ 7 N, 129 ° 102 ̆ 7 W). Two sonobuoys (ex U. S. Navy, type 57 B) were deployed. The first was deployed 1. 6 nmi away from the animals, before a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) was launched. The second was deployed 55 min later from the RHIB, within tens of meters from the animals. To relocate the animals after each dive, a continuous search was maintained by two observers searching the forward quadrants with 25 X binoculars and two or more additional observers searching all quadrants with 7 X binoculars and unaided eyes. The only other cetacean seen during this time was one large sperm whale 6 - 10 nmi away. Sounds were recorded using a Nagra IV-SJ analog tape recorder, for a total system response from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. We filtered these recordings at 20 kHz (low pass) and digitized them at 44. 1 kHz (16 bit). Spectrograms (4096 pt FFT, 1024 pt frame length, 87. 5...|$|R

40|$|The Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus), the world’s largest living fish, is a {{cosmopolitan}} tropical and warm temperate species. Genetic {{results indicate that}} two major subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific, respectively. Pronounced size- and sex-based segregation is present {{in most of the}} species’ known coastal feeding areas, with coastal sites typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. The largest known aggregation sites for Whale Sharks host hundreds or low thousands of individuals, based on counts and model estimates. Although individual sharks are highly mobile, many show a degree of site fidelity. Directed fisheries and significant bycatch fisheries have targeted areas where high densities of Whale Sharks occur, leading to rapid reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE) measures. Some bias toward juvenile Whale Shark-dominated aggregations are present in trend data; in the absence of information on other life-stages, these trends are inferred to be representative of population-level declines. While a number of commercial fisheries for the species closed during the 1990 – 2000 <b>s,</b> <b>Whale</b> Shark products remain valuable and the species is still commonly caught in some countries.

40|$|In {{spite of}} their oceanic habitat, deep diving {{cetacean}} species {{have been found to}} be affected by anthropogenic activities, with potential population impacts of high intensity sounds generated by naval research and oil prospecting receiving the most attention. Improving the knowledge of the distribution and abundance of this poorly known group is an essential prerequisite to inform mitigation strategies seeking to minimize their spatial and temporal overlap with human activities. We provide for the first time abundance estimates for five deep diving cetacean species (sperm whale, long-finned pilot whale, northern bottlenose whale, Cuvier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whale</b> and Sowerby 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> beaked <b>whale)</b> using data from three dedicated cetacean sighting surveys that covered the oceanic and shelf waters of the North-East Atlantic. Density surface modelling was used to obtain model-based estimates of abundance and to explore the physical and biological characteristics of the habitat used by these species. Distribution of all species was found to be significantly related to depth, distance from the 2000 m depth contour, the contour index (a measure of variability in the seabed) and sea surface temperature. Predicted distribution maps also suggest that there is little spatial overlap between these species. Our results represent the best abundance estimates for deep-diving whales in the North-East Atlantic, predict areas of high density during summer and constitute important baseline information to guide future risk assessments of human activities on these species, evaluate potential spatial and temporal trends and inform EU Directives and future conservation efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} marine soundscapes {{is a growing}} field of research. Recording {{hardware}} is becoming more accessible; {{there are a number}} of off-the-shelf autonomous recorders that can be deployed for months at a time; software analysis tools exist as shareware; rawor preprocessed recordings are freely and publicly available. However, what is missing are catalogues of commonly recorded sounds. Sounds related to geophysical events (e. g. earthquakes) and weather (e. g. wind and precipitation), to human activities (e. g. ships) and to marine animals (e. g. crustaceans, fish and marine mammals) commonly occur. Marine mammals are distributed throughout Australia 2 ̆ 7 s oceans and significantly contribute to the underwater soundscape. However, due to a lack of concurrent visual and passive acoustic observations, it is often not known which species produces which sounds. To aid in the analysis of Australian and Antarctic marine soundscape recordings, a literature review of the sounds made by marine mammals was undertaken. Frequency, duration and source level measurements are summarised and tabulated. In addition to the literature review, new marine mammal data are presented and include recordings from Australia of Omura 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>whales</b> (Balaenoptera omurai), dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima), common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), long-finned pilot whales (G. melas), Fraser 2 ̆ 7 s dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and spinner dolphins (S. longirostris), as well as the whistles and burst-pulse sounds of Australian pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata).

We found a significant, positive relationship between time and the distance of new observations from the diffusion center (r 2 = 0. 55, p-value = 0. 003).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the nineteenth-century literature created by and about the whaling industry. American whaling narratives saw the zenith of their popularity alongside the industry 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Golden Age, 2 ̆ 2 an era that lasts roughly a half-century (from the 1810 s to the 1860 s), and is defined by deep sea whaling expeditions to the Pacific Ocean, with voyages lasting as long as four years. I argue that whaling narratives provide new insight from new voices regarding race, environmentalism, and nationalism under the general rubric of labor reform, which in turn offer a new lens to examine Moby-Dick. The guiding question of this dissertation is 2 ̆ 2 How American is an American whaleship? 2 ̆ 2 Through the narratives of Edward Barnard and Horace Holden, I show in Chapter One how whaling narratives are precursors to later nineteenth-century writing on race and race reform, as the racial dynamic is inverted in the South Pacific; the privileges that come with being white at home become disadvantages in the non-white islands of the Pacific. In Chapter Two, I use the Reverend Henry Cheever to argue that an awakened environmental consciousness was too unsettling {{for a man who}} boarded a whaleship in order to honor the hard work of American whalemen, and then witnessed those same men slaughtering God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>whales</b> with 2 ̆ 2 cruel harpoons 2 ̆ 2 in order to provide oil for the 2 ̆ 2 honorable lamps 2 ̆ 2 back on the continent; instead of pushing at this conflict, Cheever dampens the uncomfortable feelings it unearths, refusing to dwell on the actions of the whalemen and returning to his more comfortable role as their champion. I argue in Chapter Three that J. Ross Browne uses the whaling industry to detail the failed promise of American idealism through the systematic financial abuse of the whalemen by the merchants who run the industry; yet Browne 2 ̆ 7 s ideal treatment of whalemen does not extend to non-Americans, as one of his primary calls for reform is the removal of foreigners from the whaling labor force. Browne uses nationalism as a cover for his own vengeance against the Portuguese seaman he encountered on his cruise. Lastly, I take these three areas and apply them to the most famous whaling narrative, Moby-Dick, arguing that Melville 2 ̆ 7 s conception of America aligns with neither the continent nor the whaleship but instead offers a third vision of American labor where an individual 2 ̆ 7 s skill trumps his skin color, where an environmental awakening can calm a raging hunter 2 ̆ 7 s heart, and where systematic industrial abuses are blamed not on foreigners nor merchants, but on a workforce that allows the many to be manipulated by the few. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Since the mid- 1990 <b>s,</b> gray <b>whales</b> (Eschrichtius robustus) {{have been}} {{reported}} with increasing frequency near Barrow, Alaska, during summer and autumn months. In collaboration with a broad-scale oceanographic study, three autonomous acoustic recorders were moored northeast of Barrow in October 2003 to provide capability for year-round detection of calls. Two recorders were recovered in September 2004, one from the continental slope (water depth = 316 m) and one from near {{the base of the}} slope (water depth = 1258 m). The shallow instrument recorded for roughly 3 months (87 days), and the deeper instrument for roughly 7. 3 months (222 days). Gray whale calls were recorded on both instruments throughout their periods of operation. The calling rate at the shallower instrument was higher than at the deeper recorder, but surprisingly, the deeper instrument detected calls throughout the 2003 – 04 winter, though the calling rate diminished as winter progressed. Low-frequency N 1 /S 1 pulses, the most common of the calls produced by gray whales, were recorded from deployment through December 2003 on the shallower of the two instruments and from deployment through May 2004 on the deeper instrument. Because this is the first-ever winter-long acoustic study, we cannot be certain that gray whales have not overwintered in the Beaufort Sea in the past. However, a combination of increasing population size and habitat alteration associated with sea ice reduction and warming in the Alaskan Arctic may be responsible for the extra-seasonal gray whale occurrence near Barrow.

40|$|Killer whale {{predation}} on belugas in Cook Inlet, Alaska, {{has become}} a concern since the decline of these belugas was documented during the 1990 <b>s.</b> Accordingly, killer <b>whale</b> sightings were compiled from systematic surveys, observer databases, and anecdotal accounts. Killer whales have been relatively common in lower Cook Inlet (at least 100 sightings from 1975 to 2002), but in the upper Inlet, north of Kalgin Island, sightings were infrequent (18 in 27 yr), especially prior to the 1990 s. Beach cast beluga carcasses with teeth marks and missing flesh also provided evidence of killer whale predation. Most observed killer whale/beluga interactions were in the upper Inlet. During 11 of 15 observed interactions, belugas were obviously injured or killed, either through direct attacks or indirectly {{as a result of}} stranding. Assuming at least one beluga mortality occurred during the other four encounters, we can account for 21 belugas killed between 1985 and 2002.

40|$|No {{published}} literature {{is available on}} the whales and dolphins of Benin. A first insight in the cetacean biodiversity based on stranding, capture and sighting records, as well as a preliminary assessment of status, is provided. Seven species were authenticated: humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, Atlantic spotted dolphin Stenella frontali <b>s,</b> false killer <b>whale</b> Pseudorca crassidens, shortfinned pilot whale Globicephala macrorhynchus, Cuvier’s beaked whale Ziphius cavirostris and sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus. Two additional taxa were confirmed at genus level, i. e. common dolphin Delphinus sp. and minke whale Balaenoptera sp. All reported species also occur in Ghana or Togo. Concern is expressed that in Benin, as in some other western African nations, coastal communities increasingly exploit stranded and by-caught cetaceans to supply a thriving, albeit illegal, marine bushmeat trade. Small cetaceans were also taken intentionally in the absence of efficient controls of landings or other management measures. Although presently at subsistence scale, the threat of wider commercialization exists. In view of the limited number of validated species, voucher specimens and scarce biological baseline information, opportunistic sampling must be expanded to include more systematic and dedicated research, in particular, ship-based marine mammal surveys. It is recommended that graduate students at Benin’s universities play a central role...|$|R

This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the theme of the sacrificial child in four of the most well-known novels by Maori authors published in the 1980 s and 1990 s: Keri Hulme s The Bone People (1983), Patricia Grace s Potiki (1986), Witi Ihimaera <b>s</b> The <b>Whale</b> Rider (1987), and Alan Duff s Once Were Warriors (1990). The motif of a special child whose death is the pivotal event of the narrative functions partly {{as a symbol of the}} destructive marginalization of the Maori people in colonial and postcolonial New Zealand, but it is also given a redemptive significance in that, in all the novels, the child s death has the effect of healing and strengthening its community or family. In The Sacrificial Child in Maori Literature: Narratives of Redemption by Keri Hulme, Patricia Grace, Witi Ihimaera, and Alan Duff representations of children are studied from the perspective of childhood studies, which describes the cultural construction of childhood taking into account the power structure which subordinates children to adults. This perspective makes it possible to see that the representations of children in these novels often fall back upon a Romantic idealization of childhood as a pre-social state, involving associations to Nature and Origin, that positions children outside the normal subjectivity of the adult. A traditional Maori construction of the child as a sign of continuity is also present in the theme of the savior child who is revealed as a reincarnated ancestor. In this study it is shown that the use of childhood to evoke transcendental values favors a static image of the child as either a symbol of the future or of a utopian otherness. The sacrificial child is the most intense expression of this function of childhood in fiction, a function that immobilizes the child as a symbol and precludes an idea of the child as an equal agent or subject.

40|$|The North Atlantic {{right whale}} (Eubalaena glacialis) {{is one of}} the most {{critically}} endangered whales in the world. A favorite target of whalers as early as 1000 years ago, it was considered the “right” whale to hunt because it was large, slow moving and would often float after being killed. The whale was hunted for its baleen and the oil extracted from its blubber. Pre-whaling abundance estimates are unknown but after prolonged whaling the species may have numbered as few as 85 individuals by the 19 th century. Despite international protection from whaling since 1935 the right whale has failed to recover, presently numbering fewer than 400 individuals. Surveys and assessments in the latter half of the 20 th century demonstrated that the right whale was not extinct, prompting protection in the United States and endangered status in Canada. Further studies showed that anthropogenic causes of mortality mainly from fishery entanglements and vessel collisions were inhibiting its recovery. In the U. <b>S.</b> the Right <b>Whale</b> Recovery Plan and the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan as well as ship strike reduction measures were implemented and continue to be modified. In Canada, the right whale received added protections through designation of right whale conservation areas’, “Areas to be Avoided” and Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Schemes. Recently the right whale was listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in Canada and a recovery strategy is under development...|$|R
40|$|The {{brown planthopper}} (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens {{has been one}} of the most {{important}} pests of rice in Japan since ancient times [1]. There have been numerous records of outbreaks, many covering large areas, and some causing severe famine. A brown planthopper outbreak in 1732 affected 2. 6 million persons and 12, 000 died from hunger. In 1897, 960, 000 tons of rice were lost, equivalent to a loss of 18. 5 % for all of Japan. Beginning in the 1600 ’s, rice growers added whale oil to irrigation water to kill planthoppers. In the 1890 <b>s,</b> kerosene replaced <b>whale</b> oil and in the 1950 s, the use of modern synthetic insecticides began. Improved control of planthoppers with chemical insecticides is one of the main factors resulting in the significant increase in rice yields in Japan. BPH cannot survive the winter in Japan and migrate to Japan each year from the Chinese mainland. Planthoppers must have the ability to fly continuously for at least 30 and up to 48 hours. The migrations of BPH from the Asian mainland to Japan entail over-water flights of at least 750 km, or if the migrants originate in south-east China, over 1200 km [3]. The mass immigration of planthoppers occurs every year during late June to middle July because this timing is the rainy season in Japan and planthoppers can fly to Japan on the lower jet strea...|$|R
40|$|States invoke {{cultural}} exceptions as {{justifications for}} derogating from international legal obligations. For example, some developing countries claim cultural exceptions against the international legal norm of gender equality {{for women and}} sexual minorities. International legal scholars have debated the universality of human rights, but most implicitly assume that the norm of gender equality, unlike other human rights norms, is bounded by culture. These scholars have ignored the disparate treatment of culture {{in other areas of}} international law. My article maps out the international legal discourse of cultural exceptions. It is not another argument for, or against, cultural exceptions. Rather, it explores the reason for the apparently inconsistent treatment of culture. To this end I examine the legal discourse deployed in two other cultural controversies: The European Union and Canada assert cultural exceptions against the W. T. O. rules that prohibit import barriers to U. S. publications, films and videos. Japan and Norway argue for a cultural exception to justify their rejection of the International Whaling Commission 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> ban on <b>whale</b> hunting. In both cases, the international community rejects cultural exceptions to international legal norms. I conclude that cultural exceptions to international legal norms are tolerated only when they facilitate globalization. Globalization causes popular anxieties, which threaten the political consensus for market liberalization. In my view, restrictions on women and sexual minorities represent displaced cultural anxieties. The international legal system permits this derogation from the norm in order to maintain domestic support for globalization...|$|R
40|$|The vocalization source level {{distributions}} {{and pulse}} compression gains are estimated for four distinct baleen whale {{species in the}} Gulf of Maine: fin, sei, minke and an unidentified baleen whale species. The vocalizations were received on a large-aperture densely-sampled coherent hydrophone array system useful for monitoring marine mammals over instantaneous wide areas via the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing technique. For each baleen whale species, between 125 and over 1400 measured vocalizations with significantly high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR > 10 dB) after coherent beamforming and localized with high accuracies (< 10 % localization errors) over ranges spanning roughly 1 km– 30 km {{are included in the}} analysis. The whale vocalization received pressure levels are corrected for broadband transmission losses modeled using a calibrated parabolic equation-based acoustic propagation model for a random range-dependent ocean waveguide. The whale vocalization source level distributions are characterized by the following means and standard deviations, in units of dB re 1 μ Pa at 1 m: 181. 9 ± 5. 2 for fin whale 20 -Hz pulses, 173. 5 ± 3. 2 for sei whale downsweep chirps, 177. 7 ± 5. 4 for minke whale pulse trains and 169. 6 ± 3. 5 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls. The broadband vocalization equivalent pulse-compression gains are found to be 2. 5 ± 1. 1 for fin whale 20 -Hz pulses, 24 ± 10 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls and 69 ± 23 for sei whale downsweep chirps. These pulse compression gains are found to be roughly proportional to the inter-pulse intervals of the vocalizations, which are 11 ± 5 <b>s</b> for fin <b>whale</b> 20 -Hz pulses, 29 ± 18 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls and 52 ± 33 for sei whale downsweep chirps. The source level distributions and pulse compression gains are essential for determining signal-to-noise ratios and hence detection regions for baleen whale vocalizations received passively on underwater acoustic sensing systems, as well as for assessing communication ranges in baleen whales...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{resource}} management laws mandate that Federal agencies must {{develop and implement}} plans to protect living and non-living resources. Occasionally these laws overlap in their jurisdiction of marine species, subjecting the resource in question {{to the requirements of}} more than one Federal statute. This dissertation examines the planning directives of three Federal resource laws: the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, to identify procedural and substantive conflicts between their mandates. ^ In the U. <b>S.,</b> Atlantic large <b>whale</b> protection comes under the purview of the three environmental statutes as well as the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP). This dissertation traces {{the development and implementation of}} the ALWTRP in the context of the three laws and the roll that lawsuits have played in that process. In this circumstance, the Marine Mammal Protection Act directed the planning process, while the mandates of the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act were concurrently met. ^ The dissertation also investigates the impacts of the plan on New England lobster fishermen through the use of a research questionnaire. Finally, this study examines the experiences of New England state fisheries managers throughout the development and implementation of the plan. ^ The data collected and analyzed in this dissertation reveal that the amount of lobster gear lost increased significantly following the implementation of gear modifications required by the ALWTRP. This increase was likely an unanticipated result of the gear modifications mandated by the plan. This lost gear, and the consequential increase in the number of traps deployed, raises legitimate concerns about cumulative gear impacts. ^ Importantly, the environmental assessments conducted prior to implementation of the plan did not anticipate the increase in lost gear and its replacement as a concern under the “preferred alternatives. ” The biological, economic, and social costs were not quantified; nor were the likely replacement costs adequately addressed. Given this missing component, the impact on the human environment was likely to be much greater than estimated in the environmental assessments. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} {{records of}} birds and mammals obtained at Coats Island, Northwest Territories during one visit by a National Museum of Natural Sciences expedition and fourteen visits by Canadian Wildlife Service field crews to {{the northeast corner of}} the island, as well as records obtained from the journals of the Hudson’s Bay Company post active on the island from 1920 to 1924. The terrestrial mammal fauna is very depauperate, lacking any small herbivores. Consequently, predators special-izing in small mammals—such as ermine, snowy owl, and long-tailed jaeger, all common on nearby Southampton Island—are rare or absent from Coats Island, except in passage. In addition, there are no snow goose colonies on Coats Island, although good numbers of Canada geese breed there, and some brant may also do so. This means that grazing on the island is mainly confined to the resident caribou population. The absence of small mammals and the relatively low density of geese may have accounted for the poor results of fox trapping during the period when the Hudson’s Bay Company post was operating. Numbers of most marine mammals appear to have changed little since the 1920 <b>s,</b> although bowhead <b>whales</b> may have become rarer, with only two sightings since 1981, compared to several annually in the 1920 s. Winter records from the 1920 – 24 post journals suggest that waters off Coats Island are within the wintering range of beluga, walrus, and thick-billed murres. Eighty-four species of birds have been seen since 1975; this number includes many sightings of vagrant birds well outside their normal ranges. This may be accounted for by the comparative lushness of the vegetation surrounding the thick-billed murre colony, which attracts birds from long distances.

40|$|Richard Condon Gods and Monsters Ange Lee E. Annie Proulx Brokeback Mountain Christopher Bram Father of Frankenstein {{homosexuality}} ageism Hollywood film Father of Frankenstein (1995), a {{novel by}} American author Christopher Bram, narrates the two final weeks of English film director James Whale (1889 - 1957), famous for his 1930 <b>s</b> horror pictures. <b>Whale,</b> 68, drowned himself in the swimming pool of his Californian home rather than accept his physical and mental decline {{after a series of}} strokes. Bram focuses on the imaginary friendship between the aged Whale–who had enjoyed an open, happy life as a gay man–and his much younger American gardener: the handsome, conventionally heterosexual, Clayton Boone. Their singular cross-class bonding leads Whale to recall key episodes of his past; also, to a misguided fantasy that Boone’s (supposed) violence will result in the mercy killing he desires. This fantasy is based on Whale’s muddled perception that strong Clayton is somehow connected with Frankenstein’s monster. Bram’s elegant novel was adapted for the cinema as Gods and Monsters (1998), an also elegant film directed and scripted by Richard Condon and awarded an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. British actor Ian McKellen (b. 1939), who starred as Whale, remains to this date the only gay actor nominated to an Oscar for playing a gay character. Condon’s film, which preceded by six years the main attempt to mainstream the representation of the (ageing) gay man with Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain (2005), is no doubt a quality mainstream film. Yet {{it is by no means}} as solidly placed in the general public’s imaginary as Lee’s film, nor has it received much academic attention. The moderate success of Gods and Monsters is, as I argue here, based on several factors: first, the preference of mainstream audiences for tragic romance, which benefitted very much Brokeback Mountain; second, the misreading of Bram’s story as yet another version of gay platonic desire, in the wake of Death in Venice; third, Condon’s downplaying, despite his manifest fidelity to Bram’s novel, of Clay’s rather intense struggle to accept that manliness is not unique to heterosexual men. Fourth, and most relevant, the ageism that underlies audiences’ preferences for stories involving young persons. As I argue here, both Father of Frankenstein and Gods and Monsters tell a story of universal interest about how an ageing individual reacts to the news that he will soon be dependent on others until the day he dies. The self-confident, essentially happy Whale chooses to emphasize his personal agency and, thus, to commit suicide; this is presented as a valid, rational choice, no matter how irrational his attempt to involve Clayton may seem. Bram’s story, then, focuses on an ageing gay man not only to teach a lesson about the masculinity of gay men but also about the agency of old persons. Yet, Condon’s excessive emphasis on Clayton and the audiences’ ageist avoidance of themes connected with mental and physical decline prevented Gods and Monsters from becoming a mainstream success at level similar to that of the far more melodramatic, conventionally romantic Brokeback Mountain...|$|R
40|$|Phenomena {{that occur}} only {{at very high}} {{pressures}} in the bulk phase are often observed {{to occur in the}} confined phase at normal pressures (the pressure of the bulk phase in equilibrium with the confined phase). Abundant experimental evidence suggests that adsorbates confined in nanoporous materials exhibit high pressures, such as high pressure crystal structures, high pressure chemical reactions, and the deformation of pore walls due to the adsorbate. Also molecular simulation studies of the pressure tensor for simple adsorbates in carbon nanopores of slit, cylindrical and spherical geometries show that for modest bulk phase pressures, the pressure normal to the wall is of the order of hundreds of MPa, and can be positive or negative depending on the pore size [1]. The ice structures experimentally observed in nanopores are typical for high pressures ice. We report X–ray diffraction studies of water and carbon tetrachloride adsorbed in nanoporous activated carbon fibres (ACFs) and CMK- 3 carbon mesopores of different pore sizes. The fibres are built of turbostratic nanoparticles separated by quasi twodimensional voids, forming narrow slit-shaped pores; CMK- 3 are the reverse carbon replica of silica SBA- 15 porous matrices. In order to determine the structure of water within the pores and its influence on the fibres’ structure, mean interatomic and intermolecular distances have been estimated from the positions of the maxima of the normalized angular distribution functions obtained by X-ray diffraction [1]. We observe significant changes in the interlayer distance of the carbon nanoparticles; the results suggest that very high pressures arise within the pores, about a few hundred MPa, as has been observed in molecular simulations [1, 2]. Such a results are confirmed by observation of high pressure forms of ice in cylindrical nanocarbons, using neutron and X–ray diffraction methods [3]. For water in multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN), below the pore melting point the existence of cubic ice was observed. This kind of ice structure can be obtained during re-crystallisation from high pressure phases at low temperatures for bulk water. For CMK- 3 mesopores we observe the existence of a stacking-disordered ice [4, 5], Isd. This metastable ice is neither cubic nor hexagonal, and is not a simple mixture of the two, but a combination of cubic sequences intertwined with hexagonal sequences. Moreover, the stacking disorder may vary in complexity depending on the way the ice is formed and on the prevailing thermal conditions during this process. The analysis of the kind of Isd formed in CMK- 3 of different pore size will be presented. These crystal forms, which occur in bulk water only at temperatures below 180 K in the case of cubic ice, and at pressures of hundreds or thousands MPa are stabilized by the confinement.
