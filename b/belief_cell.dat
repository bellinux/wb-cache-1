40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} face the {{challenge}} of maintaining tissue homeostasis by self-renewal while maintaining their proliferation potential over the lifetime of an organism. Continuous proliferation can cause genotoxic/metabolic stress that can compromise the genomic integrity of stem cells. To prevent stem cell exhaustion, highly proliferative adult tissues maintain a pool of quiescent stem cells that divide only in response to injury and thus remain protected from genotoxic stress. Hydra is a remarkable organism with highly proliferative stem cells and ability to regenerate at whole animal level. Intriguingly, hydra does not display consequences of high proliferation, such as senescence or tumour formation. In this study, we investigate if hydra harbours a pool of slow-cycling stem cells that could help prevent undesirable consequences of continuous proliferation. Hydra were pulsed with the thymidine analogue 5 -ethynyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and then chased in the absence of EdU to monitor the presence of EdU-retaining cells. A significant number of undifferentiated cells of all three lineages in hydra retained EdU for about 8 – 10 cell cycles, indicating that these cells did not enter cell cycle. These label-retaining cells were resistant to hydroxyurea treatment and were predominantly in the G 2 phase of cell cycle. Most significantly, similar to mammalian quiescent stem cells, these cells rapidly entered cell division during head regeneration. This study shows for the first time that, contrary to current <b>beliefs,</b> <b>cells</b> in hydra display heterogeneity in their cell cycle potential and the slow-cycling cells in this population enter cell cycle during head regeneration. These results suggest an early evolution of slow-cycling stem cells in multicellular animals...|$|R

30|$|The {{tricarboxylic acid}} (TCA) cycle {{is a central}} hub for energy {{metabolism}} and macromolecule synthesis and redox balance. The cycle is composed {{of a series of}} biochemical reactions occurring in the mitochondrial matrix, which allow aerobic organisms to oxidize fuel sources and provide energy, macromolecules, and redox balance to the cell.

Genetic diseases with compromised TCA cycle function due to inherited cycle enzyme mutations, such as fumarase (FH) deficiency, are rare but severe (Rustin et al., 1997). Moreover, several TCA cycle enzymes are deregulated in obesity, including citrate synthase, which exhibits reduced activity in obese mice (Cummins et al., 2014). Multiple neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease are associated with reduced activity of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) (Gibson et al., 2010).

5000|$|What {{she and her}} {{students}} discovered overturned accepted <b>beliefs</b> about bacterial <b>cell</b> biology. In each cell cycle, Caulobacter divides asymmetrically into two daughters. One, the swarmer cell, has a tail-like flagellum that helps it swim; the other daughter has a stalk which anchors it to a surface. Swarmer cells become stalked cells after {{a short period of}} motility. Chromosome replication and cell division only occur in stalked cells. Rather than containing an evenly dispersed mixture of proteins, the single celled Caulobacter resembles a highly organized factory, with specific [...] "machinery" [...] regulating each step in the cell cycle to ensure that changes occur at developmentally appropriate times. DNA is copied once per cycle by a particular group of molecules. Once a single DNA copy is placed in each half of the cell, other mechanisms constricts the cell’s middle to separate it into two daughters. Shapiro was the first researcher to show that bacterial DNA replication occurs in a spatially organized way and that cell division is dependent on this spatial organization.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{capability}} of cyanobacteria to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates offers a promising carbon-neutral energy solution. Unfortunately, the lifespan of cyanobacteria based photoelectrochemical cells is poor because discharge current drops to zero within days. The primary factor that limits lifespan {{was believed to}} be the toxicity of an artificial mediator that extracts electrons from cyanoacteria to electrode. It is critical to experimentally identify the true limiting factor such that we could prolong the lifespan for practical use. RESULTS: Systematic tests on cell physiology and current discharge were performed in autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Contrary to previous <b>belief,</b> results for <b>cell</b> viability, chlorophyll content and growth curve of Cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6714 under continuous vitamin K(3) -mediated current discharge did not exhibit any toxic effect. The role of glucose was then investigated. Surprisingly, discharge current dropped to zero although there was significant intracellular glycogen (2. 5 x 10 (- 10) mg cell(- 1)). Further tests of current response to the addition of exogenous glucose suggest the regulatory role of glucose on cyanobacterial metabolism that is relevant to current generation. Furthermore, current generation in the light and dark conditions corroborates glucose as energy reserve. CONCLUSION: It is not mediator toxicity but the regulatory effect of glucose on the metabolism of cyanobacteria that limits the lifespan for current generation. Glucose functions in a dual role as energy reserve and regulatory molecule to modulate cyanobacterial metabolism related to current generation. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R

However, at the present time, considerable controversy exists concerning the precise phenotype of the effector cells that are the proximate causes of inflammation and tissue destruction. In transplantation immunity, the assumption of a decade ago [...] that cytotoxic T lymphocytes, predominately of the Lyt- 1 - 23 + type, are the mediators of acute allograft rejection-has been strongly challenged by recent data identifying the T cell subpopulation that mediates delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (TD-rn, Lyt-l+ 23 -) as an equally (if not more so) important participant in specific graft destruction (1, 2). Similarly, the general <b>belief</b> that TDTH <b>cells</b> mediate contact hypersensitivity (3) has been challenged by Tagart (4) and more recently by Sunday and Dorf (5), who have demonstrated a role for cytotoxic T cells in the deve!opment of CH reactions in the skin.

Despite the general <b>belief</b> that endothelial <b>cells</b> are the primary target of Stx, there is evidence that proximal tubules may be a site of toxin action. We hypothesized that cultured proximal tubular cells are sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of Stx. MethodsCultured human proximal tubular cells were exposed to Stx- 1 in the presence and absence of a variety of inflammatory factors likely to be elevated in the kidney or serum of patients with D+HUS. Cell survival, protein synthesis, total cell levels and synthesis of Stx receptors (GB 3), and Stx binding were measured. ResultsProximal tubules were extremely sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of Stx- 1 with an LD 50 at least equal to, if not less than, that seen with Vero cells. Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and butyrate (but not tumor necrosis factor or interleukin- 6) up-regulated proximal tubule sensitivity to Stx- 1. IL- 1 increased Stx- 1 binding, but did not alter total cell levels or synthesis of GB 3, the glycosphingolipid receptor for Stx- 1. In contrast, LPS and butyrate, despite increasing Stx- 1 sensitivity, had no effect on Stx- 1 binding. ConclusionsThese studies indicate that proximal tubules are exquisitely sensitive to Stx- 1 cytotoxicity and that inflammatory factors can increase toxin responsiveness through a variety of mechanisms.

This may {{be a result of}} simplistic modeling of cellular activity. Furthermore, phenomenological models are limited when considering the effects of combined physical and biological interventions. In this study, a new model of cell and tissue differentiation, using a more mechanistic approach, is presented and applied to fracture repair. The model directly couples cellular mechanisms to mechanical stimulation during bone healing and is based on the <b>belief</b> that the <b>cells</b> act as transducers during tissue regeneration. In the model, the cells within the matrix proliferate, differentiate, migrate, and produce extracellular matrix, all at cell-phenotype specific rates, based on the mechanical stimulation they experience. The model is assembled from coupled partial differentiation equations, which are solved using a newly developed finite element formulation. The evolution of four cell types, i. e. mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and the production of extracellular matrices of fibrous tissue, cartilage and bone are calculated. The material properties of the tissues are iteratively updated based on actual amounts of extracellular matrix in material elements at progressive time points. A two-dimensional finite element model of a long bone osteotomy was used to evaluate the model's potential. The additional value of the presented model and the importance of including cell-phenotype specific activities when modeling tissue differentiation and bone healing, were demonstrated by comparing the predictions with phenomenological models. The model's capacity was established by showing that it can correctly predict several aspects of bone healing, including cell and tissue distributions during normal fracture healing.

40|$|The general <b>belief</b> that uniform <b>cells</b> under uniform {{conditions}} will all multiply {{at the same}} moment implies that the smallest units of the chromosomes, i. e., either the genes or the molecules of which the genes are composed, all double at exactly the same moment in all cells. Since the doubling of chromosomes is a synthetic chemical process, it seems more probable that it would follow chemical laws. With the assumption that the corresponding molecules in a number of uniform cells obey the mass law in their process of doubling, a definite order in the multiplication of identical cells is established which can be formulated mathematically for the simplest case. This is the same assumption which the author has used to account for the differences in the order of death between bacteria and higher organisms. This theory demands a great variability of the growth rate of uniform cells, so great that it must be experimentally measurable even for cells with a million molecules to the chromosome. The theory demands further that the frequency curve of cell divisions plotted for successive time intervals, be skewed to the left, and that the relative range of variation become smaller as the number of genes or gene-type molecules increases. Experiments on the growth rate of Bacterium aerogenes and Saccharomyces ellipsoideus showed regularly a frequency curve skewed to the left. The yeast had a relatively narrower range of variability than the bacterium. Even with multicellular organisms, theoretical calculations show a range of variation of the growth rate from the egg cell which should still be measurable though it decreases relatively with the number of cells produced. An experiment on the size of bacteria colonies at different ages of development agreed with the theory...|$|R

There are three main components in tissue engineering, scaffolds, cells and signalling mechanisms {{that make up the}} tissue engineering triad. This thesis focuses on the interplay between cell behaviour and scaffold structural properties. Recent studies from our laboratory have developed novel freeze-drying techniques to vary the structure of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) scaffolds producing scaffolds with mean pores ranging from 85 pm - 325 pm (Haugh et a/, 2010). The general aim of this thesis was to investigate, using this range of scaffolds, the effect of mean pore size on cell behaviour in the scaffolds and see how this behaviour varies with different cell types. A non-linear effect was seen on initial cell attachment but ultimately scaffolds with the largest pores size of 325 pm facilitated optimal osteoblast attachment, proliferation and migration. A comparison of stem cell (MSC) behaviour to semi-differentiated osteoblasts in the scaffolds demonstrated a similar non-linear effect on cell attachment but poorer MSC migration was observed highlighting the difference in cell type behaviour. Further analysis shed some light on this effect whereby MSCs were physically bigger cells and less motile. Longer term studies were carried out to determine the effect of mean pore size on osteoblast differentiation, matrix mineralisation and cell-mediated contraction. The largest scaffold mean pore size of 325 pm facilitated improved cell distribution, an earlier onset of osteogenic differentiation and a higher level of mineralisation. The final study of this thesis investigated the potential of human amniotic fluid derived stem cells as a readily accessible source of pluripotent stem cells (AFSCs). These cells demonstrated osteogenic differentiation and an ability to attach to the collagen-GAG scaffold. In conclusion, mean pore size was shown to have an effect on cell behaviour in collagen-GAG scaffolds. Ultimately the larger pores of 325 pm facilitate optimal cell attachment, migration, osteogenic differentiation, matrix mineralisation and cellmediated contraction. In addition, the osteogenic potential of a readily accessible source of pluripotent stem cells has demonstrated their future potential in bone tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a common}} <b>belief</b> that {{mammalian}} <b>cell</b> gene mutation assays are prone to false positives, thus questioning the relevance of these tests in regulatory screening paradigms and the mechanisms responsible for these uninterruptable results. False positives can lead to unnecessary animal testing and delays {{in the development of}} efficacious new medicines. The initial aim of this thesis was to put into perspective the rate of positives and firstly to consider the extent off target aneugenicity (chromosome loss or gain) may contribute to this rate. Secondly the contribution of topoisomerase II poisoning and its relationship to genotoxicity was considered. Topoisomerase II maintains DNA topology by inducing transient breaks in one strand so a second strand can pass. Chemicals that interact with the enzyme (topoisomerase II poisons; e. g. the antibiotic gemifloxacin and the chemotherapeutin etoposide), yield topoisomerase II bound DNA cleavage complexes, making breaks permanent, leading to mutation or cell death. Structurally, topoisomerase II poisons are diverse, so their genotoxicity is difficult to predict. To estimate the incidence of positives seen in pharmaceutical research, a retrospective review of data from 10 years of mouse lymphoma assays (MLA) conducted at AstraZeneca was undertaken. This showed that the rate of unexplainable positives was only 5 %, vindicating the use of the test in screening paradigms. Consideration was then made of what mechanisms might contribute to this 5 %. Aneugenicity was considered but it was shown that the MLA was a poor screen, failing to identify 7 known anuegens. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the relationship between topoisomerase II and genotoxicity, assays to assess enzyme poisoning were examined, including the ability of the cell free decatenation assay to predict the results of the in vitro micronucleus test. However, even when combined with an estimate of cellular uptake the predictivity was low. Assays to investigate topoisomerase II poison / DNA cleavage complexes in vivo were then investigated. The TARDIS and ICE assays both use antibodies to target topoisomerase II bound in the complex. TARDIS was found to be insensitive, failing to identify cleavage complex formation with gemifloxacin. Using the ICE assay, cleavage complex formation was seen for etoposide (0. 1 μmol/L; FITC intensity 3. 53 ± 0. 79) and gemifloxacin (100 μmol/L; FITC intensity 3. 37 ± 0. 86), but not at equivalent concentrations to those inducing micronuclei (MN) (0. 03 μmol/L etoposide; MN/ 1000 6 ± 2. 6 and 10 μmol/L gemifloxacin; MN/ 1000 5 ± 3. 4), thus questioning assay sensitivity, or suggesting a role for other mechanisms of genotoxicity e. g. reactive oxygen species (ROS). The hOGG Comet assay showed that neither etoposide nor gemifloxacin induced ROS related genotoxicity. Improvements to the sensitivity of the cleavage complex assays were made by preparation of mouse specific antibodies, but TARDIS was still unable to identify gemifloxacin. This work also suggested that when developing antibodies for DNA bound topoisomerase II, the n-terminus of the enzyme should be targeted. Over the last 4 years, emerging data linked the topoisomerase IIβ isoform to genotoxicity. As research within this thesis had investigated the activity of topoisomerase IIα, this may have explained the difficulty encountered equating topoisomerase II poisoning to genotoxicity. Following siRNA knockdown of topoisomerase IIα, the genotoxicity of etoposide and gemifloxacin was investigated. It was shown that for 0. 3 μmol/L etoposide, topoisomerase IIα knockdown of 42 % (± 2 %) was associated with a reduction in micronuclei of 49 % (± 9. 7 %). For 30 μmol/L gemifloxacin, topoisomerase IIα knockdown of 37 % (± 9. 5 %) was associated with a reduction in micronuclei of 48 % (± 0. 2 %). This was the first time such direct relationships had been demonstrated between the alpha isoform and genotoxicity. In conclusion, the predictivity of the MLA was confirmed but it was clear the assay is not a suitable screen for aneugenicity. The relative sensitivity of assays to measure topoisomerase II poisoning was shown and linked to genotoxicity. Whilst it was not possible to demonstrate cleavage complex formation at concentrations below which genotoxicity was seen, this was likely due to the insensitivity of the assays used rather than topoisomerase II poisons having other genotoxic mechanisms. For the first time the link between topoisomerase IIα and genotoxicity was confirmed and use of knockdown cells holds real promise as a tool for investigating off target topoisomerase II poisoning...|$|R
