5|$|According to tradition, {{the mosque}} {{stands on the}} site of the Philistine temple {{dedicated}} to Dagon—the god of fertility—which Samson toppled in the Book of Judges. Later, a temple dedicated to Marnas—god of rain and grain—was erected. Local legend today claims that Samson is <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> present mosque.|$|E
5|$|Other lesser known claimants were Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva and Eugenia Smith. Two {{young women}} {{claiming}} to be Anastasia and her sister Maria were taken in by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964.

5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. <b>Buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{population}} density of ectotherms is often confounded by individual activity levels, which are {{highly dependent on}} ambient climatic conditions. In this study we used radio-telemetry and streamside surveys to examine the influence of local climatic conditions on individual activity levels (detectability) and streamside density of a population of endangered giant barred frog (Mixophyes iteratus) along the Coomera river in south-east Queensland. Temperature {{was the most important}} climatic variable influencing the behaviour and hence detectability of M. iteratus. The results indicated that males <b>bury</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter during cold conditions (< 18 é so fewer were detected during surveys. Although females were also found to <b>bury</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter in cold weather, no significant relationship between exposure and streamside density was detected. This is likely to be due to the lower number of females detected during surveys. The streamside density of juveniles was significantly related to temperature and rainfall, but little {{of the variance in the}} data was explained by climatic conditions, despite greater numbers of juveniles being found than adults. These results indicate that, for increased efficiency, surveys of Mixophyes iteratus should be undertaken when temperatures exceed 18 îNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; {{the ruins}} visible today are principally {{those of the}} third rebuild. The site was {{occupied}} in Anglo-Saxon times {{by at least one}} structure, possibly a timber-framed church or boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon potsherds and an 8th-century coin have been found <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> remains of the priory's west nave. The site was abandoned at some point {{and by the time the}} priory was built the land on which it stood was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as a graveyard in the early 12th century and an early Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived {{in one corner of the}} keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E

50|$|The sankai {{is known}} as a kekkai (血塊, ケッカイ) in Saitama Prefecture and Kanagawa Prefecture, and kekke (ケッケ) in Nagano Prefecture. Legends about its outer {{appearance}} are sparse, however it is said to look like cattle and is said to be hairy. Kekkai is also said to <b>bury</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> house to kill its mother. In Urawa, a practice existed of surrounding the bottom of a house with byōbu during childbirth to prevent this maneuver. It is theorized that the etymology may derive from kekkai (結界), meaning an area restricted for religious reasons.|$|R
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy, {{now in the}} hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as Henry II in 1154. She settled her court near Rouen and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on Henry's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the Becket controversy. She worked extensively with the Church, founding Cistercian monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> high altar at Bec Abbey after her death in 1167.|$|E
5|$|The Pink Structure (Estructura Rosada in Spanish) {{was built}} as a low {{platform}} during {{the first part of}} the Middle Preclassic, at a time when the city was producing Olmec-style sculpture and La Venta was flourishing on the Gulf coast of Mexico (c.800–700 BC). During the latter part of the Middle Preclassic (c.700–400 BC), the Pink Structure was <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> first version of the enormous Structure 7. It was at this time that the use of Olmec ceremonial structures was discontinued and Olmec sculpture was destroyed, signalling an intermediate period prior to the beginning of the city's Early Maya phase. The transition between the two phases was a gradual one, without abrupt changes.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the research station, Joanna agrees {{to work with}} the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne. Daniel Carrington contacts her and explains that Zeigler had been working on an algorithm capable of decoding extraterrestrial glyphs at a dig site in South America. Traveling to Peru, Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient artefact which acts as a power-source for the Graal, a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers. Joanna plants a tracking device onto the artefact before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship. The dropship takes her to Africa, where Zhang Li has located the Graal <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> African sands. The Carrington Institute plans an offensive on dataDyne forces with the battle taking place on a large bridge. Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father's death by killing Mei Hem. Joanna infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li, who dispatches Sekhar after using the Graal. Despite the advantage, Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle. Daniel Carrington commends her efforts, informing her that she did “Perfect”.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E

5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E
5|$|Mariano {{was told}} that this refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is <b>buried</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> floor of the nave. A stone bench runs around the base of the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E
