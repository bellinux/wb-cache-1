40|$|X-ray {{transmission}} {{windows for}} the low energy range, especially between 0. 1 keV and 1 keV have been designed and fabricated based on graphenic carbon (GC) with an integrated silicon frame. A hexagonal and a <b>bar</b> <b>grid</b> support structure design have been evaluated. The <b>bar</b> <b>grid</b> design allows to substitute polymer-based windows with the advantages of higher transmission, better rejection of visible light and vacuum operability of the encapsulated silicon drift detectors (SDD). In addition, the high mechanical resilience of graphenic carbon is demonstrated by pressure cycle tests, yielding over 10 million cycles without damage. The data are complemented by bulge tests to determine a Young`s modulus for graphenic carbon of approximately 130 GPa. Additional finite-element simulation and Raman studies reveal that the mechanical stress is not homogeneously distributed, but reaches a maximum near the anchoring points of the free standing graphenic carbon membrane.

Data {{were obtained for}} a set of four exit Reynolds numbers comprised of the design point of 628, 000, - 20 %, + 20 %, and + 40 %. Three ideal exit pressure ratios were examined including the design point of 1. 378, - 10 %, and + 10 %. Inlet incidence angles of 0 deg and +/- 2 deg were also examined. Measurements were made in a linear cascade with highly three-dimensional blade passage flows that resulted from the high flow turning and thick inlet boundary layers. Inlet turbulence was generated with a blown square <b>bar</b> <b>grid.</b> The purpose of the work is the extension of three-dimensional predictive modeling capability for airfoil external {{heat transfer}} to engine specific conditions including blade shape, Reynolds numbers, and Mach numbers. Data were obtained by a steady-state technique using a thin-foil heater wrapped around a low thermal conductivity blade. Surface temperatures were measured using calibrated liquid crystals.

40|$|Detour {{behaviour}} is {{the ability}} of an animal to reach a goal stimulus by moving round any interposed obstacle. It has been widely studied and has been proposed as a test of insight learning in several species of mammals, but few data are available in birds. A comparative study in three species of birds, belonging to different eco-ethological niches, allows {{a better understanding of the}} cognitive mechanism of such detour behaviour. Young quails (Coturnix sp.), herring gulls (Larus cachinnans) and canaries (Serinus canaria), 1 month old, 10 - 25 days old and 4 - 6 months old, respectively, were tested in a detour situation requiring them to abandon a clear view of a biologically interesting object (their own reflection in a mirror) in order to approach that object. Birds were placed in a closed corridor, at one end of which was a barrier through which the object was visible. Four different types of barrier were used: vertical bar, horizontal <b>bar,</b> <b>grid</b> and transparent. Two symmetrical apertures placed midline in the corridor allowed the birds to adopt routes passing around the barrier. After entering the apertures, birds could turn either right or left to re-establish social contact with the object in the absence of any local sensory cues emanating from it. Quails appeared able to solve the task, though their performance depended on the type of barrier used, which appeared to modulate their relative interest in approaching the object or in exploring the surroundings. Young herring gulls also showed excellent abilities to locate spatially the out-of-view object, except when the transparent barrier was used. Canaries, on the other hand, appeared completely unable to solve the detour task, whatever barrier was in use. It is suggested that these species differences can be accounted for in terms of adaptation to a terrestrial or aerial environment. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Solar cells used in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) crystalline silicon modules commonly feature {{grid fingers}} and bus bars as front contacts.

In the second technology, the bus wires are coated with a diffuse reflective coating. The sunlight is diffusely reflected at this coating.

40|$|A novel macro-model for the {{analysis}} of masonry shear walls reinforced with steel <b>bar</b> <b>grids</b> is presented. The model is based on the so-called disturbed state concept (DSC), with a modiﬁed hierarchical single yield surface (HISS-CT) plasticity model accounting for a distinct behavior in tension and compression. The effect induced by the introduction of different reinforcement ratios is discussed, in terms of increase of both failure load and ductility. With reference to a quasi-square shear wall, an optimal reinforcement ratio is evaluated by means of the numerical model proposed and subsequently compared with recommendations provided by the Canadian masonry design standard. The comparison shows how minimum values proposed by Canadian standard are suboptimal and hence not totally suitable to obtain a proper increase of the seismic performance of shear walls in high seismicity region. A second example, relying into a shear panel with eccentric openings and subjected to horizontal loads, is analyzed in detail. It is assumed to strengthen the structure by means of a light and a heavy reinforcement, to deeply investigate the role played by steel bars in masonry seismic upgrading. A new explicit formula is ﬁnally presented, useful to provide a quick estimation of the load carrying capacity of reinforced masonry, to be eventually used in common design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Stents are medical implants, {{which are}} applied to keep {{cavities}} {{in the human body}} open, e. g. blood vessels. Typically they consist of tube-like grids of suitable metal alloys. Typical dimensions depend on their applications: outer diameters in the mm-range and <b>grid</b> <b>bar</b> thickness in the 100 µm range. Before implantation, stents are compressed (crimped) to allow implantation in the human body. During implantation, stents are expanded, usually by balloon catheters. Crimping as well as expansion causes high strains and high stresses locally in the <b>grid</b> <b>bars.</b> These strains and stresses are important design criteria of stents. Usually, they are calculated numerically by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The XRD-sinψ-technique is applied for in-situ-determination of stress conditions during crimping and expansion of stents of the CoCr-alloy L- 605. This provides a realistic characterization of the near-surface stress state and an evaluation of the numerical FEA results. XRD-results show an increasing compressive load stress in circumferential direction with increasing stent expansion. These findings correlate with the numerical FEA results. Further residual stresses after removing the expansion device have been measured...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} twofold: first, to {{determine}} if a length scale existed that would cause the greatest augmentation in stagnation region heat transfer for a given turbulence intensity and second, to develop a prediction tool for stagnation heat transfer in the presence of free stream turbulence. Toward this end, a model with a circular leading edge was fabricated with heat transfer gages in the stagnation region. The model was qualified in a low turbulence wind tunnel by comparing measurements with Frossling's solution for stagnation region heat transfer in a laminar free stream. Five turbulence generating grids were fabricated; four were square mesh, biplane grids made from square bars. Each had identical mesh to bar width ratio but different bar widths. The fifth grid was an array of fine parallel wires that were perpendicular to the axis of the cylindrical leading edge. Turbulence intensity and integral length scale were measured as a function of distance from the grids. Stagnation region heat transfer was measured at various distances downstream of each grid. Data were taken at cylinder Reynolds numbers ranging from 42, 000 to 193, 000. Turbulence intensities were in the range 1. 1 to 15. 9 percent while the ratio of integral length scale to cylinder diameter ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 30. Stagnation region heat transfer augmentation increased with decreasing length scale. An optimum scale was not found. A correlation was developed that fit heat transfer data for the square <b>bar</b> <b>grids</b> to within + 4 percent. The data from the array of wires were not predicted by the correlation; augmentation was higher for this case indicating that the degree of isotropy in the turbulent flow field has a large effect on stagnation heat transfer.

Experimental results obtained from cycling 40 Ah VRLA batteries revealed an increase in corrosion layer thickness on the sides of the <b>grid</b> <b>bars</b> compared to the top and bottom. It is suggested that the areas of increased corrosion layer thickness corresponded to the areas of high current density {{on the surface of the}} grid. In order to investigate this observation the finite element package ANSYS was used to produce qualitative estimates of the values in current density, which would be expected on the tested grid design. Results suggest that corrosion layer thickening is related to current density. The model was then used to predict the expected current distribution around a number of hypothetical electrode designs. These incorporated changes in both <b>grid</b> <b>bar</b> cross-section and positive active material.
