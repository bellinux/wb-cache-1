40|$|We have {{conducted}} airborne measurements over the Greenland ice sheet from the NASA P- 3 B aircraft using a 150 MHz coherent radar depth sounder to obtain extensive ice sheet thickness measurements. Simultaneous measurements of ice sheet elevation were also made using a laser altimeter. In outlet glacier areas along the ice sheet margin, the ice surface {{is characterized by}} a very rough, crevassed surface near the calving front. The rough ice surface generates signal clutter, which can mask the <b>bottom</b> <b>echo.</b> We are developing a technique to remove the surface clutter component from the signal to reveal the <b>bottom</b> <b>echo,</b> providing a complete ice thickness survey to the calving front of outlet glaciers. This technique makes use of a dense array of ice surface elevation measurements provided by the laser altimeter to characterize surface roughness. Surface roughness parameters are then used in a backscatter model to characterize the clutter waveform, which can be subsequently removed from the radar signal...|$|E

Data used in this presentation were collected in the South East continental shelf of Australia from July to mid December 1996 and in the North West Shelf region of Western Australia between late July and mid August 1995, 1997. Acoustic data were collected by using a stand-alone EK 500 SIMRAD scientific echosounder operating three different frequencies; 12, 38 and 120 kHz. Multiple echo energies were analysed using multivariate statistical tools to classify bottom features. The logarithm of the integration of the tail of the first <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> was used as a roughness index and the entire second <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> was used as a hardness index.

40|$|When we {{diagnose}} {{the structural}} integrity of a steel member in service and evaluate its remaining life time, {{we need to}} improve analyzing method to get the accurate information of a internal defect of a member. And by the recent demand for high level quality control of welding of steel joint the accuracy improvement of defect detection in the image display became essential in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) [l][2][3]. So far the defect informaUon obtained by an ultrasonic test is displayed in several ways and A-scan and B-scan display's are commonly used in a field inspection and C-scan display is used in laboratory test of the steel structural member [4][5]. In this study we made {{the different types of}} artificial small defects by drilled hole in a steel plate specimen to observe by an ultrasonic scanning pulse echo test[6]. The artificial drilled holes with diameter 1 mrn and 2 mrn are made with different lengths and inclinations and the graphic images are compared among these cases. 3 D images of these defect are obtained by a graphic software[7] on a workstation by using the maximum amplitude data of boundary and <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> and time of flight data by which we find from where the incident wave returned back.

40|$|Features of {{manufacturing}} process {{and use of}} carbon fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) define specific types of only their defects. Furthermore, the CFRP structure material and its properties considerably {{differ from those of}} the metal materials. Therefore, a relevant task is to conduct research to justify the selection of the ultrasonic testing parameters of these materials. Optimal parameters and recommendations on quality control of such materials were grounded in the course of experimental studies on samples made from the UTR 1000 - 12 - 400 P carbon fabric, based on the T 700 GC- 12 K yarn and the T- 31 epoxy binder, filled with artificial defects to imitate the bundles of different size and the impact damage. It is shown that with increasing frequency of the ultrasonic oscillation propagating in the samples there is an increase both in damping and in SNR for artificial defects. In other words, on the one hand, the lower is the oscillation frequency, the less is a damping effect, but, on the other one, the higher is the frequency, the higher is the sensitivity control. It was found that the optimum frequencies for the ultrasonic test of CFRP are those in the vicinity of 5 MHz. Furthermore, to detect the small-sized defects it is advised to use an ultrasonic beam focus, which can be achieved using phased arrays. The most optimal method of ultrasonic testing to search for impact damage is a mirrorshadow method, which is based on the measurement of the amplitude of the <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> signal. It is shown that the amplitude of the <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> signal in defect-free zone is, in average, 14 dB higher than in the area with shock damage. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This work {{consists}} in characterizing the sedimentary {{distribution of the}} South Shetland Islands continental margin, Bransfield Strait, Antarctica, through the interpretation and correlation of high-resolution seismic profiles and geological samples. The analysis of echo-characters, seismic amplitudes and their correlation with the collected samples, revealed five different echo types. Echo types I and II have good seismic resolution and are characterized by continuous sharp <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> with subparallel reflections. Echoes III and IV are characterized by diffuse and very prolonged <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> with no subbottom reflectors. Echo V is associated with glacial deposits on the upper slope in response to deglaciation and transport of coarse grains in a muddy matrix and is characterized by diffraction hyperbolae. The echo-characters showed good correlation with geological samples collected along the Bransfield Strait and bays of the King George Island, but the correlation with the seismic amplitude map was not as obvious. Echo I shows medium-high amplitudes and samples within its area of occurrence (AM- 02 and AM- 14) indicate silty sand and sandy silt, respectively. Echo II presents the lowest seismic amplitudes and the sample collected within its area (AM- 17) shows approximately 90 % mud content. Echoes III and IV, located on the shallowest portions of South Shetland’s continental margin, demonstrate medium-low amplitude values, and are related to sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of a seafloor map derived from multibeam swath bathymetry depends {{first and foremost}} {{on the quality of}} the bottom detection process that yields estimates of the arrival time and angle of <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> received in each beam. Filtering of each beam with a fixed bandwidth filter, with the bandwidth based on the length of the transmitted pulse, reduces the error associated with the time-angle estimates. However, filters of this type can not be optimal over the wide range of operational environments encountered. Better results are obtained with a processing scheme that varies the filter bandwidth across the swath width using detected time and angle information from the previous ping. This method is evaluated using sonar data obtained with a Reson SeaBat 8111 ER and the results compared with those obtained using a fixed bandwidth filter...|$|R

This hypothesis is tested by devising an inversion algorithm based on the re-reflection idea, to determine suspended sediment concentration and comparing to results from multifrequency and optical backscatter results. A theoretical analysis of the problem and the outcome of subsequent data inversion are presented. Unlike currently used methods, factors such as beam directivity, system constant, and the sediment backscattering form factor are absent from the equation used to determine suspended sediment concentrations. It is concluded that the bottom reflection plays a key role in the formation of the acoustic mirror image...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the seafloor characterisation based on multibeam sonar data. It relies on using the integrated model and description of {{three types of}} multibeam data obtained during seafloor sensing: 1) the grey-level sonar images (echograms) of seabed, 2) the 3 D model of the seabed surface which consists of bathymetric data, 3) the set of time domain <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> envelopes received in the consecutive sonar beams. The classification is performed by utilisation of several statistical methods applied for analysis {{of a set of}} seafloor descriptors derived from multibeam data. In the paper, the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) for reduction of the seafloor parameter space dimension is presented along with the obtained results. In addition, the use of the open source World Wind Java SDK tool for implementation of imaging and mapping of seafloor multibeam data, integrated with other elements of a scene and overlaid on rich background data, is also shown...|$|E
40|$|Application of 3 D imaging {{has been}} finding {{its place in}} many fields of marine science and {{technology}} {{and it has become}} almost indispensable tool in such areas like hydrography, marine navigation, seafloor mapping and characterization, marine GIS, ECDIS etc. Contemporary seabed mapping/imaging systems employing processed <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> records, acquired by a multibeam sonar, can map the bottom with the meter resolution. However, despite these advantages, even after employing data preprocessing, the method results in the excessive amount of data and the warehouse of petabytes. To address the problem of a compact representation of the huge amount of these raw data and an accurate seabed surface reconstruction from the multibeam sonar records, the paper proposes the data reduction algorithms developed for this purpose. The first one represents the smoothing procedure using B-spline surface obtained from a set of bathymetric 3 D data retrieved from the sonar echoes. Whereas, the second one transforms the echo records to the discrete wavelet coefficients domain, and subsequently uses the wavelet shrinkage theory. The second stage in both methods consists of decimation procedure, which reduces the number of polygons in the mesh, while maintaining the sufficient resolution and accuracy of the reconstructed seabed surfaces. Both investigated methods seems to be quite promising tools for significant data reduction and compact representation of seabed 3 D images retrieved from the sonar echoes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, low-frequency active sonar (LFAS) {{emerged as one of}} the most {{efficient}} tools for shallow-water antisubmarine warfare (ASW). Like any long-range active sonar system, LFAS produces a large amount of unwanted sea <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> or clutter. These echoes give way to false alarms that increase the computational load of target trackers and delay the correct classification of each echo. The number of false alarms due to clutter can be reduced either through echo classification techniques or through Doppler filtering provided the targets of interest have a nonzero radial velocity. Much research has been carried out on waveform investigation for the efficient use of bandwidth capabilities of modern sonar transmitters. Among the quantity of waveforms, binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) pulses have emerged as exhibiting cross-correlation properties relevant to Doppler filtering while maintaining a range resolution comparable to frequency-modulated (FM) pulses. In this paper, we have successfully applied a false-alarm reduction technique using contacts obtained with an FM pulse subsequently processed by Doppler filtering with a BPSK pulse. The Doppler filtering performance for this pulse is evaluated on an experimental data set and a few limitations of BPSK are identified...|$|R

40|$|There are {{particular}} diYculties {{in making}} acoustic {{estimates of the}} abundance of demersal and semi-demersal fish. One possibility which exists in any survey situation is that the fish may move from the direct path of the vessel because of the noise it is radiating. However, the problems addressed here are primarily due to the physical characteristics of the transmitted acoustic pulse from the echo-sounder and its interaction with fish close to the seabed. This paper looks at the factors controlling the detection of these fish {{in terms of the}} acoustic sampling volumes near the bottom, the discrimination theoretically possible between fish and seabed echoes and the ‘‘depth anomaly’’. The acoustic deadzone is defined and its volume is determined. Practical aspects of signal processing in this near seabed situation are then described, including seabed recognition and safeguarding fish signals from contamination by the <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> and from noise. Next, an echo-integrator deadzone comprising the acoustic deadzone, the backstep zone, and the partial integration zone (related to pulse length) is described and defined. Equations for calculating the eVective volume or eVective height of this deadzone are developed. Estimation errors due to the echo-integrator deadzone are investigated and equations derived for the necessary corrections. An example is shown of partial failure of the bottom recognition system and how the echo integrator result can be corrected to compensate...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of acoustic methods for {{the classification of}} bottomhabitats is based mostly on the analysis of measured parameters without relating them to the bathymetric structure. Geological complexity and biological patterns {{are closely related to}} bathymetry. This paper presents a new approach to the acoustic classification of bottom habitats in that it combinesthe distribution of a selected acoustic parameter with its bathymetric structure. The hypothetical effective angle of a <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> θ'/ 2,corresponding to its normalised length, was the acoustic parameter applied. This parameter broadly characterises the complex acoustic reflecting and scattering properties of the seabed. Its highest values correspond to a layered bottom consisting of soft sediment. The southern Baltic area was classified by a direct comparison of two factors measured acoustically:the statistical distribution of θ'/ 2, andthe correlated depth structure within selected standardregular geographical areas (15 ' latitude and 30 ' longitude) which the total area was divided into. The area size was matched with the density of the measurements collected. The same factors were also estimated for the whole southern Baltic. The study was based on soundings collected on board r/v "Baltica"during regular acoustic surveys in 1995 - 2003.

By the help of the simulations, all mode conversions at the crack and rail surfaces were cleared up leading to a better understanding and inerpretation of the recieved signals. A significant attenuation of the rail <b>bottom</b> <b>echo</b> for the three different crack locations were found for both, shear and longitudinal waves. The most important difference between the two wave modes is the fact the interaction between primary shear wavefront and crack or rail surfaces does not produce new echoes in the A-scan like head-waves or secondary echoes as descriebed for the P-wave. It should be mentioned that the method using piezoelectric shear wave transducers is unpracticable for fast testing of resl rails in railway tracks due to coupling-problems. But this can be solved bhy using EMA-transducers. Further investigations should i nvolve more realistic crack geometries and various crack parameters such as width, length, depth, orientation, surface roughness and so on, different frequencies and moreover, shear waves with a polarization plane perpendicular to the rail cross-section. The latter problem can be treated with a special three-dimensional EFIT model that consists of only one grid cell {{in the direction of the}} longitudinal rail axis if a strip-like transducer is still taken as a basis. a broader future perspective of the investigations should involve a classification of typical rail defects in the pulse-echo mode of ultrasonic testing...|$|E

At the Coalisland basin, the tub boats descended the final 15 ft on another cradle, which turned them over, to tip their contents into canal boats. The work was finally finished in 1777, {{and at least one}} boat travelled {{along the length of the}} canal, but the through route to the River Blackwater, along the Coalisland Canal, would not be completed for another ten years. Problems with the new route soon became apparent. The upper section was cut through limestone, and Farlough Lake, one of the canal's water sources, could not supply sufficient volumes of water to overcome seepage. Additionally, the inclines had been made too steep for the counterbalance mechanism to work well. In 1787, when an engineer called Richard Owen was sent by the Corporation for Inland Navigation to inspect the route, he found the hurries suffering from mechanical failure and little water in the upper section. He suggested the replacement of the tub boats by flat-bottomed barges on each level, 40 by 13 ft, each of which would carry two rows of seven wagons. At the inclines, the wagons would be run of the boats, and down inclined roads which would replace the inclines, to be loaded onto another boat at the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Echoing</b> Dukart's first design, he also suggested a new canal, some 3.7 mi long, running from below Coalisland basin to Drumglass.

This was the first and, so far, only detection of the floor of an extraterrestrial sea. The difference of amplitude of the surface and <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> was also investigated in order to evaluate losses by absorption in the liquid layer. In this paper, we analyze the passive radiometry data that were acquired concurrently with the active data, {{in order to provide}} an independent estimate of the liquid loss tangent and to determine the dielectric constant of both the liquid and the seafloor. We then used these results to convert the radiometry mosaic of LM into a low-resolution bathymetry map. For the last 10 years, the passive radiometer incorporated in the Cassini RADAR has been observing the 2. 2 -cm wavelength thermal microwave emission from Titan. Its calibration has been recently refined to an unprecedented accuracy of < 1 % (Janssen et al., this meeting). To date, all LM has been mapped in high-spatial resolution. The 2. 2 -cm emissivity measured over it {{is directly related to the}} depth of the seafloor, the most emissive areas being the deepest and vice-versa. Comparing the radiometry data acquired in May 2013 to a two-layer model and using as an input the altimetry-derived depth profile, we find that the loss tangent value that best fits data is very low and only slightly smaller than that found by Mastroguiseppe et al. (2014) (3. 0 ± 1. 0 10 - 5). This strongly suggests that the sea is composed of pure hydrocarbons with no or few suspended particles. A dielectric constant of 2. 9 is inferred for the sea bottom pointing to water ice as its most likely composition rather than organic sediments. Lastly, the dielectric constant of the liquid is found to be < 1. 7, which, together with the low loss tangent, supports the idea of a methane-dominated composition (rather than ethane, Mitchell et al., submitted) ...|$|R

Many kinds of examinations; i. e, physical examination, liver function test of serum, liver biopsy, laparoscopy, roentogenological diagnosis and others were using for this purpose, but the diagnosis was unliable yet. Recently, the clinical application of radioisotope is remarkably advanced, and the scintiscanning {{is used as a}} standard tool for clinician. The advances of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus and techniques is also evident. In this paper the investigations were carried out by combinating method of ultrasonic diagnosis with hepatoscintigram. The excellent point of this method is to improve the weak points each other of the hepatoscintigram and ultrasonic diagnosis. By means of hepatoscintigram every large space occupying lesion (more than 2 - 3 cm in diameter) in liver can be seen but the depth and structure of the lesion can not be recognized, however the ultrasonic A-scope method is able to clarify the laters. Ultrasonic method is able to diagnose the character of the aimed occupying lesion, respectively. Generally, the continuous multiplying echo indicate the cancer tissue, the boundary wall echo is the cyst or abscess, and the gall stone is easily diagnosed at the same time. But the risk for over diagnosis is respective in two methods, the diagnosis by this combinating method must be carefull in considerations. Combinating method of ultrasonic A-scope with hepatoscintigram gave a good result for liver disease. But the nature of the echoes obtained various kind of livers tend to over-lap. Therefore it is difficult to remark the distinguished accuracy in all cases. The suitable frequency was 2. 25 MC and a barium titanate of 10 mm in diameter was used. Now we are using the ultrasonic contact compound scope, Aloka SSD- 10. In this paper some results and problems of this method were presented.

40|$|Interactions between {{bottom water}} {{currents}} and seafloor sediments are well known. Bottom current generated bedforms are varied both morphologicaly and sedimentologicaly. Sediment transport and deposition, associated with bottom water circulation, plays {{a significant role}} is sculpting seafloor morphology in all ocean basins. Indeed, bedforms have been used to great effect to define the presence, direction and strength of bottom water circulation globally. Here we present new multibeam swath bathymetry and high frequency seismic data from the Natal Valley and Mozambique Ridge, southwest Indian Ocean. These data show a deep (- 3200 m) channel-like feature (Ariel Graben, situated at 28 ° 30 ”S on the Mozambique Ridge) connecting the northern Natal Valley to the Mozambique Basin. A distinct W – E change in seafloor morphology and seismic character is noted moving from the Natal Valley through the Ariel Graben. The northern flank of the graben exhibits smooth plastered drifts which give way to undulating seafloor in the east. The plastered drifts are characterised by distinct <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes,</b> with several discontinuous sub-bottom reflections. In contrast, the undulating seafloor is characterised by distinct hyperbolic echoes, with occasional indistinct sub-bottom reflectors. The W – E orientated undulations are straight crested, parallel / sub-parallel to the local isobaths. Wavelength is variable, ranging from 600 m to 1200 m. Cross-sectional symmetry of these features varies from symmetrical to asymmetrical, with board crests and narrow troughs. When asymmetrical, the lower (south-facing) limb is the longer (511. 76 m average) than the upper (north-facing) limb (323. 53 m average). The lower limbs are also steeper than the upper limbs; calculated averages being 3. 80 ° and 1. 55 °, respectively. Overall, the slope on which the undulations are found, is south-facing with a gradient of 1. 54 °, however, the area affected by undulations is slightly steeper (average slope of 1. 75 °). Beyond - 3000 m, the lower limit of the undulations, the gradient increases to 4. 71 °. The total slope average in this eastern region is 0. 54 ° steeper than in the west area. The channel floor, no longer flat, is ca. 440 m wide at - 3160 m depth. The Ariel Graben represents a deep saddle across the Mozambique Ridge at 28 ° 30 ”S. This saddle provides a northern-most passage for the transport of NADW from the northern Natal Valley to the Mozambique Ridge. Evidence of this transport is manifest as crudely developed plastered drifts in the west and a soft sediment deformation field in the east of the study area. Here, current flow stripping, due to increased curvature of the saddle axis, results in deposition of suspended load in accordance with reduced current velocity. The steepened northern graben flank in this area provides limited accommodation space which promotes high sedimentation. Deposited sediments overcome the necessary shear stresses, resulting in soft sediment deformation in the form of down-slope growth faulting and generation of undulating sea-floor morphology. ...|$|R

In this method, IE method is used for the detailed nondestructive evaluation of concrete structure and Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method is employed for the measurement of the average P-wave velocity of whole thickness. The signal received by the transducer in the IE test consists in a sum of the direct surface wave and side <b>echoes,</b> the <b>bottom</b> or defect <b>echo</b> (target echo), and the background noise. In the FFT based frequency domain analysis, sometimes, it is difficult and not straightforward to extract the information on the target echo. The time-frequency analysis can provide the temporal variation in frequency components of the signal and thereby has advantages in the analysis of IE signal. In this paper, time-frequency analysis based on short-time Fourier transform is presented to improve the interpretation of IE signal. Experimental studies were performed in the concrete model slab in which poor concrete was included at known location. Test results obtained by time-frequency analysis are compared to the conventional IE results and the advantages of using the proposed method were verified...|$|R
2500|$|With {{continuing}} experience, {{particularly on}} the upper continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico, the successful prediction {{of the presence of}} tubeworm communities continues to improve, however chemosynthetic communities cannot be reliably detected directly using geophysical techniques. Hydrocarbon seeps that allow chemosynthetic communities to exist do modify the geological characteristics in ways that can be remotely detected, but the time scales of co-occurring active seepage and the presence of living communities is always uncertain. These known sediment modifications include (1) precipitation of authigenic carbonate in the form of micronodules, nodules, or rock masses; (2) formation of gas hydrates; (3) modification of sediment composition through concentration of hard chemosynthetic organism remains (such as shell fragments and layers); (4) formation of interstitial gas bubbles or hydrocarbons; and (5) formation of depressions or pockmarks by gas expulsion. These features give rise to acoustic effects such as wipeout zones (no <b>echoes),</b> hard <b>bottoms</b> (strongly reflective <b>echoes),</b> bright spots (reflection enhanced layers), or reverberant layers (Behrens, 1988; Roberts and Neurauter, 1990). [...] "Potential" [...] locations for most types of communities can be determined by careful interpretation of these various geophysical modifications, but to date, the process remains imperfect and confirmation of living communities requires direct visual techniques.|$|R
40|$|As a key {{region of}} the global thermohaline circulation, the Denmark Strait between Iceland and Greenland is the pathway for the densest {{component}} of the North Atlantic Deep Water, the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). Since 1999, it has been probed with acoustic instruments in the SFB 460 program lead by the Institut für Meereskunde Kiel. The data from <b>bottom</b> Pressure/ Inverted <b>Echo</b> Sounders (PIES) and ADCP current profilers, deployed in a model-optimized mooring array at the Denmark Strait sill, resolve both spatial and temporal variability of the overflow. After recovery of moorings in August 2002, the time series available have a total length of 27 months. The data allow for transport estimates based on direct ADCP measurements and integrating geostrophic PIES observations. Including model comparisons, a mean DSOW transport of 3. 0 Sv is calculated with an accuracy of ± 0. 1 Sv. A statistical analysis with autoregressive moving average models has improved the information about integral time scales and dominant frequencies of the overflow variability. Until now, estimates of the mean DSOW throughflow have been remarkably stable. The PIES observations show a close correlation between sea surface height anomalies and the DSOW plume thickness. This opens a perspective for long term monitoring by remote sensing with relevance for climate change. First comparisons of in-situ measurements and satellite altimetry are presented...|$|R
40|$|Geoffrey Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s distinctively English spins on such genres as dream vision, fabliau and Breton lai, {{as well as}} {{his liberal}} {{citation}} of authorities in Troilus and Criseyde, offered early modern English poets the license to mingle sources and authorities within their work, rather than bend their writing to fit the format. Few authors took such productive advantage of Chaucerian permissiveness as William Shakespeare, whose narrative poems defer to Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s distinctively English authority with a regularity comparable to his uses of Homer, Ovid, Virgil and Plutarch. This free-associative approach to auctoritee, the whetstone of the poet-playwright 2 ̆ 7 s dramatic imagination, suggests that he favored his literary memory over the open book in his approach to adaptation. Key sources for A Midsummer Night 2 ̆ 7 s Dream have been well elucidated, but Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s memory of Chaucer runs deeper. We can trace threads of sexual self-awareness from The Wife of Bath 2 ̆ 7 s Prologue through Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Venus and Adonis, then back through Dame Alisoun 2 ̆ 7 s tale where they emerge to embroider A Midsummer Night 2 ̆ 7 s Dream. Shakespeare externalizes inner states, most profoundly those of Venus and Hermia, provoking other characters to look within. Complimenting this aesthetics of the inside-out, derived from the Wife of Bath, Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s characterization of <b>Bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s clueless Sir Thopas in the doggerel verses and drama interruptus of his 2 ̆ 2 Pyramus and Thisbe. 2 ̆ 2 With The Rape of Lucrece, a prerequisite for his mastery of metatheatrical forms, Shakespeare established Lucrece as Chaucerian interpreter and active spectator. The poet-playwright 2 ̆ 7 s intertextual approach transcends mere character centrality or point of view — Lucrece is a master observer and contextualizer, viewing 2 ̆ 2 Troy 2 ̆ 7 s painted woes 2 ̆ 2 (1492) selectively, in emotional rather than narrative order, fitting what she sees to how she feels, much as the adapting poet shapes source material. The 2 ̆ 2 painter 2 ̆ 2 to whom she frequently refers, if he does not precisely correspond to Chaucer, certainly exemplifies the aesthetic and emotional intersections of artist, work and audience that formed Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s sense of the Chaucerian. Had Shakespeare been merely interested in a formal skeleton on which to hang his Troilus and Cressida, William Caxton 2 ̆ 7 s Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, possibly in conjunction with John Lydgate 2 ̆ 7 s Troy-Book, would have been an apt framework. Their references to Troilus as a noted warrior present sufficient foundation for Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s dilatory gifts, if only the young knight 2 ̆ 7 s abortive romance with Criseyde — 2 ̆ 2 Englisshed 2 ̆ 2 and fully defined by Chaucer — were not central to the poet-playwright 2 ̆ 7 s explorations of love, duty and honor. With these disjunctions of narrative authority and poetic agenda in mind, Shakespeare engaged his memory of Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s Troilus and Criseyde, which renders the Trojan War insignificant to the poet 2 ̆ 7 s purpose and yet indivisible from his narrative, establishing a reflexive relationship between works separated by two centuries. The contradictions of style and content in Pericles and The Two Noble Kinsmen derive in part from Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s (and John Gower 2 ̆ 7 s) readings of the antique world, filtered through Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s conception of medieval literary auctoritee. Further difficulties stem from uneasy, however well-intended, collaborations. Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s need to repurpose the well-worn theatrical tropes and static modes of interpretation relied upon by many early modern playwrights, including George Wilkins and John Fletcher, characterizes his dramatic approach from his earliest work. His collaborative contributions reveal their singularity by assimilating narrative verisimilitude and poetic authority into character. More than theatrical pomp or a winking familiarity with audience expectations, Shakespeare sought emotional resonance — to rouse human feeling rather than manufacture it. The willingness and facility to serve both source and audience while negotiating between them may be the unquantifiable something that makes Shakespeare 2 ̆ 2 Shakespeare 2 ̆ 2 and Chaucer 2 ̆ 2 Chaucer. 2 ̆ 2 Mediating generic commonplaces with Chaucerian poetics, Shakespeare revealed a bottomless comprehension of literary forms and their evocative potential. Developing these approaches and devices throughout his career, regardless of dramatic genre and parallel to his Ovidian proclivities, the poet-playwright honed his profound sensibility on dialogues with the past...|$|R
40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{collapse}} of the Warsaw pact have resulted in a change of operational theatre for the naval forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In particular, the focus of Anti Submarine Warfare forces has shifted from tracking Soviet nuclear ballistic missile submarine in the deep waters of the Atlantic ocean to hunting smaller and quieter Diesel electric submarines in coastal water. In most scenarios, towed array sonars are the best sensor to detect, classify and localise submarines. The long passive towed array sonars used during the Cold war are more difficult to use in coastal waters and are being replaced by most Navies by Low Frequency Active Sonars (LFAS) using a towed source and shorter towed receiving array. These shorter towed arrays can be used in both active and passive modes. In passive mode, their reduced size offer limited performance compared to their longer equivalent. In active mode, they can detect submarines at long ranges in shallow waters but are plagued by false alarms caused by echoes from features of the seafloor. This thesis deals with algorithms improving Detection, Classification and Localisation for towed sonar arrays, with a specific focus on LFAS sonars. In Chapter 2, we derive, analyse and apply to measured data a method for improving detection performance with short passive towed arrays. An important issue in detection of quiet acoustic source with short towed arrays is the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bearing resolution for targets emitting low frequency signals. One of the techniques believed to improve these characteristics is Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS). The method is based on the artificial enlargement of a sonar array by coherently integrating acoustic snapshots at different antenna positions. We first derive theoretical measures of performance of passive SAS and report on its application in combination with other signal-processing algorithms. Its theoretical performance is compared with that of the frequently used incoherent integration. The used passive SAS algorithm is the method known as Extended Towed Array Measurement (ETAM) or the overlap correlator. It is based on the correlation of data snapshots on overlapping hydrophones. Correlation is a key issue in this method and since it is affected by noisy targets, some gain can be expected from noise cancellation. The influence on the performance of ETAM of a method of tow ship noise cancelling at hydrophone level (Inverse Beam Forming, IBF) is analysed. This approach increases ETAM performance by removing a loud and highly correlated noise source, the tow ship, and thus enhancing the other targets in the beam pattern. The results of the algorithms applied to two experimental datasets show that they bring an improvement close to theoretical expectations. Port starboard discrimination and the successful combination of IBF with ETAM make this approach innovative. In Chapter 3, methods for improving the localisation of a source with a short towed array are analysed and applied to data, both simulated and measured at sea. Localisation performance with sonar towed array is related to the array length. The knowledge of the position of a given acoustic source gives a critical tactical advantage to a ship. There are a limited number of ways to estimate the range of a source with a towed passive sonar, most requiring the towing platform to execute a manoeuvre. These manoeuvres are undesirable as they take a lot of time, cause bending of the towed array and can even put the towing platform in harm’s way. We present a number of source position estimation methods for both broadband and narrowband sources suitable for short towed arrays. Recursive methods based on the extended Kalman filter are first examined. A new method based on the integration of time delay of arrival measurements along the sonar path is described. We derive theoretical performance indicators and show that this method gives the possibility to estimate the position and speed of a source without a manoeuvre. In Chapter 4, the Classification performance of a broadband waveform is analysed and measured on data collected at sea. Like any long-range active sonar system, LFAS produces a large amount of unwanted sea <b>bottom</b> <b>echoes</b> or clutter. These echoes give rise to false alarms that increase the computational load of target trackers and jeopardise the correct classification of each echo. The number of false alarms due to clutter can be reduced either through echo classification techniques or through Doppler filtering provided the targets of interest are in motion. Much research has been carried out on waveform investigation for the efficient use of bandwidth capabilities of modern sonar transmitters. Among the quantity of waveforms, Binary Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) pulses have emerged as exhibiting cross-correlation properties relevant to Doppler filtering while maintaining a range resolution comparable to Frequency Modulated (FM) pulses. We have successfully applied a false alarm reduction technique using contacts obtained with an FM pulse subsequently processed by Doppler filtering with a BPSK pulse. The Doppler classification performance for this pulse is evaluated on an experimental dataset and a few limitations of BPSK are identified.
