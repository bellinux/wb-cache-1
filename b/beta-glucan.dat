5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble <b>beta-glucan,</b> RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Compounds from T. felleus {{have been}} {{extracted}} and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a <b>beta-glucan</b> that was {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non-specific immunological response. In particular, it enhances phagocytosis, {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity.|$|E
25|$|Oat <b>beta-glucan</b> is a viscous {{polysaccharide}} made up {{of units}} of the monosaccharide D-glucose. Oat <b>beta-glucan</b> is composed of mixed-linkage polysaccharides. This means the bonds between the D-glucose or D-glucopyranosyl units are either beta-1, 3 linkages or beta-1, 4 linkages. This type of <b>beta-glucan</b> is {{also referred to as}} a mixed-linkage (1→3), (1→4)-beta-D-glucan. The (1→3)-linkages break up the uniform structure of the beta-D-glucan molecule and make it soluble and flexible. In comparison, the indigestible polysaccharide cellulose is also a <b>beta-glucan,</b> but is not soluble because of its (1→4)-beta-D-linkages. The percentages of <b>beta-glucan</b> in the various whole oat products are: oat bran, having from 5.5% to 23.0%; rolled oats, about 4%; and whole oat flour about 4%.|$|E
40|$|Non-prescriptional use of {{medicinal}} herbs among cancer patients is common around the world. The alleged anti-cancer effects of most herbal extracts are mainly based on studies derived from in vitro or in vivo animal experiments. The current information {{suggests that these}} herbal extracts exert their biological effect either through cytotoxic or immunomodulatory mechanisms. One of the active compounds responsible for the immune effects of herbal products {{is in the form}} of complex polysaccharides known as <b>beta-glucans.</b> <b>beta-glucans</b> are ubiquitously found in both bacterial or fungal cell walls and have been implicated in the initiation of anti-microbial immune response. Based on in vitro studies, <b>beta-glucans</b> act on several immune receptors including Dectin- 1, complement receptor (CR 3) and TLR- 2 / 6 and trigger a group of immune cells including macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. As a consequence, both innate and adaptive response can be modulated by <b>beta-glucans</b> and they can also enhance opsonic and non-opsonic phagocytosis. In animal studies, after oral administration, the specific backbone 1 [...] > 3 linear beta-glycosidic chain of <b>beta-glucans</b> cannot be digested. Most <b>beta-glucans</b> enter the proximal small intestine and some are captured by the macrophages. They are internalized and fragmented within the cells, then transported by the macrophages to the marrow and endothelial reticular system. The small <b>beta-glucans</b> fragments are eventually released by the macrophages and taken up by other immune cells leading to various immune responses. However, <b>beta-glucans</b> of different sizes and branching patterns may have significantly variable immune potency. Careful selection of appropriate <b>beta-glucans</b> is essential if we wish to investigate the effects of <b>beta-glucans</b> clinically. So far, no good quality clinical trial data is available on assessing the effectiveness of purified <b>beta-glucans</b> among cancer patients. Future effort should direct at performing well-designed clinical trials to verify the actual clinical efficacy of <b>beta-glucans</b> or <b>beta-glucans</b> containing compounds. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|<b>Beta-glucans</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of natural polysaccharides mostly investigated for their immunological effects. Due {{to the low}} systemic availability of oral preparations, it has been thought that only parenterally applied <b>beta-glucans</b> can modulate the immune system. However, several in vivo and in vitro investigations have revealed that orally applied <b>beta-glucans</b> also exert such effects. Various receptor interactions, explaining possible mode of actions, have been detected. The effects mainly depend on the source {{and structure of the}} <b>beta-glucans.</b> In the meantime, several human clinical trials with dietary insoluble yeast <b>beta-glucans</b> have been performed. The results confirm the previous findings of in vivo studies.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} side by {{side the}} effects on serum lipoproteins and postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations of beverages enriched with 5 or 10 g of <b>beta-glucans</b> from oats or barley.
