25|$|Later {{on in the}} 1930s, Curry began wrestling in Detroit under {{promoter}} Adam Weissmuller (uncle of Johnny Weissmuller) {{who also}} trained him for his professional career. Curry stayed in Detroit for several years developing his brutal, hardcore style of wrestling {{that made him a}} top name in the territory. Curry was so well known that he even faced legendary heavyweight pro boxer Jack Dempsey in an exhibition match in 1940. Years later Curry would often claim that he knocked Dempsey out in the match <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Curry was stopped in the second round.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her.

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that...</b> let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did {{not have}} a major film success. She {{appeared}} in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} humorous piece {{appeared in}} Joseph Addison's Spectator in 1714 purporting {{to explain the}} rarity of the flitch being awarded {{in terms of the}} poor quality of the applicants. [...] The writer claims that the source is the Register of Whichenovre-hall <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the piece is almost certainly entirely fictitious. [...] The first couple to claim, according to this account, were at first successful, but then had the flitch taken away from them after they began to argue about how it should be dressed. [...] Another couple failed when the husband, who had only reluctantly attended, had his ears boxed by his wife during the questioning. [...] A couple who applied after only their honeymoon had finished passed the questioning but since insufficient time had elapsed were awarded just one rasher. [...] One of only two couples to be successful in the first century of the tradition was a ship's captain and his wife who had not actually seen one another for over a year since their marriage.|$|E

500|$|... 11 overall {{received}} mixed, {{but mostly}} unflattering reviews from critics. Music reviewer Chris Jones from the BBC wrote generally positively about 11 in his review. He {{concluded that it}} was another strong album, even if Adams voice sounded dispassionate on some tracks. The Canadian website Jam! gave the album an average review. Reviewer Darryl Stedan found the lyrics clichéd, predictable and, while not criticising it, described it as an album [...] "that didn't really mean much." [...] Ryan Wasoba from the alternatively weekly magazine, Houston Press wrote favorably of the record in a backhanded way, commenting that 11's appeal laid in its [...] "inoffensiveness" [...] and [...] "digestibility". In another favorable review, Daily Mail writer Adrian Thrills said the album highlight was [...] "Oxygen", commenting on the similarities with the music of Bob Dylan. Amy O'Brian of The Vancouver Sun wrote favorably of the new album, {{while at the same}} time criticising it for its clichés, bad lyrics and for its too-familiar melodies, and concluded, [...] "It's cheesy and overdone, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it just might give Adams his first hit in a decade." ...|$|E

In announcing his withdrawal, Maldonado said: [...] "Now is not my time... I know it's cliché to say I am not running so I can {{spend more time with}} my family.
