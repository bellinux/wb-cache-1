40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Diffusion bonding {{has been}} widely used within microlamination {{architectures}} for the fabrication of Micro Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS). MECS are microsystems {{with the ability to}} process bulk amounts of fluid within highly-parallel microchannel arrays capable of accelerated heat and mass transfer. Thus far, diffusion bonding of microchannel arrays is commonly done in a vacuum hot press system. The use of the hot press greatly restricts the production rate due to vacuum pump-down time and heating-up and cooling-down periods.
