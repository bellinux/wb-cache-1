Carbon nanotubes injection methods in the form of suspension in polar (acetone, cyclohexanone, butanol- 1, ethyl cellosolve) and non-polar (o-dimethylbenzene) solvents for alkyd primers and in the form of suspension in Р - 5 А solvent and curing agent for <b>epoxy</b> <b>primer</b> were examined. In all cases the carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent and solvent was produced by previous dispersion in cell ultrasonic bath during 15 minutes with further mixture during 20 minutes on laboratory dissolver with milling mixer.

40|$|High {{strength}} {{aluminum alloys}} {{are widely used}} in applications (aerospace and vehicle armor) that require exceptional strength or ballistic properties along with low weight. These materials (e. g. Al- 2024, Al- 7075) derive their exceptional properties from the copper added to form the alloys. Unfortunately, galvanic cells are between the copper and the aluminum, making the aluminum alloys highly susceptible to corrosion. Soluble (hexavalent) chromates are still {{the most effective and}} most widely used corrosion inhibitors for aluminum alloys. However, the toxic properties and environmental costs of chromates are well documented; their use and disposal are therefore strictly regulated. Until recently there have been few effective alternative corrosion inhibitors for high strength aluminum alloys that are chromate and heavy metal free. In this paper we describe new chromate and heavy metal free corrosion inhibitors for high strength aluminum alloys, based on low cost nanoparticle cores, which have been shown to effectively for protect both Al- 2024 and Al- 7075 alloys. When the new chromate-free corrosion inhibitors are incorporated into an <b>epoxy</b> <b>primer,</b> the coatings match or exceed the performance of chromated <b>epoxy</b> <b>primers</b> in both 3000 -hour salt fog tests and 1000 -hour filliform corrosion tests...|$|R

Two primers were used: a zinc-rich <b>epoxy</b> <b>primer</b> and a red lead oxide <b>epoxy</b> <b>primer.</b> The epoxy-polyamine topcoat was used {{in four of the}} systems. The EG and G-PARC Model 368 ac impedance measurement system, along with dc measurements with the same system using the polarization resistance method, were used to monitor changing properties of coated 4230 steel disks immersed in 3. 5 percent NaCl solutions buffered at pH 5. 4 over periods of 40 to 60 days.

This equivalent circuit parallels the impedance behavior of the corrosion system during a frequency scan. Values for the resistors and capacitors, that can be assigned in the equivalent circuit following a least-squares analysis of the data, describe changes that occur on the corroding metal surface and in the protective coatings.
