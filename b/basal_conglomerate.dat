500|$|The oldest {{section of}} the {{supergroup}} is the Unkar Group. It accumulated {{in a variety of}} fluvial, deltaic, tidal, nearshore marine, and offshore marine environments. The first formation to be laid down in the Unkar Group was the Bass Formation. Fluvial gravels initially accumulated in shallow river valleys. They later lithified into a <b>basal</b> <b>conglomerate</b> that is known as the Hotauta Member of the Bass Formation. The Bass Formation was deposited in a shallow sea near the coast as a mix of limestone, sandstone, and shale. Diagenesis later altered the bulk of the limestone into dolomite. It is [...] thick and grayish in color. Averaging 1250million years old, this is the oldest layer exposed in the Grand Canyon that contains fossilsstromatolites. Hakatai Shale is made of thin beds of marginal-marine-derived mudstones, sandstones, and shale that, together, are [...] thick. This formation indicates a short-lived regression (retreat) of the seashore in the area that left mud flats. Today it is very bright orange-red and gives the Red Canyon its name. Shinumo Quartzite is a resistant marine sedimentary quartzite that was eroded to form monadnocks that later became islands in Cambrian time. Those islands withstood wave action long enough to become re-buried by other sediments in the Cambrian Period. Dox Formation is over [...] thick and is made of sandstone with some interbedded shale beds and mudstone that were deposited in fluvial and tidal environments. Ripple marks and other features indicate it was close to the shore. Outcrops of this red to orange formation {{can be seen in the}} eastern parts of the canyon. Fossils of stromatolites and algae are found in this layer. At 1070 ± 70million years old, the Cardenas Basalt is the youngest formation in the Unkar Group.

40|$|The Wutai Complex {{associated}} with the adjacent Fuping and Hengshan Complexes represents the best and classical cross-section in the middle segment of the Trans-North China Orogen, generally divided into Eastern and Western Blocks. Unconformably overlying the Wutai and Fuping Complexes is the Hutuo Group considered as the youngest lithostratigraphic unit {{in the region and}} important both for interpreting Precambrian history as well as the overall evolution of the Trans-North China Orogen. Lack of knowledge about provenance of the sedimentary rocks in this group has hindered understanding of the depositional environments and tectonic significance. LA-ICP-MS was applied to obtain U-Pb zircon ages for the granitic pebbles, the lowest lithostratigraphic rock of the Hutuo Group, which, combined with previous lithostratigraphic, geochronological, structural and metamorphic data, provides new constraints on the sedimentary provenance and tectonic evolution of the region. The sequence of the Hutuo Group ranges upward from lower <b>basal</b> <b>conglomerates</b> and volcaniclastic rocks (Doucun Subgroup), through clastic sediments, slates, dolomites and marbles (Dongye Subgroup), to sandstones and conglomerates at the top (Guojiazhai Subgroup). Zircons from granitic pebbles preserved in the Doucun Subgroup <b>basal</b> <b>conglomerates</b> give weighted mean 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages between 2517 Ma and 2566 Ma, which are the same as those for the late Archean Wutai Granitoids, indicating that the pebbles were derived from the Wutai granitic intrusions (2566 - 2515 Ma). Based on the new data and previous studies, combined with an igneous zircon crystallization age of 2087 ± 9 Ma obtained for volcanics in the Hutuo Group, the Hutuo Group was deposited in a subduction-related retro-arc foreland basin environment that developed behind the Wutai arc during the eastward-directed subduction of the Western Block beneath the western margin of the Eastern Block.

As the results of this study, it is found that the uraniferous ores are characterised by extremely high contents of Zr, Y, Sr, and As, which show positive and linear correlation with the U contents. It is confirmed that As is concentrated in pyrite which is usually associated with the uraniferous ores. Elements such as Ni and Co are slightly concentrated both in the uraniferous ores and andesite dikes. This fact may suggest some genetic relationship among them. However, it does not seem to be plausible to draw any definite conclusion on the origin of the uranium deposits from these relationships.

40|$|Biostratigraphic and sedimentologic {{investigations}} in 67 sections {{have been carried}} out for the Middle Permian Maokou Formation that immediately underlies the Emeishan flood basalts in southwest China. The results suggest a domal crustal thinning before the emplacement of the Emeishan large igneous province. Variably thinned carbonates in the Maokou Formation are capped by a subaerial unconformity, which is generally manifested by karst paleotopography, paleoweathering zone, or locally by relict gravels and <b>basal</b> <b>conglomerates.</b> Provenance analysis indicates that these gravels and conglomerates were mainly derived from the uppermost Maokou Formation. Therefore, the stratigraphic thinning likely resulted from differential erosion due to regional uplift. Iso-thickness contours of the Maokou Formation delineate a subcircular uplifted area, in accordance with the crustal doming caused by a starting mantle plume as predicted by experimental and numerical modeling. The duration of this uplift is estimated to be less than 3 Myr and the magnitude of uplift is greater than 1000 m.

In the Kadirler area {{to the south of}} Geyve, however, Upper Permian (Midian) quartz sandstones and carbonates with a rich foraminifer fauna disconformably overlie a crystalline basement complex. This basement complex comprises metaclastic rocks, recrystallised limestones, metacherts, and metadiabases, and is intruded by granodiorites. The overlying <b>basal</b> <b>conglomerates</b> and quartzitic sandstones are dominated by pebbles from the basement complex and are followed upward by medium- to thick-bedded dolomites, dolomitic limestones and limestones.
