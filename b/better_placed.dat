5|$|The Gila monster has one close living relative, the {{beaded lizard}} (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history of which may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> in a separate family.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E

40|$|With almost $ 1 {{billion in}} funding, <b>Better</b> <b>Place</b> {{was poised to}} become one of the most {{innovative}} companies in the electric mobility market. The system <b>Better</b> <b>Place</b> proposed had two novel prongs; first, to reduce the cost of batteries, and second, to reduce range anxiety, public infrastructure concerns, and long charging times. Yet, despite this seemingly strong combination, <b>Better</b> <b>Place</b> failed to make any progress in Denmark and Israel, the first two markets it operated in, and subsequently declared bankruptcy, selling off its collective assets for less than $ 500, 000. Drawing from science and technology studies and the notion of “interpretive flexibility,” this paper posits several reasons to explain the failure of <b>Better</b> <b>Place,</b> including that Denmark is not as “green” as it seems nor is the Israeli market as attractive as believed, and that <b>Better</b> <b>Place's</b> solution to charging time and range anxiety resolved a psychological, not a functional, barrier of the general public to adopt electric vehicles. Before investigating these two reasons, the paper presents a short history of <b>Better</b> <b>Place</b> and explores the contours of its operations in Denmark and Israel. It then discusses why <b>Better</b> <b>Place</b> “failed” across both countries before concluding with implications for energy planning, policy, and analysis...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Better</b> <b>Place</b> {{electric}} car charging infrastructure network {{was based on}} a smart grid software platform using Intel Atom processors and Microsoft [...]NET software, or comparable vendors.

25|$|At Tours, Gregory {{could not}} have been <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> to hear {{everything}} and meet everyone of influence in Merovingian culture. Tours lay on the watery highway of the navigable Loire. Five Roman roads radiated from Tours, which lay on the main thoroughfare between the Frankish north and Aquitania, with Spain beyond. At Tours the Frankish influences of the north and the Gallo-Roman influences of the south had their chief contact (see map). As the center for the popular cult of St Martin, Tours was a pilgrimage site, hospital, and a political sanctuary to which important leaders fled during periods of violence and turmoil in Merovingian politics.|$|E
25|$|If a {{constitution}} {{is to be}} interpreted {{in light of the}} evolving standards of decency, why, in most democratic countries, should the highest authority of judicial branch (e.g., the Supreme Court in U.S.) be the ones to have the final say over its interpretation?

25|$|Two {{or three}} plumbatae were {{typically}} clipped {{to a small}} wooden bracket {{on the inside of}} the large oval or round shields used at the time. Massed troops would unclip and hurl plumbatae as the enemy neared, hopefully stalling their movement and morale by making them clump together and huddle under their shields. With the enemy deprived of rapid movement and their visibility impaired by their own raised shields, the Roman troops were then <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> to exploit the tactical situation. It is unlikely plumbatae were viewed by the Romans as the killing blow, but more as a means of stalling the enemy at ranges greater than previously provided by the heavier and shorter ranged pilum.|$|E
25|$|Al-Jazzar's {{military}} forces were largely organized along ethnic lines, which helped guarantee loyalty and cooperation within each ethnic unit. The unit commanders were also typically {{from the same}} ethnic origin {{as the rest of}} the unit and were <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> to ensure a level of intra-unit discipline. The units consisted of Maghrebi infantry, Arnaut (Albanian) and Bushnak (Bosnian) cavalrymen from the Balkans who al-Jazzar purchased, and Kurdish Dalat cavalry units. The Maghrebi and Dalat units were mercenaries hired by al-Jazzar. The former previously formed a major part of Zahir's army, while the latter were originally part of the Ottoman imperial army but became private militias in the service of various Ottoman Syrian governors throughout the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The five-year plans, {{especially}} in the pre-liberalisation era, attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions and distributing industries across states.

25|$|The eight {{ships were}} ordered under the {{provisions}} of the 1889 Naval Defence Act as an improved design of the preceding s. They were to displace 1000 tons more than the Apollos, and were to have improved sea-keeping abilities, and heavier and <b>better</b> <b>placed</b> armament. The result was a design with a full length deck that gave a higher freeboard amidships, and placed the main armament higher on the superstructure. Though this made them drier ships, the design was criticised for being a larger and more expensive development of the Apollos, but without offering any substantial increase in armament, speed or endurance. The increased weight did however make them more seaworthy, and the design provided the basis for the development of future protected cruisers. The ships were built at several of the principal navy dockyards: three at Devonport, two at Pembroke, and one each at Sheerness, Chatham and Portsmouth.|$|E
