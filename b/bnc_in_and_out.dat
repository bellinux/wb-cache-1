In this preliminary study, we identify current and former/abandoned BNCâ€™s winter roosts, forage preferences and conservation threats based on local resident expertise and data available with government institutions and RSPN.|$|R
40|$|The Multi-Blade is a Boron- 10 -based gaseous {{detector}} {{introduced to}} face the challenge arising in neutron reflectometry at pulsed neutron sources. Neutron reflectometers are the most challenging instruments in terms of instantaneous counting rate and spatial resolution. This detector {{has been designed to}} cope with the requirements set for the reflectometers at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden. Based on previous results obtained at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in France, an improved demonstrator has been built at ESS and tested at the Budapest Neutron Centre (<b>BNC)</b> <b>in</b> Hungary <b>and</b> at the Source Testing Facility (STF) at the Lund University in Sweden. A detailed description of the detector and the results of the tests are discussed in this manuscript. Comment: 32 pages, 18 figure...|$|R
