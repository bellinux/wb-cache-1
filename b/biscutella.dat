5000|$|In 1897 he {{reported}} some significant conceptual and methodological advances {{in his study}} of variation. [...] "I have argued that variations of a discontinuous nature may play a prepondering part in the constitution of a new species." [...] He attempts to silence his critics (the [...] "biometricians") who misconstrue his definition of discontinuity of variation by clarification of his terms: [...] "a variation is discontinuous if, when all the individuals of a population are breeding freely together, there is not simple regression to one mean form, but a sensible preponderance of the variety over the intermediates… The essential feature of a discontinuous variation is therefore that, be the cause what it may, there is not complete blending between variety and type. The variety persists and is not “swamped by intercrossing”. But critically, he begins to report a series of breeding experiments, conducted by his pupil, Miss E.R. Saunders, using the alpine brassica <b>Biscutella</b> laevigata in the Cambridge botanic gardens. In the wild, hairy and smooth forms of otherwise identical plants are seen together. They intercrossed the forms experimentally, “When therefore the well-grown mongrel plants are examined, they present just the same appearance of discontinuity which the wild plants at the Tosa Falls do. This discontinuity is, therefore, the outward sign of the fact that in heredity the two characters of smoothness and hairiness do not completely blend, and the offspring do not regress to one mean form, but to two distinct forms.” ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an account of}} the successful intentional introduction of the mountain species <b>Biscutella</b> laevigata to a lowland locality, as a result of field experiment - biological management at the toxic “Dołki” washery spoil heap (Lead and Zinc Ore Main and Factory) ZGH “Orzeł Biały” (Upper Silesia – Southern Poland). The aim of the presented study was to test the effectiveness possibilities of using the blend of seeds including a metallophyte – <b>Biscutella</b> laevigata seeds. The introduction of <b>Biscutella</b> laevigata was a part of an experiment which began in 2009 - 2010 with plots on the "Dolki" washery spoil heap. The tested seeds of <b>Biscutella</b> laevigata were examined for germination, growth and development in sites highly polluted with heavy metals. <b>Biscutella</b> laevigata appeared on two experimental plots. After 4 years there were numerous individuals of <b>Biscutella</b> – dozens of plants in various stages of development and phenology. Development of a <b>Biscutella</b> population from year to year (2 plants in 2010 – 58 plants in 2014) is larger and tends to increase. <b>Biscutella</b> individuals are spreading outside the designated test plots. The obtained results indicate that on sites highly polluted with heavy metals it is possible to perform a successful introduction of <b>Biscutella</b> laevgata population (increase from 2 individuals in 2010 to 58 individuals in 2014) from seeds. These results are also promising in terms of application as a new reclamation method...|$|E

Therefore, in the case that infraspecific taxa are accepted within B. didyma, an epitype is designated to warrant further application of the latter name in the sense it is been used in the last decades.

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of complicated native African taxa, <b>Biscutella</b> maritima (Brassicaceae) and annual species of Sesuvium (Aizoaceae) is discussed. The distribution of B. maritima is widened {{to the most}} of the coastal areas of NE Algeria and N Tunisia. Morphological differences with regard to other North African members of <b>Biscutella</b> ser. <b>Biscutella</b> are reported to facilitate the identification of B. maritima. We propose to accept four annual Sesuvium species (instead of the one previously accepted species, S. sesuvioides sensu amplissimo) with different distributions in Africa: S. digynum, S. hydaspicum, S. sesuvioides s. str. and S. nyasicum. A delimitation key based on morphological and carpological characters is provided. Lectotypes of S. digynum, S. digynum var. angustifolium, S. hydaspicum, S. nyasicum, Diplochonium sesuvioides (Sesuvium sesuvioides) and Trianthema polysperma (synonym of Sesuvium hydaspicum) are selected. Other discussed taxa belong to the alien elements of the flora. Atriplex semibaccata (Amaranthaceae-Chenopodiaceae) is reported as a new species for Cape Verde. Gaillardia × grandiflora (Asteraceae) is discovered as a new species for Africa found in Morocco. Prosopis velutina (Fabaceae) is collected {{for the first time in}} Northern Africa (Morocco). Mollugo verticillata (Molluginaceae) is recorded as a new species for DR Congo. Its morphology, including seed ornamentation, is discussed in reference to other similar-looking Molluginaceae. Incidence of American species Heterotheca subaxillaris (Asteraceae) in North Africa is discussed. Vernonanthura polyanthes (Asteraceae) is recorded as a naturalized invasive species in eastern Zimbabwe. It seems to be the first documented discovery of this ergasiophyte in Africa.

40|$|<b>Biscutella</b> raphanifolia is {{a species}} {{distributed}} in N Algeria and Tunisia, {{characterized by the}} presence of large, lyrate basal leaves, amplexicaul cauline leaves, and paniculate-branched inflorescences. It has been traditionally considered the only perennial taxon from B. sect. <b>Biscutella,</b> lifespan being the strongest argument used to differentiate B. raphanifolia from other annual taxa such as B. algeriensis, B. confusa or B. didyma var. coriophora, with which it shares both morphological characters and distribution. Reevaluation of morphological characters in the light of phylogenetic trees from plastid (rpl 32 -trnL and trnV) and nuclear (ITS region) sequence data support a new circumscription of B. raphanifolia to include all those annual taxa. As a result, the new combination B. raphanifolia var. algeriensis is established, descriptions are provided for both varieties, and synonyms and lectotypes are indicated or designated for the names concerned.

40|$|International audienceSelf-incompatibility (SI) is {{a genetic}} system that {{prevents}} self-fertilization in many Angiosperms. Although plants from the Brassicaceae family present an apparently unique SI {{system that is}} ancestral to the family, investigations at the S-locus responsible for SI have been mostly limited to two distinct lineages (Brassica and Arabidopsis-Capsella, respectively). Here, we investigated SI in a third deep-branching lineage of Brassicaceae: the tribe Biscutelleae. By coupling sequencing of the SI gene responsible for pollen recognition (SRK) with phenotypic analyses based on controlled pollinations, we identified 20 SRK-like sequences functionally linked to 13 S-haplotypes in 21 individuals of <b>Biscutella</b> neustriaca and 220 seedlings. We found two genetic and phylogenetic features of SI in Biscutelleae that depart from patterns observed in the reference Arabidopsis clade: (1) SRK-like sequences cluster into two main phylogenetic lineages interspersed within the many SRK lineages of Arabidopsis; and (2) some SRK-like sequences are transmitted by linked pairs, suggesting local duplication within the S-locus. Strikingly, these features also were observed in the Brassica clade but probably evolved independently, as the two main SRK clusters in <b>Biscutella</b> are distinct from those in Brassica. In the light of our results and {{of what has been}} previously observed in other Brassicaceae, we discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications on SI plant populations of the high diversity and the complex dominance relationships we found at the S-locus in Biscutelleae...|$|E
40|$|Survival {{of annual}} plants in unpredictably varying environments may be {{possible}} through life-history adaptations, i. e. seed dormancy, or through phenotypic variation in life-history traits. In this thesis we studied these evolutionary and environmental life-history expressions along a steep rainfall gradient in Israel, spanning from arid habitats with highly variable and unpredictable rainfall to less variable and more predictable mesic Mediterranean habitats. We studied three winter annual species abundant along the gradient, and differing in dormancy from low to high: Bromus fasciculatus, <b>Biscutella</b> didyma and Hymenocarpos circinnatus. The major objective of this thesis was to perform original empirical tests for optimal germination strategies that were frequently theoretically modeled, but rarely empirically proved. Namely, we tested the pioneering model that predicts the germination fractions are constant over time and proportional to increasing amounts and predictability of rainfall (Cohen 1966). We studied the effects of average annual rainfall separately from maternal effects, {{which has not been}} done before. Our results show germination fractions of <b>Biscutella</b> and Bromus varying in a clinal fashion along the gradient, supporting the Cohen (1966) model. The trend for <b>Biscutella</b> was consistent during three consecutive years indicating a strong genetic determinant of germination. This genetic basis still needs to be established, and we advocate careful addressing of maternal effects too. Maternal effects have been considered in optimal germination strategy only recently, when predictive germination was modeled with respect to competition and environmental variability (Tielbörger & Valleriani 2005). For the first time, we tested this model in real field populations, namely the prediction that maternal fecundity is positively related to rainfall amounts and offspring germination is negatively related to maternal fecundity. We document maternal effects in more humid and more competitive environment (the Mediterranean), and suggest their short-term advantage in controlling sibling competition. With this pioneering approach to test maternal effects on predictive germination, we encourage more rigorous empirical studies to find out whether the observed patterns are universal. In a large-scale field experiment we tested the predicted optimal germination strategies (Cohen 1966, 1967) under naturally varying climatic conditions. Simultaneously, we evaluated the importance of separating climatic from other environmental variables. We reciprocally transplanted conspecific seeds of the species from and to the four sites along the gradient and expected higher germination fractions of seeds from wetter origins and at wetter sites. By sowing seeds on both local and standard soil, we separated climatic from edaphic and neighbor effects. We found strong substrate effects but relatively weak climate effects. This indicates that local environmental conditions may override effects of climate and should be critically addressed in future studies testing for local adaptation to current climate and for the potential of species to adapt to changing climate. Finally, adaptations to local climate and pre-adaptations to changing climate may reflect in life-history traits beyond germination. While exploring phenotypic variation in several morphological and reproductive traits of <b>Biscutella</b> didyma, we found clinal trends in the trait expression along the gradient, indicating two strongly opposing selective forces at the two extremes of the aridity gradient, resulting in contrasting strategies within the species. These clinal trends in the studied traits were consistent with germination trends of <b>Biscutella</b> in our parallel studies and indicate ecotypic differentiation/local adaptation of the climatic populations. Regarding survival under variable climate and potential climate changes, our observed trends in seed dormancy and other life history traits encourage future research on within-population genetic variation related to adaptive traits. Pflanzen müssen in den einzelnen Stadien ihres Lebenszykluses Anpassungen an die jeweils herrschenden Umweltbedingungen entwickeln, um langfristig überlebensfähige Populationen aufbauen zu können. Diese Anpassungen, z. B. Keimungsstrategien, Dormanz und Samengrößen, müssen inbesondere in Lebensräumen mit räumlich und zeitlich unvorhersehbar variierenden Umweltbedingungen sehr komplex sein. Mit Hilfe der Modellierung wurden schon früh (Cohen 1966) optimale Keimungstrategien für Lebensräume entwickelt, die sich in der Vorhersehbarkeit der Umweltbedingungen unterscheiden (predictable vs unpredictable). Die Ergebnisse dieser Modelle sind in der ökologischen Wissenschaft allgemein akzeptiert, ohne dass eine empirische Überprüfung vorgenommen wurde. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, am Beispiel von drei winterannuellen Pflanzenarten (Bromus fasciculatus, <b>Biscutella</b> didyma and Hymenocarpos circinnatus) und entlang eines Gradienten der Regenfallvariation zu testen, ob die sich aus den Modellierungen ergebenden optimalen Keimungsstrategien empirisch nachweisbar sind. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass diese Anpassungen an die Vorhersagbarkeit der Umweltbedingungen existieren. Die Ausprägung der Anpassungen sind jedoch artspezifisch und variieren orientiert an den Umweltbedingungen des Vorjahres. Dies bedeutet, dass in Lebensräumen mit jährlich stark wechselnden Umweltbedingungen, die Umweltbedingungen eines gegebenen Jahres zu Veränderungen in der generellen Anpassungsstartegie der Pflanzen führen...|$|E
