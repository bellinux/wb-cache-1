5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E

Furthermore, there is a specific commandment to love the stranger.|$|E

25|$|Kibbutz divorce {{rates were}} and are {{extremely}} low. Unfortunately {{from the point}} of view of the adults in the community, marriage rates among communally raised children were equally low. This conservatism on the part of kibbutz children has been attributed to the Westermarck effect—a form of reverse sexual imprinting whereby even unrelated children, if raised together from an early age, tend to reject each other as potential partners. The children who grew up together in the children's houses considered their peers <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> had close lasting bonds with each other.|$|E
25|$|Forrest had 12 <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>and</b> half of {{them died}} of typhoid. Isaac and Bedford (twins), Fanny (Forrest's twin), Milly and Mary all died when Forrest was about 11. His father {{recovered}} but died from the effects five years later. So, he was 16, his brother John was 15, and then they {{went all the way}} down to 8 and under - Bill, Jesse, and Aaron with Jeffrey being born after. A few years later, Miriam remarried to John (sometimes James) Luxton, a marshal, and had three boys and a girl with him. At the outset of the Civil War, Forrest had a 10-year-old sister, the only one he had.|$|E
25|$|Dennison Wheelock {{was born}} June 14, 1871, in the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, second child of James A. Wheelock and Sophia Doxtator. He had {{an older brother}} Charles {{and a total of}} eight other <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>and</b> half-siblings. Dennison grew up in the 1870s and early 1880s in a poor Oneida farm community, which was faced with {{increasing}} economic pressures to harvest its timber and a federal push for the allotment of tribal lands to individual households. The Nation struggled with high alcohol consumption and tribal infighting. Dennison took up the cornet after hearing his older brother, Charles, playing it. He was impressed by a visiting Tuscarora musician, who taught the youth music reading and simple composition for several months. In 1879, Seneca and Tuscarora musicians won medals of excellence at state fairs. Dennison also heard the popular band music of John Philip Sousa at Wisconsin fairs. Locally, the Oneida Union Band and the Oneida National Band were prominent in community events and throughout the Midwest.|$|E

25|$|The Croatian ethnonym Hrvat, as well {{of those}} five <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> the early ruler Porga, are not {{considered}} to be of Slavic origin, yet again, are quite original to be a pure fabrication of Constantine VII. As such, the origin of the early Croats before and at the time of arrival to the present day Croatia, as well their ethnonym, were an eternal topic of historiography, linguistics and archeology. However, the theories were often elaborated in non-scientific terms, supported by specific ideological intentions, and often by political and cultural intentions of the time. This kind of interpretations caused a lot of damage to certain theories and actual scientific community. It should be taken into serious consideration whether the origin of the early Croatian tribes can be regarded also as the origin of Croatian nation, and can only be asserted that the Croats as are known today as a nation became only when Croatian tribes arrived in the territory of present-day Croatia.|$|E

500|$|After {{reaching}} Philadelphia, Tubman {{thought of}} her family. [...] "I was a stranger in a strange land," [...] she said later. [...] "y father, my mother, my <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>and</b> friends were [...] But I was free, {{and they should be}} free." [...] She worked odd jobs and saved money. The U.S. Congress meanwhile passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which heavily punished abetting escape and forced law enforcement officials—even in states that had outlawed slavery—to assist in their capture. The law increased risks for escaped slaves, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario (then part of the United Province of Canada), which, as part of the British Empire, had abolished slavery. Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as waves of poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work.|$|E

This apology was rejected by some of the victims' families. After the Hoey verdict, BBC News reporter Kevin Connolly stated that, [...] "The Omagh families were dignified in defeat, as they have been dignified at every stage of their fight for justice. Their campaigning will go on, but the prospect is surely receding now that anyone will ever be convicted of murdering their husbands and <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> wives and children."

I was beside myself at this sight, and cried out: [...] "O Dominic, my son, are you already in Paradise?" [...] "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I am in Heaven." [...] Then pray for your <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>and</b> your mother and father, that we may all come to join you one day in Heaven."

2500|$|The burs: In the caverns {{above the}} mouth area {{there are several}} spiky burs; when Kurelek was young he had the {{sensation}} that these were stuffing up his throat.

[...] Another of the burs is inverted with spikes pointed inward, piercing through a small child. On either side of the bur is a smiling face and an angry face, representing two sides to Kurelek's father. His father is referenced as another bur behind, [...] "the hard domineering blue bur, opening up the mushy yellow bur, my mother, to release a common lot of burs, my <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>and</b> one unique orange one - myself." ...|$|E
