5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bicycle</b> <b>and</b> {{motorcycle}} dynamics is {{the science}} of the motion of bicycles and motorcycles and their components, due to the forces acting on them. Dynamics falls under a branch of physics known as classical mechanics. Bike motions of interest include balancing, steering, braking, accelerating, suspension activation, and vibration. The study of these motions {{began in the late}} 19th century and continues today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> later died. A coroner's inquiry {{found that he was}} under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Saw Mill River from Putnam County to central Yonkers, and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River. Various {{parts of the}} line {{operated}} until the 1940s and the 1980s. The main line of the railroad is now devoted to <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian paths. They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119, and the North County Trailway north of 119.|$|E

5|$|When {{the smoke}} cleared, Heydrich {{emerged from the}} {{wreckage}} with his gun in his hand; he chased Kubiš and tried to return fire. Kubiš jumped on his <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedaled away. Heydrich ran after him for half a block but became weak from shock and collapsed. He sent his driver, Klein, to chase Gabčík on foot. In the ensuing firefight, Gabčík shot Klein in the leg and escaped to a local safe house. Heydrich, still with pistol in hand, gripped his left flank, which was bleeding profusely.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a <b>bicycle,</b> <b>and</b> when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, <b>bicycle,</b> <b>and</b> carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Marysville ranks eighth among Washington {{cities for}} longest commute times, {{with an average}} commute of {{approximately}} 30 minutes. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{plans to build a}} shoulder running lane for peak period use on I-5, as well as a new interchange at State Route 529 south of downtown to alleviate congestion on east–west railroad crossings. On April 22, 2014, Marysville voters approved the creation of a city transportation benefit district and a 0.2 percent sales tax to fund transportation improvements in the city, including road repairs, <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian access, and new capital projects.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the upper}} Caroline Street {{corridor}} and Key West Bight {{have been part}} of ongoing improvement efforts spearheaded by the City of Key West and funded by a special property tax system. At the beginning of the project, the area, once dominated by commercial fishing, had been falling into disarray as its practical future became uncertain. The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course; in early 2011, the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure along the corridor, including improved lighting and signs, a more extensive sidewalk system, and versatility with regard to <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian traffic. As recently as February 2012, additional requests for improvements were lodged with $720,000 available for the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a <b>bicycle</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E
