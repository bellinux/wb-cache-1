30|$|All {{materials}} {{for this study}} were purchased from Merck Company. The DNA extraction kit, PCR purification kit, and Master Mix for PCR amplification were bought from <b>Bioneer</b> <b>Company.</b> The 1 -Kb DNA Ladder, high pure agarose, and primers were prepared by Massruler™, Invitrogen, and Cinnagen respectively. BeckMan Spectrophotometer DU 530 and GFL Shaker Incubator 3031, 3033 were also used.|$|E
30|$|The {{environmental}} isolates that were identified phenotypically as Mycobacterium were further verified to the genus level using a specific PCR protocol {{based on a}} 228 -bp fragment of the 65 -kDa heat shock protein (hsp 65). The primers included hsp 65 F: 5 ′-CTGGTCAAGGAAGGTCTGCG- 3 ′, and hsp 65 R: 5 ′-GATGACACCCTCGTTGCCAAC- 3 ′) as recommended by Khan and Yadav (2004). For identification of the isolates at the species level the amplification and direct sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA gene was used as described previously (Shojaei et al. 2011) using the primers 27 F: 5 ′-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG- 3 ′and 1492 R: 5 ′-CG GTT ACC TTG TTA CGA CTT- 3 ′) (Wilson et al. 1990). The sequencing was performed by ABI 3100 genetic analyzer in <b>Bioneer</b> <b>Company</b> (South Korea). The obtained sequences were aligned manually with all existing sequences of the closely related mycobacteria retrieved from the GenBankTM database, compared with the relevant sequences and analyzed using the jPhydit program (Jeon et al. 2005).|$|E
50|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic, NABDA under her {{leadership}} developed probes and primers for detecting Ebola virus disease. The kits were capable of diagnoses within 24 hours of contacting the virus, even before symptoms start manifesting, thereby preventing the spread of the disease. This was achieved in collaboration with the South Korean biotechnology <b>company</b> <b>Bioneer.</b>|$|R
