5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. <b>Brittle</b> <b>fracture</b> in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E

The brittle component is arranged in a helical pattern. Each of these mineral ‘rods’ (1 μm diameter) contains chitin–protein fibrils with approximately 60nm diameter. These fibrils are made of 3nm diameter canals which link the interior and exterior of the shell.|$|E

Control rods penetrate the graphite moderator and a secondary system involves injecting nitrogen into the coolant to hold the reactor temperature down. A tertiary shutdown system which operates by injecting boron balls into the reactor is included in case the reactor has to be depressurized with insufficient control rods lowered. This would mean that nitrogen pressure can not be maintained.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Northridge earthquake, {{a number}} of steel moment -frame {{buildings}} {{were found to have}} experienced brittle fractures of beam to column connections. [...] Discovery of these unanticipated brittle fractures of framing connections was alarming to engineers and the building industry. [...] Starting in the 1960s, engineers began to regard welded steel moment-frame buildings as being among the most ductile systems contained in the building code. [...] Many engineers believed that steel moment-frame buildings were essentially invulnerable to earthquake induced damage and thought that should damage occur, it would be limited to ductile yielding of members and connections. [...] Observation of damage sustained by buildings in the 1994 Northridge earthquake indicated that contrary to the intended behavior, in many cases, brittle fractures initiated within the connections at very low levels of plastic demand. [...] In September, 1994, The SAC joint Venture, AISC, AISI, and NIST jointly convened an international workshop in Los Angeles to coordinate the efforts of various participants and to lay the foundation for systematic investigation and resolution of the problem. [...] In September 1995 the SAC Joint Venture entered into a contractual agreement with FEMA to conduct Phase II of the SAC Steel project. [...] Under Phase II, SAC continued its extensive problem-focused study of the performance of moment resisting steel frames and connections of various configurations, with the ultimate goal of developing seismic design criteria for steel construction. As a result of these studies it is now known that the typical moment-resisting connection detail employed in steel moment frame construction prior to the 1994 Northridge earthquake had {{a number of}} features that rendered it inherently susceptible to <b>brittle</b> <b>fracture.</b>|$|E

50|$|Modern ships, since roughly 1940, {{have been}} {{produced}} almost exclusively of welded steel. Early welded steel ships used steels with inadequate fracture toughness, which resulted in some ships suffering catastrophic <b>brittle</b> <b>fracture</b> structural cracks (see problems of the Liberty ship).

Although it is commonly accepted that modern steel has eliminated <b>brittle</b> <b>fracture</b> in ships, some controversy still exists. <b>Brittle</b> <b>fracture</b> of modern vessels continues to occur {{from time to time}} because grade A and grade B steel of unknown toughness or fracture appearance transition temperature (FATT) in ships' side shells can be less than adequate for all ambient conditions.|$|E
30|$|According to {{the results}} above, the micro-structure of the as-cast Al–Cu–Mn alloy is {{relatively}} loose bits of aperture formed on fracture sections during the casting and cooling process which relates to {{the properties of the}} studied alloy. A large number of small and shallow dimples indicate the tendency of ductile fractures of as-cast alloy. However, the smooth and large particles on the cross section are incoherently arranged and lamellar compounds and the particle gaps emerged at the junction of large particles. Al–Cu–Mn alloy presents <b>brittle</b> <b>fractures</b> in those weak positions under additional tensile stress due to the poor degree of inter-granular connections. Meanwhile, gaps between large particles are also equivalent to micro-crack sources. Once stress is generated, micro-cracks will converge to grow and connect the main cracks which are blocked at GBs and consequently the as-cast alloy shows <b>brittle</b> <b>fractures.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{continuum}} {{found in}} the structural geometries of shear zones reflects the different deformation mechanisms reigning in the crust, i.e. the changeover from <b>brittle</b> (<b>fracturing)</b> {{at or near the}} surface to ductile (flow) deformation with increasing depth. By passing through the brittle-semibrittle transition the ductile response to deformation is starting to set in. This transition is not tied to a specific depth, but rather occurs over a certain depth range - the so-called alternating zone, where <b>brittle</b> <b>fracturing</b> and plastic flow coexist. The main reason for this is {{found in the}} usually heteromineral composition of rocks, with different minerals showing different responses to applied stresses (for instance, under stress quartz reacts plastically long before feldspars do).
