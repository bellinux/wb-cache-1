The highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa). The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production.|$|R

The work is based on such methods, which were used by Karel Vaníček and the others from the Solar and ozone observatory in Hradec Králové.

Thus, this work aimed to characterise the dissolved carbohydrates at a Brazilian subtropical coastal lagoon (Merin lagoon), {{in addition to}} determining their relationships with environmental parameters and phyto/bacterioplankton communities over one year. We analysed the relationships among physical, chemical and biological parameters by a principal component analysis (PCA) after normalisation of data as z scores. Chlorophyceae showed the highest richness, although Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae showed the highest densities. These classes are essentially represented by centric diatoms (Aulacoseira cf. muzzanensis) and filamentous cyanobacteria (Planktolyngbya limnetica and Planktolyngbya cf. contorta). Merin lagoon showed a strong seasonal behaviour for most of parameters and phytoplanktonic density was mainly correlated with temperature, specific conductance, phosphate and total <b>bright</b> <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration.</b> Only combined dissolved carbohydrates (CDCHOs) were found and their main components were glucose (31. 6 %), mannose/xylose (20. 6 %), ribose (13. 9 %), arabinose (8. 9 %) and galacturonic acid (8. 1 %). The CDCHO amounts were higher in November, March-April and September and the December/January and July/August periods showed lower ones. Ribose was first detected only in the warm months and it gradually decreased with bacterial density. The carbohydrate concentration was coupled to phytoplanktonic density, except in December and January, when the bacterial density was increased. These results supported the significance of dissolved carbohydrates in associations with algae and bacteria in the freshwater planktonic environment. Our data reinforced the influence of phytoplankton community on the natural dissolved carbohydrate pool, besides the significance of such carbon source on the bacterial community dynamic. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{prostate}} specific antigen (PSA) test {{is commonly}} used {{as a tool for}} screening and early detection of prostate cancer. Many factors can affect its sensitivity and specificity as a screening test of prostate cancer. Its efficacy has been much debated ever since its introduction for this purpose. There is a need to better understand the confounding factors, among them seasonal variation in serum PSA levels, {{in order to make the}} best use of this test. By understanding the normal seasonal variation in serum PSA in a specific population, the cutoff point for normality may need to be adjusted according to the time of the year in order to maintain the efficacy of PSA test as a tool for screening early prostate cancer. The aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence of seasonal variations of serum PSA levels and the effects they might exert on the usage of PSA for prostate cancer screening in Hong Kong. Total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA) data were collected from two major laboratories in Hong Kong. In order to safeguard patient confidentiality, no personal identifying information was collected. Data collected were date of test sample collection, client age, tPSA and fPSA levels, PSA measurement method and clinical history of prostate cancer, if available. Three meteorological parameters, namely daily mean air temperature, total <b>bright</b> <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration,</b> and global solar radiation, covering the test sample collection period, were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory official web site. A total of 15, 863 tPSA and 491 fPSA test results from 31 st Oct 2005 to 31 st Dec 2007 were collected. The age of clients has a mean of 58. 4 year and ranges from 13 to 102 year. The tPSA and fPSA values were correlated with moving averages of the meteorological parameters. Although the results varied somewhat between the two laboratories, overall the tPSA results were significantly correlated with the three meteorological parameters. The strongest correlation was with daily mean air temperature. No correlation was shown between the meteorological parameters with either fPSA or percent fPSA (%fPSA). tPSA tests performed during summer periods were more likely to have a value of > 4 ng/mL (chi-square test, p < 0. 001), which is the range of test results for which prostate biopsies would be recommended. It was estimated that there would be at least a 16 % increase in abnormal tPSA values for tests performed between summers should these tests be ordered during the summer months instead. The study found no variations of fPSA and %fPSA with seasonal change. In conclusion, due to seasonal variations and other factors that may affect serum PSA levels, a single abnormal tPSA result should be interpreted with caution. A marginally elevated tPSA value, especially when obtained during summer time, should be repeated and confirmed before biopsies are recommended...|$|E

Methods. We undertook an ecological analysis of long-term trends in perinatal <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> and schizophrenia birth rates based on two mental health registers (Queensland.

The long-term tendencies of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> were analyzed by means of linear regression method and sequential version of the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. All months excluding March, June and September are distinguished by a growing tendency of actual and relative <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration.</b> The number of sunny hours increases in spring, summer and winter, and decreases in autumn. An increase of annual <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> totals (3. 5 h/year) within the 50 -year period was stated. Transformation of the annual course of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> within 50 -year period was detected. The annual maximum of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> during the first 25 -year period occurred in June and September. The second 25 -year period was characterized by increase of the number of sunny hour in May and August and by decrease of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> in June and September. The time of registration of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> extended in the morning hours and before the Sun set as a consequences of low cloudiness negative trend. The structure of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> in Łódź was presented in 5 classes of possible <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> (0 - sunless days, 0. 1 - 25 % - cloudy days, 25. 1 - 50 % - moderately sunny days, 50. 1 - 75 % - sunny days, > 75 % - very sunny days). Only very sunny days were distinguished by a positive annual totals trend, on average 4 days per 10 years. The tendencies of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> recorded in Łódź within fifty last years are representative for Poland and result from the macroscale factor (atmospheric circulation) not only from the influences of local (anthropogenic) conditions. The regular fluctuations in the time series of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> and solar radiation were investigated by Blackman-Tukey classical spectral analysis method. The weak periodicity (statistical insignificance) amounted 8. 3, 2. 5, 2. 8, 3. 8 years and the significance short oscillations amounted 182. 5, 91. 2, 73 days were detected in <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> time series. The total and UV solar radiation time series were characterized by 182. 5, 121. 7, 73 days significance periodicities. The values of transmission coefficient of total and UV solar radiation were investigated. The daily values of transmission coefficient varied from 25 % (total radiation) and 14 % (UV) in December to 50 % (total radiation) and 26 % (UV) in May.
