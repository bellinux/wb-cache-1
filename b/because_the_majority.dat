5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E

5|$|Encountered singly or in groups, the thornback {{guitarfish}} {{feeds on}} small, benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing young drawing sustenance from a yolk sac. Females {{give birth to}} 1–15 pups annually in late summer, following a roughly year-long gestation period. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the thornback guitarfish under Least Concern <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of its range lies within United States waters, where it is common since it has no commercial value and is not heavily fished commercially or recreationally. The status of this species in Mexican waters is inadequately known but may be more precarious.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant.

He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Ofotbanen {{have since}} their {{establishment}} had financial difficulties. The contract with Autolink had helped, but in July 2008, Autolink canceled their contract with Ofotbanen. Two weeks later, Autolink {{announced that they}} would establish their own railway company, {{which they had been}} working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> owner—Rail Management, in turn owned by Mons Bolin—would not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell their shares to Autolink.

5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men {{who were able to}} serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the credit}} {{was given to}} Augustus for each {{subsequent}} Roman military victory after this time, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19BC. (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes.) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, {{was the only other}} general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7BC.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E

5|$|Other {{reinforcements}} included {{elements of}} the 4th Army anti-aircraft units sent from Lipik, but the divisional artillery regiment had not completed mobilisation. The rebels in Bjelovar issued false orders to the 1st Battalion of the 42nd Infantry Regiment, directing it to fall back to Bjelovar. At 11:15, Nedeljković arrived at divisional headquarters and shortly afterwards ordered Raketić to launch a counterattack on the German bridgehead at Barcs at dawn the following day. Nedeljković also visited Divizijski đeneral Dragoslav Milosavljević, {{the commander of the}} 17th Infantry Division Vrbaska on the right flank of the 4th Army, to arrange support from that division during the pending attack. However, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of that division's troops had yet to arrive from Bosnia, all it was able to do was advance its left flank, stationing battalions in Čačinci and Crnac west of Slatina. The 40th Infantry Division Slavonska spent the remainder of the day preparing for the counterattack, but were hindered by German artillery and air attacks. In an indication of the state of his division, during a visit to the front line, Raketić and his chief of staff were fired at by troops of the 42nd Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E
