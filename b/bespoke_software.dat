40|$|Introduction and aim: Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of severe adult {{disability}} in the developed world [1] and functional recovery of the upper limb is particularly poor. With a shift from hospital to community-based rehabilitation [2], novel solutions are needed to deliver the amount of quality therapy that is required for optimum recovery. 3 D motion capture data can enhance a therapist's observational analysis of a patient's impairments however, clinically this is predominantly limited to use within a gait analysis laboratory. This study examined the use of portable motion capture technology and <b>bespoke</b> visualisation <b>software</b> to provide meaningful visual feedback of movement performance (Fig. 1) to patients, and their therapists, during upper limb stroke therapy sessions. We proposed this method would enhance understanding of correct movement patterns, of how improvements can be made during task orientated practice and thus enhance motor relearning to improve functional outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Scintillation {{detectors}} offer a single-step {{detection method}} for fast neutrons and necessitate real-time acquisition, whereas this is redundant in two-stage thermal detection systems using helium- 3 and lithium- 6, where the fast neutrons {{need to be}} thermalized prior to detection. The relative affordability of scintillation detectors and the associated fast digital acquisition systems have enabled entirely new measurement setups that can consist of sizeable detector arrays. These detectors in most cases rely on photo-multiplier tubes which have significant tolerances and result in variations in detector response functions. The detector tolerances and other environmental instabilities must be accounted for in measurements that depend on matched detector performance. This paper presents recent advances made to a high-speed FPGA-based digitizer. The technology described offers a complete solution for fast-neutron scintillation detectors by integrating multichannel high-speed data acquisition technology with dedicated detector high-voltage supplies. This configuration has significant advantages for large detector arrays that require uniform detector responses. We report on <b>bespoke</b> control <b>software</b> and firmware techniques that exploit realtime functionality to reduce setup and acquisition time, increase repeatability and reduce statistical uncertainties...|$|R
