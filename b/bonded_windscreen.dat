5000|$|The Tasmin was {{the first}} {{production}} car {{in the world to}} have both a <b>bonded</b> <b>windscreen</b> and also to incorporate the aerial in the rear screen heater element. As with all TVRs, the running gear was located in a tubular spaceframe steel chassis which was powder coated for extra corrosion resistance. Much of the running gear was sourced from Fords of the period. The suspension and steering was sourced from the Ford Cortina, with TVR engineered rear wishbones. Gearboxes were from the Cortina, Granada, and Sierra. Brakes were discs all round, with the front units from the Granada. The differential (and rear brakes) was from the Jaguar XJ-S.|$|E
40|$|Supersaturated {{designs are}} very {{cost-effective}} to {{scientists and engineers}} at the primary stage of scientific investigation. This article describes a method of constructing supersaturated designs from balanced incomplete block designs that is a generalization of the method of Lin for constructing these designs and a more general approach to constructing these designs. KEY WORDS: Computer-aided designs; Cyclic incomplete block designs; Interchange algorithm; Near-orthogonal array; Saturated designs; Screening designs. Because the main objective of a screening experiment is to identify a few significant factors for further studies, scientists and engineers require designs with the minimum number of runs. Many saturated designs (designs {{with the number of}} factors m equal to n- 1, where n is the number of runs) have proved useful for this purpose. There are sit-uations, however, in which scientists and engineers cannot even afford the number of runs required for these designs. Consider an example in which a car manufacturer is con-ducting a passenger-impact crash test on a planned new four-wheel-drive (4 WD) range. The objective is to find a subset of 54 safety features such as modified airbags, bull-bar, <b>bonded</b> <b>windscreen,</b> (twin front) crush cans, and so forth {{to be included in the}} new car’s total safety system. A suitable design for this test is a Hadamard matrix of order 56 that requires 56 runs (car prototypes). The question is what type of design is to be used when the research and development of the car manufacturer allows at most half of the number of required cars for this test. Designs suitable for this example are called supersatu-rated designs. These designs were introduced by Booth and Cox (1962) and were recently studied further by Lin (1993 a) and Wu (1993) (see also Satterthwaite 1959). These designs are very cost-effective with respect to the number of runs and as such are highly desirable in the context of industrial experimentation. This article describes a method of con-structing supersaturated designs from balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD’s), and a more general approach to constructing these designs...|$|E
50|$|The Maestro {{incorporated}} many {{novel and}} pioneering features for its class. It had a <b>bonded</b> laminated <b>windscreen,</b> homofocal headlamps, body-coloured plastic bumpers, an electronic engine management system, adjustable front seat belt upper anchorage positions, an asymmetrically split rear seat, and a 12,000 mi service interval. The MG and Vanden Plas versions had solid-state instrumentation with digital speedometer and vacuum fluorescent analogue displays for tachometer, fuel and temperature gauges, trip {{computer and a}} voice synthesis warning and information system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Quasi-static {{and dynamic}} roof crush {{simulations}} {{have been carried}} out successfully on a small European car that was loaded at different pitch/roll angles. The results obtained were validated against the MIRA experimental dynamic roof crush outputs and against the Bolton experiments performed under FMVSS 216. Overall, the outcomes show that <b>bonded</b> <b>windscreens</b> contribute to nearly 30 per cent of the roof strength, thus confirming similar results obtained by a number of other researchers. Furthermore, these results show that roof strength is a function of roll and pitch angles which also greatly influence the overall intrusion rate. The new findings illustrate that, having a fixed loading pitch angle, the roof strength decreases when the roll angles are between 15 and 45 °. If the pitch angle is increased, the same phenomenon of reduced strength is observed. However, this does not signify that the roof becomes weaker with increasing pitch angle, because there are limits within which this can occur, and hence the worst-case loading that yields the smallest strength is found at pitch 10 ° and roll 45 °. Therefore, it is recommended in this paper that an update be made to the FMVSS 216, where a roll angle of 45 ° (not 25 °) and a pitch angle of 10 ° (not 5 °) be used as they constitute the worst-case loading condition. As a result, a more realistic test configuration with angles that replicate real-world accident data can be represented...|$|R
