50|$|The {{motorcycle}} sequential gearchange is retained {{and operated}} via a gear shift inside {{the cockpit and}} requires a forward or backward movement to change gear. The <b>brake,</b> <b>accelerator</b> and clutch operate as per a car and are adjustable for reach to accommodate drivers of different size. The seat and steering wheel are fixed in position.|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} carried out in an {{instrumented}} full-cab fixed-base simulator (308 Peugeot). This simulator consisted of virtual reality-based visual and audio systems, a computer program for vehicle motion simulation, and a host computer system for simulating the driving environment. The road scene was projected in front, on five screens (220  ×  165  cm and 1024  ×  1280 pixels) which provided an approximate 270 ° horizontal and 40 ° vertical view of the virtual environment. Force feedback was provided through the steering wheel, and auditory feedback was delivered in the form of engine and outside noises. Driving performance parameters were captured at 60  Hz from the sensors from the equipment (<b>brake,</b> <b>accelerator</b> and steering wheel). The simulator was also equipped with a CAN-bus system to send/receive information to/from the car. Microphones allowed interaction between the driver and the experimenter (e.g. giving instructions to the participant {{at the beginning of the}} simulation).|$|E
5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, {{in which the}} <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals are pressed simultaneously. Classically, the brake is pressed with the ball of the right foot and the accelerator pedal {{is controlled by the}} right heel, while the clutch pedal is pressed by the left foot. However, variants are possible, with the <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the KR175, the KR200 had a {{full set}} of pedals: clutch, <b>brake,</b> and <b>accelerator.</b> The <b>brake</b> pedal still {{operated}} mechanical brakes using cables.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{conventional}} <b>brake,</b> <b>accelerator</b> and clutch pedals of automotive vehicles {{are replaced by}} polymeric-based composite pedals. The purpose of replacement from metallic pedal to polymeric-based composite material {{is to reduce the}} weight, cost and improve material degradation by corrosion. In this paper four different sections of polymeric based brake pedals are analyzed as per the design parameters received from General motors. The sections are analyzed and arrived at a winning concept based on stiffness comparison. A full scale model is developed from the winning concept, while developing full scale model an ergonomic study has been made on few hatch back and SUVs car’s to improve the driver’s comfort and reduce fatigue due to breaking operation. The pedal is modelled using CATIA software and analysis is carried out in ANSYS software. The results have shown polymeric-based composite material meets the requirements of manufacturer’s specification and can be replaced with present metallic pedal. Weight reduction of 66. 7 % is achieved by using composite material...|$|E
50|$|During its {{production}} run, Lincoln made few {{changes to the}} first-generation Navigator. In 1999, alongside {{the addition of the}} InTech V8, power-adjustable <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals were added; the previously optional 17-inch wheels became standard.|$|R
50|$|Early sandrails often {{consisted}} of {{little more than}} a steering wheel, <b>brakes</b> and <b>accelerator.</b> However, today an entire industry is built around all kinds of accessories such as HID and LED headlamps, radios, passenger communications headsets and GPS navigation devices.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003: Power-adjustable <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals were {{available}} on 2003 Voyagers. Anti-lock brakes remained optional for the upscale LX, but {{were no longer}} available for base Voyagers. The Voyager was discontinued after this year {{and was replaced by}} the little-changed SWB Town and Country.|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{supplied}} {{a vehicle}} which was temporarily outfitted with hand <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> ring (the car {{was equipped with}} an automatic transmission and did not require a clutch controller). As part of the agreement GO became an official sponsor of the race, hosting a trackside tent during the three-day event.|$|R
50|$|Traffic Jam Assistant {{option for}} Driving Assistant Plus, {{improved}} BMW Parking Assistant (<b>accelerator,</b> <b>brake</b> pedal, gear shift controls) became available for BMW X5 from December 2013.|$|R
50|$|Left-foot braking is the {{technique}} of using the left foot to operate the brake pedal in an automobile, leaving the right foot dedicated to the throttle pedal. It contrasts with the practice of using the left foot to operate the clutch pedal, leaving the right foot to share the duties of controlling both <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals.|$|R
5000|$|As with E-Type {{the player}} {{took control of}} the car using the mouse. The three Acorn mouse buttons {{represent}} (from left) the Clutch, <b>Brake</b> and <b>Accelerator.</b> This adds to the [...] "realism" [...] of the game as this corresponds to the typical layout of the car's foot pedals. Keyboard keys were used for gear changes (in Manual or Electronic gearbox mode).|$|R
50|$|Some cars {{also have}} memory adjustments, which can recall (usually) two {{different}} adjustments {{of the seat}} by pressing a button. The 1981 Cadillac was the first car to offer this feature in its modern version. By the 1990s, these systems began allowing customized settings and adjustment for such conveniences as rearview mirrors, <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals, climate control and the car's stereo system.|$|R

50|$|With {{the series}} of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first {{adjusted}} {{the distance between the}} <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedal on automatic-transmission models. Later repairs, of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978, added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park. As a byproduct of sudden unintended acceleration, vehicles now include gear stick patterns and brake interlock mechanisms to prevent inadvertent gear selection.|$|R

50|$|Bentley Continental R {{production}} finally ceased in 2003 and was {{the last}} car still based on the SZ Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit platform (4 door cars had already been superseded in 1998 by the new Bentley Arnage / Rolls Royce Silver Seraph) and with features unique to the company which have disappeared on cars built since, such as floor mounted <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals, sill level floors and mineral oil suspension and braking systems. The Bentley Continental R has become acknowledged {{as the end of}} an era, and a rare modern classic.|$|R
40|$|This report {{represents}} {{the results of}} a preliminary study to determine if there is a valid cause to question the positional relationship of <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals in contemporary auto-mobiles. Ten subjects were tested to determine {{how long it takes to}} move the foot from the <b>accelerator</b> to the <b>brake</b> pedal (a) in the same horizontal plane, and (b) wirh a 6 -in. height differential. Experimental results indicated that at high speeds, a reduction in stopping distance of upwards o f 14 ft. could be affected for the case tested...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} on Grand Ville models included a 455 cubic-inch V8 engine (for 1971-74 models, a 400 cubic-inch V8 was standard and the 455 optional for 1975), Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes. Popular options included air conditioning, power windows and driver's seat, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with tape deck and much more. One of the rarest options available on Grand Villes and other full-sized Pontiacs {{during this period}} was the adjustable <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals offered from 1974 to 1976.|$|R

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} VIAC, the VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge, a test {{of autonomous}} driving from Italy to China using four electric vehicles. The vehicles were equipped with a complete sensorial suite that involveddifferent kinds of sensors like cameras, laser scanners, GPS, and others; they feature autonomous capabilities thanks to a x-by-wire subsystem {{able to control the}} steering wheel, <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator.</b> Usually the tests were performed in a vehicle following fashion, namely following a manually operated vehicle, but in many trip stretches fully autonomous capabilities were tested. This paper focuses on vehicle equipment and capabilities, introducing the sensing systems that were tested during the journey...|$|R
50|$|The Volvo FL6 {{is powered}} by Volvo’s D6B 180-250 hp, six-cylinder {{turbocharged}} intercooled diesel engine. The control system had a major update, with Volvo's TEA electronics architecture {{to bring it to}} line with the rest of its bigger cousins. Inline fuel injection pump was replaced with the EDC rotary distributor pump from Bosch with the identical horsepower; despite the loss of supercharger from the previous D6A engine. The cruise control, automatic exhaust <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> now became the so-called fly by wire as standard. Full integration {{with the rest of the}} vehicle system such as Electronic Suspension Control and ABS made it much more efficient and user friendly.|$|R
50|$|Unintended {{acceleration}} {{resulting from}} pedal misapplication is a driver error wherein the driver presses the <b>accelerator</b> when <b>braking</b> is intended. Some shorter drivers' feet {{may not be}} long enough to touch the floor and pedals, making them more likely to press the wrong pedal {{due to a lack}} of proper spatial or tactile reference. Pedal misapplication may be related to pedal design and placement, as in cases where the <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> are too close to one another, or the accelerator pedal too large. The US NHTSA estimates 16,000 accidents per year in USA, when drivers intend to apply the brake but mistakenly apply the accelerator.|$|R
50|$|Pedals may be {{used for}} driving {{simulations}} or flight simulations. In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate <b>accelerator,</b> <b>brake,</b> and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals.|$|R
5000|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{that some of these}} systems are susceptible to hacking, allowing for external control of the vehicle. While generally such hack demonstrations like remote activation of the horn or windshield wipers/washers fall into the [...] "annoying or amusing" [...] category, other hacks involving the <b>accelerator,</b> <b>brakes,</b> and transmission have much more serious security and safety implications.|$|R
30|$|Driving {{tests were}} {{performed}} using a driving simulator, which {{had previously been}} constructed at Kanazawa University and validated in terms of usefulness as a simulator (Yamakoshi et al. 2009 b; Yamakoshi et al. 2009 a). The simulator consists of an adjustable car seat, steering wheel, gear lever, clutch, <b>brake,</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals for vehicle control. The system generates realistic monotonous roadway scenery, which is projected on a 1219 × 1626 -mm screen, placed 1.3 m {{in front of the}} midpoint between the driver’s eyes. The screen provided the driver with a 65 ° horizontal field of view. Auditory feedback is provided by speakers and includes engine sound. In addition, the road condition is transmitted through the steering wheel by mechanical vibration.|$|R
5000|$|Boxer DTV (Boxer Driver Training Vehicle) — This variant is {{equipped}} with a training module. The driver sits in the conventional driver’s station and the instructor is seated in an elevated position in the driver training cabin. Active occupant protection is designed to protect the crew sitting exposed in the driver training cabin. In the event of a roll-over accident, the instructor and upper occupant seats are electronically retracted into the Driver Training Module. In normal use, the instructor can monitor the trainee driver via a duplicated control and display unit and override gear selector, <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedal of the driver’s station. Steering override is available as an option. Crew consists of a trainee driver, instructor, plus up to two additional trainee passengers ...|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} the deficiency of ultrasonic sensor and camera, this paper proposed {{a method of}} autonomous parking based on the self-driving car, using HDL- 32 E LiDAR. First the 3 -D point cloud data was preprocessed. Then we calculated the minimum size of parking space according to the dynamic theories of vehicle. Second the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm was improved in two aspects based on the moving characteristic of autonomous car. And we calculated the parking path {{on the basis of}} the vehicle’s dynamics and collision constraints. Besides, we used the fuzzy logic controller to control the <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> in order to realize the stably of speed. At last the experiments were conducted in an autonomous car, and the results show that the proposed automatic parking system is feasible and effective...|$|R
50|$|Heel-and-toe {{shifting}} is {{used before}} entry into a turn while a vehicle is under braking, preparing the transmission {{to be in}} the optimal range of rpm to accelerate out of the turn. One benefit of downshifting before entering a turn is to eliminate the jolt to the drivetrain, or any other unwanted dynamics. The jolt will not upset the vehicle as badly when going in a straight line, but the same jolt while turning may upset the vehicle enough to cause loss of control if it occurs after the turn has begun. Sporting vehicles are usually modified (if necessary) so that the heights of the <b>brake</b> and <b>accelerator</b> pedals are closely matched when the brake is sufficiently depressed, and the pedals are not too far apart to permit easy use of heel-and-toe.|$|R
