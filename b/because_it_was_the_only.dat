5|$|Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were {{a close-knit}} couple, and {{contrary}} to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, {{who grew up in}} a warm family atmosphere. With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E

50|$|Sachs {{explains}} {{the convergence of}} energeia and entelecheia as follows, and uses the word actuality to describe the overlap between them:Just as energeia extends to entelecheia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> activity which makes a thing what <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> entelecheia extends to energeia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end or perfection which has being only in, through, and during activity.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E

25|$|Painters {{continued}} to include Jane Seymour in pictures of King Henry VIII long after she died, mainly because Henry {{continued to}} look back on her with favour as the only wife who gave him a son.

Filming also took place at night aboard two railcars at the Forest Glen Metro station in Maryland.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} of the settlement of Acolman is attributed to the Acolhuas, a Chichimeca tribe, around the 8th century. The settlement started out independent but was first conquered by the Huexotzincas and remained subject to one dominion or another since. By the time of King Nezahualcoyotl, Acolman was an important town in the Texcoco dominion, after it was conquered by the Aztecs in 1396. The town was important <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> place in Mesoamerica that specialized in the breeding and raising of dogs (today known as the breed called xoloitzcuintli).|$|E
25|$|The refined nebular {{model was}} {{developed}} {{entirely on the}} basis of observations of the Solar System <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one known until the mid-1990s.

As of August 30, 2013, the discovery of 941 extrasolar planets has turned up many surprises, and the nebular model must be revised to account for these discovered planetary systems, or new models considered.|$|E

25|$|B.subg. Isostylis {{was first}} {{published}} by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen; thus its full name, with author citation, is Banksia subg. Isostylis R.Br. Brown's arrangement was the first infrageneric arrangement of Banksia, making B.subg.Isostylis Banksias first infrageneric taxon. Brown erected B.subg. Isostylis to contain B.ilicifolia, which was then the only known Banksia with a dome-shaped inflorescence. He did not explicitly name a type species for the subgenus, but B.ilicifolia is treated as the type <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> member when the subgenus was published.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, a Mini Moke {{was the first}} motor vehicle to be driven on Pitcairn Island and thereby became the most remote vehicle on Earth. It was chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{off-road}} vehicle that could be lifted by the island's only crane—there being no dock or airstrip at Pitcairn. However, the rough terrain and heavy rainfall proved {{too much for the}} Moke and it soon broke down. Eventually, a second and later a third Moke were sent to the island, and by cannibalising the three for spares, the island's sole vehicle remained running until at least 1988.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter had {{intended}} Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when The Thing was a financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, Christine, was the 1983 {{adaptation of the}} Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury {{which turns out to}} have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. Christine did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing offered to him at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{house is}} famous for being the home of Sands Hotel band leader and musical {{conductor}} Antonio Morelli and his wife Helen during the Rat Pack heyday of the 1950s and 60s. For thirty years it served as an after-hours congregating spot {{for some of the}} biggest names in entertainment including Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, and many other famous names in show business. Morelli was very active in music circles in Nevada and he and his wife were also very active in various charitable causes through the years. The house also has great significance for its mid-century modern architecture and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> remaining home from the Desert Inn Estates, the community demolished to make way for the Wynn Las Vegas resort.|$|E
25|$|Further to the southwest, Narrow Street, Limehouse's {{historic}} spine, {{which runs}} {{along the back of}} the Thames wharves, boasts one of the few surviving early Georgian terraces in London. Next to the terrace is the historic Grapes pub, rebuilt in 1720 and well-known to Charles Dickens, featuring as the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in Our Mutual Friend. A few doors along was Booty's Riverside Bar but this closed down in 2012. Almost every building {{on the other side of}} Narrow Street was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, including hundreds of houses, Taylor Walker & Co's Barley Mow Brewery and a school. One notable exception is a former public house, known locally as 'The House They Left Behind', <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Victorian terrace to survive. It still stands today, with the aid of three large supporting pillars.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{attended}} {{high school}} in Williston, North Dakota, where he played varsity basketball and led the team to two state titles. He also played football, was a pitcher on the baseball team, and threw the discus {{in track and field}} competitions. The high school now has a sports complex named after him. His brother Chuck speculated years later that the three Jackson sons threw themselves passionately into athletics <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> time they were allowed to do what other children were doing. Jackson attracted the attention of several baseball scouts. Their notes found their way to future NBA coach Bill Fitch, who had previously coached baseball, and had been doing some scouting for the Atlanta Braves. Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the University of North Dakota in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of Pet Sounds, Wilson was using up to six of the eight tracks on the {{multitrack}} master {{so that he could}} record the voice of each member separately, allowing him greater control over the vocal balance in the final mix. After mixing down the four-track to mono for overdubbing via an eight-track recorder, six of the remaining seven tracks were usually dedicated to each of the Beach Boys' vocals. The last track was usually reserved for additional elements such as extra vocals or instrumentation. Vocals were recorded using two Neumann U-47s, which Dennis, Carl and Jardine would sing on, and a Shure 545 used by Brian for his leads. Love sang most of the album's bass vocals, and necessitated an extra microphone due to his low volume range. Some of the vocals were recorded at CBS Columbia Square, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> facility in Los Angeles with an eight-track recorder.|$|E
25|$|Some historians even {{proposed}} {{that they also}} had regular contacts {{with the people of}} Western Micronesia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> area in the Oceania that had rice crops, tuba (fermented coconut sap), and tradition of betel nut chewing when the first Europeans arrived there. The uncanny resemblance of complex body tattoos among the Visayans and those of Borneo also proved some interesting connection between Borneo and ancient Philippines. Magellan's chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, mentioned that merchants and ambassadors from all surrounding areas came to pay tribute to the rajah of Sugbu (Cebu) for the purpose of trade. While Magellan's crew were with the rajah, a representative from Siam was paying tribute to the rajah. Miguel López de Legazpi also wrote how merchants from Luzon and Mindoro had come to Cebu for trade, and he also mentioned how the Chinese merchants regularly came to Luzon for the same purpose. The Visayan Islands had earlier encounters with Greek traders in 21 AD. Its people enjoyed extensive trade contacts with other cultures. Indians, Japanese, Arabs, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Thais, Malays and Indonesians as traders or immigrants.|$|E
25|$|The Tobruk Ferry Service, {{made up of}} Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy warships, {{played an}} {{important}} role in the defence of Tobruk providing gunfire support, supplies, fresh troops and by ferrying out the wounded. Control of Tobruk was useful to the Allies <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> significant port east of Benghazi and west of Alexandria. The supply of Axis troops on the Egyptian frontier could have been eased by sea transport to Tobruk. The siege of Tobruk was the first occasion in the war that German Panzer units had been stopped. The siege of Tobruk was lifted in December 1941 in the course of Operation Crusader and Axis forces re-captured the port in 1942, after defeating the Eighth Army in the Battle of Gazala. Two destroyers, three sloops, seven anti-submarine vessels and minesweepers, seven store carriers and schooners, six A lighters and one fast minelayer were sunk, a total of 26 ships. Seven destroyers, a sloop, eleven anti-submarine and minesweeping vessels, three gunboats and a schooner were damaged, a total of 23 vessels. Six Merchant Navy ships and a schooner were sunk and six merchant ships were damaged; a total of 62 ships were sunk or damaged.|$|E
