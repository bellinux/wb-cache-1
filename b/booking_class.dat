50|$|In {{the airline}} industry, {{available}} seats are {{commonly referred to}} as inventory. The inventory of an airline is generally classified into service classes (e.g. first, business or economy class) and up to 26 <b>booking</b> <b>classes,</b> for which different prices and booking conditions apply. Inventory data is imported and maintained through a schedule distribution system over standardized interfaces. One of the core functions of inventory management is inventory control. Inventory control steers how many seats are available in the different <b>booking</b> <b>classes,</b> by opening and closing individual <b>booking</b> <b>classes</b> for sale. In combination with the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System, the price for each sold seat is determined. In most cases, inventory control has a real time interface to an airline’s Yield management system to support a permanent optimization of the offered <b>booking</b> <b>classes</b> in response to changes in demand or pricing strategies of a competitor.|$|R

5000|$|Airlines {{and other}} travel {{companies}} use differentiated pricing regularly, as they sell travel {{products and services}} simultaneously to different market segments. This is often done by assigning capacity to various booking classes, which sell for different prices and which {{may be linked to}} fare restrictions. The restrictions or [...] "fences" [...] help ensure that market segments buy in the <b>booking</b> <b>class</b> range that has been established for them. For example, schedule-sensitive business passengers who are willing to pay $300 for a seat from city A to city B cannot purchase a $150 ticket because the $150 <b>booking</b> <b>class</b> contains a requirement for a Saturday-night stay, or a 15-day advance purchase, or another fare rule that discourages, minimizes, or effectively prevents a sale to business passengers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{actual size}} and weight limits of cabin baggage can differ widely, {{in some cases they}} are {{dependent}} on the aircraft model being used, in other cases it depends on the <b>booking</b> <b>class.</b> Due to the lack of standardization a large number of different specifications were created by the airlines on the maximum permitted cabin luggage restrictions (see below). In 2015 the IATA made an effort to introduce a common smaller size for cabin luggage by introducing the [...] "IATA Cabin OK" [...] logo. Major airlines have expressed their interest to accept luggage of that size on their flights. This is specified as 55 x 35 x 20 cm (or 21.5 x 13.5 x 7.5 inches). There were news that the move was backed by nine airlines including Lufthansa, Emirates and Qatar Airlines. The new size restrictions were criticised widely with the introduction program to be put on hold a few days later. Consequently none of the mentioned airlines has introduced the new format (by April 2016).|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{multiple}} <b>booking</b> <b>class</b> airline-seat inventory control problem {{that relates to}} either a single flight leg or to multiple flight legs. During the time before the flight, the airline may face the problems of (1) what are the suitable prices for the opened booking classes, and (2) when to close those opened booking classes. This work deals with these two problems by only using the pricing policy. In this paper, a dynamic pricing model is developed in which the demand for tickets is modeled as a discrete time stochastic process. An important result of this work is that the strategy for the ticket booking policy {{can be reduced to}} sets of critical decision periods, which eliminates the need for large amounts of data storage. Airline companies ’ revenues come mostly from seat ticket sales. Therefore, it is natural that each company attempts to establish an optimal ticket selling policy to attain the maximum possible reve-nue for each flight, in the sense stated below. A pool of identical seats is usually divided into several booking classes, each having different ticket prices...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of Low Cost Carriers (LCC) and their {{simplified}} fare structures has created "semi-restricted" fare structures where lower classes are undifferentiated except for price, while higher fare classes are still differentiated by various advance purchase and booking restrictions. The problem this causes is two-fold: first, traditional revenue management systems, which operate {{based on the assumption}} of demand independence, will see demand "spiral down" into the lowest booking classes as passengers will buy the lowest available fare in the absence of fare restrictions. Second, airlines must maximize network revenues across two different fare structures, a more-restricted structure used on markets without an LCC presence, and the semirestricted structure for markets where LCC competition exists. This thesis describes methods of dealing with these two problems: Hybrid Forecasting (HF), which forecasts "product-oriented" demand using traditional forecasting methods while simultaneously forecasting "price-oriented" demand for those passengers who will buy the lowest available fare, and Fare Adjustment (FA), which is used at the booking limit optimizer level to account for the sell-up potential of passengers (probability a passenger will book in a higher class if his original <b>booking</b> <b>class</b> is denied). Fare Adjustment allows the airline to deal with multiple fare structures separately. The goal of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive summary of results when an airline uses HF and FA simultaneously in two different multiple fare structure, competitive networks. An alternate Fare Adjustment formulation will also be introduced and tested in these competitive environments. (cont.) Results from the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulator (PODS) demonstrate that in a more restrictive network, HF and FA used in conjunction with one another achieve revenue increases of approximately 2 - 4 % above traditional forecasting methods. In an environment with a fully unrestricted fare structure for LCC markets, HF and FA together generate revenue gains of over 20 % above traditional methods. by Matthew R. Kayser. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{popularity}} of the “low-fare ” (or sometimes called “no-frills”) airline business model, no comprehensive framework has ever been developed to evaluate the level of implementation of this business model. In the paper, we propose a framework for evaluating the extent to which an airline has implemented a “low-fare ” business model. The framework (SFC) consists of three dimensions: (a) strategic direction factors; (b) pricing factors; (c) cost structure factors (COFA). Strategic direction factors primarily focus on the top-level strategic decisions of an airline: growth concepts, the range of flights, spatial strategy and target group selection. These factors serve to differentiate the “low-fare ” airlines from more traditional rivals on a strategic level. Pricing factors evaluate differentiators at the level of market offer: relative ticket prices, the number of <b>booking</b> <b>classes,</b> ticket restrictions, interlining, penalties, non-ticket income and target load levels. These factors differentiate the “low-fare ” business model on the value proposition level. Cost structure factors focus on internal cost-saving measures designed to significantly reduce the average costs per passenger: outsourcing, aircraft type homogeneity, levels of aircraft utilization, labour factors, airport costs, distribution and in-flight arrangements. The SFC framework allows academics and practitioners to coherently analyze and identify gaps betwee...|$|R

40|$|Forecasting {{is arguably}} the most {{critical}} component of airline management. Essentially, airlines forecast demand to plan the supply of services to respond to that demand. Forecasts of short-term demand facilitate tactical decisions such as pricing and seat inventory control-the allocation of seats among the various <b>booking</b> <b>classes.</b> In this study, an evaluation was conducted of the relative performance of selected forecasting techniques used to predict short-term demand for air transportation. Short-term in this context is defined as intervals less than eight weeks prior to the date of departure. The selected techniques were representative of current practices in the airline industry including simple time series, linear regression, and booking pickup models. Two types of pickup models were analyzed: the classical model and an advanced model. The set of models was subjected to the same short-term forecasting environment where the historical data was restricted to ten weekly departures and the forecast horizon limited to seven weeks in the future. Eight scenarios were examined to study the effects of varying the size of the historical data set as well as the length of the forecast horizon. Performance was determined {{on the basis of the}} relative accuracy of the forecasts measured through the use of selected metrics. It will be shown that the booking pickup models consistently outperformed the time series and regression models and the advanced pickup model produced the best results. Furthermore, it was discovered that increasing the size of the historical data set beyond seven weekly departures did not have a significant impact on the performance of the various models and in most cases the performance of the models deteriorated as the size of the historical data set was increased.
