40|$|The Layered {{architectural}} style presents a quandary for software architects. On the one hand, the style provides important advantages: separation of concerns, abstraction, ease of evolution, etc. Each layer {{can build on}} lower layers to add specific abstractions or services. On the other hand, the layers can become opaque, rigid barriers that inhibit the ability to adapt to new application needs. Consider, for example that some application functions may not need the services of all the layers; {{it may be more}} efficient to implement them in a lower layer. We refer to these as <b>bypassing</b> <b>functions.</b> In such situations, where changes to lower layers are needed, developers must resort to writing tricky, intricate, low-level code, which is time-consuming, error prone, and not portable. We address this phenomenon in the context of middleware, and extend the middleware notion of model-driven development with new modeling syntax, code generation tools, and development processes {{to make it easier to}} build bypassing implementations. We will describe our approach and provide several illustrative examples and performance data. We will use this data to argue that bypassing implementations can provide more efficient use of a server’s resources, leading to overall better client experience. Our core contribution is this idea: model-driven code generation can enable application developers to conveniently bypass middleware layers when they are not needed, thus improving the server’s performance...|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli DinB (DNA {{polymerase}} IV) possesses {{an enzyme}} architecture resulting in specialized lesion <b>bypass</b> <b>function</b> {{and the potential}} for creating − 1 frameshifts in homopolymeric nucleotide runs. We have previously shown that the mutagenic potential of DinB is regulated by the DNA damage response protein UmuD 2. In the current study, we employ a pre-steady-state fluorescence approach to gain a mechanistic understanding of DinB regulation by UmuD 2. Our results suggest that DinB, like its mammalian and archaeal orthologs, uses a template slippage mechanism to create single base deletions on homopolymeric runs. With 2 -aminopurine as a fluorescent reporter in the DNA substrate, the template slippage reaction results in a prechemistry fluorescence change that is inhibited by UmuD 2. We propose a model in which DNA templates containing homopolymeric nucleotide runs, when bound to DinB, are in an equilibrium between non-slipped and slipped conformations. UmuD 2, when bound to DinB, displaces the equilibrium in favor of the non-slipped conformation, thereby preventing frameshifting and potentially enhancing DinB activity on non-slipped substrates...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{benefit of}} off-pump {{coronary}} artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery may be reduced by strokes caused by microemboli produced after aortic side-clamping for proximal bypass anastomoses. The Heartstring device allows constructing proximal bypass anastomoses without side-clamping of the aorta. Methods: This retrospective study describes 260 consecutive patients who underwent OPCAB surgery; 442 proximal anastomoses were performed with the Heartstring device in this series. Ten {{percent of the patients}} were randomly sampled before discharge to undergo a coronary angiogram for assessment of graft patency. Results: Intraoperative Doppler measurements confirmed regular <b>bypass</b> <b>function.</b> Early mortality occurred in 4 patients (1. 5 %), and stroke occurred in 2 patients (0. 8 %). Device-related bleeding was negligible, and there were no cases of aortic dissection. Perioperative ischemia occurred in 8 patients (3. 1 %). Predischarge coronary angiography evaluations in 25 of the patients (of 260) showed that all 42 Heartstring-assisted anastomoses (of 442) were patent. Conclusions: Clampless performance of proximal bypass anastomoses combined with OPCAB is associated with a very low incidence of stroke complications. Short-term follow-up has shown excellent results regarding bypass patency and other adverse events. Prospective randomized trials are required to confirm the advantage of this technique...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define {{predictors}} of the passability duration of femoropopliteal bypasses on the basis of both own results and medical literature. Documentation studies and comparative methods were used in the study. The subjects are patients of the Pula General hospital, operated in the Surgical ward in the period between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 2001. Predictors of the passability duration of femoropopliteal bypasses was determined by examination of subjects and the comparison to results found in literature.

The duration of openness of femoropopliteal bypasses applied to patients suffering from occlusive diseases of the arteries in the femoropopliteal segment can be determined based on the preoperatively established state of the drainage path on lower limbs, on the grade of circulatory insufficiency at the moment of surgery, on the type of femoropoliteal bypass (either by great saphenous vein or by artificial bypass) as well as based on other factors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: homografts {{have been}} used {{since the early days}} of {{vascular}} surgery, but have failed to provide long-term success. Arteries supplying organ transplants seldom show signs of biodegradation. We therefore introduced fresh arterial homograft repair with consecutive immunosupression (ATX). Aim: to assess feasibility and clinical usefulness of ATXSetting: university teaching hospital. Material and Method: conduits were harvested during multi-organ procurement and stored in Custodiol®. Implantation followed immediately. Viability of the transplant was documented in all cases. Patients received immunosuppession for the duration of <b>bypass</b> <b>function.</b> Results: thirteen patients received ATX for critical limb ischaemia (M/F: 11 / 2, age: 62 yr, previous revascularisations: 4. 5 (1 – 8), median run-off index 5, previous organ transplant: n= 2. Most bypasses were anastomosed to single tibial or pedal vessels. There was no early failure. Within an average follow up of 12 months there were 6 graft thromboses in 5 patients, successfully revised in 4. Three limbs were lost after 2, 5 and 6 months due to graft failure. Graft rejection was shown in 1 out of 3 explanted grafts. Concusion: we report a concept, which may circumvent the problem of biologic graft degeneration.

40|$|AbstractVKORC 1 and VKORC 1 L 1 are {{enzymes that}} both {{catalyze}} {{the reduction of}} vitamin K 2, 3 -epoxide via vitamin K quinone to vitamin K hydroquinone. VKORC 1 is the key enzyme of the classical vitamin K cycle by which vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins are γ-carboxylated by the hepatic γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX). In contrast, the VKORC 1 paralog enzyme, VKORC 1 L 1, is chiefly responsible for antioxidative function by reduction of vitamin K to prevent damage by intracellular reactive oxygen species. To investigate tissue-specific vitamin K 2, 3 -epoxide reductase (VKOR) function of both enzymes, we quantified mRNA levels for VKORC 1, VKORC 1 L 1, GGCX, and NQO 1 and measured VKOR enzymatic activities in 29 different mouse tissues. VKORC 1 and GGCX are highly expressed in liver, lung and exocrine tissues including mammary gland, salivary gland and prostate suggesting important extrahepatic roles for the vitamin K cycle. Interestingly, VKORC 1 L 1 showed highest transcription levels in brain. Due {{to the absence of}} detectable NQO 1 transcription in liver, we assume this enzyme has no <b>bypass</b> <b>function</b> with respect to activation of VKD coagulation proteins.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} outcome of vacuum-assisted wound closure (VAC(®)) therapy for {{infected}} bypass grafts. METHODS: A retrospective 7 -year review of patient records from 2004 to 2011 of all patients receiving VAC(®) therapy for infected bypass grafts. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with 42 wounds and 45 infected bypass (28 synthetic) grafts received VAC(®) treatment. Two serious bleeding episodes from the suture lines occurred. The median VAC(®) therapy time was 20 days. The proportion of patent bypass grafts was 91 % (41 / 45) at a median time of 3. 5 months {{from the start of}} VAC(®) therapy. Five patients with seven bypasses had persistent infection or re-infection, and the total graft preservation rate was 76 % (34 / 45). The median follow-up time was 15 months. The presence of two infected bypass grafts in one groin wound was associated with an increased major amputation rate (hazard ratio (HR) 7. 4 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 0 - 27. 5]), and synthetic graft infection (HR 5. 0 [95 % CI 1. 5 - 17. 4]) and non-healed wound (HR 3. 6 [95 % CI 1. 5 - 8. 7]) were associated with mortality.

40|$|OBJECT: Preliminary {{experience}} with the C-Port Flex-A Anastomosis System (Cardica, Inc.) to enable rapid automated anastomosis {{has been reported in}} coronary artery bypass surgery. The goal of the current study was to define the feasibility and safety of this method for high-flow extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery in a clinical series. METHODS: In a prospective study design, patients with symptomatic carotid artery (CA) occlusion were selected for C-Port-assisted high-flow EC-IC bypass surgery if they met the following criteria: 1) transient or moderate permanent symptoms of focal ischemia; 2) CA occlusion; 3) hemodynamic instability; and 4) had provided informed consent. Bypasses were done using a radial artery graft that was proximally anastomosed to the superficial temporal artery trunk, the cervical external, or common CA. All distal cerebral anastomoses were performed on M 2 branches using the C-Port Flex-A system. RESULTS: Within 6 months, 10 patients were enrolled in the study. The distal automated anastomosis could be accomplished in all patients; the median temporary occlusion time was 16. 6 +/- 3. 4 minutes. Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed good <b>bypass</b> <b>function</b> in 9 patients, and in 1 the anastomosis was classified as fair. There was 1 major perioperative complication that consisted of the creation of a pseudoaneurysm due to a hardware problem. In all but 1 case the bypass was shown to be patent on DSA after 7 days; furthermore, in 1 patient a late occlusion developed due to vasospasm after a sylvian hemorrhage. One-week follow-up DSA revealed transient asymptomatic extracranial spasm of the donor artery and the radial artery graft in 1 case. Two patients developed a limited zone of infarction on CT scanning during the follow-up course. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic CA occlusion, C-Port Flex-A-assisted high-flow EC-IC bypass surgery is a technically feasible procedure. The system needs further modification to achieve a faster and safer anastomosis to enable a conclusive comparison with standard and laser-assisted methods for high-flow bypass surgery...|$|E
40|$|Quando um conversor opera com uma larga diferenÃa entre os nÃveis de tensÃo de entrada e de saÃda, normalmente Ã possÃvel identificar uma reduÃÃo significante no seu desempenho. A razÃo disto Ã o aumento da quantidade de energia processada, que primeiramente precisa ser armazenada em um elemento passivo (indutor), antes de ser entregue Ã carga. Ã possÃvel dizer que quÃo maior for a quantidade dessa energia âindiretaâ, menor serÃ a eficiÃncia do sistema. Tal situaÃÃo Ã especialmente crÃtica para inversores e retificadores com correÃÃo de fator de potÃncia (PFC), visto que a razÃo cÃclica dos interruptores abrange praticamente todos os possÃveis valores. Em casos em que a diferenÃa entre o valor de pico da tensÃo CA e o valor mÃdio da tensÃo CC Ã grande, o Ãndice de modulaÃÃo Ã desviado consideravelmente de 1 e, consequentemente, maiores perdas sÃo esperadas. Para lidar com tal situaÃÃo, Ã proposto um retificador com caracterÃstica abaixadora e elevadora utilizando uma funÃÃo chamada de bypass. Esta funÃÃo permite que o retificador escolha entre os dois barramentos o que melhor se adapta ao nÃvel de saÃda desejado em funÃÃo do ponto de operaÃÃo da tensÃo senoidal de entrada, maximizando a eficiÃncia. Algumas das vantagens esperadas com a utilizaÃÃo da funÃÃo bypass sÃo: reduÃÃo das perdas totais por meio da operaÃÃo parcial com estÃgio Ãnico; maior nÃmero de nÃveis de tensÃo, reduzindo a corrente de modo comum e o volume do filtro de entrada, alÃm de resultar em menores esforÃos de tensÃo sobre os semicondutores; e, finalmente, reduÃÃo de perdas adicionais e no tamanho do sistema, visto que o conversor Buck de saÃda Ã projetado para apenas uma fraÃÃo da potÃncia total. Em adiÃÃo, sÃo apresentadas possÃveis configuraÃÃes de conversores de potÃncia para o carregamento de baterias de veÃculos elÃtricos. Topologias de retificadores trifÃsicos com PFC com corrente de entrada senoidal e tensÃo de saÃda controlada sÃo analisadas e propostas, e suas funcionalidades e caracterÃsticas bÃsicas descritas brevemente. FÃrmulas analÃticas para o cÃlculo dos esforÃos de tensÃo e corrente sobre os semicondutores de potÃncia sÃo fornecidas. A fim de avaliar comparativamente o desempenho das topologias selecionadas, fatores adimensionais de referÃncia sÃo definidos com base nos esforÃos elÃtricos sobre os semicondutores e no volume dos indutores. As caracterÃsticas do sistema proposto, incluindo princÃpio de operaÃÃo, estratÃgia de modulaÃÃo, equaÃÃes de dimensionamento e cÃlculos de perdas e eficiÃncia, sÃo descritas em detalhes. Finalmente, a viabilidade do conceito de bypass Ã demonstrada por meio de resultados experimentais obtidos a partir de um protÃtipo de 22 kW. When {{operating}} with large differences between {{input and output}} voltage levels, it is normally possible to identify a significant reduction {{on the performance of}} practically all topologies in regard of conversion efficiency. Reason for this is the increasing amount of processed energy that needs to be firstly stored in a passive element (inductor) before reaching the load. It is therefore possible to say that the higher the amount of such âindirectâ energy is; the lower will be the converter efficiency. Such situation is especially critical when considering the operation of inverters or controlled rectifiers with power factor correction (PFC) because the converter sweeps practically all the possible values of duty cycle. In the case the difference between peak AC value and DC value is large; the modulation index will strongly deviate from 1. Consequently, even higher amount of losses are expected. In order to deal with the above referred drawbacks, it is proposed a 5 -level three-phase PFC rectifier with an innovative approach, named bypass concept. This function allows the converter to switch between one of the available DC-links that best matches the required output levels depending on the operating point of the sinus wave, thus maximizing the efficiency. Furthermore, the referred <b>bypass</b> <b>function</b> enables direct access to the required lower voltage level by the load, reducing significantly the amount of losses. The 5 -level operation allows the voltage steps to be lower than those found in three and two-level topologies, from where lower harmonic contents, reduction of common mode current and EMI are observed. Finally, the output DC-DC converters are designed for {{only a fraction of the}} nominal power, having a rather reduced impact on additional losses and also on the converter size. In addition, possible power electronics configurations for charging of EVs are presented. Suitable three-phase PFC rectifier topologies with sinusoidal input currents and controlled output voltage are analyzed and proposed, and their functionality and basic characteristics briefly described. Analytical formulas for calculating the current stresses on the power semiconductors are provided, and in order to evaluate comparatively the performance of selected topologies, dimensionless benchmark factors are derived concerning the semiconductor stresses and the volume of the main inductive components. The characteristics of the proposed system, including the principle of operation, modulation strategy, dimensioning equations and calculated losses and efficiency, are described in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the bypass concept is demonstrated by means of experimental results obtained from a 22 kW hardware prototype...|$|E

SYT 9 and BDNF are downregulated in CS patient brain tissue, further indicating that sub-optimal neurotrophin signaling underlies neurological defects in CS.

By characterizing a Legionella pneumophila mutant defective for differentiation in broth and replication in macrophages, we identified a subfamily of major facilitator superfamily transporters, here named Pht (phagosomal transporter), that also is conserved in two other vacuolar pathogens, Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis. Biolog phenotype microarray analysis indicated that PhtA transports threonine, an essential amino acid. Either excess threonine or threonine peptides <b>bypass</b> phtA <b>function.</b> In minimal medium, phtA mutants do not replicate; in rich broth, the bacteria prematurely differentiate to the transmissive phase, as judged by the kinetics of flaA-gfp expression, heat resistance, and sodium sensitivity.

40|$|Backgrounds: Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) is a 53 amino acid {{polypeptide}} and its receptor EGFR is an established therapeutic target for anti-tumor therapy. Two major categories of EGFR-targeted drugs include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Since EGFR can maintain activation while abrogating the activity of mAbs or TKIs, or <b>bypass</b> signaling <b>functions</b> while successfully circumventing the EGF-EGFR switch, developing new mechanism-based inhibitors is necessary.

The same parameters were unaffected after direct stimulation of electrical activity with tolbutamide, which <b>bypasses</b> mitochondrial <b>function.</b> Furthermore, lowered matrix pH strongly inhibited sustained, but not first-phase, insulin secretion. Our results demonstrate that the matrix pH exerts a control function on oxidative phosphorylation in intact cells and that this mode of regulation is of physiological relevance for the generation of downstream signals leading to insulin granule exocytosis. We propose that matrix pH serves a novel signaling role in sustained cell activation...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that acute lung injury during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) {{is related to the}} activation of neutrophils and the body temperature during bypass, we determined the differential WBC count, plasma elastase concentrations, and lung function before, during, and after CPB in 38 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either normothermic (n = 19, rectal temperature: 35. 9 +/- 0. 1 degrees C, mean +/- SE) or hypothermic (n = 19, 29. 2 +/- 0. 5 degrees C) CPB. The cellular response to the extracorporeal circulation was significantly delayed in the hypothermic group with a later onset of neutrophilia and a later increase in plasma elastase levels during <b>bypass.</b> Lung <b>function</b> deteriorated significantly after CPB as assessed by respiratory index, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and intrapulmonary shunt, independent of bypass temperature. There was a positive correlation between peak elastase concentrations and postoperative respiratory index as well as intrapulmonary shunt (R 2 = 0. 5, p = 0. 002 and R 2 = 0. 45, p = 0. 003, respectively). Besides peak plasma elastase levels, multiple regression revealed no significant influence of other independent factors on postoperative lung dysfunction in our patients...|$|R
40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) encodes an {{antisense}} {{viral gene}} product termed HTLV- 1 basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ). HBZ forms heterodimers with c-Jun, {{a member of}} the AP- 1 family, and promotes its proteasomal degradation. Although most proteasomal substrates are targeted for degradation via conjugation of polyubiquitin chains, we show that ubiquitination is not required for HBZ-mediated proteasomal degradation of c-Jun. We demonstrate that HBZ directly interacts with both the 26 S proteasome and c-Jun and facilitates the delivery of c-Jun to the proteasome without ubiquitination. HBZ acts as a tethering factor between the 26 S proteasome and its substrate, thereby <b>bypassing</b> the targeting <b>function</b> of ubiquitination. These findings disclose a novel viral strategy to utilize the cellular proteolytic system for viral propagation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{agreement}} was controversial, as 34% of respondents believed {{the deal to}} be [...] "undemocratic" [...] according to a survey. The deal was also met with strong criticism from senior politicians of both blocks, including former Moderate Party leader Ulf Adelsohn denouncing it as [...] "an unconditional capitulation", former Culture Ministers Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth and Cecilia Stegö Chilò, and former Defence Ministers Anders Björck and Mikael Odenberg, the latter describing the deal as [...] "a defeat for democracy and parliamentarism". Green Party MEP and former spokesperson Peter Eriksson stated the deal to be [...] "a huge democratic problem" [...] that [...] "in its very <b>function</b> <b>bypasses</b> the usual rules of democracy". Eriksson also remarked that in most democratic countries making such a deal would not be possible.|$|R
40|$|Asexual {{sporulation}} (conidiation) in the {{filamentous fungus}} Aspergillus nidulans requires the early developmental activator fluG. Loss of fluG {{results in the}} blockage of both conidiation and production of the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST). To investigate molecular mechanisms of fluG-dependent developmental activation, 40 suppressors of fluG (SFGs) that conidiate without fluG have been isolated and characterized. Genetic analyses showed that an individual suppression {{is caused by a}} single second-site mutation, and that all sfg mutations but one are recessive. Pairwise meiotic crosses grouped mutations to four loci, 31 of them to sfgA, 6 of them to sfgB, and 1 each to sfgC and sfgD, respectively. The only dominant mutation, sfgA 38, also mapped to the sfgA locus, suggesting a dominant negative mutation. Thirteen sfgA and 1 sfgC mutants elaborated conidiophores in liquid submerged culture, indicating that loss of either of these gene <b>functions</b> not only <b>bypasses</b> fluG <b>function</b> but also results in hyperactive conidiation. While sfg mutants show varying levels of restored conidiation, all recovered the ability to produce ST at near wild-type levels. The fact that at least four loci are defined by recessive sfg mutations indicates that multiple genes negatively regulate conidiation downstream of fluG and that the activity of fluG is required to remove such repressive effects...|$|R
