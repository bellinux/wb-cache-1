5000|$|The {{test was}} so well {{received}} that <b>Bio-Rad</b> created a second {{arm of the}} company, focused on the growing area of diagnostics. With its technical expertise in separations chemistry, <b>Bio-Rad</b> was now positioned {{to contribute to a}} developing clinical diagnostics market. With the T-4 test, <b>Bio-Rad</b> recognized that laboratory diagnostics was evolving into “applied biochemistry”, in which the knowledge and techniques of research are applied to medicine and diagnostics. It was a turning point for the industry—and the company. [...] <b>Bio-Rad</b> expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, <b>Bio-Rad</b> purchased Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics. This strengthened the company’s position in the HIV and infectious disease diagnostic product market. In 2000 and 2004, <b>Bio-Rad</b> divested its semiconductor, optoelectronic metrology, and confocal microscopy product lines. In late 2007, <b>Bio-Rad</b> acquired Switzerland-based DiaMed Holding AG, enhancing Bio-Rad’s position in the immunohematology market. In January 2013, <b>Bio-Rad</b> purchased AbD Serotec, a division of MorphoSys AG.

50|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{specific}} antidote to treat humans that overdose on xylazine. Hemodialysis has been suggested {{as a form of}} treatment, but is usually unfavorable due to the large volume of distribution of xylazine. In addition, due to lack of research in humans, there are no standardized screenings to determine if an overdose has occurred. The detection of xylazine in biological fluids in humans involves various screening methods, such as urine screenings, thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Remedi HS <b>Bio-Rad</b> Laboratories, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).|$|E
