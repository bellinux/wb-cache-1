The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the apparent prevalence of PRRSv in Wallonia, a low density area of pig production (0. 05 pig farms/km²). A phone survey was addressed to 173 of the 276 Walloon <b>breeding</b> <b>pig</b> owners. One hundred and thirty‐two farmers answered the questionnaire and serological tests were performed in 113 herds. If no vaccination was carried out on sows or on piglets, an Elisa test was performed on 10 breeding and/or 5 feeder pig serum samples collected between November 2011 and December 2012. An individual result was considered negative if the s/p ratio was < 0. 4; a herd was considered positive if an s/p ratio ≥ 0. 4 was obtained by at least one of its pigs.

One hundred nine Yorkshire x Landrace; YL, Landrace x Yorkshire; LY which were mainly raised in South Korea were used for this study (31 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for parity 1; 48 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for parity 2 to 6; 30 <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> for parity 7 to 12). Though the results varied from one another, we didn 2 ̆ 7 t find any statistical significant differences within the observed parameters from the different parities studied. Given that our findings were still within the range values of the previously published works therefore our results can be a useful tool to establish a criterion to characterize the process of parturition. In this present study, we were able to established a criteria about the onset of birth by the observation that if a first discharged object is detected from a sow that weighs more than 400 g, it can be confirm that she is already been undergoing the process of farrowing and the good criterion to consider that a sow is undergoing dystocia is an interval of more than 30 min. Moreover, we believe that the parity of <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> is not necessarily required in establishing criterion in detecting the onset of farrowing and dystocia because we found no significant difference results among the different parities studied.

The aims {{of this study were}} to estimate the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies and to evaluate risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity in breeding pigs raised in Estonia. Sera from 382 pigs were tested with a commercial direct agglutination test, using a cut-off titer of 40 for seropositivity, for the presence of anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G antibodies. Results Twenty-two (5. 8 %) of the 382 pigs tested seropositive for T. gondii, and 6 of the 14 herds had at least one seropositive pig. The proportion of seropositive pigs within the herds ranged between 0 and 43 %. Gender appeared as a significant factor, with sows having 5. 6 times higher odds to be seropositive to T. gondii than boars. Seroprevalence did not increase with age. Conclusions Anti-T. gondii antibodies were present in a substantial proportion of <b>breeding</b> <b>pig</b> herds in Estonia. On the other hand, the presence of herds without seropositive pigs illustrates that porcine T. gondii infections can be avoided even {{in a country where the}} parasite is endemic and common in several other host species...|$|E

Data were analysed from a cohort of 9424 liveborn piglets from 855 litters. Overall, 1274 liveborn piglets (13. 5 %) died before weaning. A mixed effect binomial model was used to investigate the associations between preweaning mortality and farm and litter level factors, controlling for litter size and number of piglets stillborn and fostered. Increased risk of mortality was associated with fostering piglets over 24 hours of age, organic certification or membership of an assurance scheme with higher welfare standards, farmers’ perception that there was a problem with pest birds, use of medication to control coccidiosis and presence of lame sows on the farm.

Two {{follow-up}} {{studies of}} a positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) finding in the 2008 European Union baseline survey on MRSA in pig herds were performed to gain more knowledge about the epidemiology of the particular MRSA type, a known human type (ST 8 /t 008), among pigs. Two persons on a Norwegian farm {{in the study were}} found to be MRSA carriers, and human-to-animal transmission was suspected. In the first follow-up study, all pigs (n 5 346) were sampled by taking nasal swabs. A pooled sample from 5 individual pigs housed together in a single pen, and a dust sample from the equipment in the same room, were positive. Dust samples from a building housing MRSA-negative animals were negative. The MRSA was not detected in the second follow-up, after removing positive animals from the farm and cleaning and disinfecting. A low MRSA occurrence among the animals was found, suggesting that MRSA ST 8 /t 008 may be less able to colonize and persist in pig holdings compared with more host-adapted S. aureus strains.

For calculations, the results from <b>breeding</b> <b>pig</b> houses of the Mazovian region, collected dur-ing the years 2004 – 2009, were employed. Three groups of females were distinguished for the par-ticular breeds: those ones, possessing 14, 15 or 16 teats. The number of records for Polish Large White was equal to 1, 019 and for Polish Land-race, it was 1, 732. The statistically con ¿ rmed dif-ferences were revealed in respect of NPB by the groups of females, possessing 14, 15 or 16 teats (P 0. 01) and NPR until the age of 3 weeks by the sows of the same breed, possessing 14 or 15 teats (P 0. 05).

Next to eggs and poultry, pork is among the most common sources of such infections. In order to assess the prevalence of Salmonella in holdings of breeding pigs, the European Commission proposed a baseline survey in all Member States. The survey was carried out from 1 January to 31 December 2008 according to a study design prescribed by the EU. It covered at least 80 % of breeding pigs in each Member State. The individual studies were preferably carried out at holdings with at least 50 breeding pigs. Representative holdings were selected in each Member State.

Multi-level multivariable analysis including 2930 pens (12 variables) within 293 holdings (7 variables) was carried in SPSS version 22 using GLMM. Three outcomes were assessed, based on Salmonella positivity or negativity of the pens’ fecal pools: one binomial (Salmonella positive or negative pool); two multinomial outcomes, one with S.

Potential risk factors (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) for Salmonella positivity were: total number of breeding pigs, boar replacement policy and type of feed; S.

The efficiency of control programmes for Salmonella in pigs, reported among the EU Member States, varies and definitive eradication seems very difficult. Control measures currently recommended for Salmonella are not serotype-specific. Is it possible that the risk factors for different Salmonella serotypes are different? The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate potential risk factors for two groups of Salmonella sp serotypes using pen faecal samples from <b>breeding</b> <b>pig</b> holdings representative of the Portuguese pig sector. Methods The data used come from the Baseline Survey for the Prevalence of Salmonella in breeding pigs in Portugal. A total of 1670 pen faecal samples from 167 herds were tested, and 170 samples were positive for Salmonella. The presence of Salmonella in each sample (outcome variable) was classified in three categories: i) no Salmonella, ii) Salmonella Typhimurium or S. Typhimurium-like strains with the antigenic formula: 1, 4, 5, 12 :i:-,, and iii) other serotypes. Along with the sample collection, a questionnaire concerning herd management and potential risk factors was utilised. The data have a “natural” hierarchical structure so a categorical multilevel analysis of the dataset was carried out using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, implemented in the software WinBUGS. Results The significant associations found (when compared to category “no Salmonella”), for category “serotype Typhimurium or S. Typhimurium-like strains with the antigenic formula: 1, 4, 5, 12 :i:-” were: age of breeding sows, size of the herd, number of pigs/pen and source of semen. For the category “other serotypes” the significant associations found were: control of rodents, region of the country, source of semen, breeding sector room and source of feed. Conclusions The risk factors significantly associated with Salmonella shedding from the category “serotype Typhimurium or serotype 1, 4, 5, 12 :i:-“ were more related to animal factors, whereas those associated with “other serotypes” were more related to environmental factors. Our findings suggest that different control measures could be used to control different Salmonella serotypes in breeding pigs. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{cohort study}} {{was carried out}} on 112 <b>breeding</b> <b>pig</b> farms in England to {{investigate}} the impact of type of farrowing accommodation on preweaning mortality in piglets. Four types of farrowing accommodation were studied; farrowing crates, indoor loose pens, crate/loose systems (where the sow was restrained in a crate during birth and {{the first days of}} lactation before being moved to a loose pen) and outdoor farrowing in arcs in paddocks. Four estimates of preweaning mortality were collected: an oral estimate from the farmer before the visit, an estimate from the 6 -month rolling average from computer records, records from 20 litters observed when the farm was visited and prospective records collected from 20 farrowings after the visit. These four estimates were significantly correlated. The prospective records also included a farmer reported date and cause of death. From the prospective data there were 25, 031 piglets from 2143 litters from 112 farms, 6. 5 % of piglets were stillborn while live born preweaning mortality was 12 %. Mixed effect discrete time survival, binomial and competing risk, models were used to investigate the association between preweaning mortality and farrowing accommodation, controlling for sow parity, litter size and number of piglets stillborn and fostered. There was a reduced risk of stillbirths in outdoor farrowing systems compared with crated systems. Farmers reported that crushing of healthy piglets was the most frequent cause of death accounting for 55 % of live born preweaning mortality. There {{was no significant difference in}} mortality in live born piglets by farrowing system. There was a significantly higher risk of farmer reported crushing of healthy live born piglets in outdoor arcs compared with piglets reared with sows in farrowing crates and a significantly reduced risk of death from causes other than crushing in piglets reared outdoors or in crate/loose systems compared with piglets reared in crated systems. We conclude that, in the farms in this study, farrowing crates reduced the risk of preweaning live born mortality attributable to crushing but piglets in this system were at increased risk of death from other causes. Consequently crates had no significant effect on overall preweaning mortality percentage. In all four commercial production systems; outdoor, farrowing crates, crate/loose farrowing systems and indoor loose housed systems, there were similar levels of mortality...|$|E

In 2008 a survey carried out in the EU determined a high prevalence of MRSA in herds of <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs</b> also in Germany (EFSA, 2010). Likewise, MRSA were identified in Germany in herds of fattening pigs (Alt et al., 2011), pigs at slaughter (Tenhagen et al., 2009), on carcasses (Beneke et al., 2011) and in meat from pigs at retail (BVL, 2013). The current investigation was carried out to determine the current prevalence of MRSA in herds of <b>breeding</b> <b>pigs,</b> analyse patterns in the type of MRSA isolated from pigs and determine differences between the MRSA observed in units only housing sows and those housing weaned piglets. In previous studies it could be shown, that the prevalence of MRSA is higher in weaned piglets than in sows but little is known about differences in the types of MRSA that can be isolated in the different units...|$|R
