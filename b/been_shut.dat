5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had <b>been</b> <b>shut)</b> and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has <b>been</b> <b>shut</b> off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case.

5|$|After the State of Israel was established, Silverman {{recognized}} the diverse needs {{to build the}} nation and she and Archibald channeled funds into planting orchards, building the Sharon Hotel, and supplementing the Synagogue Centre Building Fund. The Sharon Hotel, built in Herzliya, on the Sharon Plain, {{was part of an}} effort to build infrastructure and develop tourism sites to stimulate further growth. Silverman founded and served the board of the company which created the hotel. In the Jezreel Valley, she chaired a water development company and established a mixed-fruit orchard of around 70 acres of trees. She also was involved in several projects in Rhode Island. In 1955 she founded and served as president of the Friends of Butler Hospital in an attempt to reopen the health center, which had <b>been</b> <b>shut</b> down. They were successful in proving its benefit to the community and the hospital reopened. In 1957, Silverman served as chair of the fundraising for the Rhode Island Association of Mental Health. By the early-1960s, 33 synagogues throughout Israel had been built through the synagogue fund. During the two years she lived in Israel, she helped erect around 80 additional synagogues and by the time of Silverman's death, the number was over 100 synagogues in Israel and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Cartman {{learns that}} all KFCs in Colorado have <b>been</b> <b>shut</b> {{down because of}} a new law which bans fast food. After {{receiving}} treatment for KFC withdrawal, Cartman is introduced to Billy Miller, a local boy who runs an illegal KFC cartel from his home. Billy hires Cartman to sell his illegal food, a job that provides Cartman with the same food as payment. After Cartman demonstrates his ruthlessness against a cheating street dealer, Billy sends him and another employee, Tommy, to Corbin, Kentucky to buy chicken directly from Colonel Sanders. Sanders is impressed by Cartman but has Tommy executed after discovering {{him to be a}} mole for healthy foods advocate Jamie Oliver. Cartman wins over the Colonel's trust, but is warned to never betray him. Cartman eventually betrays Billy by telling Billy's mother that he got an F on his social studies test, and takes over the cartel after Billy is grounded. The Colonel assigns Cartman the task of assassinating Oliver to prevent him from giving a speech in the United Nations. However, the gluttonous Cartman soon comes to abuse the KFC food he assigned to sell, and forgets the Colonel's assassination order. The Colonel, furious at Cartman's incompetence, sends a squad of gunmen to kill him, leading to a firefight with the police that kills Billy's mother, and which Cartman escapes unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{his strong}} finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring {{training}} assured of {{a spot in}} the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation {{for the first time in}} five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4–1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6–12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right rotator cuff tendinitis, which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the stretch. It was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had <b>been</b> <b>shut</b> down for the remainder of the season after receiving a second opinion on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10–13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Engine number 4 {{suffered}} only minor, external damage. It was dismantled by {{the investigation}} team {{in an attempt}} to determine why it might have <b>been</b> <b>shut</b> down by the crew. A substantial amount of corrosion product was found in the passages of the fuel flow meter on engine number 4. Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist identified the corrosion product as magnesium hydroxide. This is a corrosion product formed by reaction of magnesium and water, suggesting the fuel passages had been filled with water in the months between the crash and the detailed examination of the engine. Charles Gibbs, an engine specialist employed by the Department of Civil Aviation, estimated at least 45 cubic centimetres of water must have been involved. Rain falling on the crash site before engine number 4 was removed could not account for this much water in the fuel passages. Gibbs first examined the fuel system of engine number 4 and discovered the corrosion about two months after the accident. He conducted a test on an identical flow meter and found that after he left water in the fuel flow passages for approximately 8 weeks a similar amount of corrosion product developed. This suggested the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground may have been caused by water in the fuel reaching engine number 4. The steel rotor in the fuel pump of engine number 1 was slightly corroded but the fuel systems of engines 2 and 3 showed no evidence of corrosion. Investigators formed the opinion that the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground, and the crew's decision to shut down engine number 4 and feather its propeller, may have been related to water in the fuel reaching that engine. Similarly, the intermittent loss of power on all engines in the final minutes of the flight may indicate that all engines were receiving fuel contaminated with water.|$|E
