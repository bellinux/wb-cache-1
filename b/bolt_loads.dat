40|$|The San Juan Mine and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study to measure how development mining affected <b>bolt</b> <b>loads.</b> Twelve fully grouted, instrumented roof bolts were installed at two three-way intersections {{as part of the}} standard bolting pattern. Newly developed miniature data acquisition systems (MIDAS) were used to measure bolt load changes during initial face advance and cross-cut breakthrough. The effects of cut placement and depth on roof <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> were studied. This test showed how <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> increased at five positions along the bolt length during initial mining. Both entry advance and cross-cut breakthrough produced a similar percentage of increase in <b>bolt</b> <b>loads.</b> Geologic differences between the test sites were probably responsible for the differences in amounts of bolt loading.

40|$|During the {{prototype}} vibration {{tests of the}} GAS adapter beam, significant impacting of the beam at its support points was observed. The cause of the impacting was traced to gaps under the mounting bolt heads. Because of the nonlinear nature of the response, {{it was difficult to}} evaluate the effects which Shuttle launch dynamics might have on the mounting <b>bolt</b> <b>loads.</b> A series of tests were conducted on an electrodynamic exciter in which the transient acceleration time histories, which had been measured during the Space Transportation System- 1 (STS- 1; Space Shuttle mission 1) launch, were simulated. The actual flight data had to be filtered and compensated so that it could be reproduced on the shaker without exceeding displacement and velocity limitations. Mounting <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> were measured directly by strain gages applied to the bolts. Various gap thicknesses and bolt torques were investigated. Although increased gap thickness resulted in greater accelerations due to impacting, the <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> were not significantly affected. This is attributed to the fact that impacting excited mostly higher frequency modes which do not have significant modal mass...|$|E

The long term <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> relaxation rate described by the model was similar to the three dimensional numerical analysis. It should be noted that a performed experimental <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> relaxing experiment was performed, but due to lack of creep deformation data at the temperature of interest, fictive material data parameters were used instead.

40|$|Abstract The <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> loss {{behavior}} of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy bolted joints with a conventional SCM 435 steel bolt and an A 5056 aluminum bolt was investigated at elevated temperature. The A 5056 bolt {{could reduce the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> loss compared to the SCM 435 bolt due to smaller mismatch of thermal expansion between the bolt material and the plates. The mismatch of thermal expansion between bolt material and AZ 91 D plates was found to induce the compressive creep deformation in the AZ 91 D plates which performed as the main mechanism of <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> loss. At higher tightening stress, the <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> loss could be intensified by additional plastic deformation in bolt occurred during the test. Moreover, {{it is suggested that}} the plastic deformation could be reduced by decreasing the friction condition in the bolted joint...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Bolt</b> <b>load</b> in a <b>bolted</b> {{connection}} directly {{influence the}} safety of a design in regard to both static and fatigue loading {{as well as in the}} prevention of separation in the connection. When the separating force is applied off the bolt center, although the materials for the bolted joint remain in the linear elastic range, the interface contact area between the clamped plates is sensitive to both the magnitude and the location of the separating force. This often causes nonlinear variation of the <b>bolt</b> <b>load,</b> the deformation etc. An analytical model is proposed to obtain the expression for the nonlinear <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> under a separating service load.

The instrumented bolts were grouted through two high-strength concrete blocks, and axial tension was applied {{to as much as}} 75 % of yield strength. With the block interface acting as a failure plane, shear loads were applied to the blocks at a constant rate of displacement to the ultimate strength of the bolts.

In agreement with theoretical predictions, the interferometer response was found to be linearly related to tensile stresses oriented parallel to the bolt axis. Under rather idealized conditions, <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> can be determined with errors of less than 1 %. The ultimate operational accuracy depends on a number of variables, such as bolt dimensions and geometry, bolt temperature, uniformity of stresses, and bolt materials, but load analyses to within + or - 3 % are readily achievable.

Such techniques offer the potential of accurate, rapid bolt load measurement that does not disturb the anchotage. This report presents 6 e research findings for {{a specific type of}} ultrasonic measurement instrument using a pulsed-phase-Iock-Ioop technique.

The report identifies problems encountered in applying pulsed-phase-Iock-Ioop technology to roof bolt load measurement and provides potential solutions to many of them. A key assumption of pulsed-phase-lock-loop theory is that driving and reflected signal frequencies will always be equal.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steel flanges are normally forged to form, {{as required by}} the ASTM A 182 /A 182 M standard, but may also potentially be machined directly from forged {{stainless steel}} bar. In order to evaluate the integrity of such flanges, axisymmetric elastic-plastic finite element models have been developed, considering static effects such as bolt load and internal pressure. Additionally, tensile testing of a sample forged bar (UNS S 31803) has been conducted. The stress distribution in a flange during gasket seating and operating conditions has been determined, as well as the degree of plastic strain caused by the <b>bolt</b> <b>loads.</b> The maximum stresses {{have been found to be}} around the same values as the minimum yield strength requirement of the studied material (UNS S 31803), and the location of the maximum stress concentrations have been identified as the gasket groove.

40|$|The {{solid rocket}} booster uses {{hydraulic}} pumps fabricated from cast C 355 aluminum alloy, with 17 - 4 PH stainless steel pump port caps. Corrosion-resistant steel, MS 51830 CA 204 L self-locking screw thread inserts are installed into C 355 pump housings, with A 286 stainless steel fasteners installed into the insert {{to secure the}} pump port cap to the housing. In the past, pump port cap fasteners were installed to a torque of 33 Nm (300 in-lb). However, the structural analyses used a significantly higher nut factor than indicated during tests conducted by Boeing Space Systems. When the torque values were reassessed using Boeing's nut factor, the fastener preload had a factor of safety of less than 1, with potential for overloading the joint. This paper describes how behavior was determined for a preloaded joint with a steel bolt threaded into steel inserts in aluminum parts. Finite element models were compared with test results. For all initial bolt preloads, <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> increased as external applied loads increased. For higher initial bolt preloads, less load was transferred into the bolt, due to external applied loading. Lower torque limits were established for pump port cap fasteners and additional limits were placed on insert axial deformation under operating conditions after seating the insert with an initial preload...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of mechanical joints in monolithic carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates {{is limited by}} the poor local bearing response under <b>bolt</b> <b>loads.</b> To improve the mechanical performance of bolt-loaded open holes, often metallic inserts or fiber reinforcements like Advanced and Tailored Fiber Placement (AFP, TFP) are used. In this work, an alternative to AFP and TFP is investigated, where winded carbon rovings are twisted around the bolt and work without sewing. These multi-loop rovings consist of turns around the hole and free slings in the design area around the hole. Based on previously conducted experimental and numerical studies, published in Botzkowski et al. (2016), a model generator has been developed to build up three-dimensional finite element (FE) models on mesoscopic level. The model generator is capable of considering variable design parameters of the multi-loop rosette as well as manufacturing effects like changes in cross sections of the rovings. The applied material models have been parametrized by experimental tests at single-loops and non-reinforced reference laminates. By applying the model generator, various multi-Loop configurations with varying number of turns, number of loops, loop orientations and loop lengths are generated and evaluated in terms of their stress behavior and load bearing capacity. Finally, design proposals for winded multi-loop roving rosettes are derived...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of geometric variables on the <b>bolt</b> <b>load</b> distributions of a cold-formed steel bolt connection. The study was conducted using an experimental test, finite element analysis, and an analytical method. The experimental study was performed using single-lap shear testing of a concentrically <b>loaded</b> <b>bolt</b> connection fabricated from G 550 cold-formed steel. Finite element analysis with shell elements was used to model the cold-formed steel plate while solid elements were used to model the bolt fastener for the purpose of studying the structural behavior of the bolt connections. Material nonlinearities, contact problems, and a geometric nonlinearity procedure were used to predict the failure behavior of the bolt connections. The analytical method was generated using the spring model. The bolt-plate interaction stiffness was newly proposed which was verified by the experiment and finite element model.

Critical airworthiness issues included the loads that the aircraft and pods would be subjected to, in the wake turbulence regimes of wakes, and the trailing-pair wake vortex regime in particular. NRC CT- 133 wake turbulence data without the pods has been analysed and transformed to the pod CG locations, and resulting reactions derived for the pod mounting rack attachment bolt locations, the critical loading points.

However, we are still struggling to build autonomous tools that can match {{the ability of a}} human to detect and localize the quantity of damage in structures. Therefore, there is a growing interest in merging the computational and cognitive concepts to improve the solution of structural health monitoring (SHM). The main object of this research is to apply the human-machine cooperative approach on a tower structure to detect damage. The cooperation approach includes haptic tools to create an appropriate collaboration between SHM sensor networks, statistical compression techniques and humans. Damage simulation in the structure is conducted by releasing some of the <b>bolt</b> <b>loads.</b> Accelerometers are bonded to various locations of the tower members to acquire the dynamic response of the structure. The obtained accelerometer results are encoded in three different ways to represent them as a haptic stimulus for the human subjects. Then, the participants are subjected to each of these stimuli to detect the bolt loosened damage in the tower. Results obtained from the human-machine cooperation demonstrate that the human subjects were able to recognize the damage with an accuracy of 88 ± 20. 21 % and response time of 5. 87 ± 2. 33 s.

40|$|Historically, miners {{have known}} that roof rocks {{originally}} composed largely of mud were prone to slaking and deterioration when exposed to water and humidity. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) records show that roof falls are more prevalent in summer and late fall. Field data shows higher <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> and increased room convergence in summer months. Laboratory data shows that very high internal pressures can be generated by significant strain in clay-rich rocks. In summer months humidities ranging from 70 - 100 % can cause rock strains up to 7 %, and rock pressures of 14, 000 psi, {{more than enough to}} break apart weak shales and fireclays. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted wet/dry immersion cycling of clay-rich rocks. Results show that the rocks most prone to moisture deterioration are fireclays, claystones, and sandy shales, all of which have disrupted bedding. Of the 7 mudrocks with a weatherability index above 40 %, none showed consistent fissile bedding. Black shales were surprisingly resistant to wet/dry water immersion cycling. Generally, mixed rocks (stackrock), typically susceptible to horizontal stress, are more resistant to moisture-deterioration. Mine roof rocks tested with moisture sensitivity ratings above 50 % (moisture sensitivity index ranges from 0 - 100 with 100 being the most sensitive) all came from mines which had roof skin problems and used supplemental support to prevent rock fall injuries. Some roof rocks showed lateral variability of moisture sensitivity values, suggesting the need for more samples in highly varying roof rocks. Swelling strains of mudrocks showed that almost all of the swelling occurred in the first 24 hours after immersion. The wet/dry immersion cycling test used provides an accurate, quick and inexpensive method for estimating the moisture sensitivity of mudrocks.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a detailed}} buckling {{evaluation of the}} primary tanks in the Hanford double-shell waste tanks (DSTs), {{which is part of}} a comprehensive structural review for the Double-Shell Tank Integrity Project. This work also provides information on tank integrity that specifically responds to concerns raised by the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health (ES&H) Oversight (EH- 22) during a review of work performed on the double-shell tank farms and the operation of the aging waste facility (AWF) primary tank ventilation system. The current buckling review focuses on the following tasks: (1) Evaluate the potential for progressive anchor bolt failure and the appropriateness of the safety factors that were used for evaluating local and global buckling. The analysis will specifically answer the following questions: (a) Can the EH- 22 scenario develop if the vacuum is limited to - 6. 6 -inch water gage (w. g.) by a relief valve? (b) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario can develop? (c) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario cannot develop? (2) Develop influence functions to estimate the axial stresses in the primary tanks for all reasonable combinations of tank loads based on detailed finite element analysis. The analysis must account for the variation in design details and operating conditions between the different DSTs. The analysis must also address the imperfection sensitivity of the primary tank to buckling. (3) Perform a detailed buckling analysis to determine the maximum allowable differential pressure for each of the DST primary tanks at the current specified limits on waste temperature, height, and specific gravity. Based on the concrete anchor <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> analysis and the small deformations that are predicted at the unfactored limits on vacuum and axial loads, it is very unlikely that the EH- 22 scenario (i. e., progressive anchor bolt failure leading to global buckling of the tank under increased vacuum) could occur. After releasing Revision 0 of this report, an independent review of the Double Shell Tanks (DST) Thermal and Operating Loads Analysis (TaLA) combined with the Seismic Analysis was conducted by Dr. Robert P. Kennedy of RPK Structural Mechanics Consulting and Dr. Anestis S. Veletsos of Rice University. Revision I was then issued to address their review comments (included in Appendix D). Additional concerns involving the evaluation of concrete anchor loads and allowables were found during a second review by Drs. Kennedy and Veletsos (see Appendix G). Extensive additional analysis was performed on the anchors, which is detailed by Deibler et al. (2008 a, 2008 b).

40|$|Safety is {{the most}} {{important}} aspect to the mining industry. Research having a direct and positive impact on mine safety is always needed and should be supported. There are several different types of primary roof supports that are used to try to maintain stable mine workings in order to extract the coal safely. The majority of roof bolts installed annually in underground coal mines in the USA use resin cartridges (Tadolini, 2006). The standard roof bolt used is a fully grouted resin rebar bolt. This is considered a passive (un-tensioned) support. Technological advances in roof support anchored with resin grout systems have resulted in the development of supports that are active (tensioned during installation). Generally it is thought that active anchors are superior in performance as roof support except in highly laminated weak roof. The assumption is that since an active system applies some pre-tension to the roof, it will provide a more stable roof beam. There is, however, a lack of real data to back up this perception. A systematic attempt is through this project that addresses this knowledge gap. Without a clear idea on how different roof bolt systems work in-situ, the consequences could {{have a significant impact on}} the safety of the miners working underground as well as production costs. Supports are now often only chosen based on perceived ideas instead of real data. Such assumed superior performance of the support system could lead to false economy. Essentially, it needs to be demonstrated to what degree or under what conditions, if any, these technological advances in roof support improve ground conditions and opening stability and ultimately improve the safety of the miners. There is an argument regarding whether passive bolts could truly be better than active bolts. The focus is centralized towards a cost and performance issue. The overall goal of the proposed project was to develop an understanding of the interaction between different roof bolt types and the immediate strata in a longwall headgate as the longwall face progresses. In order to monitor the interactions between the strata and roof bolts, specially instrumented bolts were installed with six strain gauges that were electronically accessed. A look into the initial <b>bolt</b> <b>loads</b> was used to compare three different bolt types (both tensioned and untensioned) upon installation. These loads continued to be monitored and analyzed as the longwall face approached and passed the location of the instrumented bolts. Along with analyzing instrumented bolt data compared to a passing longwall face, a limited finite element model was set up within Flac 3 D to represent real conditions, and compare the in situ data collected to the computer outputs in order to establish beginning phases of validating the results...|$|E

For both aluminum and steel alloys comparative SCC growth rates obtained from tests of precracked specimens provide an additional useful characterization of the SCC behavior of an alloy...|$|R
40|$|Thin wire {{welded to}} bottom of hole down center of bolt permits {{measurement}} of tension in bolt. Bolt lengthens under strain, but wire is not loaded, so gap between wire and eddy-current gap transducer mounted on bolt head indicates <b>bolt</b> <b>loading.</b> Eddy-current transducer could measure gap within 0. 05 mm. Method {{does not require}} separate "standard" for each bolt type, and is not sensitive to dirt or oil in bolt hole, unlike ultrasonic probes...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} {{of fully}} grouted rock <b>bolts</b> <b>loaded</b> in tension is presented by implementing a non-linear bond–slip relationship of bolt–grout interface into a commercial finite difference rock mechanics code. The proposed model shows a close match with the experimental results and analytical predictions {{in terms of}} load–displacement relationship, rock bolt axial force distribution and interfacial shear stress distribution. A detailed debonding failure process is also presented, which includes five successive states: elastic state, elastic-softening state, elastic-softening-debonding state, softening-debonding state and debonding state. ...|$|R
