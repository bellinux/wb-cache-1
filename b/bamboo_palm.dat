5000|$|In {{less than}} a year, Evans had {{transformed}} 80 acre of Anaheim orange groves into lush theme park attractions filled with exotic plants. One of the prominent pieces of the projects was landscaping the Jungle Cruise ride along the path of an artificial river, which Disney insisted be [...] "the best darn jungle this side of Costa Rica." [...] This section of the park included a canopy of <b>bamboo,</b> <b>palms,</b> and ficus trees towering 70 ft tall. To create the appearance of exotic jungle branches, Evans planted walnut trees upside down to give the appearance that their gnarled roots were branches.|$|R
5000|$|Trees {{exist in}} two {{different}} groups of vascular or higher plants, the gymnosperms and the angiosperms. The gymnosperm trees include conifers, cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales; they produce seeds which are not enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles. Most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the [...] "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves. There are also some trees among the old lineages of flowering plants called [...] basal angiosperms or paleodicots; these include Amborella, Magnolia, nutmeg and avocado, while trees such as <b>bamboo,</b> <b>palms</b> and bananas are monocots.|$|R

5000|$|Chamaedorea ( [...] , in {{reference}} to easily reached fruits, or the plants' low-growing nature) is a genus of 107 species of palms, native to subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas. They are small palms, growing to 0.3 - 6 m tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests, and often spreading by means of underground runners, forming clonal colonies. The leaves are pinnate (rarely entire), with one to numerous leaflets. The flowers are produced in inflorescences; they are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5-2 cm diameter. Perhaps the best-known species is Chamaedorea elegans (neanthe bella palm or parlour palm) from Mexico and Guatemala. It is popular as a houseplant, particularly in Victorian houses. Another well-known species is Chamaedorea seifrizii, the <b>bamboo</b> <b>palm</b> or reed palm.|$|E
5000|$|Later, when Mexico {{opted for}} a {{developmental}} policy, Arai became a standard-bearer for nationalism in architecture. He re-evaluated traditional building materials, such as tree trunks, <b>bamboo,</b> <b>palm</b> leaves and lianas, using them in {{a plan for a}} country house that was adapted to the warm, damp climate of the Papaloapan region, and various essays to improve the country and popular houses. The building of the Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, gave him his greatest architectural opportunity when he designed the [...] "Frontones" [...] de Ciudad Universitaria (1952). In these he used the volcanic stone of the area to great effect in truncated pyramid shapes inspired by Pre-Columbian pyramids. This was his contribution to the early landscaping-architecture, by using the volcanoes surrounding the view as a theme for his design. His numerous books and articles addressed conceptual problems in Mexican architecture and art. His last building was the clubhouse (Kaikan) of the Japanese Association, see Japanese community of Mexico City, who was inspired on ancient Japanese and ancient Mexican architectural design, but with modern techniques and materials, successfully a modern looking piece.|$|E

Natural building materials such as water, wood, stone, sand, soil, <b>bamboo,</b> <b>palm</b> fiber, etc., do not contain chemicals that can harm human health. Some building materials contain chemicals that give negative impact to the environment and humans. To avoid mistakes the selection of building materials is necessary to identify the kind of building materials as a contaminants to the environment and human health. To identify the building materials that give negative impact on the environment and human health conducted by the literature studies. Based on the results obtained some building materials that give a negative impact such as limestone, cement, gypsum, asbestos, building materials containing formaldehyde and building materials containing lead. Negative impacts are land degradation, decreased water quality, reduction in air quality, irritation, respiratory distress, brain damage, cancer, until death...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} using {{chemical}} fertilization, organic and pyroligneous extract (EPL) on the seedling development of areca <b>bamboo</b> <b>palm</b> was evaluated. Treatments were: T 1 = no fertilizer (control), T 2 = 0. 1 % EPL, T 3 = 0. 2 % EPL, T 4 = NPK- 20 - 5 - 20, T 5 = NPK- 20 - 5 - 20 + 0. 1 % EPL, T 6 = NPK- 20 - 05 - 20 + 0. 2 % EPL, T 7 = castor bean cake, T 8 = castor bean cake + 0. 1 % EPL and T 9 = castor bean cake + 0. 2 % EPL. The EPL solutions were 0. 1 or 0. 2 %, 100 mL per pot, applied every two weeks. NPK 20 - 5 - 20 chemical fertilizer was applied at three month intervals and castor bean cake organic fertilizer was applied {{once a month}} (40 g per pot for both). Plant height {{and the number of}} leaves and shoots were evaluated one year after the beginning of the trial. The organic fertilizer on its own and with EPL (T 7, T 8 and T 9) produced the tallest plants and highest number of leaves. Organic fertilizer with 0. 1 and 0. 2 % EPL produced the most shoots. For all variables, chemical fertilizer, both with and without EPL, was less effective than organic fertilizer with EPL and treatment with only EPL was less effective than treatment with organic fertilizer. ...|$|E

They have a mystical belief and strong tradition, including the concept of building house and settlement. They believe in supra natural power. One important rule {{is not allowed to}} build buildings using materials and tools of modern technology products. Their building stand on some wooden stilts. The stilts stand on stones as function to support the weight of the building and set the building floor flat. They also forbidden to change the building site conditions, such as by way of flattened or excavated of ground. Buildings should adjust to the conditions of its site. The building made from natural materials such as wood, <b>bamboo,</b> <b>palm</b> fiber and so on. They use wood and bamboo construction, using bamboo pegs and wooden and palm-fiber rope. Construction techniques that make buildings resistant earthquake because construction is not rigid, flexible and able to absorb the shocks of the earthquake. Bamboo pegs use when two woods or construction in wet condition, when they are dried the joins becomes stronger. Another important building is leuit that serves as a place to store rice. Leuit stand on some stilts but its size smaller than dwelling house. Leuit located separately from the location of the settlement.
