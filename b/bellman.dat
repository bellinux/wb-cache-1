5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell <b>Bellman</b> {{jokes about}} a person named <b>Bellman,</b> an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known <b>Bellman</b> joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of <b>Bellman.</b> 19th century <b>Bellman</b> jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bellman</b> Society (Bellmansällskapet), {{founded in}} Stockholm {{on the anniversary}} of Bellman's birth in 1919, fosters {{interest}} in <b>Bellman</b> and supports research into the man and his work. To these ends it organises concerts, lectures and excursions. It produces the series of Bellmanstudier, starting in 1924, so far running to 24 volumes, as well as facsimile prints of <b>Bellman</b> documents, essay collections, and 's <b>Bellman</b> porcelain. It has published recordings including Alla Fredmans Epistlar (All Fredman's Epistles) and Alla Fredmans Sånger (All Fredman's Songs). The Society's newsletter is called Hwad behagas?.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, the Swedish Academy awarded <b>Bellman</b> {{its annual}} Lundblad prize of 50 Riksdaler {{for the most}} {{interesting}} piece of literature of the year. Although Fredman's Epistles was neither exactly literature as understood by the academy, nor meeting the standards of elegant taste, Johan Henric Kellgren and the King ensured that <b>Bellman</b> won the prize.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as <b>Bellman,</b> but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. <b>Bellman</b> originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, <b>Bellman</b> said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. <b>Bellman</b> approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|Stora Henriksvik, {{also called}} the <b>Bellman</b> museum (Bellmanmuseet) for its small {{permanent}} <b>Bellman</b> exhibition, celebrates his life and work with paintings, replica objects and a beachside café in a 17th-century Stockholm house. The place, beside the beach at Långholm, was in Bellman's time called Lilla Sjötullen (The Small Lake-Customs House) where farmers from Lake Mälaren had to pay a toll on the goods they were taking to market in Stockholm's Gamla stan. The place is mentioned in Epistle No. 48, Solen glimmar blank och trind.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} ill, he was imprisoned—after {{struggling}} with debts and haunted {{by the threat of}} ruin and imprisonment all his life—"for a wretched debt of 150 Rdr". The rumour was that a former Customs colleague, E. G. Nobelius, had had his advances to Louise <b>Bellman</b> rejected, and in revenge had sued <b>Bellman</b> for the debt, knowing he was penniless: he owed a total of almost 4,000 Riksdaler. On 11February 1795, he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla Kungsholmsbrogatan. He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone, its location now unknown. The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851, complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bellman</b> {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen {{was one of the}} first to translate <b>Bellman</b> into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge. Schoolchildren two hundred years on still learn some of his songs, and several including Gubben Noak and Fjäriln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes.|$|E
5|$|Bellman's poetry {{continued}} to be read and sung throughout the nineteenth century, contrary to the widespread belief among researchers that he was largely forgotten during this period. His songs were sung especially by the urban bourgeoisie and in fraternities, but also in aristocratic circles and ordinary people in the countryside. The , named after a phrase in Epistle 14, was founded in Uppsala in 1853; the song became their trademark. The Epistles and Songs were published in chapbooks, sung at festivals and performed {{in a variety of}} concerts and entertainments. Figures such as Fredman, Ulla Winblad and Movitz, as well as <b>Bellman</b> himself were painted on tavern walls and memorabilia such as plates, beer tankards and hipflasks. Curiously, <b>Bellman</b> was celebrated at least as enthusiastically in polite and abstemious circles, though with bowdlerized versions of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Fredmans epistlar (English: Fredman's Epistles or Epistles of Fredman) is a {{collection}} of 82 poems set to music by Carl Michael <b>Bellman,</b> a major figure in Swedish 18th century song. Though first published in 1790, it was created over a period of twenty years from 1768 onwards. A companion volume, Fredmans sånger (Fredman's Songs) was published the following year.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, <b>Bellman</b> also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, <b>Bellman</b> brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E
5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. <b>Bellman,</b> already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Richard <b>Bellman</b> {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the Zytglogge {{and the other}} Bernese gate towers were {{extended}} and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal <b>bellman</b> visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527–30, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. <b>Bellman</b> chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, <b>Bellman</b> wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

They were designed as easily transportable, temporary hangars which could be erected using unskilled labour and were used on war-time airfields constructed across Australia, particularly on training airfields.|$|R

40|$|It is {{the main}} purpose of this paper to {{indicate}} a new algorithm for the optimization of a short-term hydro unit calculation problem.

Because of the high requirements on the computation speed and memory (<b>BELLMAN's</b> curse of dimensionality) our contribution here is to indicate a method and an algorithm to reduce them. This should help {{to increase the number of}} systems for which such a purely mathematical approach will be technically applicable.
