5|$|From {{passage in}} 1961 until {{approximately}} 1971, political officials were not prosecuted under the Travel Act.

5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would <b>be</b> <b>another</b> to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} the {{mechanic}} forces <b>is</b> <b>another</b> example. What we gain in power is lost in time, and the converse. The periodic or compensating errors of the planets <b>is</b> <b>another</b> instance. The influences of climate and soil in political history <b>are</b> <b>another.</b> The cold climate invigorates. The barren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers or scorpions.|$|R
50|$|Circle {{inversion}} {{transforms the}} plane {{in a way that}} maps circles into circles, and pencils of circles into pencils of circles. The type of the pencil is preserved: the inversion of an elliptic pencil <b>is</b> <b>another</b> elliptic pencil, the inversion of a hyperbolic pencil <b>is</b> <b>another</b> hyperbolic pencil, and the inversion of a parabolic pencil <b>is</b> <b>another</b> parabolic pencil.|$|R

5|$|Birckenbuehl's son Charlie is kidnapped {{from his}} bedroom, again subdued with a cattle prod. Andrews and Black {{discover}} that the boy's goldfish had been poisoned with whiskey, which they believe to <b>be</b> <b>another</b> message like Comstock's number. The town's swimming instructor, Adam Burke (Brian Taylor) is interviewed, as he had contact with both missing boys through his coaching. Black discovers that Burke's son {{had been killed in}} a hit-and-run accident; Black also receives post containing a paint swatch with the number 528 on it, but he is unsure of its meaning.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever <b>be</b> <b>another</b> large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|Five months later, Wendy is on {{a subway}} train with her roommate Laura {{and her friend}} Sean. When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin {{sitting in the back}} of the car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This turns out to <b>be</b> <b>another</b> premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed by the sound of screeching metal.|$|E

5|$|Games {{tended to}} be {{characterized}} by low scores and frequent punting, with crowds between 10,000 and 20,000; these numbers dropped off {{in the last two}} games of the era. A low scoring BC–Calgary game in Everett, Washington in 1967 drew just over 6,000; there would not <b>be</b> <b>another</b> CFL game in the United States until the cusp of US expansion itself in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may <b>be</b> <b>another</b> genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In 1952–53, South Africa's cricket {{authorities}} were hesitant {{to send their}} inexperienced team to Australia, fearing that the Test series would be uncompetitive. The Australian Board of Control's concern that—after losing money on the previous season's tour by the West Indies—the series would <b>be</b> <b>another</b> financial disaster resulted in South Africa offering an indemnity of ₤10,000 against any losses. Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests, although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa. He scored 123 in the return match {{later in the season}} and Victoria recorded two wins under his watch, against Queensland.|$|E

5|$|In January 2015 in {{his column}} in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai alluded to the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that {{he would be able to}} continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was.

In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch.

B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may <b>be</b> <b>another</b> subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.|$|E
