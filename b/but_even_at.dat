5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|The monoamine {{hypothesis}} was compelling, especially based on apparently successful clinical results with early antidepressant drugs, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> {{the time there}} were discrepant findings. Only a minority of patients given the serotonin-depleting drug reserpine became depressed; in fact reserpine even acted as an antidepressant in many cases. This was inconsistent with the initial monoamine theory which said depression was caused by neurotransmitter deficiency.|$|E

However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to anti-dumping penalties by both the United States and Europe. The global oversupply has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> the sharply reduced price resulting from oversupply, as of 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.|$|E

25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century new {{innovations}} in the art of classical dance began to become apparent. With all of this, Petipa's rocky relationship with the new director of the Imperial Theatres, Vladimir Telyakovsky, appointed to the position in 1901, served as a catalyst to the Ballet Master's end. Telyakovsky made no effort in disguising his dislike of Petipa's work, as he felt that the art of classical ballet had become stagnant under him, and felt that other choreographers should have a chance {{at the helm of the}} Imperial Ballet. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> the age of eighty-three, and suffering from the constant pain brought on by a severe case of the skin disease pemphigus, the old Maestro showed no signs of slowing down, much to Telyakovsky's chagrin.|$|E

A number of prominent ex-PCs also chose to support the Liberals. These included MPs Scott Brison, Keith Martin, and John Herron, who crossed the floor to the Liberals. Lukewarm endorsements of Liberal Party candidates at the onset of the campaign were extended by former PC MPs Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, André Bachand, Rick Borotsik, and former federal PC Party president Bruck Easton.|$|E

Though he initially may have pursued a career in business, he soon turned to asceticism and mysticism. Around the age of twenty-two he became engrossed {{in the study of the}} Zohar (a major work of the Kabbalah that had recently been printed for the first time) and adopted the life of a recluse. Retreating to the banks of the Nile for seven years, he secluded himself in an isolated cottage, giving himself up entirely to meditation. He visited his family only on Shabbat. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> home, he would not utter a word, even to his wife. When it was absolutely necessary for him to say something, he would say it in the fewest number of words possible, and then, only in Hebrew.|$|E

25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with outdoor air is effective {{to the extent}} that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|E
500|$|When Balzac was {{exhibited}} in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Société rejected the work, {{and the press}} ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, [...] "there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> the present day this statue impresses one as slang." [...] A modern critic, indeed, indicates that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.|$|E
500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E

500|$|For {{some of the}} ministers, though, it was not {{sufficient}} for this proud, strong-minded woman {{to submit to the}} humiliation of making a public confession, according to the opinion of Emery Battis. [...] Wilson explored an accusation made by Shepard {{at the end of the}} previous meeting, and new words brought on new assaults. [...] The outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day's grilling, but her downfall came when she would not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four-month imprisonment. [...] With this, she was accused of lying <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> this point, Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she [...] "set forth her owne stuffe". [...] To these sentiments, Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a [...] "Notorious Imposter" [...] in whose heart there was never any grace.

500|$|Cousy {{was one of}} six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity {{basketball}} team in 1946–47. From {{the start of the}} season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the [...] "second team", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the [...] "first team" [...] starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of a chance to show off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.|$|E

[...] If {{he carries}} his revenge too far, yet he has strong grounds for [...] "the lodged hate he bears Anthonio", which he {{explains}} with equal force of eloquence and reason. He seems the depositary of the vengeance of his race; and though the long habit of brooding over daily insults and injuries has crusted over his temper with inveterate misanthropy, and hardened him against the contempt of mankind, this adds but little to the triumphant pretensions of his enemies. There is a strong, quick, and deep sense of justice mixed up with the gall and bitterness of his resentment. [...] The desire of revenge is almost inseparable from the sense of wrong; and we can hardly help sympathising with the proud spirit, hid beneath his [...] "Jewish gaberdine", stung to madness by repeated undeserved provocations, and labouring to throw off the load of obloquy and oppression heaped upon him and all his tribe by one desperate act of [...] "lawful" [...] revenge, till the ferociousness of {{the means by which}} he is to execute his purpose, and the pertinacity with which he adheres to it, turn us against him; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> last, when disappointed of the sanguinary revenge with which he had glutted his hopes, and exposed to beggary and contempt by {{the letter of the law}} on which he had insisted with so little remorse, we pity him, and think him hardly dealt with by his judges.|$|E
500|$|At first, {{there was}} a very {{positive}} reaction to Pulvermacher. [...] Early in 1851 Pulvermacher gave Golding Bird, a well known London physician with an interest in electrotherapy, a sample of the machine with which to experiment. [...] Bird was impressed enough with it that he later gave a representative of the Pulvermacher Company a testimonial as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh. [...] Bird thought that the battery would make a useful source of portable electricity and could be used for treating patients with some forms of paralysis in their homes. [...] Contemporary equipment was not very portable, {{and in the case of}} friction machines required skilled operators to keep going. [...] By October 1851 Bird felt that he had tested the device sufficiently to give it a glowing article in The Lancet. [...] <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>at</b> this early stage there were signs of disquiet. [...] Even as he wrote the favourable report in The Lancet Bird felt the need to level criticism at the Pulvermacher Company's London agent, one C. Meinig, for promoting the device as a [...] "universal panacea" [...] for almost any imaginable complaint in the company's advertisements. [...] Bird was a tireless opponent of quack practitioners, and was particular quick to criticise medically unqualified electrical treatment, as he felt this was a reason professional acceptance of his own work in electrotherapy was being held back. [...] The quack practitioner market was the very sector that the Pulvermacher Company's unrestrained claims were aimed at. Nevertheless, Bird was gracious enough to specifically exclude Pulvermacher himself from responsibility for these [...] "injudiciously puffed" [...] claims.|$|E
