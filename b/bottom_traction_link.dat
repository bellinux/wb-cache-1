40|$|This paper derives a finite-strain plate theory {{consistent}} with the principle of stationary three-dimensional (3 -D) potential energy under general loadings with a third-order error. Staring from the 3 -D nonlinear elasticity (with both geometrical and material nonlinearity) and by a series expansion, we deduce a vector plate equation with three unknowns, which exhibits the local force-balance structure. The success relies on using the 3 -D field equations and <b>bottom</b> <b>traction</b> condition to derive exact recursion relations for the coefficients. Associated weak formulations are considered, leading to a 2 -D virtual work principle. An alternative approach based on a 2 -D truncated energy is also provided, which is less consistent than the first plate theory but {{has the advantage of}} the existence of a 2 -D energy function. As an example, we consider the pure bending problem of a hyperelastic block. The comparison between the analytical plate solution and available exact one shows that the plate theory gives second-order correct results. Comparing with existing plate theories, it appears that the present one has a number of advantages, including the consistency, order of correctness, generality of the loadings, applicability to finite-strain problems and no involvement of unphysical quantities...|$|R

40|$|The postglacial {{geological}} {{history of}} Lake Erie was interpreted {{primarily on the}} basis of borehole sedimentary sequences below the major accretionary forelands: Long Point, Point Pelee, and Pointe-aux-Pins. These data were complemented by a number of sedimentary profiles from other boreholes in and around the lake, radiocarbon and pollen-based dating of postglacial sediments, relic geomorphological features, and geometrical and sedimentary data from inflowing streams. Trends in sediment properties in the basal portion of the sequences consistently show an abrupt change from glacial sediments (Unit 1), topped by an eroded surface, possibly sub-aerially exposed, to postglacial silty clays deposited in deep- or quiet-water environments (Unit 2). As topographic lows were infilled and water depths decreased, the mean grain size increased, reflected in an increasing frequency of sandy laminations (Unit 3). This transitional unit is usually topped by an erosional unconformity, suggesting non-deposition and reworking prior to the deposition of well-sorted, medium sand (Unit 4) {{at the top of the}} sequence. Deposition of the top unit began around 5000 years B. P., and clearly occurred in an upper shoreface setting where saltation and <b>bottom</b> <b>traction</b> were the predominant transport modes. This change probably marks the initiation of spit formation at the sites. All boreholes exhibit a clear coarsening-upward textural trend, suggestive of lateral migration of the higher-energy upper shore face (spit) facies over lower shoreface and lagoonal facies. Combined with the radiocarbon dates and other data, the above sediment interpretation suggests important revisions to earlier interpretations of postglacial lake levels in the Lake Erie basin. Moreover, the lake level curve presented here confirms glacioisostatic rebound of the lake outlet as a major factor in the initial lake level trend, but it also suggests that other processes (such as the changing pattern of inflows from the Upper Great Lakes, the nature and postglacial tectonics of the lake outlet, and paleoclimatic influences) could have become important in the later stages. The above data were used in a hypothetical reconstruction of Lake Erie paleogeography, including the three major forelands of the north shore. The inferred form of the contemporary shoreline, and the evolutionary trends indicated by beach-ridge patterns on the forelands themselves, suggest that these forelands did not result from conventional spit formation. Rather, their origin is due primarily to the effectiveness of cross-lake moraines in Lake Erie as sand-accumulation sites. The evolution of the forelands over the past 3000 years involves persistent erosion and shoreward transgression under the influence of rising lake levels, in a manner analogous to the ongoing retreat of barrier islands on marine coasts...|$|R

Use ESD to reorient education: ESD addresses the quality dimension of the Education for All (EFA) agenda.   UNESCO should enhance the dialogue and concrete connections between the Education for All (EFA) initiative and ESD.   Ministries of Education and other authorities should use ESD to strengthen the quality of edu­cational programs and strategies.   There is a strong need for following up official national SD and ESD policies, in order to help scaling up and spreading innovative practices. Make ESD policy context-sensitive: A process of mediation is needed to translate and adapt general aims and principles to meaningful and supportive policy at the local level.

40|$|Small sided {{football}} {{is the most popular}} area of adult football in the UK, with an estimated 1. 5 m adults playing every week. Matches are played on smaller pitches using different rules to the 11 -a-side game; this results in less stoppage time and a higher volume of ball activity per player. Despite these established differences in playing style and the increase in participation, the types and frequencies of movements performed are not fully understood due to the time consuming nature of current notational analysis methods. Understanding movements is of particular interest to researchers and developers seeking task representative protocols and products for small sided football. The importance of movement type, specifically those with high horizontal plane accelerations, has been demonstrated by recent findings <b>linking</b> <b>traction</b> and shoe stiffness to injury and performance in a number of team sports. In this paper we introduce a new motion analysis technique that uses a combination of inertial sensors and manual notational analysis to describe high acceleration movements in a repeatable and more time effective manner than previously published. A recreational 5 -a-side team (mean ± SD: age 17. 8 ± 0. 26 years, body height 1. 77 ± 0. 05 m, body mass 74. 23 ± 16. 25 kg) were observed during one season at a commercial football centre. Player mounted sensors were used to identify 1824 high acceleration movements from three players in seven matches. These movements were then classified using operational definitions adapted from notational analysis literature. This paper outlines a high acceleration movement analysis technique, provides normative high acceleration movement profiles for three individual 5 -a-side players, and suggests comparisons to published 11 -a-side data. These movement profiles provide a foundation for footwear researchers and product designers to re-align their current practice or products from the 11 -a-side game to this more popular style of football...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of space construction techniques have explored {{the use of}} composite materials {{in the construction of}} space stations and platforms. These composites offer superior strength to weight ratio and are thermally stable. Examples of these materials are laminates of graphite fibers in an epoxy or a metal (Al, Mg) matrix and boron fibers in an aluminum matrix. The overall effective elastic constants of such a medium can be calculated from fiber and matrix properties by using an effective modulus theory as shown in [1] and [2]. The investigation of propagation and scattering of elastic waves in composite materials is necessary in order to develop an ability to characterize cracks and predict the reliability of composite structures. The objective of this investigation is the characterization of a surface breaking crack by ultrasonic techniques. In particular, the use of Lamb waves for this purpose is studied here. The Lamb waves travel through the plate, encountering a crack, and scatter. Of interest is the modeling of the scattered wave in terms of the Lamb wave modes. The direct problem of propagation and scattering of Lamb waves by a surface breaking crack has been analyzed. This would permit an experimentalist to characterize the crack by comparing the measured response to the analytical model. The plate is assumed to be infinite in the x and y directions with a constant thickness in the z direction. The top and <b>bottom</b> surfaces are <b>traction</b> free. Solving the governing wave equations and using the stress-free boundary conditions results in the dispersion equation. This equation yields the guided modes in the homogeneous plate. The theoretical model is a hybrid method that combines analytical and finite elements techniques to describe the scattered displacements. A finite region containing the defects is discretized by finite elements. Outside the local region, the far field solution is expressed as a Fourier summation of the guided modes obtained from the dispersion equation. Continuity of tractions and displacements at the boundaries of the two regions provides the necessary equations to determine the expansion coefficients and the nodal displacements. This method was used for out-of-plane (SH) wave scattering in an isotropic plate[3]. A combined analytical and finite element formulation for a single layered isotropic plate in the state of plane strain was investigated in [4]. In this study the authors considered only the lowest symmetric mode and geometrically symmetric cracks. In [5] a variational approach was used to investigate scattering by a symmetric pair of surface breaking thin slots. Employing standard elastostatic crack solutions as trial functions the authors examined the scattering by the first symmetric mode. A finite difference method was used in [6] to calculate the scattering of Lamb and shear waves from surface breaking cracks. In [7] a modified Wiener-Hopf technique was used to analyze scattering of Lamb waves by a crack. Applying this technique, the authors in [8] studied quantitative sizing of spot welds in joined sheets. Besides the finite difference and finite element techniques, the analytical approaches are not suitable for analyzing arbitrarily shaped defects and anistropic media. In the hybrid method used here these defects can be of arbitrary shapes as well as inclusions of different material. Recently, using the hybrid method, the scattering by surface-breaking cracks in isotropic homogeneous and welded plates has been examined in [9]...|$|R
