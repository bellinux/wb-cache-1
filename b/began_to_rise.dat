5|$|By noon on Sunday, weather {{conditions}} on lower Lake Huron {{were close to}} normal for a November gale. Barometric pressures in some areas <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise,</b> bringing hope of {{an end to the}} storm. The low pressure area that had moved across Lake Superior was moving northeast, away from the lakes.|$|E

5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment to the surrounding basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E
5|$|In March 1865, {{the river}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> and Missouri {{was able to}} leave the Shreveport area for the first time. She reached Alexandria, Louisiana on 8 April and {{anchored}} where she could defend the town. Captain Carter surrendered the ship to Union forces on 3 June, the last Confederate ironclad to surrender. After her armor was removed, Missouri was sold at public auction on 29 November.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans were put {{to work on the}} projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{the suburb}} began {{to expand rapidly}} with the {{construction}} of many private homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} changed their name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli on 25 June 1964 they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> up again, gaining {{promotion}} in 1964–65. Under {{the management of}} former player Bruno Pesaola, they won the Coppa delle Alpi and were back amongst the elite in Serie A, with consistent top-five finishes. Napoli {{came very close to}} winning the league in 1967–68, finishing just behind Milan in second place. Some of the most popular players from this period were Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano. Juliano would eventually break the appearance records, which still stands today.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> steadily. The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 {{marked the beginning of the}} public housing estate programme to provide shelter for the less privileged and to cope with the influx of immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and the population <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of acres for bonanza farms, where they supervised the cultivation and harvesting of wheat as a commodity crop. The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887. In 1883, the University of North Dakota was established, six years before North Dakota was admitted as an independent state born from the Dakota Territory.|$|E

5|$|Disney greenlit Dick Tracy in 1988 {{under the}} {{condition}} that Warren Beatty keep the production budget within $25 million, which <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> once filming started. It quickly jumped to $30 million and then $47 million as its final production budget. Disney spent an additional $54 million on the marketing campaign, resulting in a total of $101 million spent overall. The financing for Dick Tracy came from Disney and Silver Screen Partners IV, as well as Beatty's own production company, Mulholland Productions. Disney was originally going to release the film under the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner, but chose instead to release and market the film under the adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures label leading up to the film's theatrical debut, because the studio felt it had too many mature themes for a Disney-branded film.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> The campaign for change was helped by {{the construction of the}} Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E

5|$|Greek life at UVA began a {{few decades}} after the school's {{establishment}} in 1819. Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies; the now-defunct Patrick Henry Society, for instance, initially had a membership nearly equal {{to the size of}} the student body. In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and assumed a significant role in the student body's social landscape. In the following decades, the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered. The twentieth century saw the system expand even more to include professional fraternities, social sororities, local fraternities, and black fraternities and sororities. Moving into the 2000s, several new social Greek organizations were founded, and multicultural organizations <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> to prominence.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the vital}} {{instruments}} which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden. Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads {{to control the}} long distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula. Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes– dispensing innovations of civilizations– <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E
