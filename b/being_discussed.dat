5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is <b>being</b> <b>discussed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Barthel {{referred}} {{to each of}} 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts {{have been added to}} the corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (recto) or v (verso) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A (Tahua), side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer uses an idiosyncratic numbering system.|$|E

Moltke {{participated in}} several major battles {{with the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet, {{including}} the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea, and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea. At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' fate was <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 to prevent their seizure by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Following release, {{there were}} several {{complaints}} about the game crashing, having a vague user interface, and lacking any save system. In response to these complaints, Svensson noted that a patch was <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> with the development team {{to address these issues}} in a future update. An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2. The update boasts an improved user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes, a password save system reminiscent of the original Mega Man games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and an additional boss character.|$|E

Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey.

Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback.

5|$|SR55 {{was first}} {{added to the}} state highway system in 1931, known as part of Legislative Route 43, and was routed on surface streets. It was renumbered SR55 in 1959, and the {{construction}} of the freeway portion began in the 1960s and continued until 1992. Due to congestion, several alternatives are <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> to expand the freeway portion past its current end in Newport Beach. SR55 received the first carpool lane in Orange County in 1985, and the first direct carpool ramp in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is <b>being</b> <b>discussed,</b> the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E

Several years later, the possibility of a fifth season was still <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> with Braga suggesting that fans could prompt Netflix into producing a new season of Enterprise by watching the existing four seasons on the service.

5|$|The film {{started as}} a {{collaboration}} between Henson and Froud, with ideas for the film first <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> between them following a screening of their previous collaboration, The Dark Crystal. Terry Jones of Monty Python wrote {{the first draft of}} the film's script early in 1984, drawing on Froud's sketches for inspiration. Various other scriptwriters, including Laura Phillips (who had previously written several episodes of Fraggle Rock), Lucas, Dennis Lee, and Elaine May, subsequently rewrote and made additions to the screenplay, although Jones received the film's sole screenwriting credit. Labyrinth was shot on location in Upper Nyack, Piermont and Haverstraw in New York, and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation Bill {{that would have}} brought the vote to a million women, {{so long as they}} owned property. While the bill was <b>being</b> <b>discussed,</b> the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} Julian to Kane Springs was {{completed}} in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, {{in order to receive}} state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> by county government officials in 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter {{wrote a letter to the}} San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway from El Centro; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.|$|E

5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad {{was aware}} that heavy water {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not {{been aware of the}} connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was <b>being</b> <b>discussed.</b> Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E
5|$|As 1938 began, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} as to where Briskin would go next. He {{was considered one of}} the top film executives in the industry. In mid-May, it was reported that Briskin was in negotiations with Sam Cohn to return to his former studio, Columbia, in the role of general manager. However, his name was still <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> for other major positions throughout the industry, such as the production head at Universal Pictures. On May 26 it was announced that Briskin and Columbia had reached a 7-year agreement for him to take over {{as the head of the}} production at the studio, where he resumed his former position of general manager on May 30. As part of the agreement, Briskin was issued stock options on 10,000 shares of Columbia stock, with a value of $13.875 per share. Briskin's return to Columbia would also reunite him with his brother, Irving, who had been a producer at Columbia for several years. Samuel Briskin's would be one of the top money earners in Hollywood in 1938, his earnings topping $106,000, putting him in the top 10 at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals <b>being</b> <b>discussed</b> to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E
