40|$|The {{effect of}} organic carbon {{amendment}} {{on the fate}} of <b>benazolin</b> was investigated in undisturbed soil columns. The soil columns were obtained from three different soil types located in three different regions with different crop production regimes. All soils were operated in a normal crop production regime, and one of the soils was additionally operated in low and high crop production regimes. Two experimental setups were conducted, one using [(14) C]maize straw and nonlabeled <b>benazolin</b> and one using nonlabeled maize straw and [(14) C]benazolin. The column experiments with [(14) C]maize straw showed that the residual crop residues remained mainly in the top layer. <b>Benazolin</b> and its metabolites showed a higher retention in columns that were amended with maize straw compared to column without amendment. The production regimes of the soils did not influence the behavior of <b>benazolin.</b> The effect of maize straw incorporation on the translocation and degradation of <b>benazolin</b> could well be caused by a change in the soil microbial activity, leading to an enhanced degradation of <b>benazolin</b> and producing metabolites exhibiting a sorption behavior different from the parent...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} non-extractable {{residues}} {{and the distribution}} of <b>benazolin</b> and its metabolites were evaluated three months after herbicide application (14 C-labelled) in physically extracted soil fractions of topsoil layers of undisturbed soil columns with and without incorporated maize straw (14 C-labelled). In addition, a variety of wet-chemical and spectroscopic methods were used to characterise the structure of organic carbon within the different soil fractions. The addition of crop residues increased the amount of dissolved organic carbon, enhanced the aromaticity of the organic carbon structure and enforced the aggregation of organomineral complexes. After incorporation of crop residues, an increase in the formation of metabolic compounds of <b>benazolin</b> and of non-extractable residues was detected. These results indicate that the addition of crop residues leads to a decrease in mobility and bioaccessibility of <b>benazolin</b> and its metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms in {{agricultural}} soils {{are responsible for}} maintaining soil fertility by participating in many different turnover processes. Along with the degradation of organic matter, humification takes place, plant-available nutrients are released, and the naturally occuring nutrient-cycles are preserved. Cultivation, fertilization, and environmental chemicals may affect the microbial communities and impair these processes. In the thesis presented, the effect of different active substance concentrations of the herbicide <b>Benazolin</b> and the PAH representative Benzo[a]pyrene on microorganisms involved in the turnover of crop residues was investigated in three successive experiments. The experiments were performed {{as part of the}} HGF (Helmholtz Association of National Research Centres) project soil functions. In microcosm studies 14 C-labelled maize straw was incorportated into typical orthic luvisol to simulate the degradation of crop residues {{in agricultural}} soils. Apart from radio-analytical determination of 14 C-mineralization rates, microbial activity was assessed by means of DMSO reductase-rates. Fungal biomass was analyzed by means of soil ergosterol contents. Additionally the microbial community structure was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequence analyses of 18 S rDNA fragments. The experimental results can be summarized as following: Application of <b>Benazolin</b> had a concentration-depended effect on the mineralization of maize straw and on the microbial activity. During the first days after application of the highest applied concentrations of <b>Benazolin</b> (50 and 200 mg kg- 1), mineralization of maize straw was reduced. At the same time the lower concentrations of applied <b>Benazolin</b> (1 and 10 mg kg- 1) stimulated the 14 CO 2 -releases and highest microbial activities were observed in these treatments. In contrast to the inhibiting effect of high amounts of <b>Benazolin,</b> Benzo[a]pyrene stimulated the turnover of plant material in the concentrations of 50 and 200 mg kg- 1. In these treatments also the highest microbial activity was detected. Towards the end of the incubation time of 150 days both xenobiotics induced a concentration-dependent increase of the fungal biomass with the strongest increase in the soils with highest concentrations of <b>Benazolin</b> and Benzo[a]pyrene. However, this had no effect on the structure of the fungal communities, which were similar in all soils treated with maize straw. The DGGE analysis of the 16 S rDNA indicated an influence of high concentrations of the applied xenobiotics on the composition of the bacterial communities. Accordingly, <b>Benazolin</b> treatment resulted in a decrease of the amount of bands in the DGGE gel and after application of Benzo[a]pyrene new bands appeared. From gels with amplified DNA from <b>Benazolin</b> and Benzo[a]pyrene treated soils (200 mg kg- 1) individual DGGE bands were excised. The DNA from those bands was cloned, sequenced and phylogenetically classified. Only some of these sequences were related to organisms frequently occurring in contaminated soils with organic pollutants. The fungal 18 S rDNA fragments, which were representative for all treatments with maize straw, were related to fungi known to degrade lignin and cellulose compounds. The results reveal that the xenobiotics a analyzed are only able to affect the turnover of the maize straw if they are applied at extremely high concentrations. The same is true for the microbial community composition, which was only changed in treatments which received the highest amounts of <b>Benazolin</b> or Benzo[a]pyrene. Overall the possible impact of the applied xenobiotics on the turnover of crop residues and the microbial communities involved can be considered small...|$|E

O experimento foi conduzido sob condições de casa-de-vegetação. A aplicação foi realizada quando as plantas encontravam-se no estádio de seis folhas. Foram feitas 6 repetições com os seguintes tratamentos, com as doses em i. a. /ha: 1) {{glyphosate}} (1494 g), 2) tifensulfuron methyl (6 g), 3) chlorimuron ethyl (10 g), 4) <b>benazolin</b> (300 g), 5) flumiclorac pentil (30 g), 6) bentazon (480 g), 7) lactofen (156 g), 8) fomesafen (200 g), 9) oxifluorfen (480 g), 10) imazethapyr (80 g), 11) fluoroglicofen (48 g) e testemunha sem aplicação. Foram feitas avaliações visuais e medições da altura das plantas aos 7 e aos 14 dias e, avaliação de matéria seca aos 28 dias após da aplicação. Os dados avaliados foram analisados através do ANOVA. Todos os tratamentos diferiram significativamente em relação à testemunha, ao nível de 5 % de probabilidade (Teste LSD). Os herbicidas glyphosate (100 % de mortalidade) e imazethapyr (67 % de mortalidade de plantas) diferiram com os demais tratamentos. Chlorimuron ethyl, bentazon e lactofen também mostraram ser eficientes causando reduções maiores de 80 % do peso de massa seca das plantas daninhas. <b>Benazolin</b> e flumiclorac pentil foram os de menor eficácia até quando causaram reduções de 50 e 60 % de matéria seca da planta daninha. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate the efficacy of post-emergence herbicides on soybean plants {{in order to control}} Commelina erecta L. This experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions. the herbicides were applied on plants at six leaves stage. Following treatments with six replications (doses in i. a. /ha) were tested: 1) Glyphosate (1494 g), 2) Tifensulfuron methyl (6 g), 3) Chlorimuron ethyl (10 g), 4) <b>Benazolin</b> (300 g), 5) Flumiclorac pentil (30 g), 6) Bentazon (480 g), 7) Lactofen (156 g), 8) Fomesafen (200 g), 9) Oxifluorfen (480 g), 10) Imazethapyr (80 g), 11) Fluoroglicofen (48 g) and an untreated control. Visual evaluations and plants height measurements were made after 7 and 14 days. Dry matter 28 days after applications was determined. With the obtained data an ANOVA test was conducted. All treatments showed significant differences from the untreated control at 5 % level (LSD Test). Best performance treatments were: Glyphosate (100 % plant mortality) and Imazethapyr (67 % plant mortality), differing significatively with the rest of treatments. Chlorimuron ethyl, Bentazon and Lactofen also showed high efficacy, reducing weed dry matter more than 80 %. <b>Benazolin</b> and Flumiclorac pentil were less effective, even so they respectively reduced dry matter to 50 and 65 %...|$|E
40|$|Small {{amounts of}} organic {{compounds}} are often found at much larger depths than expected from their organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient (K-oc). In this study the food dye Brilliant Blue (BB) {{was used to}} visualize the (preferential) transport pathways in undisturbed soil monoliths taken from an Orthic Luvisol and from a Eutric Cambisol. After spiking the monoliths with 1. 0 MBq of either C- 14 -labeled <b>benazolin</b> (leacher) or C- 14 -labeled benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, nonleacher), they were intermittently irrigated under free-draining conditions twice weekly with 4 mm of rain water for 17 weeks. BE (4 g L- 1) {{was added to the}} rain water during the last 4 weeks. After irrigation, the monoliths were sliced and photographs were taken from horizontal cross-sections. Soil was dried and incinerated to measure total C- 14 -activity. The mean travel depth for <b>benazolin</b> (6 - 7 cm) was larger than for BaP (2 cm), which is in line with their K-oc values, although BaP was much more mobile than expected from the K-oc value. BB patterns, arbitrarily classified into five intensity classes, showed that large parts of the monolith were bypassed below the completely stained upper two to five centimeter. Furthermore, BB patterns indicated the locations of strongly sorbing compounds in the deeper soil layers and are therefore a helpful tool to selectively sample the soil for these compounds. A continuously stained root channel below the 20 -cm depth contained substantial amounts of BaP, indicating that soil structure cannot be neglected to assess the fate of nonleachers in undisturbed soils.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the long-term behavior of breakthrough curves (BTCs) and temporal moments of a solute subjected to Freundlich equilibrium sorption (s=kc(n)). For one-dimensional transport in a homogeneous porous medium, we derived a power-law relation between travel time, tau, and solute displacement,., with the exponent being {{equal to the}} Freundlich n exponent. The mean solute velocity, derived {{from the first time}} moment, was found to change as tau(n- 1). For n values larger than 0. 66, the second time moment could be related to c (x) over bar (2 /n), where c is a constant. An approach based on the use of a critical concentration was developed to estimate the presence of the asymptotic regime in the tail of the BTC. This approach was tested successfully using numerical case studies. One-dimensional numerical simulations with varying values of k, n and initial mass were run to verify the closed form analytical expressions for the large time behavior of temporal moments and the tailing pail of breakthrough Curves. Good agreement between the slope of the tailing part of log-log transformed BTCs and the predicted slope using asymptotic theory was found. Asymptotic theory in general underestimated the magnitude of the concentration in the tail. The quality of the estimated concentrations in the tail improved for small values of the dispersivity. Experimental BTCs of uranin and <b>benazolin</b> were analyzed in combination with sorption/desorption batch experiments using asymptotic theory. A good agreement between the value of n parameter derived from desorption experiment with <b>benazolin</b> and the value of the n parameter derived from the tail of the BTC was found.

40|$|Pollution {{of water}} by {{herbicides}} and heavy metals has caused world wide concern {{because of the}} adverse effects of these pollutants on the environment, humans and wildlife. This has resulted in tighter legislation being imposed on the levels of these pollutants in drinking water. For example, the European Union (EU) has set the legislation in the drinking water Directive Admissible Concentration for a single herbicide {{to a maximum of}} 0. 1 ppb. Despite the tight environmental pollution controls, isolated cases of pollutants exceeding their limits are still encountered. This would suggest that research towards the efficient and effective removal of these pollutants will be an on-going process. In this study, sorption of copper and some selected herbicides e. g. atrazine, <b>benazolin</b> and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) was undertaken on a conventional activated carbon and its modified series. A low level detection method was developed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and this system was used to quantify the sorption capacity of the herbicides. In order to understand the sorption mechanism of the targeted pollutants, physical and chemical characterisation of the adsorbents was undertaken using a variety of techniques. These include, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) method, pore size distribution and surface area measurements, elemental analysis, sodium capacity determination, zeta potential and pH titration. The sorption data were presented and analysed by conventional adsorption isotherms.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A range of adsorbents have been evaluated for the adsorption of selected herbicide compounds from aqueous solution. The adsorption performance of LF - 1, a carbonised polymer produced in the laboratory, Amberlite XAD- 4, a commercially available polymeric adsorbent produced by Rohm and Haas and MN- 200, a HypersolMacronet polymer produced by Purolite, were compared with a commercial activated carbon, Chemviron F - 400. The pore size distributions of the adsorbents have been investigated using nitrogen adsorption. F- 400, LF- 1 and MN- 200 were found to contain similar microporous structures. The carbons also possess a significant degree of mesoporous structure, which may enhance the diffusion of organic species into the micropores. The pore size distribution for XAD- 4 shows an almost exclusive meso/macroporosity with very little microporous structure. Spectroscopic analysis and titration of the adsorbents indicated {{a number of different}} oxygen functional groups. XPS and elemental analysis suggested higher oxygen concentrations than those obtained using direct titration, which was attributed to bound oxygen within the structure of the adsorbents. The adsorption capacity of phenol was assessed as a characterisation technique. The capacity of the carbons was much greater than the polymeric adsorbents. Analytical techniques were developed and validated for the determination of trace levels (0. 1 parts per billion) of five herbicides; atrazine, <b>benazolin,</b> bentazone, imazapyr and tric 1 opyr. Single and multi-component adsorption isotherms are presented for trace concentrations of the herbicides in aqueous solution. The effect of pH and fulvic acid upon the adsorption was also investigated. Mini-column experiments were performed using multi-component mixtures. In all cases, the uptake of herbicides on F - 400 is greater than on the other adsorbents. Regeneration of F- 400 and MN- 200 was investigated usmg solvent stripping techniques. Significant regeneration efficiencies were observed using ethanol at pH 12 and 50 °C to make the technique a viable option...|$|E
