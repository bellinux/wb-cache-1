5|$|The Battle of Finschhafen {{prevented}} the early occupation of Saidor. The Japanese wrested back {{the initiative and}} threatened to derail MacArthur's strategy, but ultimately failed to dislodge the Australian 9th Division or prevent the occupation of the Finschhafen area. With the battle won, the 9th Division initiated a pursuit of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's retreating Japanese Eighteenth Army on 5 December 1943. Adachi was in a difficult and precarious position, attempting to conduct a fighting withdrawal with his inland right flank vulnerable to attack from the Australian 7th Division in the Ramu Valley and his seaward left flank open to amphibious assault. That he {{had an opportunity to}} destroy Adachi's army was not lost on MacArthur, who decided on 10 December that Saidor should be seized on or about 7 January, provided that Operation <b>Backhander,</b> the landing at Cape Gloucester, was proceeding satisfactorily. On 17 December, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the commander of Alamo Force, received orders setting a target date for Saidor of 2 January 1944.|$|E
25|$|With the Canucks' roster set, {{the team}} played its inaugural {{game against the}} Los Angeles Kings on October 9, 1970. They lost the contest 3–1; defenceman Barry Wilkins scored the Canucks' lone goal {{in the game and}} first in {{franchise}} history, a <b>backhander</b> against goaltender Denis DeJordy. Two days later, the squad recorded the first win in franchise history, a 5–3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 1943, General Douglas MacArthur issued {{orders for}} the {{invasion}} of New Britain, codenamed Operation Dexterity. This operation was conceived with several phases, with the broad Allied scheme of maneuver being to secure all of New Britain west of the line between Gasmata and Talasea on the north coast. Within this plan, one of the phases, codenamed <b>Backhander,</b> was a landing around Cape Gloucester aimed at the capture, and expansion of, two Japanese military airfields. This was {{to contribute to the}} increased isolation and harassment of the major Japanese base at Rabaul, while a secondary goal was to ensure free Allied sea passage through the straits separating New Britain from New Guinea.|$|E

25|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for developing plans for Operation Dexterity, with work on this having commenced in August 1943. Intelligence to inform these plans was sourced from Marine and Alamo Scout patrols which were landed in New Britain between September and December, {{as well as from}} aerial photography. The US 1st Marine Division was the main unit selected for the Cape Gloucester landing; combined with artillery, transport, construction and logistics units this force was designated the <b>Backhander</b> Task Force. The force selected for Arawe was built around the 112th Cavalry Regiment, which had been dismounted and was serving as infantry. The cavalry regiment was augmented with artillery and engineer units, with the overall force being designated the Director Task Force.|$|E
500|$|By 1877, Wills' cricket career [...] "had {{become a}} series of petty {{disputes}} in petty games" [...] of [...] "ever-deteriorating standards." [...] No longer an office-bearer with Corio, he moved amongst lower-level clubs in the Geelong area, earning scraps of money wherever he could. In a brief postscript to one of several rejected applications for employment at the MCC, Wills gave voice to old cricketers [...] "left in the cold". De Moore interpreted the postscript as [...] "an unmistakable <b>backhander</b> for the club." [...] He continues: [...] "To see Wills simply as a beggar would be to misunderstand him." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 15, 2009, Tavares {{signed a}} three-year, {{entry-level}} {{contract with the}} Islanders. His first NHL game was in the pre-season {{in a game against}} the Edmonton Oilers. He spent 22 minutes and 50 seconds on the ice alongside linemates Doug Weight and Sean Bergenheim during the Islanders' 3–2 loss. Weight, a veteran NHLer, said that, [...] "John's {{going to be a big}} piece of [...]" [...] Tavares scored his first career NHL goal and assist in his first ever professional game, scoring on a <b>backhander</b> against Marc-André Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 3, 2009.|$|E

Springing from the bed, he seized the {{bucket of water}} which he had recently drawn, and dashed its contents on the struggling band. Thereafter he hauled the trombone out of the debris by the neck, flattened his instrument on his head, and twisted it round his neck. The key-bugle, who had struggled to his feet, fell before a well-aimed <b>backhander,</b> and the French horn was about to perish, when Gildart succeeded in restraining and pacifying the giant by stoutly asserting that he had won his bet, and insisted on having payment on the spot! ...|$|E

60|$|Whether {{it was to}} this process, or to {{the action}} of nature, or to the {{combined}} efforts of nature and his friends, that Bumpus owed his recovery, we cannot pretend to say; but certain it is that, on Corrie making a severer dab than usual into the pit of the seaman's stomach, he gave a gasp and a sneeze, the latter of which almost overturned Poopy, who chanced to be gazing wildly into his countenance at the moment. At {{the same time he}} involuntarily threw up his right arm, and fetched Corrie such a tremendous <b>backhander</b> on the chest that our young hero was laid flat on his back--half stunned by the violence of his fall, yet shouting with delight that his rugged friend still lived to strike another blow.|$|E
6000|$|Of course Dan {{brought about}} this {{incident}} by wise forethought. His next success is unpremeditated. Making a pull at Sally's skirt, he glides quickly {{out of her}} way as she wheels round, and hits Mainmast an unintentional <b>backhander</b> on the nose. This is received by Mainmast with a little scream, and by the children with an [...] "Oh! o-o" [...] of consternation, while Sally, pulling down the handkerchief, hastens to give needless assurance that she is [...] "so vexed," [...] etcetera. Susannah joins her in condoling, and so does widow Martin; but Mainmast, with tears in her eyes, (drawn by the blow), and a smile on her lips, declares that she [...] "don't care a button." [...] Sally is therefore blindfolded again. She catches Charlie Christian immediately, and feeling that {{there is no other way}} of escaping from him, names him.|$|E
60|$|But Red Rooney was {{not quite}} so foolish as they {{supposed}} him to be. Having gained the nearest possible point to his victim, he made a sudden and tremendous rush at it. He knew that life and death were in the balance at any rate; but {{he also knew that}} to remain inactive on that iceberg would remove life out of the balance altogether. He therefore threw all his energy of soul and body into that rush, and launched himself against the broad back of the bear. It was an awful shock. Rooney was swift as well as heavy, so that his weight, multiplied into his velocity, sufficed to dislodge the wonder-stricken animal. One wild spasmodic effort it made to recover itself, and in doing so gave Rooney what may be called a <b>backhander</b> on the head, that sent him reeling on the ice.|$|E
50|$|A {{few months}} later, it was {{revealed}} that Jensen's transfer to Highbury was at least partly motivated by George Graham's involvement with agent Rune Hauge, who had been giving Graham <b>backhanders</b> in exchange for signing players he represented. The first player involved in this 'bung' scandal was Norwegian defender Pål Lydersen, and the second was Jensen. Graham was sacked from his job two months after the story broke, and he was subsequently banned from football for 12 months.|$|R

50|$|The Don Beech Scandal {{was one of}} {{two major}} storylines centred on corrupt Detective Sergeant Don Beech. Since the character's debut in 1995, his {{corruption}} had steadily grown, taking <b>backhanders</b> from suspects, making deals with dodgy criminals, and getting himself immersed into the underworld of crime. The Scandal played out over three years in the show - beginning with the introduction of DS Claire Stanton in 1999 and Beech's imprisonment in his second major storyline in 2001. The storyline concluded with the whole of CID being suspended, with only four officers being reinstated.|$|R
6000|$|Your good {{letter of}} this morning helps to console and sustain. One really needs any lift one can get after this odious experience. I am emerging, but it is slow, and I feel much ravaged and bedimmed. Fortunately these days have an {{intrinsic}} beauty--of the rarest and charmingest here; and I try to fling myself on the breast of Nature (though I don't mean by that fling myself and my poor blisters and scars on the dew-sprinkled lawn) and forget, imperfectly, that precious hours and days tumble unrestrained into the large round, the deep dark, the ever open, hole of sacrifice. I am almost afraid my silly lessors of the Chelsea Flat won't apply {{to you for a}} character of me if they haven't done so by now; afraid because the idea of a <b>backhander</b> from you, reaching them straight, would so gratify my sense of harmless sport. It was only a question of a word in case they should appeal; kindly don't dream of any such if they let the question rest (in spite indeed of their having intimated that they would thoroughly thresh it out.) ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{fifth quarter}} was a painful {{one in every}} way. Faiz-Ullah played like a little red demon, and The Rabbit seemed to be {{everywhere}} at once, and Benami rode straight at anything and everything that came in his way; while the umpires on their ponies wheeled like gulls outside the shifting game. But the Archangels had the better mounts,--they had kept their racers till late in the game,--and never allowed the Skidars to play football. They hit the ball {{up and down the}} width of the ground till Benami and the rest were outpaced. Then they went forward, and time and again Lutyens and Grey Dawn were just, and only just, able to send the ball away with a long, spitting <b>backhander.</b> Grey Dawn forgot that he was an Arab; and turned from grey to blue as he galloped. Indeed, he forgot too well, for he did not keep his eyes on the ground as an Arab should, but stuck out his nose and scuttled for the dear honour of the game. They had watered the ground once or twice between the quarters, and a careless waterman had emptied the last of his skinful all in one place near the Skidars' goal. It was close {{to the end of the}} play, and for the tenth time Grey Dawn was bolting after the ball, when his near hind-foot slipped on the greasy mud, and he rolled over and over, pitching Lutyens just clear of the goal-post; and the triumphant Archangels made their goal. Then [...] "time" [...] was called-two goals all; but Lutyens had to be helped up, and Grey Dawn rose with his near hind-leg strained somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found that}} country pub which I had already {{recommended}} to your notice, and there I made my discreet inquiries. I {{was in the}} bar, and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted. Williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the Hall. There is some rumor that he is or has been a clergyman, but one or two incidents of his short residence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical. I have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency, and {{they tell me that}} there WAS a man of that name in orders, whose career has been a singularly dark one. The landlord further informed me that there are usually week-end visitors--'a warm lot, sir'--at the Hall, and especially one gentleman with a red moustache, Mr. Woodley by name, who was always there. We had got as far as this, when who should walk in but the gentleman himself, who had been drinking his beer in the tap-room and had heard the whole conversation. Who was I? What did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He ended a string of abuse by a vicious <b>backhander,</b> which I failed to entirely avoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me. Mr. Woodley went home in a cart. So ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that, however enjoyable, my day on the Surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own." ...|$|E

The latter say that while every politician is corrupt, at least Janković is “a man of action” and has finally done something for residents of Ljubljana. This normally refers to him having built the Stožice stadium. His opponents point out, however, that he built it with taxpayers' money and that his family and companies owned by them have benefited {{to the tune of}} many millions from <b>backhanders</b> paid by building contractors engaged to construct it, while subcontractors were not paid for their work, supposedly for lack of funds.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a curious}} paradox about the Canadian Corps that is summed up in this {{quotation}} from Canadian Brass, Stephen J. Harris’s study {{of the evolution of}} a professional army in Canada. How did this military organisation become so effective in war, considering the background it had and the structure that supported it for most of its existence? This model of tactical excellence was born amid the chaos of Canadian Minister of Defence Sam Hughes’ egomaniacal control at Valcartier Camp. It was beset by jealousies, political <b>backhanders,</b> corruption and influence peddling, and saddled with favourites as incompetent officers who at best were ’very weak” and had “no power or habit of command. ” 2 Hughes determined to ensure that no Regular soldier received a command appointment, and instead put in his favourites. These were drawn from the citizen militia, whose ability was summed up by the young iconoclast and future military theorist J. F. C. Fuller, who remarked that the Canadians had potential only “if the officers could all be shot. ” 3 Yet the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) rose above this administrative nightmare, even if its impact continued to haunt the force for most of its existence...|$|R

5000|$|Kalsi Designed his own [...] "Straight Barrel" [...] Dhol in 1984. He did {{an immense}} amount of {{research}} {{as to why the}} Dhol was shaped in the Barrel shape. He discovered that the only reason was {{because of the fact that}} there was Goat Skin on both sides of the Drum. The Treble skin had to be pulled very tight with the rope and the tension had to remain in the stretching process. The shape of the wooden barrel kept the tension in the rope therefor the skin would remain tight.As Johnny had mounted [...] "Dholak" [...] hooks he realized that the barrel shape was no longer needed as the hooks took up the tension.Johnny then went to Pakistan to get a straight barrel Dhol Drum made from a village outside Lahore, Punjab.From learning that tree's had to be planted in order to make 3 Drums 4 Dholaks & 6 Tablas from 1 Talli Tree (equivalent to an Oak or Mahogany) this was not going to be the easiest of tasks, however it was achieved with some <b>backhanders</b> at the airport and the DHol Barrel was carried back to UK.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, France {{negotiated}} {{a deal to}} sell three Agosta-class submarines to Pakistan for a sum equivalent to 826m euros (£684m, $996m). In accordance with standard procedure back then (only in 2000 did France sign an OECD convention outlawing commissions), some 50m euros were paid as [...] "sweeteners" [...] to various senior Pakistani figures....In 1995, Jacques Chirac defeated Mr Balladur {{in the first round}} of the vote and went on to become president. According to Le Contrat, he immediately cancelled payment of the commissions which he knew (from intelligence sources) had helped to fund his rival's campaign. Seven years later, an explosion killed 11 employees of the DCN as they travelled to work in Karachi. For a long time it was presumed the attack was the work of al-Qaeda. But last year a new judge in charge of the case, Marc Trévidic, focused on another theory. He believes that the Karachi attack may have been carried out on orders from unnamed Pakistani intelligence and military chiefs, angry that their share of the Agosta <b>backhanders</b> was never paid. It is a monumental - and unproven - allegation. But the families of many of those who died are increasingly inclined to believe it. Their lawyer, Olivier Morice, is the most outspoken of the president's critics. [...] "Nicolas Sarkozy was at the heart of the corruption and he has lied to the families. What we have before us is not some imaginary tale, but a state lie. The families are indignant and demand his resignation," [...] he said.|$|R
