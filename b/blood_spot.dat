METHODS: We determined AAT levels in serum samples and dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> from 192 COPD patients. For the preparation of dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots,</b> a disk (diameter, 6 mm) was placed into a tube, eluted with 200 &# 181;L of PBS, and stored overnight at 4 &# 186;C. All of the samples were analyzed by immunonephelometry in duplicate. We used the bootstrap resampling method {{in order to determine}} a cut-off point for AAT levels in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots.</b> RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between the AAT levels in serum samples and those in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> was r = 0. 45. For dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots,</b> the cut-off value was 2. 02 mg/dL (97 % CI: 1. 45 - 2. 64 mg/dL), with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100 %, 95. 7 %, 27. 2 %, and 100 %, respectively.

Routinely collected blood specimens from newborns, stored as dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots,</b> {{may provide a}} low-cost method to objectively measure maternal smoking close {{to the time of}} delivery. This article compares cotinine levels in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> to those in umbilical cord blood to assess cotinine in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> as a biomarker of maternal smoking close to the time of delivery. The California Genetic Disease Screening Program provided dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> from 428 newborns delivered in 2001 - 2003 with known umbilical cord blood cotinine levels. Cotinine in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> was measured in 6. 35 -mm punches by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (quantitation limit, 3. 1 ng/mL). Repeated measures of cotinine in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> were highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 99, P < 0. 001) among 100 dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> with cotinine quantitated in 2 separate punches. Linear regression revealed that cotinine levels in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> were slightly lower than those in umbilical cord blood and predicted umbilical cord blood cotinine levels well (β = 0. 95, R 2 = 0. 80, and P < 0. 001 for both cotinine levels in log 10 scale). When defining active smoking as a cotinine level of 10 ng/mL or more and using umbilical cord blood cotinine as the criterion standard, we found that measurements of cotinine in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> had high sensitivity (92. 3 %) and specificity (99. 7 %) in the prediction of maternal active smoking.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Blood</b> <b>spots</b> {{collected}} onto {{filter paper}} are an established and convenient source of antibodies for serological diagnosis and epidemiological surveys. Although {{recommendations for the}} storage and analysis of small molecule analytes in <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> exist, there are no published systematic studies of the stability of antibodies under different storage conditions. Methods <b>Blood</b> <b>spots,</b> on filter paper or glass fibre mats and containing malaria-endemic plasma, were desiccated and stored at various temperatures for different times. Eluates of these spots were assayed for antibodies against two Plasmodium falciparum antigens, MSP- 1 19 and MSP 2, and calculated titres used to fit an exponential (first order kinetic) decay model. The first order rate constants (k) for each spot storage temperature were used to fit an Arrhenius equation, in order to estimate the thermal and temporal stability of antibodies in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots.</b> The utility of <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> for serological assays was confirmed by comparing antibodies eluted from <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> with the equivalent plasma values {{in a series of}} samples from North Eastern Tanzania and by using blood spot-derived antibodies to estimate malaria transmission intensity in this site and for two localities in Uganda. Results Antibodies in spots on filter paper and glass fibre paper had similar stabilities but blood was more easily absorbed onto filter papers than glass fibre, spots were more regular and spot size was more closely correlated with blood volume for filter paper spots. Desiccated spots could be stored at or below 4 °C for extended periods, but were stable for only very limited periods at ambient temperature. When desiccated, recoveries of antibodies that are predominantly of IgG 1 or IgG 3 subclasses were similar. Recoveries of antibodies from paired samples of serum and of <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> from Tanzania which had been suitably stored showed similar recoveries of antibodies, but spots which had been stored for extended periods at ambient humidity and temperature showed severe loss of recoveries. Estimates of malaria transmission intensity obtained from serum and from <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> were similar, and values obtained using <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> agreed well with entomologically determined values. Conclusion This study has demonstrated the suitability of filter paper <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> paper for collection of serum antibodies, and provided clear guidelines for the treatment and storage of filter papers which emphasize the importance of desiccation and minimisation of time spent at ambient temperatures. A recommended protocol for collecting, storing and assaying <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> is provided. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to assess the feasibility of using ferritin and transferrin receptor measurements on dried capillary <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> to identify iron deficiency (ID) in public health surveys. Measurements on serum and <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> prepared from venous blood were performed in 71 healthy subjects, 41 of whom were iron-replete and 30 who had ID, either without (n 5 20) or with (n 5 10) anemia. Parallel measurements were performed on hemolyzed whole blood and washed hemolyzed red blood cells to assess the erythrocyte contribution of ferritin and transferrin receptor to dried blood samples. The concentration of ferritin in dried blood samples was threefold higher than serum assays due {{to the release of}} ferritin from hemolyzed erythrocytes, which diminished the usefulness of ferritin measurements for de-tecting ID. On the other hand, there was negligible erythro-cyte contribution to the measurement of transferrin receptor in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots.</b> The most sensitive parameter in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> was the ratio of receptor/ferritin, which was suitable for identifying iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), but less reliable than serum assays for detecting milder ID without anemia. We conclude that tandem measurements of serum ferritin and transferrin receptor in dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> can be used to facilitate the identification of IDA in epidemiologic studies...|$|R

40|$|Parasitologic {{diagnosis}} of infection with the intestinal nematode Strongyloides stercoralis is relatively insensitive and logistically challenging. Serologic assays based on detection of antibodies to crude larval antigen offer increased sensitivity, but specificity is hampered by cross-reactive antibodies and persistence after cure. Further, standardization of antigen for assays is problematic. The use of recombinant antigen can potentially overcome these problems, and the NIE antigen from S. stercoralis {{has been used}} widely with good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Detection of antibody eluted from dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> has shown utility in large-scale seroepidemiologic studies, and is appealing in children where venipuncture or stool collection is problematic. We adapted an existing NIE-ELISA protocol for the testing of anti-strongyloides antibody response on dried <b>blood</b> <b>spots</b> collected {{as part of an}} ivermectin mass drug administration conducted in an Australian Indigenous community. The NIE ELISA was first validated using representative positive, negative, and equivocal timematched serum samples previously tested using S. ratti antigen ELISA. Optimal assay and storage conditions were determined using positive control <b>blood</b> <b>spots,</b> and samples screened with the adapted NIE-DBSELISA. <b>Blood</b> <b>spots</b> were stable for several days at 37 oC, or following longer-term storage at 4 oC, - 20 oC or - 80 oC.

No time-associated differences were seen in negative or equivocal samples.
