40|$|L-Arginine {{hydrochloride}} is a {{very important}} aggregation suppressor for which there has been much attention given regarding elucidating its mechanism of action. Little consideration, however, has been given toward other salt forms <b>besides</b> chloride, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the counterion likely imparts a large influence per the Hofmeister Series. Here, we report an in depth analysis of the role the counterion plays in the aggregation suppression behavior of arginine. Consistent with the empirical Hofmeister series, we found that the aggregation suppression ability of other arginine salt forms on a model protein (α-chymotrypsinogen) follows the order: H[subscript 2]PO[subscript 4][superscript –] > SO[subscript 4][superscript 2 –] > citratep[superscript 2 –] > acetate[superscript –] ≈ F[superscript –] ≈ Cl[superscript –] > Br[superscript –] > I[superscript –] ≈ SCN[superscript –]. Mechanistically, preferential interaction and osmotic virial coefficient measurements, in addition to molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that attractive ion–ion interactions, particularly attractive interactions between arginine molecules, play a dominate role in the observed behavior. Furthermore, it appears that dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, and citrate have strong attractive interactions with the guanidinium group of arginine, which seems to contribute to the superior aggregation suppression ability of those salt forms by bridging together multiple arginine molecules into clusters. These results not only further our understanding of how arginine influences protein stability, they also help to elucidate the mechanism behind the Hofmeister Series. This should help to improve biopharmaceutical stabilization through the use of other arginine salts and possibly, the development of novel excipients.

The current study propose a cross-sectional analysis to investigate the combination of EO and MO and its impact on performance through a quantitative research method. Based on existing theories and previous studies, three hypotheses have been formulated : H 1 : Companies that are entrepreneurial oriented outperform companies that are not.

40|$|The {{informed}} consent {{to a medical}} treatment or participation in medical research is nowadays considered a fundamental standard of everyday practice and scientific research in medicine. However, accepting this standard, both in medical ethics and law, is not uniquely viewed upon {{in terms of its}} content or necessity. Starting from basic principles – human dignity and individual autonomy – UNESCO’s International Committee for Bioethics has offered in sketches of three bioethics declarations unique rules which must be followed in the application of this institute, and which were consequently adopted by consensus by all UNESCO state members. Following a short historical overview, this presentation examines the standards of patients’ consent to a medical measure or exam contained in UNESCO’s bioethics declarations, namely: Universal Declaration on Human Genome and Human Rights, International Declaration on Human Genetic Data and Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. Th e presentation will show that declarations hold only minimum standards that protect patients or participants in medical exams from self-willing treatment or research and that the authors of these documents missed the opportunity to set rigorous and explicit rules for the applications of this institute. However, bearing in mind that most countries’ domestic legal regulations are not sufficiently elaborated in regards with biomedicine and that the existing domestic laws diff er in many aspects, the author shall show that the UNESCO’s bioethics declarations are a useful source and signposts for the domestic systems in defining ethical and legal regulations regarding biomedicine. <b>Besides,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> these documents are not legally binding, one should bear in mind that declarations of this type are the first step towards the necessary protection of human rights with regards to biomedicine worldwide and they promote a new approach to solving bioethical dilemma based on the international law on human rights...|$|E

40|$|Tesis para optar al grado de Doctor en EconomíaThis work {{proposes a}} novel {{matching}} estimator where weights {{and the choice}} of neighbors used are endogenously determined by solving an optimization problem. The estimator is non-parametric {{and is based on}} nding, for each unit that needs to be matched, sets of observations such that a convex combination of their covariates has the same value of the covariates as the unit to be matched, or with minimized distance between them. Since there is generally more than one set per each unit, the method chooses the one with the closest covariate values. In this work we contribute to the matching literature by linking the choice of matches and weights to the improvement of post-matching covariate balance in a simple way: an optimization problem that optimizes individual covariate balance. It is worth mentioning that the developed method is not an algorithm that iteratively checks covariate balance until convergence. Instead, it incorporates an individual balance criterion in the objective function that determines the weights used in each match. It can be written as a linear program that allows us to use standard optimization techniques to solve the problem quickly. To aid research, we provide a new R library called blopmatching. Regarding asymptotic properties, we shows that our estimator of the ATE attains stan- dard limit properties (consistency and normality), and it has a conditional bias that is Op(N 2 =k). It worth mentioning that this order improves the order N 1 =k attained by the NN-matching estimator. In fact, Op(N 2 =k) could be attained by the NN-matching estima- tor in the only case in which the conditional expectation of the outcome variable is a linear expression in covariates, a condition under which the conditional bias of our estimators is as good as we want. <b>Besides,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the proposed estimator of the ATE is not p N- consistent in general, we show that if the number of control units increases faster than the number of treated units, then our matching estimator of the ATT attains the p N-consistency, as its bias rate is better than the one attained by the NN-matching estimator. Finally, as regards nite sample properties, we implement the proposed estimator to data from the National Supported Work Demonstration nding an outstanding performance even though when using alternative control groups from a non-experimental sample. In addition, by performing Monte Carlo experiments with designs based on the related literature that includes misspeci cation of the selection equation, we study its performance in nite samples. We nd that our estimator provides good post-matching balance and performs well in terms of bias and variance when compared to nearest neighbor matching estimators (for both covariates and propensity score) and the normalized inverse probability weighting estimator. Major improvements are observed when there is underspeci cation of the selection equation for estimating the propensity score. Hence, our method gives researchers a new alternative matching estimator that prevents the selection of an arbitrary number of neighbors or the estimation of the propensity score...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, the {{lubricity}} {{mechanism of}} spherical nano-SiO 2 {{is quite different}} from that of nano-MoS 2 platelets. The higher-magnification image of the worn surface in Fig.  9 a and corresponding EDS reveal the presence of nano-SiO 2 on the worn surface. Unlike nano-MoS 2, nano-SiO 2 possesses nano-scale size and excellent dispersion in the base lubricant. These characteristics allow the nano-SiO 2 to easily enter the contact area, thereby resulting in faster running-in conditions (Fig.  2). The rolling effect was often proposed as a lubrication mechanism for spherical nanoparticles, although little research has been conducted on the direct visualization of the rolling behavior of the nano-SiO 2 into the contact interfaces [33, 43]. In this way, nanoparticles decrease the shear stress and lead to the reduction in friction coefficient. <b>Besides,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the surface of the magnesium alloy plate was looking smooth, when we observed its micro meter and nanoscale image, the surface was complicated with ridges and valleys. When nanoparticles were added into the base oil, the filling of valleys of the contacting asperities will occur. This is also supported by the high magnification FESEM spectra (Fig.  9), which shows the distribution of nanoparticles on the worn surface. As shown in Fig.  9, it is clearly seen that nano-SiO 2 fills up the grooves of the rubbing surfaces, while nano-MoS 2 deposits on the flat of the worn surfaces. It demonstrates that the difference in the distribution of nanoparticles on the worn surface is substantial. This {{can be explained by the}} model proposed by Mosleh Mohsen [21]. The authors suggested that the nanoparticles can fill up valleys and smooth the surface if the characteristic length l of flaky nanoparticles is smaller than the peak-to-valley roughness of the harder surface which is equal to 4 Ra, i.e., the condition of l[*]<[*] 4 Ra applies. With respect to spherical nanoparticles, the diameter d of the particle should satisfy d[*]<[*] 0.67 Ra. Comparatively, nano-SiO 2 with an average size of about 30  nm acts as a third body material filling in the valley of surface with 0.08 -μm surface roughness, increasing real contact area. As a result, the load can be distributed over a larger contact area, so that the effective contact pressure decreases and consequently the wear also reduce. However, nano-MoS 2 platelets may be difficult to fill in the cavities because its length (more than 300  nm) is larger than 4 Ra in our study. In comparison with pure nano-SiO 2 additive (Fig.  10 b), the micro-cooperation for SiO 2 /MoS 2 hybrid nanoparticles additive occurred in succession between the shearing-sliding of the nano-MoS 2 platelets structure and the filling of nano-SiO 2 particles during sliding process, resulting in excellent lubrication performances (Fig.  10 c). However, the efficiency of the SiO 2 /MoS 2 hybrid nanofluids was influenced by the mass ratio of SiO 2 /MoS 2. For instance, the lubrication performances of SiO 2 /MoS 2 (0.5 : 0.5) and SiO 2 /MoS 2 (0.75 : 0.25) were a little inferior to that of the SiO 2 /MoS 2 (0.25 : 0.75) at the test condition. Namely, there was an optimum dose of nano-SiO 2 in the SiO 2 /MoS 2 hybrid nanofluids. If excess nano-SiO 2 was added into the SiO 2 /MoS 2 hybrid nanofluids, the contact area was saturated with nano-SiO 2. Any more nano-SiO 2 took up the space of nano-MoS 2 and disturbed its lubrication. The nano-SiO 2 has outstanding mechanical properties especially in terms of hardness (Vickers hardness— 1000  kgf/mm 2); therefore, the excess hard nano-SiO 2 as an abrasive plows the soft magnesium alloy surfaces (Vickers hardness— 66.7  kgf/mm 2) under the applied load. It will facilitate the abrasion of the magnesium alloy surface during rubbing process and thus results in the worse anti-wear property. This was confirmed by the poor anti-wear behaviors of the samples with high concentrations of nano-SiO 2, such as SiO 2 /MoS 2 (0.5 : 0.5), SiO 2 /MoS 2 (0.75 : 0.25) and pure nano-SiO 2 as shown in Fig.  3 a. Therefore, the nano-SiO 2 and nano-MoS 2 mass ratio of 0.25 : 0.75 is the best proportion for synergetic lubrication effect under the selected testing conditions. In addition, from the XPS results of the worn magnesium alloy surface, nano-SiO 2 is shown to prevent nano-MoS 2 from oxidation, resulting in increased oxidation resistance of nano-MoS 2 during rubbing process. The oxidation phenomenon may provide an important role in the sense. It could provide a “soft” oxide-like MoO 3 which could serve to tether the nanoparticles to the magnesium alloy surface. However, if nano-MoS 2 is overmuch oxidized into MoO 3, the oxidation destroys the lubrication structure of layered MoS 2 and thus results in the worse lubrication property [37]. Therefore, the synergistic lubricating effect enables the SiO 2 /MoS 2 hybrid nanofluids to integrate the advantages and eradicate the disadvantages of SiO 2 and MoS 2 nanoparticles at optimal ratio. So the SiO 2 /MoS 2 (0.25 : 0.75) hybrid nanoparticles exhibit superior lubricating performances than individual nano-SiO 2 or nano-MoS 2 even in high load and diverse velocity cases. Previous work on the combination of MoS 2 with other nanoparticles as lubricant additives has reported improvements in their lubricating performance, such as nano-TiO 2 [24], carbon nanotubes (CNT) [25], and graphene [26]. Since the testing method and analysis are completely different from the present study, comparable comparison between the results cannot be made. Even so, nano-SiO 2 is less costly and facile preparation in contrast with the aforementioned nanoparticles. In conclusion, the SiO 2 /MoS 2 hybrid nanoparticles are suggested as economic and environment friendly lubricant additives for the applications in forming process of magnesium alloy.|$|E
