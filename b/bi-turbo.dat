25|$|Also in 2008, Frentzen {{built the}} HHF Hybrid Concept Car which he {{entered in the}} 24 Hours Nürburgring with his own Team. The chassis was a bought Gumpert Apollo road car with a 3.3 litre V8 <b>bi-turbo</b> with 520hp and an {{electric}} motor with approximately 136hp. Frentzen finished the race but was not classified due to two conventional gearbox failures.|$|E
25|$|Twin-turbo or <b>bi-turbo</b> designs {{have two}} {{separate}} turbochargers operating {{in either a}} sequence or in parallel. In a parallel configuration, both turbochargers are fed one-half of the engine’s exhaust. In a sequential setup one turbocharger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a predetermined engine speed or load. Sequential turbochargers further reduce turbo lag, but require an intricate set of pipes to properly feed both turbochargers.|$|E
25|$|Yamaha {{has built}} engines for other manufacturers' {{vehicles}} {{beginning with the}} development and production of the Toyota 2000GT (1967) with the Toyota Motor Corporation. Also, the cylinder head from the Toyota 4A-GE engine was developed by Yamaha Motor Corporation and was built at Toyota's Shimayama plant alongside the 4A and 2A engines. All performance-oriented cylinder heads on Toyota/Lexus engines were designed and/or built by Yamaha. Some examples are the 1LR-GUE engine found on the 2010–2012 Lexus LFA, the 2UR-GSE found in Lexus ISF, the 3S-GTE engine found on the Toyota Celica GT4 and the 2ZZ-GE engine found on the 1999–2006 Toyota Celica GT-S. In 1984, executives of the Yamaha Motor Corporation {{signed a contract with}} the Ford Motor Company to develop, produce, and supply compact 60° 3.0 Liter DOHC V6 engines for transverse application for the 1989–'95 Ford Taurus SHO. From 1993 to 1995, the SHO engine was produced in 3.0 and 3.2 Liter versions. Yamaha jointly designed the 3.4 Liter DOHC V-8 engine with Ford for the 1996–'99 SHO. Ford and Yamaha also developed the Zetec-SE branded 4-cylinder engines used in several Ford cars like the small sports car Ford Puma. Since 2005 Yamaha produces a 4.4 Liter V8 for Volvo. The B8444S engines are used in the XC90 and S80 models. British sportscar maker Noble also uses a <b>bi-turbo</b> version of the Volvo V8 in their M600.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, German tuninghouse Brabus {{created a}} {{prototype}} {{version of the}} Roadster Coupé with two merged 3-cylinder engines to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Solituderennen. This V6 <b>bi-turbo</b> powerplant had a maximum power of [...] for a weight of only , giving it the same power-to-weight ratio as a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S. Smart claimed the car could accelerate to [...] in under five seconds.|$|E
2500|$|During April 2005 the Apollo {{made its}} racing {{debut in the}} Divinol Cup. This Apollo was driven by the Belgian race driver Ruben Maes. Maes {{finished}} third on the Hockenheimring race track. Three years later Gumpert announced that they would enter a hybrid electric version of the Apollo in the 2008 24 Hours Nürburgring, driven by 2004 winner Dirk Müller and former Formula One racer Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Three months passed between the first discussions and the finished hybrid Apollo. The Apollo was driven in the 24 Hours Nürburgring in May 2008. [...] The hybrid Apollo can deliver up to , powered with a 3.3 litre V8 <b>bi-turbo</b> engine coupled with a [...] electric motor. The car {{has the ability to}} recharge the battery under braking.|$|E
2500|$|Two-stage {{variable}} twin-turbos {{employ a}} small turbocharger at low speeds {{and a large}} one at higher speeds. They are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbocharger is multiplied by another, hence the name [...] "2-stage." [...] The distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable, so the transition from using the small turbocharger to the large one can be done incrementally. Twin turbochargers are primarily used in Diesel engines. For example, in Opel <b>bi-turbo</b> Diesel, only the smaller turbocharger works at low speed, providing high torque at 1,500–1,700rpm. Both turbochargers operate together in mid range, with the larger one pre-compressing the air, which the smaller one further compresses. A bypass valve regulates the exhaust flow to each turbocharger. At higher speed (2,500 to 3,000 RPM) only the larger turbocharger runs.|$|E
2500|$|The Zonda HP Barchetta was {{unveiled}} at the 2017 Pebble beach Concours d'Elegance {{as a present}} to the company's founder, Horacio Pagani for his 60th birthday {{as well as to}} commemorate the 18th anniversary of the Zonda. It has unique exterior design cues which makes it different from other Zondas produced with the most distinguishable features being the barchetta body style and rear wheel covers inspired by group C race cars, making it the first Pagani to ever use this styling. It also has a rear spoiler, air intakes and rear lights taken from the 760 series cars. Power comes courtesy of the [...] Mercedes-Benz V12 engine engine producing [...] and [...] of torque making it the most powerful road legal Zonda ever produced. It borrows its seats and suspension from the Huayra BC along with its power output being identical to the BC with the only difference being that the BC has a <b>Bi-turbo</b> engine while the HP Barchetta is naturally aspirated. The wheels of the car also have different colour inlays with the wheels at the left having gold and the wheels at the right having blue inlays. Production is limited to just 3 units. The Zonda HP Barchetta marks an end to the Zonda's production run. The 760 series cars and other special edition Zondas can still be commissioned upon customer request.|$|E
