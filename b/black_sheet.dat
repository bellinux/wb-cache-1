6000|$|The negroes of Loanda {{struck me}} as unusually ill-favoured; short, [...] "stumpy," [...] and very dark, or tinged with unclean yellow. Lepers and hideous cripples thrust their sores and stumps {{in the face of}} charity. There was no local {{colouring}} compared with the carregadores, or coolies, from the northeast, whose thrum-mop heads and single monkey skins for fig-leaves, spoke of the wold and the wild. The body-dress of both sexes is the tángá, pagne, or waist-cloth, unless the men can afford trousers and ragged shirts, and the women a [...] "veo preto," [...] or dingy <b>black</b> <b>sheet,</b> ungracefully worn, like the graceful sárí of Hindostan, over the bright foulard which confines the wool. [...] "It is mighty ridiculous to observe," [...] says the old missionary, [...] "that the women, contrary to the custom of all other nations, buy and sell, and do all things which the men ought to do, whilst their husbands stay at home and spin or weave cotton, or busy themselves in such other effeminate actions." [...] This is not wholly true in 63. The [...] "munengana,"or machila-man, is active in offering his light cane palanquin, and he chaffs the [...] "mean white" [...] who is compelled to walk, bitterly as did the sedan-chairmen of Bath before the days of Beau Nash. Of course the Quitandeira, or market-woman, holds her own. The rest of the street population seems to consist of negro [...] "infantry" [...] and black Portuguese pigs, gaunt and long- legged. The favourite passe-temps is to lie prone in sun or shade, chattering and smoking the cachimbo, a heavy clay pipe, with peculiar stem--"to sleep supine," [...] say the Arabs, [...] "is the position of saints; on the dexter side, of kings; on the sinister, of learned men; and on the belly, of devils." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a shop {{the like}} of which I {{had never seen}} before. Its windows were filled with dress-coats for men, and dresses for women. But the studs of the shirts were made of stamped cloth upon the shirt front, {{and there were no}} {{trousers}} to those coats--nothing but a sweep of cheap black cloth falling like an abbé's frock. In the doorway sat a young man reading Pollock's Course of Time, and by that I knew that he was an undertaker. His name was Gring, which is a beautiful name, and I talked to him on the mysteries of his Craft. He was an enthusiast and an artist. I told him how corpses were burnt in India. Said he: [...] "We're vastly superior. We hold--that is to say, embalm--our dead. So!" [...] Whereupon he produced the horrible weapons of his trade, and most practically showed me how you [...] "held" [...] a man back from that corruption which is his birthright. [...] "And I wish I could live a few generations just to see how my people keep. But I'm sure it's all right. Nothing can touch 'em after I've embalmed 'em." [...] Then he displayed one of those ghastly dress-suits, and when I laid a shuddering hand upon it, behold it crumpled to nothing, for the white linen was sewn on to the black cloth and--there was no back to it! That was the horror. The garment was a shell. [...] "We dress a man in that," [...] said Gring, laying it out tastily on the counter. [...] "As you see here, our caskets have a plate-glass window in front" [...] (Oh me, but that window in the coffin was fitted with plush like a brougham-window!), [...] "and you don't see anything below the level of the man's waistcoat. Consequently ..." [...] He unrolled the terrible cheap black cloth that falls down over the stark feet, and I jumped back. [...] "Of course a man can be dressed in his own clothes if he likes, but these are the regular things: and for women look at this!" [...] He took up the body of a high-necked dinner-dress in subdued lilac, slashed and puffed and bedeviled with black, but, like the dress-suit, backless, and below the waist turning to shroud. [...] "That's for an old maid. But for young girls we give white with imitation pearls round the neck. That looks very pretty through the window of the casket--you see there's a cushion for the head--with flowers banked all round." [...] Can you imagine anything more awful than to take your last rest as much of a dead fraud as ever you were a living lie--to go into the darkness one half of you shaved, trimmed and dressed for an evening party, while the other half--the half that your friends cannot see--is enwrapped in a flapping <b>black</b> <b>sheet?</b> ...|$|E

5000|$|Poison Years is a {{compilation}} album by Bob Mould, {{who had been}} the guitarist and co-vocalist of the influential American rock band Hüsker Dü. It is essentially a condensed version of Mould's first two solo albums on Virgin Records, Workbook (1989) and <b>Black</b> <b>Sheets</b> of Rain (1990), and was released in mid-1994 after Mould had achieved considerable success with his new band Sugar. It contains 6 (out of 11) studio tracks from <b>Black</b> <b>Sheets</b> and 5 (out of 11) tracks from Workbook, of which 3 are previously unreleased live versions. In addition, the album contains a studio outtake from the Workbook period, [...] "All Those People Know", a live version of another non-album track, [...] "If You're True", and a live cover version of [...] "Shoot Out The Lights" [...] from the eponymous 1982 album by Richard and Linda Thompson.|$|R
