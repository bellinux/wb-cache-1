25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The <b>barrel,</b> <b>bolt,</b> bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E
2500|$|Switching a Desert Eagle {{to another}} {{chambering}} requires {{only that the}} correct <b>barrel,</b> <b>bolt</b> assembly, and magazine be installed. Thus, a conversion to fire the other cartridges can be quickly accomplished. The rim diameter of the [...]50 AE (Action Express) {{is the same as}} the [...]44 Remington Magnum cartridge, consequently only a barrel and magazine change is required to convert a [...]44 Desert Eagle to the larger, more powerful [...]50 AE round. The most popular barrel length is 6 in (152mm), although a 10 in (254mm) barrel is available. The Mark XIX barrels are machined with integral scope mounting bases, simplifying the process of adding a pistol scope.|$|E
2500|$|The gun used metal {{stamping}} and pressing, spot welding and seam welding extensively in its construction, {{reducing the number}} of man-hours required to assemble a unit. Only the <b>barrel,</b> <b>bolt</b> and firing mechanism were precision machined. The receiver consisted of two sheet metal halves welded together to form a cylinder. At the front end was a knurled metal cap which was used to retain the removable barrel. The cold-swaged, rifled barrel had 4 right-hand grooves. [...] M3 and M3A1 submachine guns could be fitted with an optional, detachable flash hider, though none saw any service in World War II. [...] A later production flash hider designated Hider, Flash M9 was produced in time to see service during the Korean War. [...] It proved popular in combat, as frequent night engagements emphasized the need to reduce flash signatures on small arms. [...] In Korea, U.S. soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were taught to look above the flash of their weapon during night firing, a tactic that sometimes prevented the detection of crawling enemy infiltrators and sappers.|$|E
50|$|The {{modular design}} of the AW system allows for flexibility, {{serviceability}} and repairability under field and combat conditions. Major components, such as the <b>barrel</b> and the <b>bolt,</b> can be switched between rifles, or replaced in the field by their operator {{with the help of}} some tools. The chambering can also be switched by the operator as long as the <b>barrels,</b> <b>bolts</b> and feeding mechanism can handle the shape and size of the cartridges.|$|R

50|$|Earlier {{versions}} {{retained the}} German receiver ring markings, but some rifles, especially later ones, had them removed {{and a new}} serial number {{was added to the}} right side of the receiver above the stock line. The left side of the receiver retained the original markings. Barrels had a calibre designation stamp near the breech and a SCHULTZ & LARSEN OTTERUP or GEVAERFABRIKEN OTTERUP (early examples) marking applied to the <b>barrel.</b> <b>Bolts</b> were usually re-numbered to match the receiver, but old numbers remained visible on some bolt parts, trigger guards and magazine floorplates.|$|R

50|$|At first glance, the FMK-3 may be {{associated}} with the UZI. This Argentine sub-machine gun fires the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and hosts its magazine in the pistol grip, along with a fire selector and grip safety on the rear of the grip which must be squeezed in order to fire the weapon. Above the hand grip, is the upper receiver which houses the <b>barrel,</b> <b>bolt</b> and recoil spring.|$|E

50|$|The recoil booster {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the Vickers machine gun of 1912. The Vickers, like the Maxim gun from which it was developed, uses a short-recoil action. At firing, the recoil from the cartridge pushes the <b>barrel</b> and <b>bolt</b> together backwards within the gun. This movement provides the energy required to extract and eject the spent cartridge, and compresses the recoil spring to complete the cycle. The muzzle booster increased the recoil force transmitted to the barrel by directing some of the escaping gas into pushing the barrel back rather than letting it all expand outwards at the muzzle, in essence acting as an auxiliary gas-operating system, with the barrel acting {{the role of the}} operating rod. This increased the initial velocity of the <b>barrel</b> and <b>bolt,</b> providing more energy for the operation of the mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Upon firing, <b>bolt</b> and <b>barrel</b> recoil {{backwards}} a {{short distance}} while locked together. Near {{the end of the}} <b>barrel</b> travel, the <b>bolt</b> and <b>barrel</b> unlock.|$|R
5000|$|... — In March 2017, the Czech Ministry of Defence {{signed a}} {{contract}} worth CZK 75 million (USD 3 million) for 30 Hard Tactical Interdiction rifles for use by Czech special forces in international operations.

5000|$|The Uzi was {{available}} with caliber conversion kits in [...]22 LR or [...]41 AE. The operator {{just has to}} change the <b>barrel,</b> <b>bolt</b> and magazine. The [...]22 LR had 20-round magazines; the original IMI kit used a barrel insert while the aftermarket Action Arms kit used a full replacement barrel. The [...]41 AE also had a 20-round magazine; since {{it has the same}} bolt face as the 9×19mm Parabellum, only the barrel and magazine needed to be changed.|$|E
50|$|AUG Para: The Steyr AUG Para, {{also known}} as the AUG SMG or AUG 9 mm is {{chambered}} in 9×19mm Parabellum and produced since 1988. It differs from the A1 model by the: <b>barrel,</b> <b>bolt,</b> magazine and a magazine well adapter, which allows the rifle to feed from Steyr MPi 69 magazines. This variant operates as a blowback firearm, without the use of the rifle's gas system. For some time a kit of the above components was available to convert any AUG into a 9 mm variant.|$|E
50|$|The Haskins was a bolt-action, magazine-fed weapon, {{featuring}} a steel receiver with a rotating bolt. The bolt had 3 long lugs which locked {{into the receiver}} walls.
