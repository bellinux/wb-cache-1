6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} any thing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home," [...] and Rob's {{voice had a}} little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him gently down, saying, in her most capable way, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is silly, it is low, it is {{anything}} you please. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Some {{of my friends}} have been, {{and they say it}} is awfully drole. My friends go everywhere; it is only I who sit moping at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid; don't be afraid. We'll break camp again to-morrow--ah me! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> myself," [...] I added. I {{took her}} hand in farewell, but spoke again while I held it. [...] "The way you put it, about Linda, was very bad?" ...|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see her. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> her <b>to</b> come here.|$|R
60|$|Oh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hear about}} the {{exquisite}} shapes and glorious colours.|$|R
5000|$|... “It will {{be great}} to reach the final, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{concentrate}} on improving my diving skills.” ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{it seemed}} so odd to be walking about with such a man as that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back, {{and look at the}} black and yellow roses in that house, there. Would you go with me? that is, if we may. I wonder whether we may!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have just}} heard that Mr. Hanscom has been arrested. If {{this is true}} I want him bailed {{out as soon as}} possible. I don't know how these things are done, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on his bond. He should have a lawyer also. He has fallen into this trouble entirely on my account, and I cannot permit him to suffer. He must be defended." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is good," [...] she said. [...] "I shall {{expect you}} to escort me out {{sometimes}}, Cyril. Father always wants me {{to go down to}} the wharf to look at the ships or to go into the fields; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> sometimes to see the fashions, and there is no one to take me, for John Wilkes always goes off to smoke a pipe with some sailor or other, and the apprentices are stupid and have nothing to say for themselves; and besides, one can't walk alongside a boy in an apprentice cap." ...|$|E
60|$|JACK. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know what}} <b>I</b> 'm to do. [Passionately.] I won't be badgered like this.|$|R
5000|$|... {{care about}} it at all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> come to the Volga, to a {{specific}} place and a specific city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hold her}} hands while the {{drumming}} takes place. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hear her voice}} {{at the same time}} with 'Mitchell's.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He isn't {{much to look}} at," [...] said Frances, rather patronizingly. [...] "I saw {{him once}} at Campden--he came to the school when his {{daughter}} was graduated. He is bald and fat. Oh, of course, he is famous and all that! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the picnic to see Sara Beaumont. She's {{to be there with}} the Chandlers from Campden, and Mary Spearman, who knows her by sight, is going to point her out to me. I suppose it would be too much to expect to be introduced to her. I shall probably have to content myself with just looking at her." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{ought not}} to forget to say your tale fetched me (Miss Green) by its really vile probability. If we had met that man in Honolulu {{he would have done}} it, and Miss Green would have done it. Only, alas! there is no {{completed}} novel lying in the garret: would there were! It should be out to-morrow with the name to it, and relieve a kind of tightness in the money market much deplored in our immediate circle. To be sure (now I come to think of it) there are some seven chapters of The Great North Road; three, I think, of Robin Run the Hedge, given up when some nefarious person pre-empted the name; and either there--or somewhere else--likely New York--one chapter of David Balfour, and five or six of the Memoirs of Henry Shovel. That's all. But Lloyd and I have one-half of The Wrecker in type, and a good part of The Pearl Fisher (O, a great and grisly tale that!) in MS. And I have a projected, entirely planned love-story--everybody will think it dreadfully improper, I'm afraid--called Cannonmills. And I've a vague, rosy haze before me--a love-story too, but not improper--called The Rising Sun. (It's the name of the wayside inn where the story, or much of the story, runs; but it's a kind of a pun: it means the stirring up of a boy by falling in love, and how he rises in the estimation of a girl who despised him, though she liked him, and had befriended him; I really scarce see beyond their childhood yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond, and make each out-top the other by successions: it should be pretty and true if I could do it.) Also I have my big book, The South Seas, always with me, and a sair handfu'--if I may be allowed to speak Scotch to Miss Green--a sair handfu' it is likely to be. All this literary gossip I bestow upon you entre confrères, Miss Green, which is little more than fair, Miss Green.|$|E
5000|$|Folk singer Lead Belly {{performed}} the song (as [...] "Gee, <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> Home" [...] or [...] "Army Life" [...] ) on several 1940s recordings.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, yes; I've got to dine {{with these}} fellows at the Railway Hotel at eight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to you}} first, Wilmet,' said Mr. Audley, sitting down {{as if he were}} weary of his day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Margie is well-bred," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Wrapp. [...] "We'll admit she hasn't gone to extremes, {{as most of}} {{our girls}} have. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> observe to you {{that she has been}} a wall-flower for a year." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not think}} that her {{information}} was likely to be of any practical use, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make her speak again.|$|R
5000|$|Albert {{reported}} in another district at the Alban training camp, which assigned {{him to the}} 30th Battalion of Hunters. His military training did not go well, he was badly assessed and not respected, his temper finally {{got the best of}} him and he walked off the camp, whereupon he was immediately caught and arrested for desertion. His defence on these charges was that he was not a deserter and that: [...] "Bad soldiers, are sent up there, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> where we fight.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Kennedy {{was drafted}} by the New York Yankees {{in the first round}} (21st overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, earning a $2.25 million signing bonus. [...] "I would like to go out and play", he said, [...] "start my {{professional}} career. The earlier the better. I imagine it's not going to be very long before I start. At least that's what I'm hoping. If it does take a while, I'm ready for that - <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and play." [...] He consistently throws his fastball around 91-92 mph, he is known for his pitching finesse to retire hitters.|$|E
5000|$|Miller's fame {{was partly}} spawned by his 2002 Winter Olympics slalom {{performance}}. He had already won two silver medals {{and was in}} line for a third when he missed a gate. Instead of stopping, he hiked back up the course to retry the gate and finish. That performance established Miller's reputation as a competitor who cares more about the way he skis rather than winning medals. He admitted that after the race: [...] It's the Olympics, you know. If I had backed off and I came down in fifth place or sixth place, I think I would have been really disappointed. I was going for the win. If it was somewhere else, maybe I would have had the ability to hold back a little bit more. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and race my best race in front of my home crowd.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean you}} were indelicate, really, Alma, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> warn you. <b>I</b> think Mr. Beaton {{was very much}} in earnest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be an Englishman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{other points}} of view. And <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of}} a merely English attitude in studies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see it. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{copies of}} all the issues in which there have been {{articles}} upon the International Stores." ...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written in recent years about the {{changing}} material culture of textiles in late seventeenth and eighteenth-century Britain, especially the rise of cotton textiles from India {{and their impact on}} domestic supply and demand. Much less {{has been written}} about the processes by which consumers acquired these ‘exotic’ fabrics – or, indeed, other ‘more traditional’ types of cloth. We lack detailed information about even some fairly basic questions such as: who sold the newly fashionable calicoes; to what extent were they integrated within existing forms of textile retailing, and how did their supply vary across space and time, not least in response to bans and increases in excise? In this paper, I want to draw on detailed analysis of the probate inventories of provincial shopkeepers to begin answering some of these questions. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further and consider the ways in which shopkeepers sought to market these wares through the printed media. Here, I am particularly interested in the position and role of printed calicoes, etc. in the promotional strategies of retailers and the ways in which provenance was (or was not) used as a selling point. Building on this, I seek to analyse the nature of these advertisements as instruments of marketing: to what extent did they promote certain cultural values (e. g. politeness) or social-commercial imperatives, most especially fashio...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help you. You're in such {{an awful}} scrape, and if you'll only marry me it can all be set right.|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Yes. I always {{call him}} Horus, because Horus {{is the most}} {{beautiful}} of our gods. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know his real name.|$|R
60|$|Jack. Ay, very likely, if Mistress Rose {{had been}} in his stomach; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fight Spaniards just then, not to be shark-bitten.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. If Ive {{made any}} mistake I'm ready <b>to</b> apologize. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know where my}} {{daughter}} {{has been for the}} last fortnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rube laughed. 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get there}} before dusk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> start at daybreak, and I'll tell you why. You {{remember}} Pepita?' ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{could tell}} just in general that yes, it's him. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} tell other people so I {{replicated}} the pose.|$|R
6000|$|AUGUSTA. I--I can't discuss it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be just. I'm {{convinced}} that I did you a wrong--and I'm sorry. Won't you believe me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; tell us,' said Lucilla. 'I {{read all}} your evidence, so like {{yourself}} as it was, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know where you}} were sleeping.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It's very silly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell it, because I hate to {{have people}} say and think such things about us and Laurie." ...|$|R
60|$|I went in {{farther than}} was {{necessary}} for me to state my errand. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Sampson's face, to see into his eyes.|$|R
