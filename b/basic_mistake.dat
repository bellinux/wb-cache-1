Participation of Slovakian NGOs was not a matter of course in the issue of regional development. The growing NGOs participation is based upon assumption of the Strategy of Slovakian government explicitly introducing Romany Issue to the context of regional development, NGO and foreign funds. Within the issue of regional development NGOs activities are not understood as a factor of democratization, but they are conceptualized as an initiator of social and cultural change. In the theoretical view classical conceptualization of change is not sufficient. The major theoretical frameworks that are criticised within these concepts are evolutional patterns, idealistic and materialistic determinism. They classify societies and cultural diversity in the dichotomies of traditional vs. modern, underdeveloped vs. developed. The <b>basic</b> <b>mistake</b> of these dichotomies is the idea about different dynamics of constituted social systems, where someone has to live in modernity and another one has to live in his naturalness or in tradition and superstitions.

40|$|The paper {{referred}} to in the title concerns the algebraic topology at infinity of geometric realizations of Coxeter groups and of buildings. For Coxeter groups, the arguments are correct; however, for buildings, they are not. Jan Dymara and Damian Osajda pointed out to us some serious problems with Section 5, where the results for buildings are given (see [4]). In particular, Lemmas 5. 3 and 5. 7 are wrong. This leads to gaps in the proofs of Theorems 5. 8, 5. 12 and 5. 13. Nevertheless, we believe that the theorems in Section 5 remain true. (More precisely, Theorems 5. 12 and 5. 13 should hold as stated and a version of Theorem 5. 8 should be true.) The <b>basic</b> <b>mistake</b> in Section 5 is this. Suppose C is (the set of chambers of) a building and X ⊂ C is a subset which is starlike with respect to a base chamber c 0. Let c be an extreme chamber in X and put X ̌: = C −X. Implicit in both Lemmas 5. 3 and 5. 7 is the assumption that (0. 1) |X̌ | ∩ |c | = |c|I↑(X,c).

U kraćim poglavljima osvrće se na osnovne primjedbe koje se upućuju ovoj metodi: zastarjelost, teorijska neutemeljenost, jednostranost, jednodimenzionalnost, statičnost, izvankontekstualnost, ahistoričnost. Argumentirano ih opovrgava i ukazuje na osnovnu pogrešku kritičara kulturnopovijesne metode, koji u kritici polaze od kriterija drugih i različitih metodičkih pristupa. Zaključuje da su nedostaci koji joj se pripisuju zapravo njezina prednost u odnosu na druge metode. The author {{points to}} the {{theoretical}} drawbacks and lack of arguments for the criticism of cultural-historical method which she sees as the consequence of insufficient understanding and comprehension {{of the advantages of}} this method and its possible results. In the following paragraphs the author discusses the basic criticisms addressed to this method. The most common criticism is that this method is out-dated and theoretically ungrounded. The author asks how it is possible for any method to be theoretically ungrounded and uses the example of her own work to show that a clearly defined research goal and the application of the basic premises of cultural-historical method can yield reliable results. The second criticism refers to the uniformity, i. e to one-dimensional approach to cultural phenomena and this one is, according to the author, equally ungrounded, because a method, whose main aim is to establish cultural links and which analyses traditional elements both diachronically and synchronically, cannot be branded as such. The critics of the cultural-historical method are also starting from the wrong idea that this method sees culture as an unchanging and a stable category. This criticism {{is a good example of}} insufficient understanding and comprehension of the achievements of the cultural-historical methodological procedure, since ethno-cultural processes, which are the scope of interest of this method, are a very dynamic category. The criticism referring to the lack of context is related to one of the requirements of this method to single out specific cultural elements and processes from the entire cultural context. In order to apply the comparative procedure we have to atomize a certain phenomenon, since we can compare only structural segments, not whole structures. In order to establish the entire context of the historical development of a certain phenomenon and its elements, it is necessary to separate it from the present context, i. e. the context in which we have found it, with the purpose of determining its temporal and spatial contexts, or, in other words, its multi-contextuality (the context of its formation and disappearance and of all the phases in between). The most ungrounded criticism, next to the criticism on the lack of theoretical background, is the criticism on a-historicity of the cultural-historical method, since the main goal of this method is to reconstruct the history of specific cultural elements/phenomena on the basis of geographical distribution. Their horizontal distribution reveals their vertical historical development. This criticism stems from different approach to history and from the wrong perception of the concept of ethnological present, which was best explained by A. L. Kroeber and his idea on descriptive and conceptual integration. After considering the most common criticisms of the cultural-historical method, the author concluded that everything that was emphasized as its drawback turned out to be quite the opposite: its advantage. Hasty negative labeling of the method was simply the consequence of inadequate understanding of the possibilities and achievements of its application. The author lists arguments against such ungrounded criticisms of cultural-historical method and {{points to the}} <b>basic</b> <b>mistake</b> of its critics who were using the criteria of different methodological approaches for evaluating this method...|$|E
40|$|The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) {{has entered}} into an interagency {{agreement}} with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) under which Argonne National Laboratory provides technical assistance for hazardous waste site characterization and remediation for the CCC/USDA. Carbon tetrachloride is the contaminant of primary concern at sites in Kansas where former CCC/USDA grain storage facilities were located. Argonne applies its QuickSite(reg sign) Expedited Site Characterization (ESC) approach to these former facilities. The QuickSite environmental site characterization methodology is Argonne's proprietary implementation of the ESC process (ASTM 1998). Argonne has used this approach at several former CCC/USDA facilities in Kansas, including Agenda, Agra, Everest, and Frankfort. The Argonne ESC approach revolves around a multidisciplinary, team-oriented approach to problem solving. The basic features and steps of the QuickSite methodology are as follows: (1) A team of scientists with diverse expertise and strong field experience is required to make the process work. The Argonne team is composed of geologists, geochemists, geophysicists, hydrogeologists, chemists, biologists, engineers, computer scientists, health and safety personnel, and regulatory staff, as well as technical support staff. Most of the staff scientists are at the Ph. D. level; each has on average, more than 15 years of experience. The technical team works together throughout the process. In other words, the team that plans the program also implements the program {{in the field and}} writes the reports. More experienced scientists do not remain in the office while individuals with lesser degrees or experience carry out the field work. (2) The technical team reviews, evaluates, and interprets existing data for the site and the contaminants there to determine which data sets are technically valid and can be used in initially designing the field program. A <b>basic</b> <b>mistake</b> sometimes made in the site characterization process is failure to use technically sound available data to form working hypotheses on hydrogeology, contaminant distribution, etc. for initial testing. (3) After assembling and interpreting existing data for the site, the entire technical team visits the site to identify as a group the site characteristics that might prohibit or enhance any particular technological approach. Logistic and community constraints are also identified at this point. (4) After the field visit, the team selects a suite of technologies appropriate to the problem and completes the design of the field program. No one technique works well at all sites, and a suite of techniques is necessary to delineate site features fully. In addition, multiple technologies are employed to increase confidence in conclusions about site features. Noninvasive and minimally invasive technologies are emphasized to minimize risk to the environment, the community, and the staff. In no case is the traditional approach of installing a massive number of monitoring wells followed. A dynamic work plan that outlines the program is produced for the sponsoring and regulatory agencies. The word ''dynamic'' is emphasized because the work plan is viewed as a guide, subject to modification, for the site characterization activity, rather than a document that is absolute and unchangeable. Therefore, the health and safety plan and the quality assurance/quality control plan must be broad and encompass all possible alterations to the plan. The cooperation of the regulating agency is essential in successful implementation of this process. The sponsoring and regulatory agencies are notified if significant changes to the site-specific work plan are necessary. (5) The entire team participates in the technical field program. Several technical activities are undertaken simultaneously. These may range from different surface geophysics investigations to vegetation sampling. Data from the various activities are reduced and interpreted each day by the technical staff. Various computer programs are used to visualize and integrate the data. However, people do the data interpretation and integration, not the computers, which are just one more tool at the site. At the end of the day, the staff members meet, review results, and modify the next day's program as necessary to optimize activities that are generating overlapping or confirming site details. Data are not arbitrarily discarded [...] each finding must be explained and understood. Anomalous readings may be due to equipment malfunctions, laboratory error, or the inability of a technique to work in a given setting. The suite of selected technologies is adjusted in the field if necessary. (6) The end result of this process is the optimization of the field activity to produce a high-quality technical product that is cost and time effective...|$|E
