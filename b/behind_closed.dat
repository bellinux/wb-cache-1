In September 1980, De La Salle University withdrew from the league after an August 17 game against Colegio de San Juan Letran turned into a full-blown riot {{which led to the}} game being called off. The league ordered the game to be replayed <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors but the then-FIBA recognized basketball association, the Basketball Association of the Philippines, ordered the league to cancel the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{planning}} for The Swarm began <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors. The ride was codenamed Project LC12 {{in the early}} process of its planning and construction. On 31 January 2011, Thorpe Park submitted a planning application for their 2012 ride to the Runnymede Borough Council. The website gave further information about the new ride's theme, that of an apocalyptic battle.|$|E

5|$|The repercussions {{from the}} Rapid Wien ties {{followed}} Celtic into the 1985–86 European Cup Winners' Cup campaign. The first round saw them pitted against old foes Atlético Madrid. Mo Johnston's headed goal from a Davie Provan cross and Pat Bonner's late penalty save from Rubio secured a 11 draw away in Madrid, putting Celtic {{in a good}} position to win the tie. The second leg in Glasgow, however, was played in front of an empty stadium as punishment for the fans' behaviour the previous season in the replayed game against Rapid. In the unreal atmosphere of playing <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors, Celtic toiled and lost 21 for another early European exit.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord {{headed to}} Cambuur Leeuwarden in the {{beginning}} of November, resulting in a 0–2 win with goals by Immers and Te Vrede. The win moved Feyenoord back into fourth place in the league table. The club hosted AZ in the second week of November for a 2–2 draw. Te Vrede and Immers scored 3 minutes apart just after half time; the final score was reached after Jóhannsson successfully converted a penalty. During the international match break Feyenoord played a friendly <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors against FC Groningen, a game they won 4–1. Feyenoord closed out the month of November with a road game against RKC Waalwijk. They lost the game due to a lone 93rd-minute goal by their opponent.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors.|$|E

50|$|Part of the {{rationale}} <b>behind</b> <b>closing</b> medium wave, and using long wave to access listeners in {{hard to reach}} parts of Ireland and the UK, was that reception would be better {{in places such as}} the south of England and London areas which in the past had very poor coverage from RTÉ on medium wave.|$|R
5|$|Heskey was {{selected}} in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and {{was used as a}} makeshift option to play in England's left-wing role in the match against Sweden, but did not perform well out of his regular position. He scored against Denmark in England's 3–0 victory, which saw England reach the quarter-finals of the tournament. He featured in this match, where England were beaten 2–1 by the eventual champions Brazil. He and teammate Ashley Cole received abuse from some Slovakia supporters when England played them in a friendly in October 2002, which led to UEFA opening an investigation into the allegations. Slovakia were eventually forced to play their next home international <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors.|$|E
5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester police {{announced}} that they would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move would almost certainly {{have resulted in the}} stadium's safety certificate being revoked, effectively forcing the team to play <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors. The move was part of an ongoing dispute between the police force and Dave Whelan surrounding GB£300,000 in unpaid policing costs. The police's decision would not have affected Wigan Warriors, whose games are stewarded instead of policed. The situation was temporarily resolved on 8 March with both sides reaching an agreement that would allow Athletic to play at the ground {{until the end of the}} season. Four months later, Wigan Athletic, facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, grudgingly paid the money they owed to the police. The club successfully appealed against the payments in court and won damages from the police.|$|E

5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} this tragedy, {{workers in the}} unorganized leather {{industry}} of Topsia area held protest rallies demanding compensation for the relatives of the deceased workers, better working conditions and a probe into the fire mishap. The mayor of Kolkata convened an all-party meeting to discuss the incident and also promised to initiate a drive demolish illegal constructions in the area. The labour inspectors inspected the building and declared the factory as illegal. Even though the building was declared illegal and unsafe, a month later, the police raided the house and found that another leather factory was operating <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors in {{the ground floor of}} the building. The civic officials issued a notice to stop any work in the building. Though local residents alleged that clandestine work started in the building with the help of local MLA, Javen Khan, Khan himself blamed it rather on the police.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{match between}} Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP) and Nueva Chicago {{initially}} scheduled on March 14 was postponed to March 17.

5|$|Rapid, however, appealed, {{citing the}} alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a second appeal {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken had hit the post with an effort for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the break to score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August, Messi scored {{his first}} two goals of the 2017–18 La Liga season in a 2–0 away win over Alavés. Messi's first goal marked his 350th in the fixture, {{becoming}} the first player ever to achieve this milestone. On 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in derbi barceloní, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals. Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3–0 {{at home in the}} UEFA Champions League. On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga. Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played <b>behind</b> <b>closed</b> doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum. On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3–1 home victory over Olympiakos; he also set up Lucas Digne's goal during the same match. Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart. On 23 October, Messi finished as the runner-up behind Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year. On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 2–1 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.|$|E
