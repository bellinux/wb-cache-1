The analysis {{is based on a}} structural approach that highlights the roles of the fundamental macroeconomic determinants of saving and investment. Cross-section and panel regression techniques are used to characterize the properties of current account variation across countries and over time. Current <b>account</b> <b>balances</b> are positively correlated with government budget balances and initial stocks of net foreign assets. Among developing countries, measures of financial deepening are positively correlated while indicators of openness to international trade are negatively correlated with current <b>account</b> <b>balances.</b> Developing countries;Developed countries;Savings;current account, current <b>accounts,</b> current <b>account</b> <b>balances,</b> current <b>account</b> deficits, budget <b>balance,</b> current <b>account</b> surpluses, current account positions, external debt, current <b>account</b> <b>balance,</b> budget <b>balances,</b> capital <b>account,</b> <b>balance</b> of payments, current account deficit, current account position, current account dynamics, foreign aid, domestic saving, current account response, external liabilities, capital account transactions, current account transactions, long-term external debt, debt data, external financing, external debt data...|$|R

However, the fiscal balance has a considerably stronger impact on current account norms for emerging markets.

40|$|The paper investigates {{cyclical}} {{fluctuations in the}} current and financial (formerly capital) <b>accounts</b> of the <b>balance</b> of payments and major underlying components for nine industrial countries. The empirical model uses as explanatory variables domestic output growth, price inflation, real exchange rate fluctuations, energy price inflation, global growth, and regional growth. The evidence from the estimation of the model indicates the importance of fluctuations in output growth to the cyclicality of the current and financial <b>account</b> <b>balances.</b> The necessary and sufficient condition to sustain a large current account deficit is high domestic growth, which tends to stimulate financial inflows and provides adequate resources for financing. Other factors appear to be less important to the cyclicality of the current and financial <b>account</b> <b>balances</b> and their negative correlations.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the LYP correlation functional is not suited {{to be used for}} the calculation of electron spin resonance hyperfine structure (HFS) constants, nuclear magnetic resonance spin-spin coupling constants, magnetic, shieldings and other properties that require a <b>balanced</b> <b>account</b> of opposite- and equal-spin correlation, especially in the core region. In the case of the HFS constants of alkali atoms, LYP exaggerates opposite-spin correlation effects thus invoking too strong in-out correlation effects, an exaggerated spin-polarization pattern in the core shells of the atoms, and, consequently, too large HFS constants. Any correlation functional that provides a <b>balanced</b> <b>account</b> of opposite- and equal-spin correlation leads to improved HFS constants, which is proven by comparing results obtained with the LYP and the PW 91 correlation functional. It is suggested that specific response properties are calculated with the PW 91 rather than the LYP correlation functional. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
50|$|Zero balance account: A Zero <b>balance</b> <b>account</b> can {{be thought}} of as {{somewhat}} of a hack. Companies with large numbers of stores or locations can very often be confused if all those stores are depositing into a single bank account. Traditionally, it would be impossible to know which deposits were from which stores without seeking to view images of those deposits. To help correct this problem, banks developed a system where each store is given their own bank account, but all the money deposited into the individual store accounts are automatically moved or swept into the company's main bank account. This allows the company to look at individual statements for each store. U.S. banks are almost all converting their systems so that companies can tell which store made a particular deposit, even if these deposits are all deposited into a single <b>account.</b> Therefore, zero <b>balance</b> <b>accounting</b> is being used less frequently.|$|R
