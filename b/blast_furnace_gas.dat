50|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> (BFG) is a {{by-product}} of blast furnaces that is generated when the iron ore is reduced with coke to metallic iron. It has a very low heating value, about 93 BTU/cubic foot (3.5 MJ/m³, because it consists of about 60 percent nitrogen and 18-20% carbon dioxide, which are not flammable. The rest is mostly carbon monoxide, which has a fairly low heating value already and some (2-4%) hydrogen. It is commonly used as a fuel within the steel works, {{but it can be}} used in boilers and power plants equipped to burn it. It may be combined with natural gas or coke oven gas before combustion or a flame support with richer gas or oil is provided to sustain combustion. Particulate matter is removed {{so that it can be}} burned more cleanly. <b>Blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> is sometimes flared without generating heat or electricity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{internal}} combustion gas engines {{were developed to}} burn gasses produced from blast furnaces, {{eliminating the need for}} fuel for steam boilers and increasing efficiency.

The adsorption data, which fit the Langmuir equation well, show that the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> sludge has a high adsorption capability, up to 80 mg Pb per g dried sludge at saturation. The order of magnitude of the adsorption enthalpy, calculated from the apparent equilibrium constant, indicates that the adsorption of Pb 2 + on the sludge is of a physical nature.

Techniques exist for the recovery of metallic iron and either metallic lead or lead oxide from the sludge. The rendering of sludge into pellets, followed by their controlled heating, allows not only the extraction of these metals, but also makes use of the coke within the sludge.

500|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{operate on}} the {{principle}} of chemical reduction whereby carbon monoxide, having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does, reduces the iron to its elemental form. [...] <b>Blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> differ from bloomeries and reverberatory furnaces in that in a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace,</b> flue <b>gas</b> is in direct contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon. [...] The <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> operates as a countercurrent exchange process whereas a bloomery does not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a batch process while <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> operate continuously for long periods because they are difficult to start up and shut down.

50|$|In the 1920s {{the coal}} and steel {{industry}} in the Ruhrgebiet produced <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> and coal gas as a by-product of iron production and coking, while the steel industry as well as coking used large amounts these gasses or alternative fuels.

The Gasometer was built as a buffer: storing excess gas and releasing it again when demand exceeded production.|$|E

5000|$|Together, the Bechers {{went out}} with a large 8 x 10-inch view camera and photographed these {{buildings}} {{from a number of}} different angles, but always with a straightforward [...] "objective" [...] point of view. They shot only on overcast days, so as to avoid shadows, and early in the morning during the seasons of spring and fall. Objects included barns, water towers, coal tipples, cooling towers, grain elevators, coal bunkers, coke ovens, oil refineries, <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> <b>gas</b> tanks, storage silos, and warehouses. At each site the Bechers also created overall landscape views of the entire plant, which set the structures in their context and show how they relate to each other. They excluded any details that would detract from the central theme and instead set up comparisons of viewpoint and lighting through which the eye is led to the basic structural pattern of the images being compared. This principle, which is allied to the philosophy underlying the New Topographics movement, is most obvious in the two published series, Anonyme Skulpturen: Eine Typologie technischer Bauten and Typologien, Industrieller Bau, 1963-1975, in which the images are contrasted in groups of three. Another early project, which they pursued for nearly two decades, was published as Framework Houses (Schirmer/Mosel) in 1977, a visual catalog of types of structures, an approach that characterized much of their work.|$|R

The engine was used to drive a 12,500 scfm fan to blow air into a blast furnace, and the design requirement was to use blast furnace exhaust gas as its fuel. The engine was modified so that all compressor discharge could be removed and fed to an external burner, from which products of combustion were returned to drive the turbine.

50|$|After merger the {{adjacent}} Appleby and Frodingham works both produced pig iron, with the Frodingham works specialising in bars and sections, and the Appleby works plates and slabs. In 1937 each site had four blast furnaces each, each with two relatively modern builds, {{with a maximum}} diameter of 17 ft in three; capacities of the four modern furnaces were two at 2,300 tons, one at 2,000 tons and one at 1,650 tons per week. <b>Blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> was used at both sites to power electrical generators, and further energy recovery from the residual hot gas obtained from water tube boilers heated by the gas, or for heating in the steel works. Both works contained similar melting shops - the Appleby works had five tilting furnaces (open hearth) of 250 or 300 ton capacity. Employment over both sites was 6,500 in 1937. In {{the context of the}} wider United Steel group, rationalisation during the 1930s led the Appleby Frodingham works to be specialised in plates and heavy sections, whilst lighter section, bars, rod and wire were produced at the group's Steel, Peech and Tozer and Samuel Fox works in Yorkshire, with rails and ferroalloys at the Workington site., In 1945 the works was the largest in Britain, with a capacity of 700 million tons pa (5.5% national production), and occupied a 1700 acre site.|$|E

To derive the influence mechanism of effects of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speed within the pipeline on the dust deposition laws in the butterfly valve region, a 3 D model of the butterfly valve and its regional flow field is built with Pro/E software. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, along with standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of moving trajectories of dust particles in butterfly valve region under 3 <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speeds is conducted. Results show that the deposition mass of dust particles decreases firstly, then increases with the enlargement of valve plate opening angle under the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speed of 8 m/s, while decreases with the enlargement of valve plate opening under the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speeds of 12 m/s and 16 m/s.

Actual processes will {{be compared to the}} developed system in this project. Trial runs in laboratory scale help to establish a use of non-ideal gases and potentiality to recirculate these gases. The simulation tool will be done with Matlab’s Simulink ® and will be based on the data collected from the test campaigns. The real measurements of the experimental data and the simulated results will be compared. Simulation will consist of models for the mixing of pure gases and for the mixed real process gases like coke oven and <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gases.</b> In laboratory trials the variables are for example the composition of the gas, the operating temperature, recirculation rate, catalyst’s dimensions and composition and the characters of the iron charge.
