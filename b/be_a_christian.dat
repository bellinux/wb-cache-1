5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian.</b> Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.|$|E

25|$|After Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount (Elizabeth de Sodington Blount, née Elizabeth Anne Mould Williams) {{created the}} Universal Zetetic Society in 1893 in England {{and created a}} journal called Earth not a Globe Review, which sold for twopence, {{as well as one}} called Earth, which only lasted from 1901 to 1904. She held that the Bible was the {{unquestionable}} authority on the natural world and argued that one could not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> and believe the Earth is a globe. Well-known members included E. W. Bullinger of the Trinitarian Bible Society, Edward Haughton, senior moderator in natural science in Trinity College, Dublin and an archbishop. She repeated Rowbotham's experiments, generating some interesting counter-experiments, but interest declined after the First World War. The movement gave rise to several books that argued for a flat, stationary earth, including Terra Firma by David Wardlaw Scott.|$|E

25|$|These {{desultory}} persecutions culminated {{with the}} reign of Diocletian and Galerius {{at the end of}} the third century and the beginning of the 4th century. The Great Persecution is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the Roman gods or face immediate execution. Over 20,000 Christians are thought to have died during Diocletian's reign. One of the most prominent martyrs during the Diocletian persecution was Saint George, a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> by declaring his worship of Jesus Christ. Diocletian attempted to convert George, even offering gifts of land, money and slaves if he made a sacrifice to the Roman gods; he made many offers, but George never accepted any of them and was subsequently tortured and decapitated. Though Diocletian zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in Gaul, Spain, and Britannia were virtually unmolested.|$|E
25|$|Beves's father, {{the aged}} nobleman Guy of Hampton, is murdered {{by his mother}} and her lover, the Emperor of Germany. The guilty pair marry, and are soon {{plotting}} to kill Beves, the seven-year-old heir to Guy's earldom. When the plot fails they instead sell him to merchants, who send him off to the Levant by ship. There he finds refuge at the court of Ermin, king of Armenia. As he grows up he proves his valour in various exploits, the king's daughter Josian {{falls in love with}} him, and the king makes Beves a knight and presents him with a sword called Morgelai and a horse called Arondel. Beves repels an invasion by the Saracen king Brademond, but falls out with Josian, whom he finds too independent-minded. The two are reconciled when Josian declares she will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian.</b> Ermin, believing that Beves has deflowered his daughter, sends him to Brademond with a sealed letter in which Brademond is asked to kill him. Beves reaches Damascus, insults the Saracen gods, and presents his letter to Brademond, who immediately casts Beves into a deep pit.|$|E

500|$|Early American reviewers {{were divided}} on {{discussing}} the theological {{aspects of the}} Four Quartets. F. R. Leavis, in Scrutiny (Summer 1942), analysed the first three poems and discussed how the verse [...] "makes its explorations into the concrete realities of experience below the conceptual currency" [...] instead of their Christian themes. Muriel Bradbrook, in Theology (March 1943), did the opposite of F. R. Leavis and emphasised how Eliot captured Christian experience in general and how it relates to literature. D. W. Harding, in the Spring 1943 issue of Scrutiny, discussed the Pentecostal image but would not discuss how it would relate to Eliot's Christianity. Although he appreciated Eliot's work, Paul Goodman believed that the despair found within the poem meant that Eliot could not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> poet. John Fletcher felt that Eliot's understanding of salvation could not help the real world whereas Louis Untermeyer believed that not everyone would understand the poems.|$|E
500|$|Underoath's {{members are}} Christian and {{have stated that}} they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, [...] " [...] in a {{different}} way. We're not like your average Christian band." [...] He explains that Christianity is the [...] "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles." [...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E
500|$|Abraham Mendelssohn renounced the Jewish religion; he and {{his wife}} {{deliberately}} decided not to have Felix circumcised, in contravention of the Jewish tradition. Felix and his siblings were first brought up without religious education, and were baptised by a Reformed Church minister in 1816, at which time Felix was given the additional names Jakob Ludwig. Abraham and his wife Lea were themselves baptised in 1822, formally adopting the surname Mendelssohn Bartholdy (which they had used since 1812) for themselves and their children. The name Bartholdy was added at the suggestion of Lea's brother, Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, who had inherited a property of this name in Luisenstadt and adopted it as his own surname. In an 1829 letter to Felix, Abraham explained that adopting the Bartholdy name was meant to demonstrate a decisive break with the traditions of his father Moses: [...] "There can no more <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> Mendelssohn than there can be a Jewish Confucius". On embarking on his musical career, Felix did not entirely drop the name Mendelssohn as Abraham requested, but in deference to his father signed his letters and had his visiting cards printed using the form 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy'. In 1829, his sister Fanny wrote to him of [...] "Bartholdy this name that we all dislike".|$|E

500|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{religion}} in Scotland before the arrival of Christianity. The lack of native written sources among the Picts means that it can only be judged from parallels elsewhere, occasional surviving archaeological evidence and hostile accounts of later Christian writers. It is generally presumed to have resembled Celtic polytheism. The names of more than two hundred Celtic deities have been noted, some of which, like Lugh, The Dagda and The Morrigan, come from later Irish mythology, whilst others, like Teutatis, Taranis and Cernunnos, come from evidence from Gaul. The Celtic pagans constructed temples and shrines to venerate these gods, something they did so through votive offerings and performing sacrifices, possibly including human sacrifice. According to Greek and Roman accounts, in Gaul, Britain and Ireland, there was a priestly caste of [...] "magico-religious specialists" [...] known as the druids, although very little is definitely known about them. Irish legends about the origin of the Picts and stories from the life of St. Ninian, associate the Picts with druids. The Picts are also associated in Christian writing with [...] "demon" [...] worship, which may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> interpretation of their deities, and one story concerning St. Columba has him exorcising a demon from a well in Pictland, suggesting that the worship of well spirits was a feature of Pictish paganism. Roman mentions of the worship of the Goddess Minerva at wells, and a Pictish stone associated with a well near Dunvegan Castle on Skye, have been taken to support this case.|$|E
500|$|Byron had {{arranged}} for Allegra to be educated in the convent precisely because he, unlike his former lover Clairmont, thought favourably of the manners and attitudes of Italian women who had received convent educations. [...] He disapproved {{of what he called}} Clairmont's [...] "loose morals" [...] and [...] "Bedlam behavior" [...] and didn't want her to influence Allegra. He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy than she would in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would have a decent chance of marrying into high Italian society. He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Christian</b> and a married woman, if possible." [...] Her mother could see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent than she would with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be the best place for Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest place for her with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
