The novelty of our design is that it aims at globally addressing the QoS requirements as defined by 3 GPP specifications. For this, {{we carry out the}} following contributions: (i) a thorough review of 3 GPP specifications analyzing the QoS requirements imposed by the 3 GPP QoS architecture and their implications on the scheduling design. From this review, we identify the Packet Delay Budget as a key requirement to be fulfilled. Additionally, we identify that if the PDB cannot be fulfilled for all bearers then prioritization between bearers of different QoS classes should be triggered. (ii) The design of a channel-aware service discipline for GBR bearers that is able to fulfill not only the Guaranteed Bit Rate but also the Packet Delay <b>Budget.</b> The <b>discipline</b> incorporates a delay-dependent factor based on a sigmoid function. The benefit of this delay-dependent factor is that a parameter controls its upper bound. This facilitates the prioritization of bearers of different QoS classes compared to other service disciplines.(iii) The design of an algorithm for prioritizing GBR and non-GBR bearers from different QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs) following 3 GPP QoS rules when the PDB cannot be met for all bearers.|$|R

40|$|The fiscal {{performance}} of the States in India has been an area of concern for quite some time. The Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) recommended a three-pronged strategy to alleviate States'' fiscal distress, built around greater orientation toward market discipline, incentives for fiscal consolidation targets, and commitment to fiscal correction. We find that States have created fiscal space through raising revenues and reducing and reprioritizing expenditures. Looking ahead, expansion of fiscal space is essential to meet the States'' large infrastructure and social needs in order to alleviate bottlenecks to growth. This needs to be accomplished without undermining fiscal sustainability.

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a detailed historical {{analysis of the}} British Civil Service reforms in the period 1979 – 2007 using archive, public and legal sources. The work focuses on organisational changes and the managerialisation process that crossed three different premierships and parties in government. All these thirty years of administrative reforms involved many common profiles {{to take into account}} objectives, resources and management information, better policy-making, openness to outside thinking and people, role, structure and better capacity of the centre of government, size, structures and functions of the Civil Service. Continuities with the past and within reforms are not neglected considering the relationship between modernisation and tradition that included values, principles and embedded practices that resisted change and accompanied an incremental process of change. On the one hand, the impact of the New Public Management doctrine developed by international scholars and policymakers by the eighties is taken into account; on the other hand, the 'constitutional' characteristics of an ancient, professional and centralised bureaucratic model such as the Civil Service are not underestimated by this historical work. The analysis is historical, considering key events, reforms, personalities and debate that involved the civil service during this period, but even legally and politically grounded. It considers the historical background of the Thatcher era, when the government of the Iron Lady set up a new season of reforms for the bureaucracy of the central government based on managerial principles, <b>budget</b> <b>disciplines</b> and the need to cut waste, spending and manpower. The Thatcher period (1979 – 1990) was characterized by three phases of reform: departmental scrutinies led by Derek Rayner and the Efficiency Unit (1979 – 1983); Lasting Reforms, involving the launch of programmes such as MINIS and FMI, which aimed to improve information management and offer better value for money in government (1982 – 1987); and the Next Steps Agencies (1987 – 1990), which were the most important structural reforms of the last three decades. The Civil Service moved from being a unitary bureaucracy to being a federalized one in which managerial principles and performance measurement could be developed and implemented. By 1990, the Major government had focused more on customer service, with initiatives such as the Citizen's Charter (1991) and Competing for Quality (1994). Meanwhile, the Next Steps reform was completed and contracting-out and competition policy for public services was enforced. Traditional values, legal framework and principles continued to be reaffirmed by many governmental initiatives and papers. In 1997, when New Labour and Tony Blair arrived at Downing Street, the appetite for administrative reforms remained. Continuity with the past is highlighted as well as changes at both organisational and policy levels. The most important innovations such as Public Service Agreements, performance measurement, developing of delivery control, capability reviews, the proliferation of units to achieve more coordination and tackle social issues, the rise of special advisers and transparency in Government are investigated. Moreover, legal updates such as Ministerial Code, Civil Service Code and Special Advisers regulations are analysed. In the last chapters, crucial issues such as constitutional and legal developments, performance measurement, special advisers, ministerial responsibility and resilience of tradition are assessed. In the conclusion, the new traits of managerial bureaucracy as a result of historical facts and reform process are drawn...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares Canadian central {{government}} budget forecasting with forecasting by other industrial countries. While fiscal forecasting in Canada {{is governed by}} one of the strongest institutional frameworks, quantitative analysis suggests that budget projections of macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates have been more cautious than in other countries since the mid- 1990 s. The relatively volatile macroeconomic environment as well as institutional factors, such as Canada''s asymmetric deficit target, have likely contributed to this outcome.
