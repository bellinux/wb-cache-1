5|$|In April 2016, Kirchner's {{secretary}} and confidant Daniel Muñoz (who died early that year) was {{identified in the}} Panama Papers as owner of real-estate investment firm Gold Black Limited. Company director Sergio Todisco was investigated <b>by</b> <b>prosecutors</b> who suspected {{that the company was}} used for money laundering. At the end of the year, judge Julián Ercolini indicted Cristina Kirchner and several members of their cabinet, charging them with a criminal conspiracy that would have started when Nestor Kirchner first became president.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought <b>by</b> <b>prosecutors</b> and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified {{that they had}} heard Waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In {{an analysis of the}} transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached <b>by</b> <b>prosecutors,</b> but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E

5|$|In December, after former East German leader Erich Honecker {{was issued}} {{an arrest warrant}} <b>by</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in Berlin and charged with giving orders to fire on escapees, Snetkov refused to hand over Honecker, who was under Soviet {{protection}} at a military hospital. He opposed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, and stated in multiple early 2000s interviews with Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that his opposition to a Soviet pull-out {{was the reason for}} his dismissal from command of the WGF later that month. However, according to a contemporary Izvestia report, he was fired along with deputies after the desertions of a regimental commander and a supply unit leader on 29 November, who took two missiles, three tank shells and other armaments with them. After his dismissal, Snetkov joined the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, traditionally a pre-retirement post for elderly generals. He retired in May 1992 after the elimination of the Group of Inspectors General.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday February 24, 2007 {{at about}} 6:55a.m., Brown's Chevrolet Equinox {{was stolen from}} an on-street parking {{location}} by someone with key access and crashed into three parked vehicles before being abandoned {{a few blocks from}} the family home. Brown had driven his son to play in a basketball tournament in Jamestown, New York on Friday February 23. They returned home at approximately 10:30p.m. from the tournament. In interviews at the end of March 2007, Brown claimed that all members of his family with known key access had alibis. At the time Brown III possessed a learner's permit. Canisius College security cameras recorded parts of the accident, including the driver leaving the scene of multiple accidents. In April a second video recording with more fluid movement was revealed in contrast to the original recording of 36 frames per minute. In a news conference Brown announced that Byron Brown III took the senior Brown's car without permission and drove about the area near his house and Canisius College campus. Brown III admitted to the damage and was charged with driving without a driver's license and leaving the scenes of multiple accidents. Brown III was scheduled to appear on April 16, 2007 in Buffalo City Court on the charges. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving and leaving the scene of an accident. In 2010, his son was charged with petit larceny for leaving a store with goods that were not paid for. Byron Jr. was spared a criminal conviction when a judge granted him a delayed dismissal on shoplifting charges, as recommended <b>by</b> <b>prosecutors.</b> Buffalo City Judge David M. Manz warned him and Xavier Jemison that they have to complete a four-hour shoplifting class and stay out of trouble for the next six months. He granted each an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, meaning their petit larceny charges will be dismissed if they comply with his orders.|$|E

Moussaoui made requests for access to confidential documents {{and the right to}} call captive al-Qaeda members as witnesses, notably bin al-Shibh, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Both requests were claimed <b>by</b> <b>prosecutors</b> to be potential threats to national security.
