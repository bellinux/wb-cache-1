25|$|Then black teas are {{processed}} {{in either of}} two ways, CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) or orthodox. The CTC method produces leaves of fannings or dust grades that are commonly used in tea bags but also produces higher (<b>broken</b> <b>leaf)</b> grades such as BOP CTC and GFBOP CTC (see gradings below for more details). This method is efficient and effective for producing a better quality product from medium and lower quality leaves of consistently dark color. Orthodox processing is done either by machines or by hand. Hand processing is used for high quality teas. While the methods employed in orthodox processing differ by tea type, this style of processing results in the high quality loose tea sought by many connoisseurs. The tea leaves are allowed to completely oxidize.|$|E

Had it not been that, from the tranquil expression of their faces, he saw that this was the regular course of events, he would have thought that some accident had occurred, and that the Mexicans had, in some mysterious way, taken fire in the interior.|$|E

6000|$|The {{extensive}} Epeira family {{supply the}} mason-wasps and other spider-killers {{with the majority}} of their victims. These spiders have soft, plump, succulent bodies like pats of butter; they inhabit trees and bushes chiefly, where their geometric webs-betray their whereabouts; they are timid, comparatively innocuous, and reluctant to quit the shelter of their green bower, made of a rolled-up leaf; so that there are many reasons why they should be persecuted. They exhibit a great variety of curious forms; many are also very richly coloured; but even their brightest hues--orange, silver, scarlet--have not been given without regard to the colouring of their surroundings. Green-leafed bushes arc frequented by vividly green Epeiras, but the imitative resemblance does not quite end here. The green spider's method of escape, when the bush is roughly shaken, is to drop itself down on the earth, where it lies simulating death. In falling, it drops just as a green leaf would drop, that is, not quite so rapidly as a round, solid body like a beetle or spider. Now in the bushes there is another Epeira, in size and form like the last, but differing in colour; for instead of a vivid green, it is of a faded yellowish white--the exact hue of a dead, dried-up leaf. This spider, when it lets itself drop--for it has the same protective habit as the other--falls not so rapidly as a green freshly <b>broken</b> off <b>leaf</b> or as the green spider would fall, but with a slower motion, precisely like a leaf withered up till it has become almost light as a feather. It is not difficult to imagine how this comes about: either a thicker line, or a greater stiffness or tenacity of the viscid fluid composing the web and attached to the point the spider drops from, causes one to fall slower than the other. But how many tentative variations in the stiffness of the web material must there have been before the precise degree was attained enabling the two distinct species, differing in colour, to complete their resemblance to falling leaves--a fresh green leaf in one case and a dead, withered leaf in the other! ...|$|R

60|$|One {{of these}} beaten and broken tracks {{went from the}} space under the peacock trees outward into the wood for about twenty yards and then stopped. Beyond that point not a twig was <b>broken</b> nor a <b>leaf</b> disturbed. It had no exit, {{but he could not}} believe that it had no goal. After some further reflection, he knelt down and began to cut away grass and clay with his knife, and was {{surprised}} at the ease with which they detached themselves. In a few moments a whole section of the soil lifted like a lid; it was a round lid and presented a quaint appearance, like a flat cap with green feathers. For though the disc itself was made of wood, there was a layer of earth on it with the live grass still growing there. And the removal of the round lid revealed a round hole, black as night and seemingly bottomless. Paynter understood it instantly. It was rather near the sea for a well to be sunk, but the traveler had known wells sunk even nearer. He rose to his feet with the great knife in his hand, a frown on his face, and his doubts resolved. He no longer shrank from naming what he knew. This was not the first corpse that had been thrown down a well; here, without stone or epitaph, was the grave of Squire Vane. In a flash all the mythological follies about saints and peacocks were forgotten; he was knocked on the head, as with a stone club, by the human common sense of crime.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{two separate}} studies. A survey of small-scale chicken production (layer and broiler) in Laos {{is presented in}} Part 1 and the characterisation of local feed ingredients is presented in Part 2. Part 1 examined aspects of demographic details, breeds and sources, management systems, labour, diseases, production parameters, marketing and farmer attitude in small-scale chicken farms. For the survey of layer farms, a total of 35 farmers from Xaythany and Naxaithong districts were interviewed. All producers were over 30 years of age. Almost 75 % of interviewees were males, showing that males {{play a significant role}} in the leadership in the families. The average hen day production was found to be 0. 65 and an average of 1. 81 kg feed was required to produce a dozen eggs. It was observed that this feed conversion efficiency level was similar to those reported in some tropical countries, but poorer than the recommendation by breeding companies for modern layers (1. 58 kg feed/dozen eggs). Hens were culled after 18 months of production (around 2 years of age). During this period, a hen produced an average of 242 eggs, which was lower than the 300 or more eggs expected for modern layers under optimum conditions. Number factors are responsible for the poor layer performance under small farm conditions in Laos, with poor management being the main cause. This problem can be solved by the involvement of government and better veterinary and extension services. The average mortality was 11 %; diarrhoea and bird flu were the main causes associated with the deaths. Vaccines and drugs were regularly used by all farms. For the broiler survey, 7 broiler farms in Naxaithong district were surveyed. All farms operated under contract with a large company (Charoen Pokphand Laos Company). The annual broiler output per farm ranged from 15, 000 to 24, 000 birds. The number of production cycles per year and the type of breed provided are decided by the company. Three breeds are raised, namely Ross 308, Brown Nick and 3 -line crossbreeds. The average market age was 8. 6 weeks at an average body weight at 1. 5 kg. The FCR (feed conversion ratio) was 2. 1 kg feed/kg gain. Although all farms received good quality feed and regular monitoring from the CP Company, the feed efficiency was higher compared to breeding company standards (1. 6 kg feed/kg gain). The average mortality was 1. 4 %. Ross 308 was found to be more susceptible to the hot environment than the other two breeds. Deaths in Ross 308 were related largely to the faster growth rate. The study reported in Part 2 aimed at characterising the nutrient contents of locally available poultry feedstuffs so that dependence on imported commercial feeds can be reduced. Fifteen local feedstuffs (rice bran, <b>broken</b> rice, cassava <b>leaf</b> meal, cassava root meal, coconut meal, fish meal, green banana meal, groundnut, leucaena leaf meal, maize, sesame seed, snail meal, soybean, sweet potato tuber meal and taro meal) were collected. Each sample was analysed for proximate composition, minerals and amino acids. Of the tested ingredients, fishmeal had the highest crude protein content (54. 4 g/ 100 g), while sweet potato tuber meal had the lowest crude protein content (3. 5 g/ 100 g). The highest crude fat value (65. 0 g/ 100 g) determined for full-fat copra, followed by sesame and groundnut seeds (54. 8 and 54. 4 g/ 100 g, respectively). Roce bran had the highest fibre content (14. 7 g/ 100 g) and snail meal the highest ash content (71. 3 g/ 100 g). Snail meal had the highest calcium content (30. 0 g/ 100 g) followed by fish meal (4. 50 g/ 100 g). Snail meal was also rich in t iron, copper, manganese and zinc. Fish meal had high contents of amino acids. Whereas cassavas root meal had the lowest...|$|R
6000|$|... Â§ 31. Owing {{to these}} various influences, Sion, {{the capital of}} the district, {{presents}} {{one of the most remarkable}} scenes for the study of the particular condition of human feeling at present under consideration that I know among mountains. It consists of little more than one main street, winding round the roots of two ridges of crag, and branching, on the sides towards the rocks, into a few narrow lanes, on the other, into spaces of waste ground, of which part serve for military exercises, part are enclosed in an uncertain and vague way; a ditch half-filled up, or wall half-broken down, seeming to indicate their belonging, or having been intended to belong, to some of the unfinished houses which are springing up amidst their weeds. But it is difficult to say, in any part of the town, what is garden-ground or what is waste; still more, what is new building and what old. The houses have been for the most part built roughly of the coarse limestone of the neighboring hills, then coated with plaster, and painted, in imitation of Palladian palaces, with grey architraves and pilasters, having draperies from capital to capital. With this false decoration is curiously contrasted a great deal of graceful, honest, and original ironwork, in bulging balconies, and floreted gratings of huge windows, and branching sprays, for any and every purpose of support or guard. The plaster, with its fresco, has in most instances dropped away, leaving the houses peeled and scarred; daubed into uncertain restoration with new mortar, and in the best cases thus left; but commonly fallen also, more or less, into ruin, and either roofed over at the first story when the second has fallen, or hopelessly abandoned;--not pulled down, but left in white and ghastly shells to crumble into heaps of limestone and dust, a pauper or two still inhabiting where inhabitation is possible. The lanes wind among these ruins; the blue sky and mountain grass are seen through the windows of their rooms and over their partitions, on which old gaudy papers flaunt in rags: the weeds gather, and the dogs scratch about their foundations; yet there are no luxuriant weeds, for their ragged leaves are blanched with lime, crushed under perpetually falling fragments, and worn away by listless standing of idle feet. There is always mason's work doing, always some fresh patching and whitening; a dull smell of mortar, mixed with that of stale foulness of every kind, rises with the dust, and defiles every current of air; the corners are filled with accumulations of stones, partly broken, with crusts of cement sticking to them, and blotches of nitre oozing out of their pores. The lichenous rocks and sunburnt slopes of grass stretch themselves hither and thither among the wreck, curiously traversed by stairs and walls and half-cut paths, that disappear below starkly black arches, and cannot be followed, or rise in windings round the angles, and in unfenced slopes along the fronts, of the two masses of rock which bear, one the dark castle, the other the old church and convent of Sion; beneath, in a rudely inclosed square at the outskirts of the town, a still more ancient Lombardic church raises its grey tower, a kind of esplanade extending between it and the Episcopal palace, and laid out as a plot of grass, intersected by gravel walks; but the grass, in strange sympathy with the inhabitants, will not grow as grass, but chokes itself with a network of grey weeds, quite wonderful in its various expression of thorny discontent and savageness; the blue flower of the borage, which mingles with it in quantities, hardly interrupting its character, for the violent black spots in the centre of its blue takes away the tenderness of the flower, and it seems to have grown there in some supernatural mockery of its old renown of being good against melancholy. The rest of the herbage is chiefly composed of the dwarf mallow, the wild succory, the wall-rocket, goose-foot, and milfoil;[105] plants, nearly all of them, jagged in the <b>leaf,</b> <b>broken</b> and dimly clustered in flower, haunters of waste ground and places of outcast refuse.|$|R

The drawback of the CTC method is that it tends by its nature, and unfortunately by adulteration, to homogenize all black tea flavors.

Since, regardless of origin, CTC teas in their dry form are generically [...] "tea-like" [...] in aroma, and of similar pelletized appearance, {{it is easy to}} adulterate a more expensive CTC-type tea with inexpensive and generally mild lowland teas of the same process.
