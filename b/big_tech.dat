30|$|The {{existence}} of high-quality research {{universities in the}} region is an important attractor for these talents, especially when there are programs for tech-entrepreneurship.

30|$|According to J.S. Engel, {{director}} of the Entrepreneurship Program at the Haas School of Business (University of California, Berkeley), the main changes seen in the industry refer {{to the rise of}} accelerator programs and the role that <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> corporations are acquiring in Silicon Valley. While in 2007 there were only 2 accelerator programs in the U.S., by 2014 the number raised exponentially up to 170. The leading accelerator programs include funding, which, combined with training and access to powerful networks, suggest a positive impact on the startups but their overall impact remains to be assessed. Following J. Iglehart, one of the experts that were interviewed and president of the international division at Keiretsu Forum “incubators and accelerators help entrepreneurs to present a better business case to investors”. A clear benefit of these programs is the big increase of seed deals sealed. Traditional Tech Corporations have been involved with startups. However, <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> companies that were startups 10 – 15 [*]years ago are now changing the “rules” by engaging sooner with startups.|$|E

30|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, the New York City {{software}} startup ecosystem {{was in its}} nascent maturity level and had already acquired much of the necessary support infrastructure to evolve quickly: the metropolitan region is home to top research universities like Cornell, Columbia, New York University, and the City University of New York, which all have special programs for entrepreneurs; many (sometimes free) co-working spaces like General Assembly and WeWork (which was valued $ 17 billion in 2016) started to emerge; the public transportation system is efficient; and <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> companies established offices in the city (for instance, Google’s office in the Chelsea neighborhood).|$|E
40|$|Publishers see {{the rise}} of fake news as a chance for quality journalism to stand out, even as they worry about the {{increasing}} power of <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> platforms, and about their own commercial prospects. Going into 2017, they also see opportunities in video, chat bots and voice-activated assistants, {{according to a new}} survey of almost 150 CEOs, Editors and digital leaders from 24 different countries. The survey is part of the Reuters Institute’s media trends and predictions report for 2017. The full paper covers possible developments with fake news, the role of platforms, new business models, online video, the growing importance of messaging apps, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence and automation for journalism...|$|E
30|$|We observe this {{evolution}} {{not only}} in the number of startups and investment deals, but also in other factors, such as event frequency, support from <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> companies (like the first Cornell Tech course in Google’s office), and co-working spaces. After 2010, the ecosystem started the path toward a virtuous cycle when the older generation of successful entrepreneurs became angel investors or serial entrepreneurs. In addition, after 2012, the number of startup acquisitions per year exploded (almost one every 3 days), indicating a prosperous environment for investors and entrepreneurs. It is worth noting that, since 2011, the number of new companies did not grow as much as the number of investment deals or acquisitions. This shows a tendency of abundance in access to funding in the last years, or a saturation of talent availability, suggesting that the ecosystem has space for more startups and needs more investment to attract and retain talent.|$|E

30|$|Other changes {{include the}} way big {{corporations}} interact with startups. New <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> companies—those that were startups 10 – 15 [*]years ago—are changing the “rules”, engaging sooner with startups. Corporate Venture Capital funds (CVCs), Corporate Accelerators and acquisitions {{are the most}} popular ways of engagement. Despite the long time existence of CVCs, the current amount of funds is extraordinary, including traditionally non-tech companies such as 7 -Eleven or Walmart. Regardless the high performance of some of them—such as Intel or Google Ventures—the immaturity of others is causing a high level of skepticism from some entrepreneurs and investors. Nevertheless, it is expected that CVCs will consolidate as mature agents of the ecosystem in the near future. Accelerator programs are another mechanism corporations use to engage with startups. Yet, since most organizations are still experimenting with different ways of setting up and managing their accelerator initiatives—either running the program in-house or outsourcing its administration to a partner such as Techstars, LMarks, or Nest—we should still have to wait a couple of years to see the real effects of such initiatives.|$|E
30|$|On its surface, {{the smart}} city {{presents}} {{itself as a}} utopian dream; a technologically empowered panacea {{to many of the}} problems of modern city life. Yet, if we gaze beneath the glossy veneer and unpick its etiological roots, a different picture begins to emerge. The smart city is not a social scientific concept grounded in real concrete relations and connections. It is a commercial construct designed to sell a particular vision of capital accumulation and the necessity of digital technologies to achieve this. <b>Big</b> <b>tech</b> companies employ the smart city as a narrative device to sell their products and services (Söderström et al. 2014), which explains why it has so many incarnations (see Cocchia, 2014, for a review). Its spectacle is intended to capture the imagination of prospective clients who buy into the claims of these IT companies. Such assertions are often unrealistic and can bring with them a whole host of problems. Emerging technologies can have negative side effects that cannot always be predetermined, and even if they are tech companies may not be concerned as long as their products sell. Once established, governments may become reliant on these technologies thereby putting IT companies in extreme positions of power. It would be wise to adopt a healthy scepticism toward the smart city, considering where the concept originates from and the interests it privileges. It does nonetheless have real-world consequences, and {{it is for this reason}} that criminologists should be concerned. New technologies can create vulnerabilities that may be exploited by criminal actors.|$|E
40|$|Why is London a less {{successful}} entrepreneurial eco-system than the San Francisco Bay Area and arguably Boston? This question {{is discussed in}} the context of access to funding and, more specifically {{the quality and quantity of}} talent pools. This thesis then focuses on the role of the Product manager as a key source of talent in the growth of technology firms, it attempts to understand if the Bay Area/Silicon Valley innovation eco-system has an advantage because it tends to train and retain high quality PMs as it contains either the headquarters of the largest technology companies or the offices where key products are built. It found that the Bay Area contains significantly more PMs who have worked for the biggest, most iconic technology companies and that alumni of these firms constitute a much larger population relative to the number of PMs in firms of 500 people or less in the Bay Area than in London or Boston. The Bay Area also has significantly more Product Directors currently working for the most iconic technology companies. In branch offices there seems to be a perception (amongst junior staff) that PMs gain better experience/or career progression than their peers when based in the Bay Area, but this is disputed by more senior people (as long as the branch office has a certain scale). It is possible that informal advantages accrue to those working in large Bay Area hubs and/or that the most career focused product managers self-select by going to the Bay Area. To gather more quantitative data on this question, an exercise was undertaken to understand if there was a difference in the proportion of <b>big</b> <b>tech</b> product manager alumni founding startups between the three locations, and whether this was correlated with the success of startup fundraising and therefore the innovation eco-system. In the companies sampled, those based in the Bay Area had more than double the proportion of these alumni co-founders than London or Boston, but no substantive evidence was found that this gave the companies an advantage in terms of the amount of follow-on funding raised, but it did point to the possibility that these companies are more successful at raising any funding post Series A. However, more research is needed as due to the quality of data available, effective sample sizes were very small. by Richard Andrew Michael Wieder. Thesis: S.
