Until the impeachment, she was little known to the public, {{although}} she did rise to public attention when a burglar reportedly <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> car and stole documents relating to {{the handling of the}} late Vincent Foster's papers related to the Whitewater controversy, as well as the 1993 federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco.|$|E

In 1996, an Italian man who was seen in Dublin wearing a photograph of Enya around his neck, stabbed himself outside her parents' pub after being ejected from the premises. In 2005, two people <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> home; one attacked one of her maids and left with several of Enya's items. Enya raised the alarm in her safe room. The incident led Enya to spend roughly Â£250,000 on security improvements, covering gaps in the castle's outer wall and installing bollards and iron railings.|$|E

Her stalker, Alex Gray, who had sent an email to his mother stating he was planning on murdering a celebrity, spent nights in her back garden, <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> bedroom whilst she was sleeping and ultimately forced Allen to move. She has strongly criticised the Metropolitan Police for their inaction in the case, which included refusals to show Allen {{a picture of her}} stalker, lending her a panic alarm before demanding it back and refusal to believe stalking incidents were linked.|$|E

Answering {{separate}} {{reports of}} a shooting and of a kidnapping at the motel, police found Cooke's body, clad only in a sports jacket and shoes but no shirt, pants or underwear. He had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, which was later determined to have pierced his heart. The motel's manager, Bertha Franklin, said she had shot Cooke in self-defense after he <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> office residence and attacked her. Her account was immediately questioned and disputed by acquaintances.|$|E

5000|$|Warda's {{pioneering}} status can {{be attributed}} {{not only to the}} male profession that she <b>broke</b> <b>into,</b> but also <b>her</b> support for broader women's rights. This can be seen during Warda's time in Egypt by her writings on women's issues in the Egyptian magazine, [...] "Al Diya". Her support women's rights led her to unveil herself in public, inspiring the designation of a commemorative portrait of her at the National Library in Beirut. Ziade published a eulogy for Warda in [...] "Al-Muqtataf" [...] which held Warda as a model and pioneer for future Arab women.|$|R
60|$|Melville, {{finding that}} his efforts were vain, called Lindsay in. He entered with a fierce and {{determined}} air. Mary {{was reminded of}} the terrible night when he and Ruthven <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> little supper-room at Holyrood in quest of Rizzio. She was agitated and alarmed. Lindsay assailed her with denunciations and threats of the most violent character. There ensued a scene of the most rough and ferocious passion on the one side, and of anguish, terror, and despair on the other, which is said to have made this day the most wretched of all the wretched days of Mary's life. Sometimes she sat pale, motionless, and almost stupefied. At others, she was overwhelmed with sorrow and tears. She finally yielded; and, taking the pen, she signed the papers. Lindsay and Melville took them, left the castle gate, entered their boat, and were rowed away to the shore.|$|E
60|$|We had {{scarcely}} done so ere {{the first}} squall from behind struck us, and {{in five minutes}} we were running back {{as fast as we}} had come. The wind was at first south, but settled round to southeast. We got up a little more sail now, and made a shift to keep her to the west, for with this wind we should have been ashore long before morning if we had run straight before it. The sea had been heavy--it was tremendous now; and, light and seaworthy as the Jane was, we had to keep baling as the sea <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her.</b> Over and over again I thought that it was all over with us as the great waves towered above our stern, but they slipped under us as we went driving on at twelve or fourteen knots an hour. I stood up by the side of Jabez, and asked him what he thought of it.|$|E
60|$|The body {{remained}} {{where it}} had fallen until late at night. Then some attendants of the palace came and conveyed it away. They were sent, it was said, by CÃ¦sonia, {{the wife of the}} murdered man. CÃ¦sonia had an infant daughter at this time, and she remained herself with the child, in a retired apartment of the palace while these things were transpiring. Distracted with grief and terror at the tidings that she heard, she clung to her babe, and made the arrangements for the interment of the body of her husband without leaving its cradle. She imagined perhaps that {{there was no reason for}} supposing that she or the child were in any immediate danger, and accordingly she took no measures toward effecting an escape. If so, she did not understand the terrible frenzy to which the conspirators had been aroused, and for which the long series of cruelties and indignities which they had endured from her husband had prepared them. For at midnight one of them <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> apartment, stabbed the mother in her chair, and taking the innocent infant from its cradle, killed it by beating its head against the wall.|$|E

60|$|At last {{there was}} an urgent cry from Lisle and he backed his paddle. The canoe swerved, a foaming wave <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her,</b> and in another moment Nasmyth was in the water. He was dragged down by the {{swirling}} stream, and when he rose he dimly saw the canoe a few yards in front of him. He failed to reach her--she was traveling faster than he was--and, though he could swim well, he grew horribly afraid. It struck him {{that there was a}} strong probability of his being driven against a boulder with force enough to break his bones or of being drawn down and battered against the stony bottom. Still, he struck out for a line of leaping froth between him and the bank and was nearing it when Lisle grasped his shoulder and thrust him straight down-stream. Scarcely able to see amid the turmoil, confused and bewildered, he nevertheless realized that it was not desirable to attempt a landing where he had intended. Yielding to the guiding impulse, he floundered down-stream, until Lisle again seized him and drove him shoreward, and a few moments later he stood up, breathless, in a few feet of slacker water. He waded to the bank, and then turned to Lisle, who was close behind.|$|E

He paid for my education at Harvard; he lent me the money to make my first venture. He has been all the relative I ever had. Out there I pledged my word blindly to help him in his revenge upon you, Marquis, in whatever manner he might direct. To-night he sprung this upon me. I was {{face to face with}} my word of honour, and the certainty that if I refused to fulfil my pledge he would kill himself before morning. So I came.

60|$|Just then, however, {{a bitter}} rush of wind hurled the spray about them, {{and the boat}} fell off almost beam on to the sea, {{in spite of all}} that they could do. The icy brine washed into her, and it seemed almost certain that she would swamp or roll over before they could get way on her. Still, pulling desperately, they drove her round the point. Then, as gasping and {{dripping}} they made their last effort, a sea rolled up ahead, and Wyllard had a momentary glimpse of an opening not far away as she swung up with it. He shouted to his companions, but could not tell whether they heard and understood him, for after that he was only conscious of sculling savagely until another sea <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> and she struck. There was a crash, and she swung clear with the backwash, with all one side smashed in. Then she swung in again just beyond a tongue of ice over which the froth was pouring tumultuously, and the Indian jumped from the bow. He had the painter with him, and for half a minute he held her somehow, standing in the foam, while they hurled a few of the carefully made-up packages in her as far on to the ice as possible. Then, as Wyllard, who seized one sled frame, jumped, she rolled over. He landed on his hands and knees, but in another moment he was on his feet, and he and the Indian clutched at Charly, who drove towards them amidst a long wash of foam.|$|E

No, indeed! She would not have the thing done in a corner! What was the use of her being wedded, and having to consort with the tedious old wives instead of the merry wrenches? Could she not guide the house, and rule the maids, and get in the stores, and hinder waste, and make the pasties, and brew the possets? Had her father found the crust hard, or missed his roasted crab, or had any one blamed her for want of discretion? Nay, as to that, she was like to be more {{discreet}} as she was, with only her good old father to please, than with a husband to plague her." ...|$|R

Then she flew to the extreme of self-assertion. [...] "Well, I HAVE a right to him, and he has a right to me. If he's never done anything to make her think he cared for her,--and I know he hasn't; it's all been our doing, then he's free and I'm free.
