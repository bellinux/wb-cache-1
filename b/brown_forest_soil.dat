40|$|Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on the ectomycorrhizae-induced changes in surface structure and composition of soil colloids, the most active portion in soil matrix, although such data may benefit the understanding of mycorrhizal-aided soil improvements. By using ectomycorrhizae (Gomphidius viscidus) and soil colloids from dark <b>brown</b> <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> (a good loam) and saline-alkali soil (heavily degraded soil), we tried to approach the changes here. For the good loam either from the surface or deep soils, the fungus treatment induced physical absorption of covering materials on colloid surface with nonsignificant increases in soil particle size (P> 0. 05). These increased the amount of variable functional groups (O–H stretching and bending, C–H stretching, C=O stretching, etc.) by 3 – 26 % and the crystallinity of variable soil minerals (kaolinite, hydromica, and quartz) by 40 – 300 %. However, the fungus treatment of saline-alkali soil obviously differed from the dark <b>brown</b> <b>forest</b> <b>soil.</b> There were 12 – 35 % decreases in most functional groups, 15 – 55 % decreases in crystallinity of most soil minerals but general increases in their grain size, and significant increases in soil particle size (P< 0. 05).

40|$|In a {{study of}} mineral soils in floodplains, shallow depressions, and dry valley heads of the Saale-Elster plateau in eastern Germany and along the lower Eger/Ohře river in Czechia, sixteen {{earthworm}} species were found. On {{the basis of these}} findings, areas of gray-brown podzolic soils can be differentiated from chernozem areas mainly by the occurrence in the former of the two species Proctodrilus antipai and P. tuberculatus. In a section of one floodplain in the gray-brown podzolic soil area, the distribution of these two earthworm species shows a vicariance situation, such that P. antipai is restricted to the outer edges of the floodplain while P. tuberculatus inhabits the parts close to the river. In the chernozem areas, on the other hand, P. antipai {{is the only one of}} the two species to occur, and is also found in those areas close to the river. P. tuberculatus disappears in the transitional zone between a floodplain where it occurs and a chernozem floodplain. The distribution of P. antipai ends where a floodplain inhabited by it graduates into one belonging to a large river with a high rate of flow. On the stretch of the Elbe near Mlékojedy, where the position of the confluence with the Ohře has migrated over time, the vicariant distribution of the two species within the soil profile was noted. Here P. antipai is found in the uppermost soil layer, while P. tuberculatus lives in the lower-lying mineral soil at the same location. This ecological vicariance appears to represent different stages of clay translocation in flood loam. The results show that P. tuberculatus is dependent on such clay translocation or lessivage, and where this soil-profile-influencing process cannot take place the species does not occur.
