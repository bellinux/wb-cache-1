6000|$|I {{saw it all}} plainly enough now. They {{had eyes}} in their heads and all their wits about them in that craft. We had passed them in the dark as they jogged on easily towards their ambush {{with the idea that}} we were yet far behind. At daylight, however, {{sighting}} a <b>balancelle</b> ahead under a press of canvas, they had made sail in chase. But if that was so, then-- ...|$|E
60|$|We {{slipped out}} to sea quietly at dusk, and all through the night {{everything}} went well. The breeze was gusty; a southerly blow was making up. It was fair wind for our course. Now and then Dominic slowly and rhythmically struck his hands together a few times, as if applauding {{the performance of the}} Tremolino. The <b>balancelle</b> hummed and quivered as she flew along, dancing lightly under our feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prenez la barre, monsieur," [...] Dominic {{broke the}} silence {{suddenly}} in an austere voice. [...] "Take hold of the tiller." [...] He bent his hood to my ear. [...] "The <b>balancelle</b> is yours. Your own hands must deal the blow. I--I have yet another piece of work to do." [...] He spoke up loudly {{to the man who}} steered. [...] "Let the signorino take the tiller, and you with the others stand by to haul the boat alongside quickly at the word." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{who was my}} cradle {{in those}} years had been built on the River of Savona by a famous builder of boats, was rigged in Corsica by another good man, and was {{described}} on her papers as a 'tartane' of sixty tons. In reality, she was a true <b>balancelle,</b> with two short masts raking forward and two curved yards, each as long as her hull; a true child of the Latin lake, with a spread of two enormous sails resembling the pointed wings on a sea-bird's slender body, and herself, like a bird indeed, skimming rather than sailing the seas.|$|E
6000|$|I {{never tried}} to conceal {{the origins of the}} subject matter of this book which I have hesitated so long to write; but some reviewers indulged {{themselves}} with a sense of triumph in discovering in it my Dominic of [...] "The Mirror of the Sea" [...] under his own name (a truly wonderful discovery) and in recognizing the <b>balancelle</b> Tremolino in the unnamed little craft in which Mr. George plied his fantastic trade and sought to allay the pain of his incurable wound. I am not in the least disconcerted by this display of perspicacity. It is the same man and the same <b>balancelle.</b> But for the purposes of a book like [...] "The Mirror of the Sea" [...] all I could make use of was the personal history of the little Tremolino. The present work is not in any sense an attempt to develop a subject lightly touched upon in former years and in connection with quite another kind of love. What the story of the Tremolino in its anecdotic character has in common with the story of [...] "The Arrow of Gold" [...] is the quality of initiation (through an ordeal which required some resolution to face) into the life of passion. In the few pages at the end of [...] "The Mirror of the Sea" [...] and in the whole volume of [...] "The Arrow of Gold," [...] that and no other is the subject offered to the public. The pages and the book form together a complete record; and the only assurance I can give my readers is, that as it stands here with all its imperfections it is given to them complete.|$|E
60|$|Late {{that night}} I {{went in search}} of Dominic. That Mediterranean sailor was just the man I wanted. He had a great {{experience}} of all unlawful things that can be done on the seas and he brought to the practice of them much wisdom and audacity. That I didn’t know where he lived was nothing since I knew where he loved. The proprietor of a small, quiet café on the quay, a certain Madame Léonore, a woman of thirty-five with an open Roman face and intelligent black eyes, had captivated his heart years ago. In that café with our heads close together over a marble table, Dominic and I held an earnest and endless confabulation while Madame Léonore, rustling a black silk skirt, with gold earrings, with her raven hair elaborately dressed and something nonchalant in her movements, would take occasion, in passing to and fro, to rest her hand for a moment on Dominic’s shoulder. Later when the little café had emptied itself of its habitual customers, mostly people connected with the work of ships and cargoes, she came quietly to sit at our table and looking at me very hard with her black, sparkling eyes asked Dominic familiarly what had happened to his Signorino. It was her name for me. I was Dominic’s Signorino. She knew me by no other; and our connection has always been somewhat of a riddle to her. She said that I was somehow changed since she saw me last. In her rich voice she urged Dominic only to look at my eyes. I must have had some piece of luck come to me either in love or at cards, she bantered. But Dominic answered half in scorn that I was not of the sort that runs after that kind of luck. He stated generally that there were some young gentlemen very clever in inventing new ways of getting rid of their time and their money. However, if they needed a sensible man to help them he had no objection himself to lend a hand. Dominic’s general scorn for the beliefs, and activities, and abilities of upper-class people covered the Principle of Legitimacy amply; but he could not resist the opportunity to exercise his special faculties in a field he knew of old. He had been a desperate smuggler in his younger days. We settled the purchase of a fast sailing craft. Agreed that it must be a <b>balancelle</b> and something altogether out of the common. He knew of one suitable but she was in Corsica. Offered to start for Bastia by mail-boat in the morning. All the time the handsome and mature Madame Léonore sat by, smiling faintly, amused at her great man joining like this in a frolic of boys. She said the last words of that evening: “You men never grow up,” touching lightly the grey hair above his temple.|$|E
50|$|The lateen survived as a rigging {{choice for}} mainsails of small craft where local {{conditions}} were favorable. For instance, barge-like {{vessels in the}} American maritimes north of Boston, called gundalows, carried lateen rigs throughout {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. Likewise, lateen sail survived in the Baltic until the late 19th century. Because the yard pivots on its point of attachment to the mast, the entire sail and yard can be swiftly dropped. This was an advantage when navigating the tidal riverways of the region, which often required passage under bridges. The <b>balancelle,</b> a Mediterranean coasting and fishing boat of the 19th century, also used a single lateen sail.|$|E
