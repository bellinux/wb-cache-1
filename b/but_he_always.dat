5|$|On {{many of his}} forays in Kentucky, Hines made special {{trips to}} see loved ones. Often it was to visit Nancy Sproule, his {{childhood}} sweetheart and future bride, in Brown's Lock, near Bowling Green. On other occasions he visited his parents in Lexington, Kentucky. In both places, Union spies attempted to capture Hines, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> escaped, even after {{his father had been}} captured and his mother was sick in bed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> stood out in people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E

25|$|Heine {{soon became}} a celebrity in France. Paris offered him a {{cultural}} richness unavailable in the smaller cities of Germany. He made many famous acquaintances (the closest were Gérard de Nerval and Hector Berlioz) <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> remained something of an outsider. He {{had little interest in}} French literature and wrote everything in German, subsequently translating it into French {{with the help of a}} collaborator.|$|E

25|$|Spofforth's bowling {{average was}} not very low for his era, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> attacked, and he {{dismissed}} a great many batsmen. Lord Hawke, who played first-class cricket for a great many years, considered {{him to be the}} most difficult bowler he had ever played against. He was often called the best bowler in the game, and he was particularly effective bowling to W.G. Grace, the best batsman of the era.|$|E
25|$|Lustiger was a {{favorite}} of Pope John Paul II. He had a Polish background and staunchly upheld the Pope's conservative views {{in the face of}} much hostility from liberal Catholic opinion in France. This led to some speculation that Lustiger would be a candidate to succeed John Paul II, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> refused to discuss any such possibility. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{recommendation}} of General Kenney, the Far East Air Force commander, Bong received the Medal of Honor from General Douglas MacArthur in a special ceremony in December 1944. Bong's Medal of Honor citation says that he flew combat missions despite his status as an instructor, {{which was one of}} his duties as standardization officer for V Fighter Command. His rank of major would have qualified him for a squadron command, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> flew as a flight (four-plane) or element (two-plane) leader.|$|E

25|$|In {{his role}} as the {{representative}} of Catholics in the United States, Carroll often wrote articles for publications defending the Catholic tradition against persons who promoted anti-Catholicism in the United States. He fought notions of state establishment of Protestantism as the official religion, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> treated non-Catholics with respect. He insisted that Catholics and Protestants should work together to build up the new nation. An early advocate of Christian unity, Carroll suggested that the chief obstacles to unity among Christians in the United States were the lack of clarity on the boundaries of papal primacy and the use of Latin in the liturgy.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 1861, the {{congregation}} moved permanently {{to the newly}} constructed purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, Southwark, seating 5000 people with standing room for another 1000. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the largest church edifice of its day. Spurgeon continued to preach there several times per week until his death 31 years later. He never gave altar calls {{at the conclusion of}} his sermons, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> extended the invitation that if anyone was moved to seek an interest in Christ by his preaching on a Sunday, they could meet with him at his vestry on Monday morning. Without fail, there was always someone at his door the next day.|$|E
500|$|Lemon {{suffered}} a stroke in his later years. Lemon died in 2000 in Long Beach, California, {{where he had been}} a permanent resident since his career as a player. Former teammate Bob Feller said, [...] "Bob had a good curve, a good slider, and a vicious sinker pitch. He wasn't overly fast, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> stayed ahead of the hitters and he didn't walk many batters, which is the key to success in the majors." ...|$|E

500|$|Ronalds was {{separated}} from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private. In his diary, he would refer to her as [...] "Mrs. Ronalds" [...] {{when he saw her}} in a public setting, but [...] "L. W." [...] (for [...] "Little Woman") or [...] "D. H." [...] (possibly [...] "Dear Heart") when they were alone together, often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed. Ronalds was apparently pregnant on at least two occasions and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884. Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrel when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> returned to her. She was a constant companion up to the time of Sullivan's death, but around 1889 or 1890, the sexual relationship seems to have ended. He started to refer to her in the diary as [...] "Auntie", and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there, although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified, and who were always referred to by their initials.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore and {{his wife}} both {{appeared}} in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy Midnight, her only film role. The New York Times thought the film was [...] "one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season" [...] and that Barrymore, [...] "the [...] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect". The film {{was inducted into the}} National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore {{and his wife}} appeared together in the stage farce My Dear Children, which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University's McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been. Because of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. Life magazine wrote that [...] "People flock to see , not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight. Usually he forgets his lines. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>always</b> puts on a great show." [...] When the show reached Broadway, Life wrote that [...] "Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph". Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times thought that Barrymore was [...] "still the most gifted actor in this country.... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in My Dear Children but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday." [...] Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.|$|E
