5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> some other statistic. There are also usable {{items such as}} potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|The backstory is {{explained}} progressively through the player's acquisition of audio logs and encounters with ghostly apparitions. At {{the beginning of}} the game, the player chooses a career in a branch of the Unified National Nominate, a fictional military organization. Each branch of service gives the player a set of starting bonuses composed of certain skills, though may thereafter freely develop as the player chooses. The Marine begins with <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> weaponry, the Navy officer is skilled in repairing and hacking, and the OSA agent gets a starting set of psionic powers.|$|E
5000|$|Vitality: Grants a <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> max {{health and}} {{moderate}} <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> stamina. A high vitality may slightly reduce {{the effects of}} poison and bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Truedive {{shifters}} {{receive a}} <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> their Constitution score, a <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> their Swim skill, {{and an increase}} in their swimming speed while shifting. Even when not shifting, a Truedive shifter can hold their breath for amazing amounts of time.|$|R
50|$|Wildhunt {{shifters}} {{gain the}} extraordinary ability to smell {{as well as}} a predatory animal, allowing them to track by scent, {{as well as a}} <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> Constitution. Wildhunt shifters also gain a permanent <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> their tracking ability even when not shifted, due to their residual ability to smell well at all times.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort to address some of the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> characters.|$|E
5|$|The player's clan {{affects their}} skills and powers. Although the {{attractive}} Toreadors receive bonuses for seduction and persuasion, opening additional dialog options, they are physically weak; the Nosferatu are forced to travel in the shadows or through sewers to avoid alerting humans, but receive <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> their intelligence and computer skills, which enables access to more information. The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|After the Declaration of Independence, Congress {{continued}} {{to manage the}} war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the Board of War in 1777. He advocated paying <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> Continental Army soldiers {{to encourage them to}} reenlist {{for the duration of the}} war. He called for harsh state legislation to punish Loyalists—Americans who {{continued to}} support the British crown—who Adams believed were as dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated. After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In early 1946, Jorge Pasquel and {{his four}} brothers, {{owners of the}} Mexican {{baseball}} league, siphoned campaign funds from the upcoming Mexican presidential election and used them to offer large salaries and signing <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> American baseball players. In some cases, the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues. Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers by imposing a five-year ban from Major League Baseball to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1, 1946. In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including Mickey Owen, Max Lanier, and Sal Maglie. Vern Stephens initially agreed to play in Mexico as well, but returned before Chandler's April 1 deadline. Ted Williams, Stan Musial, and Phil Rizzuto were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The Crystarium is a {{leveling}} {{and growth}} system, making a return from Final Fantasy XIII in an altered form. The system consists of constellation-style {{representations of the}} character's weapons and tamed monsters, made up of small and large crystal nodes, which can be accessed {{from the start of}} the game. There is one Crystarium system available for each monster and Paradigm role. Crystogen points gained in battle can be used to expand the Crystarium, unlocking <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> health, magic, or strength, or provide the characters with new abilities and slots for battle accessories. For the monsters, the bonuses are unlocked with items dropped by defeated enemies.|$|E
5|$|The Crystarium is a {{leveling}} system {{consisting of}} six crystals and resembles the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X. Each crystal in the Crystarium {{represents one of}} the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies. The full Crystarium is not available to the player {{at the beginning of the}} game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{owes its}} {{survival}} {{to a small}} group of enthusiasts, working with the French National Stud. A genetic study performed in 1994 revealed a genetic bottleneck in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Québec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of inbreeding, leading the Unité Nationale de Sélection et de Promotion de Race to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998. At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and Belgian horses was suggested to increase genetic diversity using morphologically and historically similar breeds. The French government distributes <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> the owners of the best stallions, a program more important to the Poitevin than to other draft breeds because of the significant possibility of extinction.|$|E

25|$|Orichalcum : is used {{primarily}} by the Solar Exalted. Orichalcum is rarely found in pure deposits; usually, it is created out of gold that has been heated by lava and sunlight reflected from mirrors of occult design. Orichalcum weapons excel at no one thing; instead of adding a large <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> speed, damage or defense, they add a small <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> all.|$|R
5|$|As in the {{original}} Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's faction, a rival playable faction, or the non-playable Eleutheroi faction, which represents the world's minor kingdoms, regional powers and rebel states. If a faction should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn-based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of {{the original}} Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' moves. A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy. Once a faction has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city {{at the same time as}} undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction), whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions.|$|E
5|$|The 2009–10 season started poorly, {{with the}} club failing to pay <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> former players, as well as £250k owed to Bristol City for the {{transfer}} of Australian international Nick Carle twelve months before. The Football League placed a transfer embargo on the Eagles in early August, which was lifted {{near the end of}} that month. However, it was only another three weeks before a second embargo was put into effect, this time due to an unpaid portion of a transfer fee owed to Ipswich Town for Alan Lee. The financial problems came to a head at the end of January when the club was placed into administration by creditor Agilo Finance, and Brendan Guilfoyle took over the running of the club. Victor Moses departed for Wigan Athletic days later, and Neil Warnock left one month later to take over at Queens Park Rangers. Paul Hart was brought in on a temporary basis to keep the Eagles up, with Dougie Freedman and John Pemberton both returning to the club they played for as assistant and coach respectively. Before administration, the Eagles appeared to be building towards a run for the play-offs, but the ten-point deduction for going into administration turned the season into a battle against relegation. Survival was only achieved on the final day, with a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, who went down to League One instead of Palace. Following the end of the season, Freedman took over as caretaker manager and the club emerged from administration owned by a consortium of wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} {{eventually}} research advanced forms {{of government that}} grant significant <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> the economy and social production. However, it becomes increasingly harder to keep morale up while progressing from an imperial government to a republic, democracy or galactic federation.|$|E

50|$|Dreamsight {{shifters}} are {{the rarest}} of all. While shifting, they gain a <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> their Wisdom {{as well as}} the ability to speak with animals in a supernatural manner. Dreamsight shifters, like Wildhunt shifters, also have a permanent <b>bonus</b> <b>to</b> their skills, {{but in the case of}} Dreamsight shifters it is an increase in their ability to communicate with animals (reflected in the skill Handle Animal).|$|R

25|$|A {{decline in}} the stock price {{following}} the release of Nova's 2008 fiscal year first quarter financials was preceded by news of a delay in payment of wages and <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> some employees. Nova explained that the delay in the monthly wages was due to change in its payment system and personnel management and accounting sections {{that had not been}} completed on time and that the summer bonus delay until October was a business necessity that required employee co-operation.|$|E
25|$|That {{question}} was answered June 19, when the owner did insure {{a new line}} of credit with the league for the upcoming season. The optimism of this news was somewhat mitigated though by other news that same day. That being that the club had failed to pay <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> six key players, and was in danger of them all becoming free agents as a result. Eventually that situation too was settled, and the players all remained with the team.|$|E
25|$|National Water Pricing Policy. In 1985 the {{government}} adopted a National Water Pricing Policy {{with the objective}} to gradually reach full operation and maintenance cost recovery for water by 1991. The policy also introduced a sewer surcharge set at just 10% of the water bill. The policy also provided for incentives (10 percent of total income) {{in the form of}} <b>bonuses</b> <b>to</b> workers in the water industry. However, tariffs were not increased as foreseen by the policy.|$|E
