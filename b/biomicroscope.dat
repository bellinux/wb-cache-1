Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy.

40|$|Contact lenses {{can affect}} the cornea {{in a variety of}} ways. Corneal {{structure}} can be altered so that its thickness changes to involve the epithelium and the stroma. As a result, the curvature may be affected, but whether it is the front or the back surface that is affected depends on the type of lens used. If thickness increases sufficiently, corneal transparency may decrease. Contact lenses can also affect cellular structure of all layers of the cornea through mechanical trauma, hypoxia, or toxicity from solutions that are used in association with lenses. More serious complications, such as inflammation and infection, can arise. All these changes can be detected by clinicians using slitlamp <b>biomicroscopes</b> and keratometers if the changes are significant enough. Since the development of computers, optical instruments have become more sophisticated and have enabled the detection of subtle changes but have also facilitated more precise measurement of these conditions along with the ability to capture images of the alterations or defects. This article describes some of the newer techniques and, specifically, the application of optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and esthesiometry. <br /...|$|R
50|$|Despite their {{relative}} ubiquity, slit lamps have several important limitations. As optical instruments, conventional slit lamp <b>biomicroscopes</b> do not natively record or document exam {{findings in the}} way that imaging devices, such as OCT, MRI or CT, do by storing images. Some modern slit lamps now have the ability to record 2D video or still digital images during an exam. Without any objective record of the exam, findings from slit lamp exams are transient and must be interpreted in real-time by a trained observer. Exam data can be lost if the examiner fails to document a finding or does not have the knowledge required to recognize a finding - a limitation that can be amplified by the variability in ophthalmic training around the world. This requirement that the operator be knowledgeable also means that slit lamp exams must be conducted by trained and experienced personnel - a feature that increases the cost and decreases the number of examiners qualified to perform them. Findings from slit lamp examinations are generally considered to be subjective and qualitative. For example, one ophthalmologist may rate a patient's anterior chamber reaction as 1+ cell with trace flare while a specialist might rate the same patient's anterior chamber reaction as 2+ cell with 2+ flare. Without any objective documentation of the examination findings from that specific visit, {{it can be difficult to}} determine in retrospect which assessment was correct. Another limitation of slit lamps is that they must be manually maneuvered during an examination. This freedom means that slit lamp exams may be conducted differently at different patient visits and in different locations around the world. And this variability may have a negative impact on standardization of terminology and exam protocols. Despite these features and limitations, slit lamp exams are still a cornerstone of the ophthalmic exam.|$|R

50|$|The erosion {{may be seen}} by an eye doctor {{using the}} {{magnification}} of a <b>biomicroscope</b> or slit lamp.

5000|$|The {{common cause}} of {{blindness}} in developing countries is VAD. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 13.8 million children to have some degree of visual loss related to VAD. Night blindness and its worsened condition, xerophthalmia, are markers of VAD, as it {{can also lead to}} impaired immune function, cancer, and birth defects. Collections of keratin in the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, are also seen. Imtiaz's sign is the earliest ocular sign of VAD. Conjunctival epithelial defects occur around lateral aspect of the limbus in subclinical stage of VAD. These conjunctival epithelial defects are not even visible on a <b>biomicroscope,</b> but they take up black stain and become readily visible after instillation of kajal (surma); this is called [...] "Imtiaz's sign".|$|E
50|$|In Marfan syndrome, {{the health}} of the eye can be {{affected}} in many ways but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the lens is shifted out of its normal position. This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye. The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch. The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the lens shifting upwards and outwards but it can shift in other directions as well. Nearsightedness and blurred vision are common, but farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated. Subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens can be detected clinically in 80% of patients by the use of a slit-lamp <b>biomicroscope.</b> If the lens subluxation is subtle then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy might be used.|$|E
50|$|OCT Biomicroscopy {{is the use}} {{of optical}} {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) in place of slit lamp biomicroscopy to examine the transparent, axial tissues of the eye. Traditionally, ophthalmic biomicroscopy has been completed with a slit lamp <b>biomicroscope</b> that uses slit beam illumination and an optical microscope to enable stereoscopic, magnified, cross-sectional views of transparent tissues in the eye, with or without the aid of an additional lens. Like slit lamp biomicroscopy, OCT does not penetrate opaque tissues well but enables detailed, cross-sectional views of transparent tissues, often with greater detail than is possible with a slit lamp. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is much better at imaging through opaque tissues since it uses high energy sound waves. Because of its limited depth of penetration, UBM's main use within ophthalmology has been to visualize anterior structures such as the angle and ciliary body. Both ultrasound and OCT biomicroscopy produce an objective image of ocular tissues from which measurements can be made. Unlike UBM, OCT biomicroscopy can image tissues with high axial resolution as far posteriorly as the choroid (Figure 1).|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Measurement ofcorneal {{thickness}} {{has potential}} benefit {{both in the}} fitting of contact lenses and in monitoring any pathology that could affect corneal thickness. Corneal thickness measurement is undertaken using an accessory to the <b>biomicroscope,</b> the optical pachometer, orby means of expensive apparatus uch as the ultrasonic pachometer. There are other complex methods, such as laser Doppler interferometry, or ultrasonic rasters of the cornea. In this study, an easier and low cost method, based on the measurement of he optical section formed of the cornea by the <b>biomicroscope</b> illumination system, is proposed.

40|$|AIMS—Slit lamp fundus {{biomicroscopy}} {{allows for}} high magnification, stereoscopic diagnosis, {{and treatment of}} macular diseases. Variable contrast, narrow field of view, and specular reflections arising from the cornea, sclera, and examining lens reduce image quality; these images are of limited clinical utility for diagnosis, treatment planning, and photodocumentation when compared with fundus camera images. Algorithms are being developed to segment fundus imagery from slit lamp biomicroscopic video image sequences {{in order to improve}} clinical utility.  METHODS—Video fundus image sequences of human volunteers were acquired with a video equipped, Nikon NS- 1 V slit lamp <b>biomicroscope.</b> Custom developed software identified specular reflections based on brightness and colour content, and extracted the illuminated fundus image based on colour image analysis and size constraints.  RESULTS—In five subjects with variable image quality, the approach allowed for automatic, robust, accurate extraction of that portion of the video image corresponding to the illuminated portion of the fundus. Non-real time analysis allowed for fundus image segmentation for each frame of the image sequence. In real time, segmentation occurs at 2  Hz, and improvements are being implemented for video rate performance.  CONCLUSIONS—Computer vision algorithms allow for real time extraction of fundus imagery from marginal quality, slit lamp fundus <b>biomicroscope</b> image sequences. ...|$|E

IOP of all patients were still over 45 mmHg with shallow anterior chamber after general and topical medical management. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation combined with goniosynechialysis were performed after vitreous aspiration in all patients.
