60|$|This is {{also the}} year in which I first begin to {{remember}} my mother with more distinctness than a mere loving, wide-browed, silent, protecting presence, whose eyes had a sort of commanding sweetness; and I also remember the great gathering of all the relations from near and far, and the gray heads of the family friends paying her the homage of respect and love in the house of her favourite brother, who, a few years later, was to take the place for me of <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} the body of my sister, after I handed it, {{resembling}} a sleeping infant, to the arms of Lucy. There {{is a sort of}} mania in some, a morbid curiosity, to gaze on the features of the dead; but, with me, it has ever been the reverse. I had been taken to the family room to contemplate and weep over the faces of <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> but this was at an age when it became me to be passive. I was now at a time of life when I might be permitted to judge for myself; and, as soon as I began to think at all on the subject, which was not for some hours, however, I resolved that the last look of love, the sweet countenance, sinking in death it is true, but still animate and beaming with the sentiments of her pure heart, should be the abiding impression of my sister's form. I have cherished it ever since, and often have I rejoiced that I did not permit any subsequent images of a corpse to supplant it. As respects <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> the images left on my mind, for years and years, was painful rather than pleasing.|$|E

All I have prayed for has been to recognise her kindred and to behold her gods.' ...|$|E

The reason I believe this is, because she was thus spared the disgrace that came upon our family several years later.|$|R

60|$|My {{father was}} a retired lawyer, who, being in ill health, went with my mother on a two years' trip to Europe. They journeyed {{from place to place}} for sixteen months, and then lost their lives in a terrible railway {{accident}} in England. The death of <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> at once was a fearful blow to me, and for a long while I could not think, and was utterly unable to judge what was taking place around me. At the end of three months I was informed that Mr. Stillwell had been appointed my guardian, and then I was taken from school and placed in his office in New York City.|$|E
6000|$|The two clergymen led us {{into the}} vestry. The church {{was in one of}} the dreary {{quarters}} of London, situated between the City and the West End; the day was dull; the atmosphere was heavy and damp. We were a melancholy little wedding party, worthy of the dreary neighborhood and the dull day. No relatives or friends of my husband's were present; his family, as I have already hinted, disapproved of his marriage. Except my uncle and my aunt, no other relations appeared on my side. I had lost <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> and I had but few friends. My dear father's faithful old clerk, Benjamin, attended the wedding to [...] "give me away," [...] as the phrase is. He had known me from a child, and, in my forlorn position, he was as good as a father to me.|$|E
60|$|On {{the road}} between Succotash Hill and South Asphyxia {{is a little}} open field which once {{contained}} a shanty known as Pete Gilstrap's Place, where that gentleman used to murder travelers for a living. The death of Mr. Gilstrap and the diversion of nearly all the travel to another road occurred so nearly {{at the same time}} that no one has ever been able to say which was cause and which effect. Anyhow, the field was now a desolation and the Place had long been burned. It was while going afoot to South Asphyxia, the home of my childhood, that I found <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> on their way to the Hill. They had hitched their team and were eating luncheon under an oak tree in the center of the field. The sight of the luncheon called up painful memories of my school days and roused the sleeping lion in my breast. Approaching the guilty couple, who at once recognized me, I ventured to suggest that I share their hospitality.|$|E
40|$|I {{was born}} in Superior, Wisconsin on September 27, 1932 as the second child of Scott and Lucille Williamson. <b>Both</b> of <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> had been high school {{teachers}} but my father left teaching when he married my mother and joined my grandfather, Oliver E.

My father was a successful small businessman and active participant {{in the life of}} the community, culminating with nine years of service as President of the Superior City Council. My mother had been the principal of the small high school in Minnesota where <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> met.

James 1 : 2 - 3, NIV As a child I often marveled at the beauty and luster of my father's high school class ring.

60|$|We {{passed the}} night at Lilacsbush, and {{remained}} {{an hour or two}} after breakfast, next morning. I had carried a warm invitation from <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> to Herman Mordaunt, to ride over, with the young ladies, and taste the fish of the Sound; and the visit was returned {{in the course of the}} month of September. My mother received Anneke as a relation; though I believe that both Herman Mordaunt and his daughter were surprised to learn that they came within even the wide embrace of Dutch kindred. They did not seem displeased, however, for the family name of my mother was good, and no one need have been ashamed of affinity to her, on her own account. Our guests did not remain the night, but they left us in a sort of a chaise that Herman Mordaunt kept for country use, about an hour before sunset. I mounted my horse, and rode five miles with the party, on its way back, and then took my leave of Anneke, as it turned out, for many, many weary months.|$|E
60|$|No one had {{a better}} mother than myself. Thoroughly a lady in all that {{pertains}} to the character, she was also an humble and pious Christian. Nevertheless, humility and piety are, in some respects, particularly the first, matters of convention. The fitness of things had great merit {{in the eyes of}} <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> and I cannot say that it is entirely without it in mine. In nothing is this fitness of things more appropriate than in equalizing marriages; and few things {{are less likely to be}} overlooked by a discreet parent, than to have all proper care that the child connects itself prudently; and that, too, as much in reference to station, habits, opinions, breeding in particular, and the general way of thinking, as to fortune. Principles are inferred among people of principle, as a matter of course; but subordinate to these, worldly position is ever of great importance in the eyes of parents. My parents could not be very different from those of other people, and I could see that both now thought that Ursula Malbone, the Chainbearer's niece, one who had actually carried chain herself, for I had lightly mentioned that circumstance in one of my letters, was scarcely a suitable match for the only son of General Littlepage. Neither said much, however; though my father did put one or two questions that were somewhat to the point, ere we separated.|$|E
60|$|For my own part, my {{occupation}} in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard {{of the old}} road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots, of which I never tired. I haunted them, as my memory had often done, and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away. The grave beneath the tree, where <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> lay--on which I had looked out, when it was my father's only, with such curious feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby--the grave which Peggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden of, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the churchyard path, in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names upon the stone as I walked to and fro, startled {{by the sound of}} the church-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to me. My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do. My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother's side.|$|E

Two of my favorite childhood photos show <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> reading to me: one of my mother Lynn Stertz reading {{to me in a}} hotel room on a family trip, and the other of my dad Tom Stertz and I reading on the couch at home, his eyes wide with the drama of his storytelling and my face lit up in laughter. For their investment in my early education I am deeply grateful. <b>Both</b> of <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> had high expectations for my academic achievement and never failed to express pride in my meeting (or exceeding) those expectations or to provide assistance if I floundered (which, let’s face it, didn’t happen often).

'Your grandpapa,' {{retorted}} Mrs Wilfer, with {{an awful}} look, {{and in an}} awful tone, 'was what I describe him to have been, and would have struck any of his grandchildren to the earth who presumed to question it. It was one of mamma's cherished hopes that I should become united to a tall member of society. It {{may have been a}} weakness, but if so, it was equally the weakness, I believe, of King Frederick of Prussia.' These remarks being offered to Mr George Sampson, who had not the courage to come out for single combat, but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down, Mrs Wilfer proceeded, in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness, until she should force that skulker to give himself up. 'Mamma would appear to have had an indefinable foreboding of what afterwards happened, for she would frequently urge upon me, [...] "Not a little man. Promise me, my child, not a little man. Never, never, never, marry a little man!" [...] Papa also would remark to me (he possessed extraordinary humour), [...] "that a family of whales must not ally themselves with sprats." [...] His company was eagerly sought, as may be supposed, by the wits of the day, and our house was their continual resort. I have known as many as three copper-plate engravers exchanging the most exquisite sallies and retorts there, at one time.' (Here Mr Sampson delivered himself captive, and said, with an uneasy movement on his chair, that three was a large number, and it must have been highly entertaining.) 'Among the most prominent members of that distinguished circle, was a gentleman measuring six feet four in height. HE was NOT an engraver.' (Here Mr Sampson said, with no reason whatever, Of course not.) 'This gentleman was so obliging as to honour me with attentions which I could not fail to understand.' (Here Mr Sampson murmured that when it came to that, you could always tell.) 'I immediately announced to <b>both</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> that those attentions were misplaced, and that I could not favour his suit. They inquired was he too tall? I replied it was not the stature, but the intellect was too lofty. At our house, I said, the tone was too brilliant, the pressure was too high, to be maintained by me, a mere woman, in every-day domestic life. I well remember mamma's clasping her hands, and exclaiming [...] "This will end in a little man!"' (Here Mr Sampson glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency.) 'She afterwards {{went so far as to}} predict that it would end in a little man whose mind would be below the average, but that was in what I may denominate a paroxysm of maternal disappointment. Within a month,' said Mrs Wilfer, deepening her voice, as if she were relating a terrible ghost story, 'within a-month, I first saw R. W. my husband. Within a year, I married him. It is natural for the mind to recall these dark coincidences on the present day.' ...|$|E

Tom has no speaking voice in my narrative, but his letters are the source of every detail of the (absent) character I draw.

I am using this experience to create a body of work that speaks to what I can best describe as the Doctrine of Impermanence. The Impermanence Doctrine states that all aspects of the world are in a process of constant change. Life embodies change through the process of aging, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and in every loss that we experience. Due to the impermanent nature of all things, having attachments to them is futile and only leads to pain and suffering. Reflections in water, like the landscape, are constantly in flux and never remain the same for very long. I feel that the intangible nature of the landscape and its reflection is my honest and direct response to conveying the idea of impermanence. The series Liquid Sky represents a combination of Digital and Alternative Processes Photography. Unlike my previous projects, in this series I am working from a traditional straight photographic shooting method. The formal content of the images in this series are exactly the same as when I shot them through the camera lens. The final images consist of combining the straight photographs with emulsion transfers of the same image." ...|$|R

5000|$|When <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> call me, I {{must answer}} right away. When {{they ask me}} to do something, I must not be lazy to do. When <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> {{instruct}} me, I will listen respectfully. When <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> scold me, I must accept and obey them. I will try to ensure <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> are always warm and comfortable. In the morning I will greet <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and at night I will wish them a good night. Before going out or after returning home, I will tell <b>my</b> <b>parents.</b> I will maintain a disciplined life and strive for good results in all my studies. I must not do as I please, {{even though it may}} be just a small matter. If I do so, then I will not have been a dutiful child. I must not keep anything from <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> even though it is small. If I do so, I may hurt their feelings. I will try my best to please <b>my</b> <b>parents.</b> I will try not to do anything that offends them. If I behave badly, <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> will feel ashamed. With loving parents, {{it is not difficult to}} be dutiful to them. Even if <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> sometimes treat me badly, I must still be dutiful to them. If I feel <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> are wrong, I may advise them to change. I must do this politely. If <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> pass away, I will mourn them. I will not decorate my home and I will avoid any festivities. I will serve my parents' funerals with deepest sorrow and as if they were still alive.|$|R
