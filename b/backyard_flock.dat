40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Background: Backyard poultry flocks {{raised in}} urban {{settings}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular across the country; however, hospitalizations related to contact with poultry are reported each year. Understanding husbandry practices and general Salmonella knowledge of <b>backyard</b> <b>flock</b> owners will help highlight future educational outreach to reduce exposure related to caretaking practices. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was developed {{to better understand the}} knowledge, attitudes, and practices around Salmonella risk and prevention in backyard poultry owners living in Seattle and King County, Washington. Fifty households were recruited from June through October 2014. Selection criteria required participants to be at least 18 years old, own at least one chicken and live in Seattle/ King County. A 61 -question written survey was administered orally to the study participants. The questions focused on bird health, biosecurity practices, husbandry practices, attitudes about Salmonella risk, and general Salmonella knowledge. Participants were videotaped while caring for their birds, and this information was transcribed using notational analysis to determine if reported behaviors differed from observed practices. Results: The results from this survey indicated that while a large proportion of subjects knew that exposure to Salmonella is an inherent risk associated with raising poultry and harvesting eggs, preventive behaviors and husbandry practices of subjects did not consistently reduce risk of transmission of zoonotic disease. Approximately 1 in 4 participants reported performing behaviors that increase risk of hand to mouth contact around their birds, such as snuggling and kissing birds or eating/drinking near them. None of the participants were observed kissing their birds on video; however, holding birds or touching their face during routine care was observed in approximately two-thirds of the video recordings. Use of personal protective equipment, including gloves and masks when cleaning the coop was lower than reported when compared to the video recordings. Education and outreach targeting <b>backyard</b> <b>flock</b> owners to should aim to improve husbandry practices and awareness of how to reduce zoonotic risks associated with raising poultry in the backyard setting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although modern {{commercial}} poultry production today {{is based on}} large farms and intensive husbandry, keeping backyard poultry has regained popularity in industrialized countries. However, the health status of <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks</b> is still relatively poorly documented. A questionnaire {{was sent to the}} owners of 376 <b>backyard</b> poultry <b>flocks</b> (< 500 birds) in order to study health management procedures and characterize backyard poultry populations in Finland. Information was also collected on the postmortem findings from non-commercial flocks using necropsy data from the Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira). Results <b>Backyard</b> <b>flocks</b> in Finland are small in size (< 50 birds), comprising mainly chickens. Based on the results of the questionnaire, the health of such flocks is good, mortality low and vaccinations are not commonly used. Most of the flocks were registered in the national poultry register. The standard biosecurity practices are not generally applied and contact with wild birds, pets and farm animals is frequent, which can make the flocks more prone to infectious diseases. We conducted an 11 -year retrospective study of the postmortem necropsy findings of the Evira in order to document the diseases, which caused mortality in backyard chickens in Finland. Necropsy was performed on a total of 132 non-commercial laying hens during 2000 &# 8211; 2011. The most common postmortem findings were Marek&# 8217;s disease (27 %) and colibacillosis (17 %).

40|$|Infectious Laryngotracheitis (ILT) is {{an acute}} {{respiratory}} disease of poultry and causes significant economic losses {{due to increased}} mortality and decreased productivity. First described in 1925, ILT has been extensively studied, but {{little is known about}} the epidemiology of the disease. In the past 15 years, there have been severe ILT outbreaks in several poultry-producing states. The spread of ILT in outbreak situations is typically quite rapid, and then in an ever-widening arc around the initial case. The mechanism of this spread is not well understood, and many hypotheses are currently in existence. Several risk factors that have been identified are indicative of wind-borne transmission. A case-control study of 18 case and 122 control flocks was conducted. A GIS database of poultry operations and meteorological data from local weather stations were employed to analyze the risk of clinical ILT associated with prevailing wind patterns. Case farms were 9. 9 times more likely located within the wind vector of a clinical ILT flock during the 14 day incubation period for ILT than control flocks (p< 0. 001). House orientation and proximity to a <b>backyard</b> <b>flock</b> or a commercial flock were not significantly associated with case status. The control-to-case flock distance was significantly greater than the case-to-case flock distance (p= 0. 03). House ventilation system, wind vector, and distance from another case flock were presented to a backward eliminating logistic regression model. Only wind vector variable was retained in the model.

40|$|The highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} H 5 N 1 pandemic motivated {{countries around the}} World {{to be prepared for}} outbreaks within their borders. Well ahead of the outbreak, in Jordan contingency plans were prepared involving all relevant bodies in both the private and public sectors and a practice was simulated to test the effectiveness of the task force and the applicability of the plan. The highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 influenza virus was detected and confirmed in one turkey in a <b>backyard</b> <b>flock</b> comprising 12 turkeys and 25 chickens in Kufranjah, 6 km from Ajloun city, on 23 March 2006. The samples were confirmed by the following day. Control measures were implemented immediately according to the national contingency plan and complete clean up achieved by 27 March 2006. A 3 km area around the index case was designated as a control zone, with a 10 km area around the holding further designated as a surveillance zone. The objective was to stamp out the infection and approximately 20, 000 birds were destroyed including all commercial and backyard flocks in the control zone. All the human contacts were examined, treated and discharged from the hospital. The immediate response from all Jordanian sectors involved in the control strategy was positive as a result of increasing awareness and training programs that were implemented six months before the occurrence of the outbreak. A total estimated economic loss posed by this outbreak including compensation was almost $US 169 million. Following the outbreak, passive surveil-lance for the virus was undertaken and training and capacity building continued. Efforts made in the preparation for an outbreak paid dividends and the need for a department responsible for monitoring migratory and wild birds in Jordan was recognized.

40|$|Coccidiosis is {{a costly}} enteric disease of {{chickens}} caused by protozoan parasites {{of the genus}} Eimeria. Disease diagnosis and management is complicated since there are multiple Eimeria species infecting chickens and mixed species infections are common. Current control measures are only partially effective and this, combined with concerns over vaccine efficacy and increasing drug resistance, demonstrates a need for improved coccidiosis diagnosis and control. Before improvements can be made, {{it is important to}} understand the species commonly infecting poultry <b>flocks</b> in both <b>backyard</b> and commercial enterprises. The aim of this project was to conduct a survey and assessment of poultry Eimeria across Australia using genetic markers, and create a collection of isolates for each Eimeria species. A total of 260 samples (faecal or caecal) was obtained, and survey results showed that Eimeria taxa were present in 98 % of commercial and 81 % of <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks.</b> The distribution of each Eimeria species was widespread across Australia, with representatives of all species being found in every state and territory, and the Eimeria species predominating in commercial flocks differed from those in <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks.</b> Three operational taxonomic units also occurred frequently in commercial flocks highlighting the need to understand the impact of these uncharacterised species on poultry production. As Eimeria infections were also frequent in <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks,</b> there is a potential for <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks</b> to act as reservoirs for disease, especially as the industry moves towards free range production systems. This Eimeria collection will be an important genetic resource which is the crucial first step in the development of more sophisticated diagnostic tools and the development of new live vaccines which ultimately will provide savings to the industry in terms of more efficient coccidiosis management...|$|R

A three-part study applying both standard outbreak investigation techniques and GIS tools was implemented to determine prevalence, distribution and risk factors for ILT. A field investigation, a case-control study, and sero-prevalence survey were conducted. The case-control study used a sample of 7 case flocks and 14 control flocks from the affected integrator. Risk factors analyzed include proximity to: broiler-breeder <b>flocks,</b> <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks</b> and game bird facilities. A systematic-random sample of 168 flocks were selected for the seroprevalence study. Case flocks were 36. 00 (95 % C.

40|$|Marek’s disease (MD) is a worldwide, contagious, lymphoprolipherative {{disease of}} chicken {{caused by a}} {{lymphotropic}} and oncogenic virus, Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2, also known as Marek’s Disease Virus serotype 1 (MDV- 1). MDV- 1 can cause neoplastic (lymphomas) and non neoplastic (neurological syndromes and immunosuppression) pathological syndromes. The nervous syndrome characterized mainly by peripheral nerve lesions accompanied by spastic paralysis of legs is termed classical MD. An outbreak of classical MD in unvaccinated Cochin chickens from an Italian <b>backyard</b> <b>flock</b> is reported. After suppression two birds, showing inability to stand upright and spastic paralysis of legs, were necropsied and organs were taken for histologic examination and molecular analysis. MDV- 1 was detected from feathers and organs by PCR targeting the meq gene. Meq gene of the detected strain was fully sequenced along with commercial vaccines most commonly used in Italy. Using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor, nucleotide and amino acid sequences were edited and compared to meq sequences of selected MDV- 1 reference strains, retrieved from GenBank, having different degrees of pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences was performed using neighbor- joining clustering method. The high number of PPPP repeats found in the transactivation domain of the Meq protein and the phylogenetic tree obtained showed that the detected virus was closely related to mild or attenuated MDV- 1 strains, but different from the analyzed vaccines. The molecular results were supported by clinical, macroscopic and microscopic findings. A- and B-type lesions, highly suggestive of a mild MDV- 1 infection, were observed in enlarged peripheral nerves (brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus and sciatic, vagus and intercostal nerves). Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotype B 19, known to be correlated with high susceptibility to Marek’s disease, was identified in affected chickens by PCR and sequencing of B-L II family genes. Because sequencing of the meq gene is not a sufficient criteria to determine the pathotype, virus isolation will be attempted in order to confirm the molecular results by in vivo experimental trials...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate antimicrobial resistance profiles of Enterococcus spp. strains isolated from cloacal swabs of laying hens of small <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks.</b> Materials and methods. Susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents was tested by the disc diffusion method in 115 Enterococcus spp. strains. Vancomycin and ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations and high-level aminoglycoside resistance tests were also performed. Results. Isolates showed resistance mainly to aminoglycosides, eritromycin, fluoroquinoles, tetracycline and nitrofurantoin. 19 (16. 5 %) isolates showed a high level of resistance to streptomycin, but no high level resistance to gentamycin. No significant resistance was detected for vancomycin. Several strains (45; 39. 1 %) showed combined resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B. 61 (53 %) isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 6 (5. 2 %) strains as possibly extensively drug-resistant (XDR). E. faecium was the most prevalent antimicrobial resistant species, followed by E. faecalis and E. durans. Conclusions.

Food animal production has been transformed since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Poultry and swine production have changed from small-scale methods to industrial-scale operations. There is substantial evidence of pathogen movement between and among these industrial facilities, release to the external environment, and exposure to farm workers, which challenges the assumption that modern poultry production is more biosecure and biocon-tained as compared with backyard or small holder operations in preventing introduction and release of pathogens. An analysis of data from the Thai gov-ernment investigation in 2004 indicates that the odds of H 5 N 1 outbreaks and infections were significantly higher in large-scale commercial poultry operations as compared with <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks.</b> These data suggest that successful strate-gies to prevent or mitigate the emergence of pandemic avian influenza mus...|$|R
50|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken well - suited to small farmyard and <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the HPAI H5N1 pandemic, village poultry and their owners were {{frequently}} implicated in disease transmission. Village poultry, also known as <b>backyard</b> and hobby <b>flocks,</b> are small flocks raised under extensive conditions and often allowed free range between multiple households. However, research has shown that these flocks pose less of a threat than intensively raised commercial poultry with homogenous genetic stock and poor biosecurity. Backyard and village poultry also do not travel great distances compared to transport of intensively raised poultry and contribute less to the spread of HPAI. This initial implication of Asian poultry farmers as one broad category presented challenges to prevention recommendations as commercial strategies did not necessarily apply to <b>backyard</b> poultry <b>flocks.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{large-scale}} mass {{vaccination campaign}} {{was carried out}} in Java, Indonesia in an attempt to control outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks</b> and commercial smallholder poultry. Sero-monitoring was conducted in mass vaccination and control areas to assess the proportion of the target population with antibodies against HPAI and Newcastle disease (ND). There were four rounds of vaccination, and samples were collected after each round resulting in a total of 27 293 samples. Sampling was performed irrespective of vaccination status. In the mass vaccination areas, 20 – 45 % of poultry sampled had a positive titre to H 5 after each round of vaccination, compared to 2 – 3 % in the control group. In the HPAI + ND vaccination group, 12 – 25 % of the population had positive ND titres, compared to 5 – 13 % in the areas without ND vaccination. The level of seropositivity varied by district, age of the bird, and species (ducks vs. chickens) ...|$|R
40|$|Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} diseases in birds, causing high losses in poultry industry and food poisoning in human. For this reason, 422 apparently healthy chickens from 35 <b>backyard</b> <b>flocks</b> in different geographical regions of the rural area of Ahvaz (a city in the southwestern Iran) were sampled from January 2004 to June 2005 by cloacal swab as per OIE standards. The swabs, from each flock, were pooled in groups of up to five, then cultured and confirmed by routine biochemical and serological tests. Out of pooled 85 samples, five (5. 8 %) were positive for Salmonella. Of these, four isolates were identified as S. Serovar Typhimurium and one isolate as S. Serovar Enteritidis. The isolates belonged to 3 flocks. S. Serovar Enteritidis was sensitive in vitro to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, neomycine, nalidixic acid and sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, but the other four isolates were resistant to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. This is the first report of the isolated serotypes in backyard chickens in Iran...|$|R
50|$|ALBC's 2000 {{census of}} {{domestic}} waterfowl in North America found only 126 breeding Magpie. While seven people reported breeding Magpie, only one primary breeding flock with 50 or more breeding birds existed. There {{is a critical}} need for more conservation breeders of Magpie ducks. Their excellent laying ability, gourmet quality meat, and excellent foraging abilities make them a great addition to any small farmstead or <b>backyard</b> producer's <b>flock.</b>|$|R
