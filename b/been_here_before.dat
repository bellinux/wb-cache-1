500|$|Lawrence Brown wrote: [...] "Spielberg's {{decision}} {{to present the}} invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which {{did not exist in}} the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before,</b> long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before</b> / 'Cause I feel we {{keep going back}} and forth / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} can say I still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E

2500|$|Reverend Jesse Jackson—who, {{prior to}} Obama's {{campaign}}, had come closer {{than any other}} African American to winning a major party's presidential nomination—said that the Obama campaign {{had been on the}} verge of being derailed by racial fear stemming from Wright's comments and previous remarks by Clinton supporter Geraldine Ferraro that Obama would not have come so far had he been white. Jackson said that Obama [...] "made the case we've <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before,</b> but not this time will we linger. This time we're going to higher ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|A post-war {{success was}} the concert-party entertainment, The Co-Optimists, first staged in 1921. [...] The year 1924 {{saw the first}} West End {{production}} at the theatre of Noël Coward's The Vortex. Juno and the Paycock was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's Pillars of Society played in 1926. Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with While Parents Sleep. [...] By 1936 the danger of fire from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the Lord Chamberlain that the theatre {{had been on the}} site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. J. B. Priestley's I Have <b>Been</b> <b>Here</b> <b>Before</b> was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players.|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} album {{two out of}} four stars saying, [...] "it reaffirms his prodigious agility with rhymes. Eminem still crunches {{together}} syllables, silliness, and storytelling flights of ridiculousness with acrobatic skill" [...] and [...] "The sense that we've all <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before,</b> twice, is exacerbated by tired samples and interpolations. Eminem tries to cover up his retreat by doing cartwheels and back-flips with his rhymes". Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork gave the album a mixed review saying, [...] "Eminem is a titan with wordplay, but MMLP2 once again finds him {{at a loss for}} how to apply his talents." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C+ criticizing Eminem's use of slurs on the album, saying [...] "Eminem wouldn't be Eminem..... if he didn't allot some of his whizbang homophobic slurs and misogynistic fantasies..... rightly considered a rap great for his technical prowess, wicked humor, and tenacity..... which make his flashes of hatred for women and gay men all the more alarming." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{subsequently}} presented American TV {{cable and}} satellite network E!'s coverage of the BAFTA film awards, Live from the Red Carpet. She also presented her own three-part documentary called Jennie Bond's Royals on Channel 5 and in 2005, she presented the BBC's daytime coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show, alongside Charlie Dimmock. In the same year, Bond appeared in Have I <b>Been</b> <b>Here</b> <b>Before?</b> [...] More recently she appeared in Posh Swap on Five, where she {{was transformed into a}} Brummie woman. She had to convince two of her best friends she really was the Brummie lass. Bond was also the host for the first series of Great British Menu, in which different chefs have to compete by cooking meals; the winner of the first series had the chance to cook for the Queen on her 80th birthday. Bond has presented the BBC's Cash in the Attic. In 2006, she was a celebrity guest on Stars in Their Eyes where she sang as Debbie Harry. She presented the second series of Great British Menu during April and May 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, H.F.M. 2 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 9 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Slava Kuperstein of HipHopDX noted a marked improvement over Banks' 2006 effort Rotten Apple, stating that [...] "the execution isn’t as good {{the second time}} around, but Banks has reestablished his sound, and made clear that {{he is still a}} major {{force to be reckoned with}} in the rap game." [...] Allmusic writer Dave Jeffries, despite citing a lack of new ideas as one of the album's weaknesses, was also positive about the album: [...] "At 13 tracks the album feels right-sized, not overstuffed, and Banks himself is in fine form throughout, delivering stone cold and slow punch lines that are as lethal as ever. When it comes to evolution, there’s really none, but even though he’s <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before,</b> veteran fans will appreciate his return." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the summer}} of 2010, the stalled Israeli–Palestinian peace process was {{potentially}} revived when the various parties involved agreed to direct talks {{for the first time}} in a while. While President Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, Secretary Clinton had gone through months of cajoling just to get the parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. She then assumed a prominent role in the talks; Speaking at a September 2 meeting at the State Department between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, she acknowledged that, [...] "We've <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before,</b> and we know how difficult the road ahead will be." [...] Her role in the ongoing talks would be to take over from U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George J. Mitchell when discussions threatened to break down. The talks were generally given little chance to succeed, and Clinton faced the history of many such past failures, including the near miss of her husband at the 2000 Camp David Summit. Nevertheless, her prominent role in them thrust her further into the international spotlight and had the potential to affect her legacy as secretary.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Freak", an electro-R song that was {{originally}} recorded by American entertainer Jamie Foxx for his album Best Night of My Life (2010) It references Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller" [...] {{as well as}} including a spoken bridge towards the end. Then comes [...] "Kisses Down Low", an R and electronic track written by Marquel Middlebrooks, Timothy and Theron Thomas, Rowland, Mike Will Made It, with the latter producing the song.

2500|$|David told Arthur {{they were}} going to restore Excalibur right this second and {{revealed}} that Emma was the Dark One and that Lancelot was back. David believed that he had brought the dagger to hand over, but Mary Margaret brought it to Lancelot to hide, who then took her to the place that he and Guinevere had discovered. Mary Margaret realized that she has <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before</b> in a vision where Emma pulled her heart out, but before they can carry out their plan a deranged Arthur arrived and pulled a sword on them and demanded Mary Margaret hand over the dagger. Arthur reveals that he was planning to use the Dagger to have Emma restore Excalibur, and then, he planned to kill Merlin with Excalibur and become the most powerful king in all the realms. Arthur then uses the dagger to try to command Emma to come to him, only to realize that he was fooled by Mary Margaret, as the dagger she gave him was a fake, and David was on to this plan all along. The threesome took Arthur to Granny’s Diner, where Guinevere arrived and uncuffed him. Aware that Guinevere was still under a spell, she broke Lancelot's heart by telling him that she loved Arthur. Arthur by the way, also had a plan up his armored sleeves, as Guinevere blow a kiss out the sands on David and Mary Margaret, then tossed Lancelot in jail, where he was joined by another cellmate, Merida. With Mary Margaret and David now under Arthur's powers, they went to Regina and deceived her, with Mary Margaret saying [...] "Making Excalibur whole is our best chance to help Emma." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>before.</b> [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
