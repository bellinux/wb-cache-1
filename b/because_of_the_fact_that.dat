5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they had met him in person.|$|E
5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas {{arrived in}} the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E
5|$|When Maribor was established, some of {{the club}} {{officials}} were favouring the red and white colours, while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> many football teams in Yugoslavia wore red and white or black and white jerseys, most notably Red Star Belgrade and Partizan, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to {{follow the example of}} Fiorentina, which at the time {{was one of the most}} successful clubs in Europe, and their purple and white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain in history of the club, was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play. Eventually, they changed the secondary colour to yellow. In July 2015, white replaced yellow as the secondary colour. Today, Maribor play their home matches in purple and away matches in white kits. Since July 2011, the club's kit manufacturer is Adidas.|$|E

5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an Interstate Highway along with present-day Route 3, which itself {{was not included in the}} Interstate Highway System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards. However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the Interstate Highway System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet Interstate Highway standards. Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to Interstate Highway standards with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York's I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> New Jersey's I-495 would not be connected to New York's, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the decommissioning of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved the decommissioning of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|Sunnis are a {{majority}} in most Muslim communities in Southeast Asia, China, South Asia, Africa, most of the Arab World, and among Muslims in the United States (of which 85–90% are Sunnis).

In March 1927, P. Munuswamy Naidu of the Justice Party passed a motion recommending salary cuts for Government ministers. However, they were defeated by a margin of 41 votes. A no-confidence motion was passed on 23 August 1927, but was defeated 56 to 67 {{with the support of the}} Governor and the members nominated by him.|$|E

25|$|While {{scientists}} {{were trying to}} create a new antidepressant to inhibit the NE re-uptake they accidentally synthesised two new compounds, named talopram and talsupram. The two compounds where not marketed in spite of being potent SNRIs <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> number of suicide attempts were reported in clinical trials. With minor changes to the chemical structure of talopram (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert talopram into a potent SSRI, called citalopram. But citalopram can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{argues that}} the {{performance}} of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender {{to the performance of}} the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E

Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E

25|$|For competition, a blue judogi is worn {{by one of}} the two {{competitors}} {{for ease}} of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.|$|E
25|$|S. septentrionalis is preyed upon by {{numerous}} species. This is largely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it resides at {{an elevation of}} 300 meters above sea level, a lower elevation than most paper wasps. Specifically, army ants will regularly feed on them along with other species of paper wasps. This prevalent predation has resulted in S. septentrionalis making numerous adaptations, some of which include forming a complex nest structure, choosing a nest-site that reduces exposure to predators, and establishing defensive mechanisms. S. septentrionalis has also been known to defend against army ants by piling their bodies up against the nest entrance. However, army ant predation can be extreme enough to regulate the density of a colony and keep populations of S. septentrionalis and other species of paper wasps regulated.|$|E
25|$|Roughly a {{week after}} the nest is complete, the first larvae begin to hatch, and these will become adults {{approximately}} 30 days after hatching, marking the end of the pre-emergence phase {{and the beginning of the}} post emergence phase. It is at this point when the emergence of workers is largely dependent on the necessity to produce reproductive females that will become queens. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> S. septentrionalis is a polygynous species, more than one queen will exist at a given time, and often the number of queens will fluctuate. When queen number is small, worker number will be high and thus females will grow ovaries that are well developed so that they may reproduce as queens. When queen number is high, worker number is small, and steps will be taken to inseminate females in order to keep them from reproducing, and they will become workers.|$|E

5000|$|These {{associations}} {{succeeded in}} sending settlers to New Guinea and lobbied successfully for <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> {{a government agency}} to subsidise these initiatives (in 1938). However, most settlements ended in failure <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harsh climate and natural conditions, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> settlers, previously office workers, were not skilled in agriculture. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> settlers remained small. In the Netherlands proper, some organisations existed that promoted a kind of [...] "tropical Holland" [...] in New Guinea, but they were rather marginal. They were linked to the NSB party and other fascist organisations.|$|R
25|$|Toward <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> July, <b>the</b> NLA entered <b>the</b> Tetovo suburb <b>of</b> Drenovec, {{which was}} already emptied of army and police personnel.

25|$|Despite {{the effort}} from WWE {{to promote the}} Brock Lesnar versus Goldberg contest, some critics {{expressed}} disappointment with the match, with many in Madison Square Garden booing both competitors and only cheering for Steve Austin <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both participants were set to leave the WWE after the event with Goldberg not signing a new contract and Lesnar {{going to work in}} the NFL. Goldberg returned to WWE in 2016 and reignited his rivalry with Lesnar, after the pair had been feuding for several months through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. This would set up a rematch between the two at the 2016 Survivor Series, where Goldberg defeated Lesnar after two consecutive spears and a Jackhammer in 1 minute and 26 seconds. A final match between them occurred at WrestleMania 33 in April 2017, where Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a match for the Universal Championship to end the feud.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} sample preparation. One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} electrospray ionization (EESI). This method involves having an electrospray of solvent directed at an angle against a different spray of the sample solution, produced by a separate nebulizer. This method requires no sample preparation in that the electrospray of solvent extracts the sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which involves directing an electrospray at a surface with the sample deposited on top of it. The sample is ionized in the electrospray as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no sample preparation is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few of the negative matrix effects experienced by ESI {{due to the fact}} that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing the effect of the matrix on the ionization process.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the overall}} literacy, the sources allow us only a rough image. In total, only around 5% of all known written records of Christian Nubia {{come from the}} domains of Alodia. The thought of Ochala, that {{northern}} Nubia produced more sources mostly because of its proximity to Egypt should be rejected, not only because, as he also says, the north is way more studied than the south, but also <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Alodia housed the very heartland of the former Meroitic kingdom, a kingdom which was considerable literate. It seems plausible to suggest that like in other Medieval societies, the art of reading and writing was taught by the clerics to nobles and officials, but would the average population have had basic writing skills as well. In the case of Alodia, the latter can be attested by two types of sources: First, ostraca and other incised pottery {{as well as a}} few incised bricks predominantly coming from Soba and second, graffiti incised into former Meroitic monuments and sites. The graffiti from Meroitic sites have hitherto been largely ignored by scholars and therefore comprise only a fraction of all known written sources, but is a study in preparation now. Content-wise, all known inscriptions consist of personal names, names of saints (Often in the form of monograms) and short, predominantly religious, sentences. Except of graffiti, the Alodians also used to write books, which they did, according to the Fung Chronichle, in Greek, but commentated upon them in Nubian.|$|E

50|$|With Hawaii's {{industry}} {{heavily dependent}} on tourism and tourist spending, the state regularly raises nearly half its government revenues through <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GET.

500|$|The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in {{particular}} constantly attacked Ferraro's integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about [...] "the ethnic slur that I am {{somehow or other}} connected to organized crime. There's lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I am an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype..."

Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Weak results {{hinting that}} the clique problem {{might be hard}} to {{approximate}} have been {{known for a long}} time. [...] observed that, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the clique number takes on small integer values and is NP-hard to compute, it cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began to make connections between the approximation of maximum cliques and probabilistically checkable proofs. They used these connections to prove hardness of approximation results for the maximum clique problem.|$|E

Ambrosius also told RapUpTV that Dr. Dre's third album is no longer called Detox, but didn't reveal the new title. In a September {{interview with}} Shots Fired that same year, Aftermath Entertainment in-house producer Dawaun Parker confirmed the title change. Parker also refrained from revealing the new title <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the title hadn't been leaked online.
