You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
500|$|Rhythm & Hues created 300 {{pairs of}} animals {{for use on}} the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots. R was also {{assisted}} by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided {{a large number of}} composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements. In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months. Andy Arnett, the animation supervisor, declared that [...] "The research was extensive. It took six or seven months to perfect {{the look and feel of}} the animals <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the first shot out the door." ...|$|E

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E

500|$|Revolutions per Minute was {{released}} on April 8, 2003. Like The Unraveling, it failed to reach any major record charts, but did reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart in the United States. Critics praised the album for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore; Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone called Revolutions per Minute [...] "easily among the finest punk records of the past decade". To support the album, Rise Against traveled with other Fat Wreck Chord bands like Anti-Flag, None More Black, and No Use for a Name on North American and Japan based tours, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour in North America. When asked about the band's early years with Fat Wreck Chords, Principe said: [...] "Our goal was to be on Fat Wreck Chords and just sell enough records so that when we were home from tour, we wouldn't have to get jobs...Of course, that was all <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> families and children and numerous responsibilities. That was the beauty. And then the longer we did it things just kept coming our way." ...|$|E

At 16, she had a sexual encounter with a woman: [...] "Perhaps I was drunk, after all, {{because it was so}} beautiful when H began making love to me...It had been 4:00 <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gotten to bed...I became fully conscious that I desired her, she knew it, too".|$|E
2500|$|The late 1890s {{was a time}} of horse-drawn {{carriages}} and wagons pulled along unpaved {{streets and}} roads, so the arrival of the town streetcar was appreciated. Some of these trolley lines eventually expanded into the countryside and by 1911 grew into hundreds of miles of interurban lines networked across Indiana. [...] "When <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> moved by horse and carriage, we now rode on plush seats to places , , even [...] distant." [...] In 1930, this unprofitable network became the new Indiana Railroad interurban. The plan was to increase both passenger and freight business and improve efficiency. A brief description of these IR predecessor interurban companies follows.|$|E

The journey took two days. A few years later {{an account of the}} journey of a Scotsman through Ireland in 1619 and 1620 reflects the great difficulties which he encountered: Travelling in winter his horse constantly sank to its girths on the boggy roads, and his saddles and saddlebags were destroyed. Often he had to cross streams by swimming his horse, a dangerous procedure for, as he tells us, in five months he has foundered six horses.|$|E
2500|$|Television {{historian}} Lez Cooke described Lambert's time {{in control}} of the drama department at Thames as [...] "an adventurous period for the company, demonstrating that it was not only the BBC that was capable of producing progressive television drama during the 1970s. Lambert wanted Thames to produce drama series 'which were attempting {{in one way or another}} to tackle modern problems and life,' an ambition which echoed the philosophy of her mentor Sydney Newman." [...] Howard Schuman, the writer of Rock Follies, also later praised the bravery of Lambert's commissioning. [...] "Verity Lambert had just arrived as head of drama at Thames TV and she went for broke," [...] he told The Observer newspaper in 2002. [...] "She commissioned a serial, Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill, for safety, but also Bill Brand, one of the edgiest political dramas ever, and us... <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> even finished making the first series, Verity commissioned the second." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} 1974–75 season, with women's college {{basketball}} {{still in its}} infancy and not yet an NCAA-sanctioned sport, 22-year-old Summitt became a graduate assistant at the University of Tennessee, and was named head coach of the Lady Vols after the previous coach suddenly quit. Summitt earned $250 monthly and washed the players' uniforms – uniforms purchased the previous year with proceeds from a donut sale. Summitt recalled that era of women's basketball during a February 2009 interview with Time. [...] "I had to drive the van when I first started coaching," [...] Summitt said. [...] "One time, for a road game, we actually slept in the other team's gym the night <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> mats, we had our little sleeping bags. When I was a player at the University of Tennessee–Martin, we played at Tennessee Tech for three straight games, and we didn't wash our uniforms. We only had one set. We played because we loved the game. We didn't think anything about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1985, Slash {{was asked}} by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join the newly founded GunsN'Roses, along with Duff McKagan and Steven Adler; {{completing}} the line-up. They played nightclubssuch as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadourand opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. It was during this period that the band wrote most of its classic material, including [...] "Welcome to the Jungle," [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine,", and [...] "Paradise City," [...] As {{a result of their}} rowdy and rebellious behavior, Guns N' Roses quickly received the moniker [...] "Most Dangerous Band in the World," [...] causing Slash to remark, [...] "For some strange reason, Guns N' Roses is like the catalyst for controversy, even <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any kind of record deal." [...] After being scouted by several major record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. Later that year, they began recording their debut album, but initially nothing was accomplished as Slash had developed a drug problem.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{soon became}} notorious for causing controversy, {{such as his}} infamous quote that resurfaced in {{interviews}} and articles in the following years, that he was [...] "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience". In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, [...] "Animal Nitrate", which went into the UK top ten. The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's Brit Awards ceremony. Impressed by the band's charged sexuality, Suede's first sequence of singles and first album shocked audiences and critics alike. Suede's sexual lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, {{one of the few}} British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided. Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded nothing quite like anybody else around at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement. Anderson recalls, [...] "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and I liked to throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs. This was <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> that horrible term Britpop." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 January 2006, it was {{announced}} that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, Studio 1. The first single, [...] "Rock Steady" [...] (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Studio 1 entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. A second single, [...] "Chick Fit" [...] failed to reach the top 200. Blatt discussed the reunion's failure in an interview with i-D magazine in 2012: [...] "I don't think it was done for the right reasons... I know that I did it for the money. We got signed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> even made music again, it wasn't like we felt we had something to give back to the world... we were given an opportunity and took it, without really thinking about it too hard". She also said she never felt comfortable with the success the band had and that [...] "it was not necessarily the plan at the beginning; {{there was a lot of}} compromise involved".|$|E

2500|$|Judge left {{no record}} of the period before the {{founding}} of the Theosophical Society but some of his published statements reveal the character of his relationship with Blavatsky during this period. On the occasion of her death in 1891, he referred to their first meeting in her rooms in January 1875. He wrote:"It was her eye that attracted me, the eye of one whom I must have known in lives long passed away. She looked at me in recognition for that first hour, and never since has that look changed. Not as a questioner of philosophies did I come before her, not as one groping in the dark for lights that schools and fanciful theories had obscured, but as one who, wandering through the corridors of life, was seeking the friends who could show where the designs for the work had been hidden. And, true to the call, she responded, revealing plans once again, and speaking no words to explain, simply pointed them out and went on with the task. It was as if but the evening <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> parted, leaving yet to be done some detail of a task taken up with one common end; it was teacher and pupil, elder brother and younger, both bent on the one single end, but she with the power and knowledge that belong but to lions and sages." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} several {{songs for}} War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Something in the Air" [...] for the compilation 1 Love. Elbow contributed the song [...] "Snowball" [...] to another compilation, , in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that we listened to in that car was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone's doing something about it".|$|E
2500|$|The band gained further {{exposure}} {{when their}} 2007 single, [...] "Apologize", was re-mixed and re-released on Timbaland's compilation album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The remix became an international chart {{hit in the}} fall of 2007. The song broke records after gaining 10,331 spins in one week. According to SoundScan, [...] "Apologize" [...] is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone. It is also the second best-selling song of the decade. OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records. The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, [...] "Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded". Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group. Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, [...] "Apologize": [...] "The toughest thing to do is write a hit song, but we had a hit song <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> an album... What has happened has been really strange and really great." [...] Lately they have performed on The Voice, a singing competition, and have also performed on The Ellen Show singing their hit songs Love Runs Out and Counting Stars.|$|E
