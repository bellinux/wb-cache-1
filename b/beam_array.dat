40|$|Accelerating beams have {{attracted}} much attention in the frontiers of optical physics and technology owing to their unique propagation dynamics of nondiffracting, self-healing, and freely accelerating along curved trajectories. Such behaviors essentially arise from the particular phase factor occurring in their spatial frequency spectrum, e. g., the cubic phase associated to the spectrum of Airy beam. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a sort of accelerating <b>beam</b> <b>arrays,</b> which are composed of spatially separated accelerating beams. By superimposing kinoforms of multifocal patterns into the spatial frequency spectrum of accelerating beams, different types of <b>beam</b> <b>arrays,</b> e. g., Airy <b>beam</b> <b>arrays</b> and two-main-lobe accelerating <b>beam</b> <b>arrays,</b> are generated and measured by scanning a reflection mirror near the focal region along the optical axis.

40|$|The {{stiction}} of microstructures {{is still}} a challenging problem in spite of innovative advances in modern micromachining technology. In this paper, diamond-like carbon films were suggested as a solution for this problem. The microwave electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced CVD equipment {{has been applied to}} prepare the DLC films. Confocal Raman spectra confirmed the DLC characteristics of the prepared films. Water contact angle increased from 110 o on DLC-coated surfaces. The adhesion force of the DLC films was as low as 3. 8 nN measured by AFM, whereas the adhesion force of the oxide-coated surfaces was approximately 11. 2 nN. The polysilicon cantilever <b>beam</b> <b>arrays</b> have been used to determine the success of DLC coating for releasing microstructures.
