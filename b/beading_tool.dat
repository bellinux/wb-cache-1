5000|$|Bead {{setting is}} a generic term for setting a stone {{directly}} into metal using gravers, also called burins, which are essentially tiny chisels. A hole is drilled {{directly into the}} metal surface, and then a ball burr is {{used to make a}} concave depression just the size of the stone. Some setters will set the stone into that concave depression, and some will use a hart burr to cut a bearing around the edge. Then the stone is inserted into that space, and the gravers or burins are used to lift and push a tiny bit of the metal into and {{over the edge of the}} stone. Then a <b>beading</b> <b>tool,</b> which is simply a steel shaft with a concave dimple cut into the tip, is pushed onto the bit of metal, rounding and smoothing it, pushing it firmly onto the stone, and creating a [...] "bead". That is the essential method, but there are many types of setting that use the technique. When many stones are set in this fashion very closely together, about 1 millimeter apart, covering a surface, that is called [...] "pavé"—from the French for paved or cobblestoned. When a long line is engraved into the metal going up to each of the beads, that is [...] "star set", because of the look. The other common usage is called [...] "bead and bright", [...] "grain setting" [...] or [...] "threading" [...] in Europe, and other names at times. This is when, after the stone is set as described above, the background metal around the stone is cut away, usually in geometric shapes. In the end what is left is the stone with four beads in a lowered box shape with an edge around it. Often it is a row of stones, so it will be in a long shape with a raised edge and a row of stones and beads down the center. This type of setting is still used often, but it was very common in the early to middle 20th century.|$|E
50|$|There {{may have}} been several phases of occupation, as the first figurine was {{probably}} carved 2500 - 3000 BCE and one structure has been dated to c. 2000 BCE. Other finds include polished bone <b>beads,</b> <b>tools,</b> and grooved ware pottery. The {{full extent of the}} site is believed to exceed the size of Skara Brae on the Orkney mainland. The ruins are being backfilled to protect them from winter storms.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{discussed}} ancient art and its origin {{as well as}} some interesting samples from Georgian Stone Age sites. One of them is the earliest sample of jewelry discovered so far on the territory of Georgia and dates back to 22 - 21 thousand years BP. Besides there are other interesting samples, such as <b>beads,</b> <b>tools</b> {{in the form of a}} ﬁsh, adornments and so on. So, according to the Paleolithic art materials, Georgia can be characterized as one of the oldest places of origin and development of Paleolithic art in Europe...|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 4,722 {{artifacts}} {{have been recovered}} from the ship, a major percentage of which are Vietnamese ceramics (at 72.4 percent). These finds are categorized into six main groups depending on their kinds namely: Porcelain and ceramics, metals, coins, glass artifacts (<b>beads),</b> stone <b>tools</b> and earthenwares. These are discussed individually below.|$|R
50|$|Burial pits {{contained}} human remains, {{and nearby}} burial goods. The burial goods included jars, cups, dishes, spoons, arrowheads, pipes, <b>tools,</b> <b>beads,</b> pearls, and shell items.|$|R
5000|$|In 1881 to 1883, several {{excavations}} by Hjalmar Stolpe revealed 14 graves in {{and just}} beyond the south-east corner of the churchyard. Several of the burials were contained in boats up to 9 m long, and they were richly furnished with arrangements of weapons (including fine swords), helmets, cauldrons and chains, <b>beads,</b> shields, <b>tools</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|A tied {{bundle of}} documents, the Bar-Kokhba letters, {{was found in}} a waterskin, next to what were {{apparently}} a woman's belongings: wool, cosmetic <b>tools,</b> <b>beads,</b> a perfume flask and a mirror.|$|R
50|$|Njoro River Cave {{was first}} {{excavated}} in 1938 by Mary Leakey {{and her husband}} Louis Leakey. Dated to roughly 1,000 BC, the excavations revealed a mass cremation site. They also uncovered pottery, beads, stone bowls, basket work, pestles and flakes. The Leakey's excavation {{was one of the}} earliest to uncover ancient <b>beads</b> and <b>tools</b> in the area and a later investigation in 1950 was the first to use radiocarbon dating in East Africa.|$|R
50|$|Tools and {{ornaments}} made of wood, bone, {{stone and}} shell have been found. Perforated stones and plummets (oblong stones with a groove incised around one end) of limestone are though {{to have been}} used as fishing net weights. Dippers, cups, spoons, <b>beads,</b> cutting-edge <b>tools</b> and hammers were made from shells. Awls, beads, pendants, pins, gorges, barbs, and points were made from bone. Ceremonial tablets were incised on non-native stone (presumably imported from other areas).|$|R
50|$|A {{broken stone}} dish and {{fragment}} {{of a stone}} axe or hammer, sling stones, sharpening stone with a hole, bone handle of an unknown <b>tool,</b> <b>beads</b> made of lead and yellow glass, {{as well as other}} things were also unearthed.|$|R
50|$|Artifacts from Bed II {{have been}} dated using {{radiocarbon}} to 381 ± 91 B.P. Amongst rockfall debris, this bed contains {{both human and}} animals bones, including the bones of turtles and fish, {{some of which have}} been carved. Other artifacts include ostrich eggshell <b>beads,</b> pottery, obsidian <b>tools,</b> red ochre.|$|R
50|$|In 1719, French explorers {{established}} a fort and trading {{post on the}} Red River, Le Poste des Cadodaquious, opposite of an Upper Nasoni village. They traded firearms, ammunition, metal <b>tools,</b> <b>beads,</b> clothing, and accessories for hides and horses. The Upper Nasoni allied with the French from 1719 to 1762.|$|R
2500|$|Materials {{gathered}} from the Tallassee excavations revealed sporadic habitation dating to {{as early as the}} Woodland period (1000 B.C.–1000 A.D.) and occurring throughout the Mississippian period (900–1600 A.D.). [...] A prehistoric substructure mound was also located at the site, on the east bank of the river. [...] Excavators uncovered 145 burials at Tallassee—27 of which were classified as Cherokee—and 18 refuse pits. [...] Grave goods accompanying the Cherokee burials included glass <b>beads,</b> iron <b>tools,</b> brass implements, copper arrowheads, and a jaw harp. [...] Excavators also uncovered remnants of a house that had been burned and the foundations of an early 19th-century cabin.|$|R
50|$|The dolmen {{dates to}} the Neolithic, around 3000 BC. It was used for interments in which the cremated remains {{were placed in the}} tomb, often {{accompanied}} by grave goods, including <b>tools,</b> <b>beads</b> and pottery. The tomb may be aligned so that its portal points toward Slieve Gullion and/or the setting sun at the summer solstice.|$|R
50|$|For six days, volunteers, UC Davis {{undergraduate}} students and professors, spent 240 hours on-site collecting materials and studying the dig. Along with arrowheads, spear points, cutting <b>tools,</b> <b>beads,</b> animal and human skeletal remains, excavators uncovered delicate chert drills - an important discovery {{because they are}} believed to have been used to perforate marine clam shells to make beads, which became their currency.|$|R
40|$|Control of {{porosity}} in {{weld beads}} was major objective in development of aluminum welding program. Porosity, most difficult defect to control, {{is caused by}} hydrogen gas unable to escape during solidification. Hard <b>tooling</b> allows hotter <b>bead</b> than free-fall <b>tooling</b> so hydrogen bubbles can boil out instead of forming pores. Welding position, moisture, and cleanliness are other important factors in control of porosity...|$|R
50|$|The current {{inhabitants}} of Concow, including a few Maidus, commonly find relics of the Maidu {{in the form}} of <b>beads</b> and stone <b>tools</b> while digging in and around their homes. In the Concow Lake Valley there is no monument, plaque, or other recognition to memorialize the fate of the KonKow people - few if any of the current inhabitants know.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with just}} the vegetal {{artifacts}}, bone, shell, and wooden artifacts found most still fully intact, which implies they were left there for a reason, possibly for later use. There was an assortment of bone artifacts: flakes, perforated, and pendants as well as was 49 sharpened projectile points made from antler and animal bones. The pendants consisted of shaped bone. There were 143 shell artifacts consisting of clam and olivella shells. The shells were mainly used as <b>beads.</b> Wooden <b>tools</b> were very common. There was an assortment of 63 wooden weapon parts such as fore shafts, atlatls, and other weaponry pieces. Some wooden tools were located near hearths of which were eight discovered in the excavation.|$|R
50|$|The Poverty Point culture {{inhabited}} {{portions of}} the state of Louisiana from 2000 to 1000 BCE during the Archaic period. Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, including chipped stone projectile points and tools, ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels, and shell and stone <b>beads.</b> Stone <b>tools</b> found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials which originated in the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and from the much further away Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. Vessels were made from soapstone which came from the Appalachian foothills of Alabama and Georgia. Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomophic figurines and cooking balls.|$|R

50|$|J. A. Jørgensen, {{a schoolteacher}} from Ibsker, was Bornholm's most active {{archeologist}} {{in the late}} 19th century. In 1882, he investigated the Stenseby passage grave from the Neolithic where he discovered a few hundred amber <b>beads,</b> several flint <b>tools,</b> including a 5-inch knife, a sandstone axe and a decorated pot. Not far from Stenseby, he investigated another site, Bønnestenen. Further finds {{were made in the}} 1920s including a bronze age pot.|$|R
50|$|This chamber, {{dated to}} the early 4th {{millennium}} BC, is {{at the north end}} of monument F. It also underwent reuse in the 3rd millennium BC. The chamber, approximately 5 m by 2 m, is covered by a 32-ton slab, made from a type of stone available near Exodoun, 4 km away. The scarce finds from the chamber included pottery fragments, some unusual jewellery (<b>beads)</b> and flint <b>tools.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most of {{the ancient}} {{religions}} {{of the world have}} a tradition of using some type of prayer <b>beads</b> as <b>tools</b> in devotional meditation. Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads. Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone {{all the way around the}} mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads. Specific meditations of each religion may be different.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{resurgence}} of lampworking as a technique to make handmade glass beads, borosilicate has become a popular material in many glass artists' studios. Borosilicate for beadmaking comes in thin, pencil-like rods. Northstar, Trautman Art Glass, Glass Alchemy and Momka's Glass are popular manufacturers, although there are other brands available. The metals used to color borosilicate glass, particularly silver, often create strikingly beautiful and unpredictable results when melted in an oxygen-gas torch flame. Because it is more shock-resistant and stronger than soft glass, borosilicate is particularly suited for pipe making, as well as sculpting figures and creating large <b>beads.</b> The <b>tools</b> used for making glass beads from borosilicate glass {{are the same as}} those used for making glass beads from soft glass.|$|R

50|$|The Poverty Point culture {{inhabited}} {{portions of}} the state of Louisiana from 2000-1000 BCE during the Archaic period. Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, indicating that the people were part of an extensive trading culture. Such items include chipped stone projectile points and tools; ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels; and shell and stone <b>beads.</b> Stone <b>tools</b> found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials that {{can be traced to the}} relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark mountains, as well as others from the more distant Ohio and Tennessee River valleys.

50|$|The {{original}} {{hospital was}} built using the traditional Angolan method of making bricks from baked anthill.The ruins {{are still in}} existence.The Fishers brought ample supplies of cloth, <b>beads,</b> iron <b>tools</b> and utensils.In exchange for these, they had no difficulty hiring labour and construction proceeded fast.A serious incident occurred during the cold, dry season, when temperatures at night often dipped below the freezing point. One night a spark from {{the fire in the}} kitchen the grass roof alight. The fire spread and destroyed all of the Fishers' trade goods, medical supplies and personal possessions.Fortunately, local Europeans quickly made good the damage and more help arrived from overseas.

50|$|Between 1998-2000 and 2009-2010, {{the firm}} Archéotec {{conducted}} archaeological digs {{in and around}} the Le Ber-Le Moyne House. Roughly 32,000 fragments and objects were uncovered during these digs. The artefacts and ecofacts document the various phases of the site's occupation. For instance, pottery shards, <b>beads</b> and <b>tools</b> dating back between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago confirm the presence of Native Americans on the Le Ber-Le Moyne site. Furthermore, many suspected the trading post constructed by Le Ber and Le Moyne had been razed by fire during the Massacre in 1689 and reconstructed by Chorel and her husband between 1695 and 1698. The archaeological digs conducted by Archéotec have refuted this theory. Archaeologists have been unable to find traces of the supposed fire nor have they found anything that would indicate Chorel repaired or rebuilt the house. Archéotec suggests the large quantity of artefacts commonly used as trading goods during the French Regime confirm the house was in fact built by Le Moyne and Le Ber.|$|R

50|$|Burnish setting, also {{sometimes}} referred to as flush setting, shot setting, or gypsy setting (The term gypsy setting is used less often today because the word gypsy is seen as derogatory) is similar to bead setting, but after the stone is inserted into the space, instead of using a graver to lift <b>beads,</b> a burnishing <b>tool</b> is used to push the metal all around the stone. The stone will be roughly flush with the surface, with a burnished or rubbed edge around it. This type of setting has a long history but is gaining a resurgence in contemporary jewelry. Sometimes the metal is finished using sandblasting, as it shows off the work very well.|$|R

5000|$|Khasekhemwy {{apparently}} undertook considerable {{building projects}} upon {{the reunification of}} Egypt. He built in stone at el-Kab, Hierakonpolis, and Abydos. He apparently built a unique, as well as huge, tomb at Abydos, the last such royal tomb built in that necropolis (Tomb V). The trapezoidal tomb measures some 70 meters (230 ft) in length and is 17 meters (56 ft) wide at its northern end, and 10 meters (33 ft) wide at its southern end. This area was divided into 58 rooms. Prior to some recent discoveries from the 1st dynasty, its central burial chamber was considered the oldest masonry structure in the world, being built of quarried limestone. Here, the excavators discovered the king's scepter of gold and sard, {{as well as several}} beautifully made small stone pots with gold leaf lid coverings, apparently missed by earlier tomb robbers. In fact, Petrie detailed a number of items removed during the excavations of Amélineau. Other items included flint tools, as well as a variety of copper tools and vessels, stone vessels and pottery vessels filled with grain and fruit. There were also small, glazed objects, carnelian <b>beads,</b> model <b>tools,</b> basketwork and a large quantity of seals.|$|R
2500|$|On 16July 1999, the world's largest Viking silver treasure, the Spillings Hoard, {{was found}} in a field at Spillings farm {{northwest}} of Slite. The silver treasure was divided into two parts weighing a total of [...] ( [...] and [...] ) and consisted mostly of coins, about 14,000, from foreign countries, mostly Islamic. It also contained about [...] of bronze objects along with numerous everyday objects such as nails, glass <b>beads,</b> parts of <b>tools,</b> pottery, iron bands and clasps. The treasure was found by using a metal detector, and the finders fee, given to the farmer who owned the land, was over 2 million crowns (about US$308,000). The treasure was found almost by accident while filming a news report for TV4 about illegal treasure hunting on Gotland.|$|R
2500|$|Examination of {{the archaeological}} record in Norway has {{revealed}} some patterns that are comparable to horse burials in other areas. Of the six-hundred graves excavated forty of them are horse burials. Horse burials are found in both Norway and Iceland to occur more frequently with males, but are not exclusive to males. There are some female burials with horses, but a significantly lower number of them are found. Most graves are covered by circular or oval mounds. The grave goods found in Viking burials associated with horses in Norway and Iceland are also pretty similar. For male burials there are usually found weapons and tools, and women are usually found with <b>tools,</b> <b>beads,</b> brooches. Both genders are often found buried with riding equipment like horse bits and headstalls.|$|R
50|$|After the {{discovery}} of magatama beads in April 1986, the site was extensively excavated between 1989 and 1990 by the local Oirase Town Board of Education, and were discovered to consist of 108 domed kofun dating from {{the first half of}} the 7th century to the early 9th century AD. Many of the tombs had a shallow circumferential groove resembling a small moat. The tombs contained the remnants of swords, agricultural <b>tools,</b> <b>beads</b> and other jewelry articles, Haji pottery, and horse harnesses and the remains of wooden sarcophagus. The size of each tomb was approximately 10 meters in diameter, with a height of 1.1 meter. As the mounds are now flattened and do not appear above the present ground-level, a possibility exists that more undiscovered tombs exist in the area.|$|R
