Moses thought that he could busy himself with the Torah — the whole of which is life — and then the sun would set and the decree for his death would lapse. God signaled to the sun, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> refused to obey God, saying that it would not set and leave Moses alive in the world.|$|E

And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had.
