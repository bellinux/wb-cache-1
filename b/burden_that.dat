5|$|The double <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> {{single mothers}} endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E

And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E

25|$|In 1912 Barnes's family, facing {{financial}} ruin, split up. Elizabeth {{moved to}} New York City with Barnes {{and three of}} her brothers, then filed for divorce, freeing Wald to marry Fanny Clark. The move gave Barnes an opportunity to study art formally for the first time; she attended the Pratt Institute for about six months, but the need to support herself and her family—a <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> fell largely on her—soon drove her to leave school and take {{a job as a}} reporter at the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Upon arriving at the Daily Eagle, Barnes declared, “I can draw and write, and you’d be a fool not to hire me”, words that were inscribed inside the Brooklyn Museum.|$|E

Constantly, the Continental Navy {{attempted}} to breach the cordon of British vessels awaiting their departure; tasks in reaching the open seas came with such <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> Congress and the state assemblies attempted to mount a serious naval campaign {{in an effort to}} drive away the British warships that were blockading the American harbors. One achievement was that they warranted in shifting some of its cruises to European waters, using the ports of their ally, France, as a base of operation. Although it did not totally hinder nor prevent the Royal Navy from going anywhere in American waters. But the naval campaigns made it costly for Great Britain to maintain its army in American.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{licences}} are {{an important}} source of revenue. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. Payments from US government made under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) was about $9million in 1999. In May 2013 representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats for 18 months. In 2015 Tuvalu has refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked Tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery. In 2016 Dr Puakena Boreham, the Minister of Natural Resources, drew attention to Article 30 of the WCPF Convention, which describes the collective obligation of members to consider the disproportionate <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> management measures might place on small-island developing states.|$|E

500|$|The album's themes deal {{primarily}} with excess and celebrity, and also touch on decadence, grandiosity, escapism, sex, wealth, romance, self-aggrandizement, and self-doubt. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine notes the album's ethos as [...] "more is more" [...] and {{describes it as}} [...] "a meditation on fame", in which West decries the <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> it entails. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy also features more open references to drinking and drug use than on West's previous albums. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club describes it as [...] "darkly funny, boldly introspective, and characteristically fame-obsessed", noting [...] "manic highs and depressive lows emotionally" [...] in the album. Christgau found the themes of insecurity and uncertainty on the album to be West's [...] "heart, his message, the reason he's so major", noting the tracks [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and [...] "Runaway" [...] as examples. Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said West displayed a transparency and [...] "almost pathological allegiance to expressing his emotions, unfiltered".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> Hoffman felt: [...] "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North {{compared}} to 9 million in the South. While the North's population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color. [...] While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners were terrified at the idea of a black man with a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. [...] There was also the additional <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and [...] "owned". The North had vastly greater industrial capacity, built nearly all of the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all of the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.|$|E

500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{agreed to}} direct the project largely because of his {{attachment}} {{to the character of}} Cloud. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in Final Fantasy VII than in Advent Children, he did not believe that such an [...] "'upbeat' image of him is what stuck {{in the minds of the}} fans", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind [...] "consistent with the fans' view of him." [...] Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing. Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud's cell phone sinks into the water, but Nojima altered the scene because it [...] "sounded too creepy". The wolf which Cloud imagines [...] "represents the deepest part of Cloud's psyche" [...] and [...] "appears in response to some <b>burden</b> <b>that</b> Cloud is carrying deep in his heart", vanishing at the film's end. Nomura cites one of the film's final scenes, in which Cloud smiles, as his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud's embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu's score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished Final Fantasy VII would have had imagining Cloud's smile.|$|E
