Before he died, he told her {{she would have to}} get a job to support her mother, and would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four {{apprentice}} electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room, saying: [...] "Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it's Cynthia." ...|$|E

[...] Davidson has also managed to get O'Hara punished for being immoral, but Sadie will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Australia instead if Davidson approves.

[...] Davidson figures out this means that there is a warrant for her arrest back in San Francisco. [...] Sadie claims that she was framed and is innocent, but will go to prison if she is sent back.|$|E
2500|$|The Manifesto {{put forward}} {{proposals}} {{for creating a}} European federation of states, the primary aim of which was to tie European countries so closely together that they would no longer <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war with one another. As in many European left-wing political circles, this sort of move towards federalist ideas was argued {{as a reaction to}} the destructive excesses of nationalism. [...] The ideological underpinnings for a united Europe can thus be traced to hostility to nationalism: [...] "If a post war order is established in which each State retains its complete national sovereignty, the basis for a Third World War would still exist even after the Nazi attempt to establish the domination of the German race in Europe has been frustrated" [...] (founding meeting of the MFE).|$|E
2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this? How many kids are going to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college because of this?
