25|$|There are {{two types}} of animal {{locomotion}} on water, determined by the ratio of the animal's weight to the water's surface tension: those whose weight is supported by the surface tension at rest, and can therefore easily remain on the water's surface without much exertion, and those whose weight is not supported by the water's surface tension at rest, and must therefore exert additional motion in a direction parallel to the water's surface in order to remain above it. A creature such as the <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizard,</b> often dubbed the 'Jesus lizard', has a weight which is larger than the surface tension can support, and is widely known for running across the surface of water. Another example, the western grebe, performs a mating ritual that includes running across the surface of water.|$|E
500|$|Cope was {{the first}} to {{describe}} a sail-backed synapsid with the naming of Clepsydrops natalis in his 1878 paper, although he called the sail a fin and compared it to the crests of the modern <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizard</b> (Basilicus). Sails were not preserved in the specimens of D.incisivus and D.gigas that Cope described in his 1878 paper, but elongated spines were present in the D.rectiformis specimen he described. Cope commented on the purpose of the sail in 1886, writing, [...] "The utility is difficult to imagine. Unless the animal had aquatic habits, and swam on its back, the crest or fin must have been in the way of active movements... The limbs are not long enough nor the claws acute enough to demonstrate arboreal habits, as in the existing genus Basilicus, where a similar crest exists." ...|$|E
40|$|Water {{provides}} a unique challenge for legged locomotion because it readily yields to any applied force. Previous {{studies have shown}} that static stability during locomotion is possible only when the center of mass remains within a theoretical region of stability. Running across a highly yielding surface could move the center of mass beyond the edges of the region of stability, potentially leading to tripping or falling. Yet <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizards</b> are proficient water runners, regularly dashing across bodies of water to evade predators. We present here direct measurements of time-averaged force produced by juvenile plumed <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizards</b> (Basiliscus plumifrons) while running across water. By using digital particle image velocimetry to visualize fluid flow induced by foot movement, we show that sufficient support force is generated for a lizard to run across water and that novel strategies are also required to run across a highly yielding surface. Juvenile <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizards</b> produce greatest support and propulsive forces {{during the first half of}} the step, when the foot moves primarily vertically downwards into the water; they also produce large transverse reaction forces that change from medial (79 % body weight) to lateral (37 % body weight) throughout the step. These forces may act to dynamically stabilize the lizards during water running. Our results give insight into the mechanics of how <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizards</b> run across water and, on a broader scale, provide a conceptual basis for how locomotor surface properties can challenge established rules for the mechanics of legged locomotion...|$|R

500|$|In 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in {{the journal}} Science {{published}} a paper in which they analysed the rachises of the primary feathers of Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx. The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass. The authors determined that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis, were unable to use flapping flight. This study was criticized by Philip J. Currie and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested {{that it is difficult}} to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water. Gregory Paul also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds, and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of [...] for the Munich specimen Archaeopteryx, a young juvenile, based on published mass estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about [...] Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved.

Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises [...] across. Despite these criticisms, Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions. They claimed that Paul's statement, that an adult Archaeopteryx would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen, was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require an even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented. Another possibility is that they had not achieved true flight, but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizard,</b> which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits (see Evolution of bird flight).|$|E

50|$|There {{has also}} been debate about whether the {{earliest}} known bird, Archaeopteryx, could fly. It appears that Archaeopteryx had the brain structures and inner-ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight. Archaeopteryx also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But Archaeopteryx lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes; this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and numerical approach to “magic angle ” of stone skipping We investigate oblique impacts of a circular disk and water surface. An experiment [Clanet, C., Hersen, F. and Bocquet, L., Nature 427, 29 (2004) ] revealed that {{there exists a}} “magic angle ” of 20 ◦ between a disk face and water surface which minimize the required speed for ricochet. We perform 3 -dimensional simulation of the water impacts using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and analyze the results with an ordinal differential equation (ODE) model. Our simulation is in good agreement with the experiment. The analysis with the ODE model give us a theoretical insight for the “magic angle ” of stone skipping. Problem of impacts and ricochets of solid bodies against water surface have been received {{a considerable amount of}} attention [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In the early stage, the problem was of importance in naval engineering [8]. The investigations then mainly concerned with the impacts of canon balls off sea surface. Some experiments revealed, for ricochet of spheres, that there exists a critical angle θcr, above which the rebound does not occur. Furthermore the critical angle has a simple relation to specific gravity of the sphere σ as θcr = 18 / √ σ [9]. This empirical law was theoretically explained using a simple ODE model [9, 10]. In the military engineering today, problem of water impacts is not as important as that of a century ago. However, the problem attracts renewed interest under studies of locomotion of <b>basilisk</b> <b>lizards</b> [11] and ricochet of stone [12]. This study is motivated by an experimental study by C.

30|$|All {{living things}} have unique moving methods {{that have been}} {{developed}} through evolution. Creatures that walk or run on the ground use frictional or reaction forces. The surface of the earth is solid and hard and thus, sufficient frictional and reaction forces can be provided. In contrast, because the surface of water is easily deformed by external forces, the frictional and reaction forces from the water surface are much smaller than those from a solid surface. Like animals that move on solid ground, those moving on a water surface also can walk, run, and jump on it. Animals that are relatively large, however, cannot move on the water surface due to their heavy weight. The <b>Basilisk</b> <b>lizard,</b> among relatively large reptiles, can run on water by slapping the water with its back feet. Fringes between its toes create a large surface area. When the foot slaps the water, the large foot surface makes a large hole in the water, and the generated buoyancy pushes up the lizard. It has been measured that this motion produces 110 – 225 % of the force needed to support the lizard’s weight [1]. However, while the <b>Basilisk</b> <b>lizard</b> can move on water through his quick slapping motion, it cannot stand on the water surface due to its heavy weight.|$|E
