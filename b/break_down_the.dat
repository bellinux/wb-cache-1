5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|At the park's visitor center, {{the group}} learns that the cloning was {{accomplished}} by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber.

Malcolm scoffs {{at the idea of}} such controlled breeding, declaring it will inevitably <b>break</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> crew witness the birth of a baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E

5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E

5|$|After {{the victory}} at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pontoon bridges, {{but found that}} this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies, made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, and the Athenians laid siege to them there. After a protracted siege, Sestos fell to the Athenians, marking {{the beginning of a}} new phase in the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek counterattack. Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003 NRL grand final {{against the}} Penrith Panthers, the Roosters lost 18–6 {{in what was}} their {{heaviest}} defeat for the year. A decisive moment occurred midway through the second half: with the scores tied at 6-all, Roosters winger Todd Byrne made a clear <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> sideline and looked set to score a try before being chased down and tackled into touch by Penrith lock forward, Scott Sattler. From then on, {{the momentum of the}} game was with Penrith. The Roosters' made the Grand Final in 2004, when they ceded a 13–6 half-time lead to be defeated by the Bulldogs 16–13. The match was captain Fittler's last for the team.|$|E

Back at the church, Mulder realizes O'Connor was innocent all along, but Mackey summons snakes who promptly attack Mulder.

5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pontoon bridges, {{but found that}} this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E
