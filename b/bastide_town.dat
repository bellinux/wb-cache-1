2500|$|As an {{architect}} his engineering skills were firmly to the forefront, {{rather than an}} interpretation on the finer and more sophisticated points of rinascimento architecture. Impregnable fortresses such as the Fortezza Medicea [...] at Siena, and <b>bastide</b> <b>towns,</b> and bridges are his trade mark rather than elegant palazzi. [...] This {{is not to say}} Lanci was a man lacking in sophistication, one of his more surprising talents was designing some of the sets for the lavish theatrical and dramatical performances for which the Medici court was famed. As with his architecture, though, it was his engineering skills even here which dominated.|$|R
50|$|In the 13th century, old Winchelsea {{was one of}} England's most prosperous ports, {{particularly}} {{involved in}} the wine trade from Gascony but was lost to the sea. The new town of Winchelsea was laid out in 1283 {{in the form of}} a continental <b>bastides</b> <b>town</b> as a commercial centre for the importing of wine. The port was moved to the area of flat land, below the cliffs along the Strand. It was a river port, at the mouth of the River Brede which flowed out into a large lagoon, protected by a sandbar from the open waters of the Channel. The port connected with the town by a road that went up Strand Hill, through Strand Gate to the market place. The returning route went through the Landgate or Pipewell Gate, down Ferry Hill and into the port area.|$|R

The Anglesey Sea Zoo is a local tourist attraction, providing a look at and descriptions of local marine wildlife from common lobsters to congers.

The Anglesey Sea Zoo also breed commercially lobsters, for food, and oysters, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (Halen Môn, evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.|$|E
