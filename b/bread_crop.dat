50|$|It {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} the family until the 1930s, but part of the lands had passed into the proprietorship of the Hungarian Land Institute by then. It was the most populous village of that time. In 1932, 1,005 inhabitants lived in the 196 houses. The co-operative credit association was already in operation; in 1947, it was united with the Transdanubian Savings Bank Inc. There was also a co-operative dairy and a smallholders' association. The Roman Catholic elementary school was founded in 1750. The closest post office was in Somogysámson. The telephone and the district-notary were also available only there, but in 1951, the administrative centre was transferred to the village. The Liberty Agricultural Co-Operative operated between 1952-56. From 1959 the New Life Agricultural Co-Operative cultivated the lands, later joined by Főnyed, Szegerdő, and Szőkedencs. However, the co-operative went bankrupt in 1992. Since then the Darim Ltd. has grown fodder-plants and <b>bread</b> <b>crops</b> in 10 km² of land and another, not local contractor, on 6 km². The company has built a modern cleaning-drying apparatus, which gives a possibility to dry the crops grown not only in its own land but also in the neighboring farms. The apparatus is suitable for drying nuts and seeds as well. Two local agricultural contractors have chosen the province of animal husbandry. In one of the farms, 30 cows give fresh milk daily. In the other, 100 sows and their progeny are kept in the Szökedencs premises. Some try to find jobs in trade and services individually, but they rather intend it to be an additional income. Nearly forty people are compelled to commute to farther workplaces.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of increases in British and southern NSW wheat yields associated with genetic improvements. Estimates of these improvements were initially compared in each location using two different techniques. These techniques were a "variety improvement index" and a "vintage yield function". Yield increases "due to" genetic improvements were then compared between countries using both techniques. The variety improvement index technique suggested {{that there was little}} overall difference between genetic improvement in wheat in Britain and southern NSW. The vintage yield function technique suggested that the rate of yield increase for all varieties "due to" genetic improvement was markedly inferior in southern NSW. Estimated genetic improvement in southern NSW "food" wheats was similar to estimated genetic improvements in British <b>bread</b> wheats. <b>Crop</b> Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The long {{isolation}} of Albania and {{the scarcity of}} raw materials has traditionally led {{to the production of}} <b>bread</b> from <b>crops</b> other than wheat, like maize, which is the basic ingredient for maize bread (buk misri), rye, which is used to prepare rye bread (buk thekre), and chick-pea, used in chick-pea bread (buk me qiqre). Today, these traditional breads are accompanied by other types, such as brown bread from soft wheat (buk zize). In the present work, the traditional Albanian breads were characterised in order to assess their quality. The results obtained indicated that the protein content reflected the characteristics of the raw material used, being higher in the chick-pea bread and in bread made from high extraction rate wheat flour, while both fat and yellow pigment levels were higher in maize bread. A high humidity value was found in many of the breads examined, especially in maize bread, with consequent risks of moulds and a shortened shelf-life...|$|R
40|$|Both {{winter wheat}} and spring wheat have the {{potential}} for producing grain of bread wheat quality under North European conditions. The two crops may due to their different growth length respond differently to previous use of green manure and to the soil organic matter content. To compare winter wheat and spring wheat for their ability to produce quality grain for <b>bread</b> production, both <b>crops</b> are included in a long-term experiment (LTE) at Askov Experimental Station. The LTE provides a unique platform for such comparison, as the two crops can be grown under identical conditions regarding previous management, soil and climate. The bread wheat experiment is part of the project AGronomical and TEChnological methods to improve ORGanic wheat quality (AGTEC-Org) funded by CORE Organi...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the village}} {{community}} is about 25 persons strong, {{but there is}} a wider area that associates with Howardsville and partakes in its social activities. The oldest, most historic homes, which were sheltered from hurricanes Camille and Agnes, remain, lovingly restored by their present owners. The current village is on the Virginia Birding Route and the Virginia Cycle Route. There is a bed and breakfast establishment and local farmers produce goat cheese, <b>bread</b> and other <b>crops,</b> though forestry is the main agricultural produce of the area. Soapstone is still quarried in nearby Schuyler. It has its own boat ramp, where kayakers, canoers and fishermen can embark and land. As such, it remains one of the quaintest, most unspoilt villages of central Virginia.|$|R
40|$|Tomato (Solanum lycopsersicum) {{which forms}} a small {{monophyletic}} clade within the large Solanaceae {{family has been}} chosen as a model system for studying the Solanaceae genome, fruit development and ripening. At that time, many efforts have been devoted {{to the analysis of}} the genetic diversity of tomato species, little work has focused on the analysis epigenetic diversity in this clade, although there is a general agreement that epigenetic processes play essential role in the phenotypic diversity in animal and plant system. As first step, DNA methylation level was analyzed in leaves and fruits of various wild and cultivated tomato species. Additionally, the Enhancer of zest (E(z)) gene family has been analyzed. In tomato, the E(z) family consists in two functional genes (SlEZ 1, SlEZ 2) and in a pseudogene (SlEZ 3). In addition, the epigenetic stability is an important consideration that could have a significant on strategies for <b>crop</b> <b>breading.</b> Finally, we made a fine characterization of the different aspects of fruit development and ripening...|$|R
40|$|The Population {{produces}} more stable yields {{than those of}} the parent varieties due to more efficient use of soil nutrients and water, and lower plant disease and pest levels. When compared to the parent varieties, it produces yields of higher quality; increased protein content, improved hardness, good baking quality, comparable nutrition levels, and it is suitable for animal feed. Practical recommendation •	The Population is most suitable for growing in low input or organic systems (under high input conditions it maintains its stability, but could yield significantly lower than pure line varieties). •	It is able to adapt to changing environmental and weather conditions and cope with variation in diseases and weeds. To further increase crop resilience, you could also consider intercropping grain legumes and cereals. •	Evolutionary change can occur within 2 to 3 years, but grain yield, disease incidence and genetic diversity should not be affected. •	Sowing too deep or too shallow could delay or decrease establishment. •	When grown organically, it may provide a better potential for bread-making than modern quality varieties bred for conventional conditions but grown under organic conditions. •	Under conventional conditions, it may have potential for producing <b>bread</b> from <b>crops</b> with a lower nitrogen input. •	Carefully identify a target market for the Population, finding one that suits the characteristics of the wheat. This is likely to be smaller-scale, artisan bakers and home bakers, who can adapt their processes to suit the flour. •	There are many artisan and locally produced flours and breads on the market, so the unique selling points of the Population should be clearly explained to consumers...|$|R
40|$|Foliar {{diseases}} {{are the main}} biotic cause of yield loss in wheat crops (Triticum aestivum L.) in Argentina and other regions around the world. Most of the studies on foliar diseases take a phytopathological perspective, but few studies have analyzed the problem with an eco-physiological approach aimed at the understanding of which crop traits are affected by foliar diseases. The present {{study was designed to}} determine the effects of a foliar disease complex (including leaf rust, Septoria leaf blotch and tan spot), on (i) grain yield and (ii) the physiological components of biomass production; intercepted radiation (RI) and radiation use efficiency (RUE), in <b>bread</b> wheat <b>crops</b> growing under contrasting agronomic and environmental conditions (i. e. different cultivars, years, location and nitrogen supply). The experiments were carried out during 4 years in different locations (three in the rolling pampas of Argentina and one in northern of France). Five different commercial wheat cultivars were sown on early (E) and late (L) sowing dates (SD); and two contrasting nitrogen availability and two fungicide treatments (protected and unprotected) were applied. Foliar diseases appeared during the grain filling period and affected both, leaf area duration (LAD) and healthy area duration (HAD) during that period. Foliar diseases reduced both, above-ground biomass at harvest (1533 and 1703 gm- 2 for unprotected and protected treatments, respectively) and grain yield (646 and 748 gm- 2 for unprotected and protected treatments, respectively) without important effects on harvest index. Biomass reductions after anthesis, due to the effects of foliar diseases, were associated with a reduced capacity of the canopy to absorb solar radiation more than any effect on RUE. However, RUE was consistently lower—when leaf rust was the predominant disease in the crop, suggesting that this biotrophic pathogen could affect the photosynthetic activity at the leaf or canopy level...|$|R

The definitive version is available at [URL] variation in landscape character {{has in the past}} been studied by archaeologists in terms of its physical manifestations such as different settlement patterns and field systems. Local and regional distinctiveness in landscape character also results from how rural communities practised different agricultural regimes, and historians have long recognised {{the extent to which these}} varied across the country. Archaeologists, in contrast, have compared the animal bones and cereal remains from sites of different socio-economic status, but have not previously focused on the extent to which they vary across different geologies. This paper therefore presents an analysis of the animal bones of the three main domesticates (cattle, sheep/goat and pig), and the charred grains of the four main cereal <b>crops</b> (<b>bread</b> wheat, barley, oats and rye), across a series of different surface geologies within a study area extending from East Anglia down to the South-West Peninsula. It shows that, first, patterns of animal husbandry and cereal cultivation varied considerably across different surface geologies; secondly that, while farming practices do appear to have been influenced by surface geologies, they were also affected by cultural factors, particularly as human communities responded to the opportunities of a growing market economy; and thirdly that, while archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological patterns evident in the mid- 11 th–mid- 14 th centuries conform with what documentary sources tell us, the particular importance of this archaeological dataset is that it allows us to reconstruct farming regimes back into the undocumented early medieval (and indeed earlier) periods.

40|$|Developing a {{methodology}} for the inverse estimation of root architecturalparameters from field based sampling schemesShehan Morandage (1), Andrea Schnepf (1), Jan Vanderborght (1), Mathieu Javaux (1, 2), Daniel Leitner (3), EricLaloy (4), and Harry Vereecken (1) (1) Forschungszentrum Jülich, IBG- 3, jülich, Germany (t. morandage@fz-juelich. de), (2) Earth and Life Institute, Universitécatholique de Louvain, Louvain,Belgium (m. javaux@fz-juelich. de), (3) Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, University ofNatural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria (daniel. leitner@univie. ac. at), (4) Institute for Environment,Health and Safety, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, Belgium (eric. laloy@sckcen. be) Root traits are increasingly important in <b>breading</b> of new <b>crop</b> varieties. E. g., longer and fewer lateral roots aresuggested to improve drought resistance of wheat. Thus, detailed root architectural parameters are important. However, classical field sampling of roots only provides more aggregated {{information such as}} root length density(coring), root counts per area (trenches) or root arrival curves at certain depths (rhizotubes). We investigate thepossibility of obtaining the information about root system architecture of plants using field based classical rootsampling schemes, based on sensitivity analysis and inverse parameter estimation. This methodology was developed based on a virtual experiment where a root architectural model was usedto simulate root system development in a field, parameterized for winter wheat. This information provided theground truth which is normally unknown in a real field experiment. The three sampling schemes coring, trenching,and rhizotubes where virtually applied to and aggregated information computed. Morris OAT global sensitivityanalysis method was then performed to determine the most sensitive parameters of root architecture model forthe three different sampling methods. The estimated means and the standard deviation of elementary effects of atotal number of 37 parameters were evaluated. Upper and lower bounds of the parameters were obtained basedon literature and published data of winter wheat root architectural parameters. Root length density profiles ofcoring, arrival curve characteristics observed in rhizotubes, and root counts in grids of trench profile methodwere evaluated statistically to investigate the influence of each parameter using five different error functions. Number of branches, insertion angle inter-nodal distance, and elongation rates are the most sensitive parametersand the parameter sensitivity varies slightly with the depth. Most parameters and their interaction with the otherparameters show highly nonlinear effect to the model output. The most sensitive parameters {{will be subject to}} inverse estimation from the virtual field sampling data us-ing DREAMzs algorithm. The estimated parameters can then be compared with the ground truth in order todetermine the suitability of the sampling schemes to identify specific traits or parameters of the root growth mode...|$|R
