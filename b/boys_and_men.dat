While Gardasil and Gardasil-9 vaccines have been approved for males, the third HPV vaccine, Cervarix, is not administered to males. Unlike the Gardasil-based vaccines, Cervarix does not protect against genital warts.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the subject of}} the nude male figure in Western art had long been {{reserved}} for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting. Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, in America such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art. Viewed in a broader context, The Swimming Hole has been cited {{as one of the few}} 19th-century American paintings that [...] "engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition"—that of the male bather. Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in Summer Scene, Georges Seurat (1859–91) (Bathers at Asnières, 1884) and Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) in his numerous explorations of the subject.|$|E

The German 3rd Fallschirmjäger [...] Division, which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation, had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket. It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd, 51st, and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments. The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans. Although they carried the new StG 44 and were equipped with rifle grenades, few had ever fired them in combat. The German recruits were told the American soldiers they faced {{would not have the}} nerve to stand and fight.

He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: [...] "that [...] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys." [...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne's {{father was}} soon {{appointed}} curate (deputy vicar) of Saint Wilfrid's, {{the local church}} in Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford Free Grammar School, one of many such public schools, free {{to the poor and}} begun by Queen Elizabeth. About this time, Marbury married his first wife Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died. [...] Within a year of his first wife's death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about ten years younger than he and from a prominent Northampton family. [...] Bridget's brother Erasmus was the grandfather of John Dryden, the famous playwright and Poet Laureate. [...] Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood. The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne's life, and she received a better education than most girls of her time, with her father's strong commitment to learning, and she also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets. Education at that time was almost exclusively offered to <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>men.</b> One possible reason why Marbury taught his daughters may have been that six of his first seven children were girls. Another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.|$|E
500|$|Critics harshly {{criticized the}} film's {{controversial}} change in title from Rapunzel to Tangled. Holding Flynn's role and characterization partially responsible for it, they accused {{the character of}} being a marketing tool manipulated by Disney to attract larger male audiences via the film's trailers. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Dawn C. Chmielewski observed that Tangleds marketing campaign involved [...] "amp up {{the role of the}} dashing Errol Flynn-styled male lead to share the spotlight with the golden-haired namesake of the classic Brothers Grimm story". Tom Charity of CNN received Flynn as [...] "an attempt to lure <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>men</b> into the theater". One of the film's trailers features Flynn [...] "trying to win over ... Rapunzel by giving her 'the smolder'" [...] while [...] "emphasiz ... action components ... over the more girl-oriented fairy tale stuff", according to Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine. Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail felt that Flynn was [...] "obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie". Richard Corliss of Time mocked the film's marketing and the idea that [...] "The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish guy ... whose mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside." [...] Referring to the film's title as [...] "idiotic", Matt Neal of the Standard-Examiner wrote, [...] "Disney claims it changed the film's title from Rapunzel to Tangled to emphasise Flynn Rider's role in the film ... but that title-change excuse doesn't fly." [...] The Daily Mails Chris Tookey felt that Flynn's narration [...] "feels wrong", describing it [...] "as a commercially calculated move to reassure males in the audience that the film won't be too 'girly'." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times received Flynn as a [...] "hijacking of a princess's tale", panning the character as [...] "a crude commercial calculation, a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren't going to be too girly, or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude." [...] Claire Martin of The Denver Post felt that Flynn's sole purpose in the film was for potential merchandising opportunities, specifically to [...] "take Ken's role as [...] male arm candy".|$|E
