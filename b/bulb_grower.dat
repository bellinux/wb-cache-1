50|$|A {{building}} campaign {{began in}} the winter of 1952, but construction of new bunkhouses, T-houses, dining hall, and office building had not been completed enough to hold camp the following summer, the only gap in Nature Camp’s otherwise unbroken history. Nature Camp reopened in 1953 with three sessions and expanded to its current format of four sessions the following year. The new location at Big Mary’s Creek allowed Nature Camp to serve a much larger population of campers during the summer. All of the existing buildings were built in the 1950s and 1960s under the guidance of Lillian Schilling, who served as camp director through the summer of 1969. Brent Heath, now a third-generation <b>bulb</b> <b>grower</b> in Gloucester, Virginia, succeeded Mrs. Schilling as director and held the position for two years.|$|E

From 1880 the number of <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> and <b>bulb</b> fields grew to 250 and 252 hectares respectively, {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Tulips, daffodils and gladioli were grown, amongst other flowers. The majority of bulb fields lie behind the dunes as the sandy soil there is extremely suitable for cultivation. Noordwijk earned a national and international reputation for its impressive bulb exhibitions. In 1932 a Flora park was set up within the Offem country estate. Furthermore, Noordwijk entries could be admired at foreign bulb exhibitions and subsequently also in the flower exhibitions. Today the Noordwijk bulb area covers 311 hectares of land.|$|R
50|$|According to the RKD {{he was a}} pupil of {{his father}} Jan Laurentsz van der Vinne, who made botanical {{paintings}} of flowers for <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> in Haarlem. He {{became a member of}} the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1754. He is known for Italianate landscapes and flower still lifes, and also created tapestries. He was the first curator of art for the young Teyler's Museum during the years 1778-1785. In his Will Pieter Teyler van der Hulst had stipulated that ‘an artistic painter or other lover of the arts and sciences' would live in his house (later called Fundatiehuis). His task would be to maintain the books in the library and other collections (the medals, prints and drawings); and to catalogue and conserve them. This person would also be the manager or ‘resident caretaker' of the house, and, later, of the museum. Vincent van der Vinne was the first 'resident caretaker' of Teylers Museum and set up his studio in the fundatiehuis. He left after an argument with Martin van Marum, whereupon his position was filled by Wybrand Hendriks.|$|R

Field, greenhouse, and controlled-environment facilities were used to determine plant/temperature relations in the phasic development of the Easter lily crop and its climatic adaptation. Weather monitoring (soil and air temperature) and plant growth analysis were used to evaluate the feasibility of predicting bulb yield, dormancy, maturity, and greenhouse forcing performance.

40|$|The plant {{quarantine}} measures for tulip and lily bulbs were abolished in 1988. A {{removal of the}} quarantine made Japanese <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> face international competition in the markets. Since then the imports of bulbs, mainly from Holland, increased rapidly and bulb prices tended to decline gradually, while the Japanese production of bulbs did not decrease. The imports also introduced new varieties of bulbs to Japan. The demand for tulip bulbs increased greatly until the late 1990 s, but in the 2000 s the Japanese bulb markets stagnated. Bulb prices decreased, and the domestic production of bulbs decreased sharply, which caused a great {{reduction in the number}} of bulb farmers. Consequently, the rate of self-sufficiency for producing tulip bulbs in Japan decreased from 80 % in 1988 to 20 % in 2006, even though the volume of imported bulbs decreased in the 2000 s. This paper analyzes the demand and supply conditions of tulip bulbs, and reports estimates of the Japanese demand and supply functions of tulip bulbs by regression analysis. Demand depends upon the real price (in terms of consumption goods) of tulip bulbs negatively and the real national income positively, and shows that the demand curve shifted forward until 2001, and then shifted backwards. Domestic supply depends upon the prices of tulip bulbs and the rice prices positively...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of an historical {{perspective on the}} formation of regions is widely accepted. Academics and regional policy-makers use regional history to explain or legitimise the current political position of particular regions, while history is also widely regarded as {{an important element in}} the social construction of regions. The dominant evolutionary approach to regions has provided useful insights, but suffers from some fundamental problems, as illustrated here through the example of the present-day Dutch province of Gelderland. We propose to shift the focus from the historical analysis of the evolution of given regions to the comparison of the spatial strategies used by local stakeholders in different historical settings. We identify four logically distinct though empirically interrelated spatial strategies used by local stakeholders to promote their interests through their support of specific regions: (1) the territorialisation of networks to realise economies of scale; (2) cooperation against sub-regional threats; (3) regional territorial defence against other regions; 4) scalar politics against supra-regional control. This framework is then applied to two case studies of spatial strategies: those of urban elites in medieval Nijmegen, and of contemporary <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands. Historical analysis of the reasons why actors in these widely divergent historical cases sometimes use regions to promote their specific interests can help us to understand the conditions under which regions may become important political entities.

40|$|Flower bulb {{production}} in The Netherlands is economically successful. However, production methods {{rely heavily on}} external inputs, causing contamination of surface and ground water. The use of pesticides has been estimated 100 kg active ingredient (a. i.) per ha in 1994. In the same year the annual use of nitrogen and phosphate was 310 and 130 kg per ha respectively. Over the last decade the Dutch government established targets for the input and emission of pesticides and (in) organic fertilizers, energy use and volume of production related waste. Prototype flower bulb farming systems, with regard to these objectives, were developed, tested and improved on three experimental farms. This article concentrates {{on the results of}} two experimental farms on sandy soils in the west of The Netherlands in the period 1991 - 1997 : ‘De Noord’ at St. Maartensbrug and ‘De Zuid’ at Hillegom. At both experimental farms the use of pesticides was reduced with at least 75 % compared to the reference year of 1987 - 1988. Considerable reduction in the use of soil fumigants and fungicides was realised, but not of herbicides and insecticides. The use of nitrogen and phosphate decreased to approximately 215 kg and 55 kg per ha respectively. The integrated prototypes of experimental farm ‘De Zuid’ were economically competitive with flowerbulb farms in the same region. Integrated farming prototypes of ‘De Noord’ were less profitable due to suboptimal soil conditions, over-ambitious research targets and i nexperienced management. As a spin-off of this farming system research, 24 flower <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> are converting to integrated flowerbulb growing on their farms. They are supported by research and extension worker...|$|R
40|$|Leaf blight, {{caused by}} the {{pathogen}} Botrytis elliptica (Berk.) Cooke, {{is the most important}} foliar disease in ornamental lily cultivation. The conventional control strategy of Dutch <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> is to apply protective fungicides at weekly intervals from crop emergence until harvest. We applied simulation models to complement experimental studies in the search for control strategies with less fungicide input at minimum yield loss. Effects of cultural measures that reduce primary infection, were investigated across 5 years of historic weather assuming season-specific influx patterns of only primary inoculum. The results indicate that reduction of influx of external primary inoculum by cultural measures is a necessary basis of an effective strategy to control fire disease in lilies. A modest degree of spatial isolation, i. c. maintaining a distance of at least 10 m to fields where lilies were grown in the previous year, was much more effective than post-harvest measures aiming at reduced production or survival of sclerotia. Results showed that when cultural measures are combined with a relatively resistant cultivar, non-chemical control may well be a feasible option. Different chemical control strategies were evaluated across combinations of 5 years of historic weather and inoculum influx levels that had been derived in a previous study. Simulation results indicate that fungicide input can be strongly reduced, even with a highly susceptible cultivar and under a scenario of high disease pressure. Under such high-risk conditions, fungicides with a high initial and residual efficacy and weather forecasts of better-than-actual quality appear to be the prerequisites to make a warning system-based control strategy as reliable as the strategy with weekly applications of a low-cost fungicide. The conclusions concerning the strong beneficial effect of modest degrees of spatial isolation rely critically on our assumptions with regard to the dispersal distance of conidiospores. We therefore recommend that field studies on dispersal of B. elliptica spores be conducted, whereas system-level experiments are required to validate the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{dry bulb}} mite, Aceria tulipae, {{is the most}} {{important}} pest of stored tulip bulbs in The Netherlands. This tiny, eriophyoid mite hides in the narrow space between scales in the interior of the bulb. To achieve biological control of this hidden pest, candidate predators small enough to move in between the bulb scales are required. Earlier experiments have shown this potential for the phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus cucumeris, but only after the bulbs were exposed to ethylene, a plant hormone that causes a slight increase in the distance between tulip bulb scales, just sufficient to allow this predator to reach the interior part of the bulb. Applying ethylene, however, is not an option in practice because it causes malformation of tulip flowers. In fact, to prevent this cosmetic damage, <b>bulb</b> <b>growers</b> ventilate rooms where tulip bulbs are stored, thereby removing ethylene produced by the bulbs (e. g. in response to mite or fungus infestation). Recently, studies on the role of predatory mites in controlling another eriophyoid mite on coconuts led to the discovery of an exceptionally small phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus paspalivorus. This predator is able to move under the perianth of coconuts where coconut mites feed on meristematic tissue of the fruit. This discovery prompted us to test N. paspalivorus for its ability to control A. tulipae on tulip bulbs under storage conditions (ventilated rooms with bulbs in open boxes; 23 °C; storage period June-October). Using destructive sampling we monitored predator and prey populations in two series of replicated experiments, one at a high initial level of dry bulb mite infestation, late in the storage period, and another at a low initial dry bulb mite infestation, halfway the storage period. The first and the second series involved treatment with N. paspalivorus and a control experiment, but the second series had an additional treatment in which the predator N. cucumeris was released. Taking the two series of experiments together we found that N. paspalivorus controlled the populations of dry bulb mites both on the outer scale of the bulbs {{as well as in the}} interior part of the bulbs, whereas N. cucumeris significantly reduced the population of dry bulb mites on the outer scale, but not in the interior part of the bulb. Moreover, N. paspalivorus was found predominantly inside the bulb, whereas N. cucumeris was only found on the outer scale, thereby confirming our hypothesis that the small size of N. paspalivorus facilitates access to the interior of the bulbs. We argue that N. paspalivorus is a promising candidate for the biological control of dry bulb mites on tulip bulbs under storage conditions in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MComm (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Tulips are {{the second}} largest floral {{commodity}} that is traded globally. Currently Holland controls half of the 20 billion Dollar tulip bulb market, although immense pressure from European institutions may serve to change this phenomenon in the near future. Not only do increasing labour costs and stricter legislation on the usage of pesticides impair this industry, but the Dutch government also places huge pressure on its own producers to convert scarce agricultural land into residential areas. These conditions could therefore provide a possible market opportunity for farmers from other countries. Due too {{the fact that the}} price of tulip bulbs is based {{on the size of the}} flower and the length of the floral stem, floral farmers generally gain an extra 2 - 3 cm stem length via physically cutting it out of the tulip bulb. Therefore, floral farmers annually destroy their whole supply of tulip bulbs, resulting in a need to reacquire <b>bulbs</b> from <b>bulb</b> <b>growers.</b> Due to the fact that the lifespan of cut tulip flowers is generally not more than seven days, Dutch land rezoning ought to result in tulip bulb production being the production component which could truly be relocated in a global context. In this study, an economic analysis is therefore conducted to ascertain South Africa’s potential to produce tulip bulbs in order to supply the growing demand in the Netherlands. Information was gathered by performing a literature study of existing literature and by conducting structured interviews with numerous experts in their various fields of operation. Due to the fact that expertise in South Africa was very limited, a large number of interviews were scheduled with experts from Holland and Germany. The presence of strict non-disclosure contracts resulted in a situation where interviews had to be conducted with individuals who are two to three levels removed from any relevant tulip organisation. The study was conducted through first analysing the global market from a horticultural perspective and thereafter from an economic-logistical stance. It was established that tulip bulbs are very temperature sensitive and therefore have to be produced far from any tropical zones. Since Sutherland’s winter temperature is similar to that of Dutch production areas, South African tulip bulbs could be planted in Holland. The difference in seasons of production allows farmers from the Southern Hemisphere to predict the extremely fashion sensitive market in one year less. Via moving production activities between alternative hemispheres, off seasons can be utilized for production, which could result in fashions being predicted with a greater sense of accuracy. If unfashionable bulbs are produced, a loss of up to R 34 129, 87 per ha can be incurred, while mid-priced bulbs and fashionable bulbs can earn respectively R 80 118, 09 and R 122 626, 57 per ha. Projections are however based on the prices of a bear phase where the market currently pays up to 75 % less for bulbs than it did three years ago. The production costs in Sutherland could be cut by R 15 750 if it is decided to mechanise production but simultaneously this action will result in an increase of R 120 000 in new capital equipment required. The use of 40 feet High Cube Reefers reduces transportation costs considerably and 1 042 437 bulbs with a circumference of between 10 and 12 cm can be shipped in such an container via utilizing South African produced SN 64190 crates and four way export pallets. Market penetration remains an important consideration since a farmer’s production history is very important in the international market environment. Partnerships, production of larger bulbs, organic production and seasonal production in alternating hemispheres, remain some of the most suitable techniques for market penetration...|$|R
