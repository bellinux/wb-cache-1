The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the structure modification of palm oil to cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> using Carica papaya lipase –catalyzed interesterification. The study showed that the compositions of cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> were affected by acyl donor sources, substrate ratio, initial water of enzyme, reaction time, reaction temperature and the amount of enzyme. Among three acyl donors tested (methyl stearate, ethyl stearate and stearic acid), methyl stearate appeared to be the best acyl donor for incorporation to palm oil structure. The best reaction conditions for cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> production were: substrate ratio (palm oil: methyl stearate, mol/mol) at 1 : 4, water activity of enzyme at 0. 11, reaction time at 4 h, reaction temperature at 45 � C and 18 % by weight of the enzyme.

40|$|Abstract. Cocoa butter (CB) is an {{important}} major constituent of chocolate and other confectionary products. Several factors such as premium price, uncertainty in supply and variability in quality, have led the search for an alternative such as cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> (CBE) from available and cheap commercial oils or fats. The aim {{of this research was}} to produce CBEs which contain omega- 3 and omega- 6 by blending hard palm oil mid-fraction (PMF) with canola oil. The reaction was performed by using Lipozyme RM IM as the biocatalyst. It aims to retain omega- 3 and omega- 6 content in CBE after interesterification. The effect of lipase load (LL), time reaction (TR) and stearic acid (ST) on CBE properties were studied to produce nearly similar CBE properties to CB. The best reaction conditions for maximizing POS (palmitic-oleic-stearic), SOS (stearic-oleic-stearic), and SMP (slip melting point) value while minimizing POP (palmitic-oleic-palmitic) and the levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) formation were; LL, 7. 5 % (w/w); TR, 8 hours; ST, with 44 % stearic acid addition.

We examined the kinetics of HOHS oil crystallization, paying special attention to the influence of crystal seeding and temperature on the process and the composition of the final fractions.

The experimental data collected were fitted using the models of Gompertz and Avrami to study how well these models fitted the data and their utility in predicting the progress of crystallization. At seeding additions above 0. 25 % there was a change in the crystallization mechanism that improved the process of fractionation. The effect of temperature was also studied, showing important increases in the maximum rates of crystallization when fractionations were carried out at lower temperatures.

40|$|When the European Union {{decided in}} 2000 to allow {{chocolate}} to contain up to 5 % vegetal fats other than cocoa butter, shea butter was proclaimed as a promising substitute.

Shea butter is extracted from {{the fruits of the}} shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa, also known as Butryospermum paradoxum) which grows in the southern Sahelian zone, from Senegal in the west to Uganda and Sudan in eastern Africa. On average, one tree produces 15 to 20 kg of fruits, yielding 1. 5 kg of butter. Processed nuts fetch in general one and a half times more 200 /t) than the raw ones. Harvesting from the wild and processing the butter is done mainly by women. The butter is processed into cooking oil and consumed locally or exported as the basis for cosmetics or fat in foodstuffs. The downside is that the shea tree is hard to domesticate, starts bearing fruit only after 15 to 20 years and has a fluctuating yield. The combination of unreliable and small supply with low purchasing prices on intermediate trade markets has meant that shea has not become a strong CBE. Of the estimated total production of 1. 7 million t, only 65, 000 t is exported as a CBE and 3, 000 t for cosmetics. There is room for improvement if producers can organise themselves to guarantee a stable supply and establish direct links with such markets as the cocoa and cosmetics industries. In Burkina Faso, the UN fund for women (UNIFEM) has mediated a deal between producers and L Occitane, a French firm, which now buys directly from the Union des Groupements Kiswendsida (UGK).

40|$|Shea {{butter is}} a plant fat {{extracted}} from kernels of shea nuts, {{the seeds of}} shea trees (Vitellaria paradoxa). The extracted fat, which {{has a long history}} of use in sub-Saharan Africa for medicinal, culinary, and other applications, serves as cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> (CBEs) in the manufacture of chocolate and is an ingredient for cosmetics in the international market. Since shea butter contains relatively high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (more than 50 %), oxidation can occur during extraction and during post-harvest processing and storage. This study investigated the protective effects of synthetic butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and selected natural antioxidants (rosmarinic acid and gallic acid) on shea butter against oxidation. Each antioxidant (0. 02 %) was added to shea butter and the mixtures were placed at 90 °C for 0, 72, and 144 h to accelerate oxidation. Measures of oxidation indicated the shea butter was protected from oxidation by addition of the antioxidants. The addition of antioxidants to shea butter produced no significant changes in the parameters used to measure oxidation (e. g. peroxide values, conjugated dienes and TBARS), as well as in the levels of major fatty acids. The natural antioxidants were almost as effective as the synthetic antioxidant...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) {{technique in}} combination with multivariate data evaluation was used to analyze {{a wide variety of}} cocoa butters (CB), cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> (CBE), and mixtures thereof. The sample set con-sisted of 14 CB (10 pure from various geographical origins and 4 commercial mixtures), 18 CBE (12 mixtures and 6 pure CBE from kokum, illipé, and palm midfraction), and 154 mixtures of CB with CBE at various concentrations (ranging from 5 to 20 %). A total of 192 samples were analyzed in triplicate. All CB and CBE were shown to have very characteristic FTIR spectra that gave highly reproducible fingerprints. The main vibrational modes were also elucidated. FTIR can easily be employed to distinguish between pure CB and pure CBE. With prior knowl-edge of which cocoa butter is present in mixtures, FTIR can be applied to distinguish between CB mixed with CBE at the 10 and 20 % levels (corresponding to about 2 and 5 % of CBE in chocolate). However, the study revealed that a single “global” statistical model (multilayer perceptron, radial basis functions, or partial least square regression) was not able to predict the precise level of addition. The FTIR approach detailed here shows great potential as a rapid screening method for distin-guishing between pure vegetable fats and, we believe, could be extended to investigate mixtures of CB and CBE by the estab-lishment of a database...|$|R
40|$|Pre-colonial {{patterns}} of trade in West Africa included exchanges of shea in periodic {{local and regional}} markets. The collection, processing and marketing of shea products in such markets continues to be predominantly by women to both meet subsistence needs, and exchange of surpluses. In {{the early part of}} the 20 th century, the British colonial administration considered the possibilities of starting large-scale exports of shea kernels to Europe. Multiple colonial initiatives to develop the global trade were not successful due to a composite of factors. Contemporary {{patterns of}} production, trade and regulation are contrasted in the context of globalisation in the post-independence era. The government of Ghana has progressively reinforced its ambitions to expand the shea nut trade as part of the state’s portfolio of major non-traditional agricultural export commodities. This policy is embedded within the (now) dominant orthodoxy of neo-liberalism, which privileges monetized production systems and private over public regulation. Historically and culturally-embedded patterns of shea production and trade by women in northern Ghana may now be challenged by the emergence of new processing technologies, the emergence of an oligopolistic global commodity chain and the anticipated continued growth in global demand for cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents.</b>   Nevertheless, the cumulative impacts of increasing commercialisation and world market integration at the national and local level in Ghana, and other West African producer countries, are still unknown. There are risks, however, that this process may result in social differentiation, changes in household consumption patterns and loss of livelihoods, particularly for women. </p...|$|R
30|$|Mango (Lakshminarayana et al. 1983), neem (Kaura et al. 1998) and shea kernels contain 7 – 15, 14 – 42 and 35 – 55  % (Bup et al. 2011; Honfo et al. 2013) oils {{indicating}} their potentials as {{a vegetable}} oil source. While neem oil is not eaten {{in the production}} areas, mango and shea oils {{have been used as}} cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> in chocolates and margarine formulations. All three types of oils find use in traditional medicines and cosmetic formulations (Bup et al. 2011; Förster and Moser 2000; Lakshminarayana et al. 1983). However, reports have shown that potential for the production of these non-conventional oils are still largely underexploited. For example only 45  % of total shea kernels produced annually are actually collected and processed (Holtzman 2004). The amounts of neem and mango kernels processed yearly are far less than shea nuts. Consequently it can be stated that these kernels often rot away during the production season and represent instead an environmental concern. At present there are no modern factories in African countries for the processing of mango and neem kernels into oil, which may be due partly to the fact that market demands from the existing users are not strong enough to encourage production. A diversification of the uses of these oils for the production of biodiesel may be a correct measure to encourage their exploitation, which will have important positive effects on the economies of the processors and the countries producing them. Studies on the enzymatic transesterification of these oils, as far as we know, do not exist in the literature.|$|R

Characterisation of high 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycerol content stearins produced by acidolysis of high oleic sunflower oil with stearic and palmitic acids. European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology, 116 (5), pp. 532 - 547, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Nine different stearin fractions with 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycerol (StOSt) contents ranging from 69 – 84 % were obtained via fractionation from fats produced by acidolysis of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) with various mixtures of stearic (either 95 or 98 % pure) and palmitic acids (98 % pure). Samples were further treated with silica to reduce the oxidised glyceride and DAG content. Isothermal crystallisation at 20 °C showed a single main peak, but evidence of crystallisation during the initial DSC transient was also apparent for high StOSt content samples. This was confirmed as the α form by stop-and-return DSC and XRD. The main crystallisation event was generally faster (including a shorter induction time) for samples with higher StOSt levels (lower POSt levels). Silica treatment generally accelerated transformations to higher polymorphs (γ, β′ and β). Raman microscopy experiments showed that crystallisation of the β-form was achieved after 7 days storage at 20 °C but only in the silica treated stearin samples. This is consistent with higher solid fat content (SFC) values that were obtained with silica treated samples, which also increased with higher levels of StOSt. The results suggest that such stearins could potentially replace shea stearin in cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> (CBE) formulations...|$|R
40|$|A multi-methodological {{approach}} {{was used to}} study the isothermal crystallization of cocoa butter (CB) {{in the presence of}} sunflower oil based cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> (CBEs). pNMR, DSC, oscillatory rheology, XRD, and PLM were used for this purpose. All the techniques confirmed that at 20 °C isothermal crystallization of all the blends is a two-step process with formation of α crystals in the first step and formation of β’ crystals in the second step. The blends with high amount of CBEs contained more high-melting triacylglycerols (TAGs) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in compare with CB acting as seed crystals enhancing the formation of a- crystals in the first crystallization step. Therefore, the induction time of the first crystallization step was inversely related to the amount of CBE. In contrast, the subsequent polymorphic transition was delayed by the presence of the CBE due to their low-melting TAGs. However, adding up to 5 % CBE did not change the Foubert’s parameters for isothermal crystallization significantly. All the blends (except 5 % HOSO CBE), had a mediated β’ crystallization. Picturing of the microstructure showed that for the CB and the blends up to 50 % large microstructures, indicative of the bV polymorph developed during storage. At 100 %, a dense network of spherulites was formed {{at the beginning of the}} crystallization period, but upon further storage, no large morphological changes were observed. Practical applications: In recent years, the production of CB has been delayed owing to its cultivation difficulty and low yield due to pest attack, while the world cocoa prices have increased with rising demand and higher chocolate consumption. Therefore, there is a need to develop low-priced and appropriate alternatives to CB. Accordingly, in this study two sunflower oil based CBEs were produced with fatty acid mixtures in the presence of immobilized 1, 3 -regiospecific lipase. The results from this study could help the fats and oils industries to extend their knowledge on the crystallization and polymorphic behavior of two enzymatically produced sunflower oil based CBEs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{quantification}} of the effect of the cocoa fat content on the wetting characteristics and surface free energy of different chocolate compositions. On the market, there are many different types of chocolate products which differ both in the sensory and physico-chemical properties together with their raw material compositions and the contents of the individual components. This paper focuses on differences in the use of different types of fats - cocoa <b>butter,</b> milk fat, <b>equivalents</b> or cocoa <b>butter</b> substitutes in chocolate products. Studied samples (prepared at Carla, Ltd. Company) were followed by static contact angles of wetting measurements and by calculated surface free energies. There were investigated the effects of fat content and used fat types of the chocolate products on their final wettabilities and resulting surface free energies. There was found a linear dependence between total fat content and the surface free energy, which was gradually increasing with increasing fat content. Additionally, there were performed TG DTG and NIR spectrometry measurements of the tested materials with the aim to determine the melting point of studied fats used, as well as to determine and identify individual fat components of chocolate products which may affect the resulting value of surface free energy. © 2017 Potravinarstvo Slovak Journal of Food Sciences...|$|R
