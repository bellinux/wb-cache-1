40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>pigments,</b> {{including}} bilirubin and biliverdin, are endogenous compounds {{belonging to}} the porphyrin family of molecules. In the past, <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> and bilirubin in particular were thought of as useless by-products of heme catabolism that can be toxic if they accumulate. However, in the past 20 years, research probing the physiological relevance of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> has been mounting, with evidence to suggest <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> possess significant antioxidant and anti-mutagenic properties. More specifically, <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> are potent peroxyl radical scavengers and inhibit the mutagenic effects {{of a number of}} classes of mutagens (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, oxidants). Coincidentally, persons with elevated circulating bilirubin concentrations have a reduced prevalence of cancer and cardio-vascular disease. Despite the encouraging in vitro anti-mutagenic effects of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments,</b> relatively little research has been conducted on their inhibitory capacity in bacterial and cultured cell assays of mutation, which might link the existing in vitro and in vivo observations. This is the first review to summarise the published data and it is our hope it will stimulate further research on these potentially preventative compounds. No Full Tex...|$|R

50|$|Gmelin's test is a {{chemical}} test used for detecting {{the presence of}} <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> in urine. It is named after Leopold Gmelin, who introduced the test. Five millilitres of urine is slowly added to five millilitres of concentrated nitric acid in a test-tube. Different coloured rings between the two layers are visible if <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> are present as they are oxidised to various chemical products. Nitric acid is used as the oxidising agent. Blue, green and violet rings are seen if bilirubin is present.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{potential}} pro- and anti-mutagenic effects of endogenous <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> unconjugated bilirubin (BR), biliverdin (BV) and a synthetic, water soluble conjugate, bilirubin ditaurate (BRT) in the Ames Salmonella test. The <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> were tested over a wide concentration range (0. 01 – 2 !mol/plate) in the presence of three bacterial strains (TA 98,TA 100, TA 102). A variety of mutagens including benzo[alpha]pyrene (B[']P), 2, 4, 7 trinitrofluorenone (TNFone), 2 -aminofluorene (2 -AF), sodium azide (NaN 3) and tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), were used to promote the formation of mutant revertants. Tests were conducted with (B[']P, 2 -AF, t-BuOOH) and without (TNFone, NaN 3, t-BuOOH) metabolic activation incorporating the addition of the microsomal liver preparation, S 9. The <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> alone did not induce mutagenicity in any of the strains tested (p > 0. 05). Anti-mutagenic effects of the <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> were observed in the presence of all mutagens except for NaN 3 and the anti-mutagenic effects appeared independent of the strain tested. For TNFone induced genotoxicity, the order of effectiveness was BR> or equal to BRT >BV. However, the order was BR> or equal to BRT > or equal to BV. for 2 -AF. Antioxidant testing in the TA 102 strain revealed <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> could effectively inhibit the genotoxic effect of t-BuOOH induced oxidative stress.

40|$|Recent {{applications}} of thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedures has revealed an unexpected {{wide variety of}} naturally occurring unconjugated and conjugated bilirubins. Biliverdins seems to occur only in unconjugated forms, mainly as the IX alpha isomer. Several synthetic biliverdins and bilirubins present interesting models for biochemical and metabolic studies. Owing to recent recognition of the astounding heterogeneity of natural bilirubins and to the various artifactual changes that <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> can undergo, considerable confusion has existed, and still exists, {{with regard to the}} nomenclature of the <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> and their derivatives.

40|$|Patients with Crigler-Najjar {{syndrome}} and Gunn rats cannot form bilirubin glucuronides owing {{to a lack}} of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. Because increased serum and tissue bilirubin levels remain constant, an alternative excretory route has to substitute for this deficiency. Gunn rats excrete in bile only 2 - 13 % of the bilirubins eliminated in Wistar rats. In contrast, the biliary excretion rate of urobilinogen in Gunn and Wistar rats is comparable. The sum of bilirubins and urobilinogen excreted in the bile of Gum rats amounts to 10 - 30 % of pigments excreted in Wistar rats. Despite this low biliary excretion, the intestinal content and fecal excretion of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> in Gunn and Wistar rats were similar. These data support an extrabiliary entrance of unconjugated bilirubin into the intestine. Additional proof for this was found in that the intestinal lumen of Gunn rats still contains a high amount of bilirubins and urobilinogen after 3 d of external biliary drainage. A similar procedure in Wistar rats resulted in the complete disappearance of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> from the intestine. The direct transmural transport of bilirubin from blood to all parts of the intestinal lumen was demonstrated by injecting C- 14 -bilirubin i. v. into Gunn rats with isolated parts of small and large intestine. In Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert's syndrome patients, the biliary excretion of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> has previously been shown to be strongly reduced.

Although only traces of unconjugated bilirubin were detected in the stool of normal persons (4 +/- 3 % of total <b>bile</b> <b>pigments),</b> higher amounts were found in patients with Crigler-Najjar disease (20 +/- 12 &).

40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>pigments,</b> {{including}} bilirubin and biliverdin are tetrapyrrolic, dicarboxylic acids {{capable of}} forming conjugates at their propionic acid groups via ester or amide bonds. They possess substantial antioxidant and anti-mutagenic activities and therefore their intestinal absorption might influence {{the development of}} cardiovascular disease and cancer. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether altering the physico-chemical properties of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> would improve their permeability in an in vitro assay of absorption. Native and synthetically modified <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> were tested for gastrointestinal permeability and metabolic stability using the Caco- 2 cell line. In addition, a gross measure of their toxic effects was tested in a red blood cell co-incubation assay. The apparent permeability of unconjugated bilirubin (1), bilirubin ditaurate (2) and biliverdin (3) through Caco- 2 cell monolayers was determined to be 10. 4 +/- 1. 2 x 10 (- 7), 35. 2 +/- 3. 4 x 10 (- 7) and 37. 0 +/- 1. 6 x 10 (- 7) cm/s (mean +/- SD), respectively, while biliverdin diglucosamine (4), and biliverdin dioctylamine (5) were impermeable. Unconjugated bilirubin, biliverdin, bilirubin ditaurate and biliverdin diglucosamine did not decompose when incubated in Caco- 2 cell homogenates, whereas biliverdin dioctylamine decomposed over time. Only unconjugated bilirubin showed toxicity towards red blood cells (>= 1000 mu M), an effect that was abolished by the addition of 40 g/L serum albumin. The data presented here suggest that <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> are absorbed across the Caco- 2 cell monolayer and that conjugation of biliverdin to hydrophilic or lipophilic moieties decreases their absorption and can reduce their metabolic stability. In summary, exogenous bilirubin and biliverdin supplements could be absorbed across the intestinal epithelium in vivo and potentially increase circulating concentrations of these antioxidant compounds.

40|$|AbstractBilirubin (BR) and biliverdin (BV), two {{metabolites}} {{produced during}} haem degradation by haem oxygenase, possess strong antioxidant activities toward peroxyl radical, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide. Considering the importance attributed to nitric oxide (NO) and its congeners {{in the control}} of physiological and pathophysiological processes, we examined the interaction of BR and BV with NO and NO-related species in vitro. Exposure of BR and BV to agents that release NO or nitroxyl resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent loss of BR and BV, as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. Peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant derived from the reaction of NO with superoxide anion, also showed high reactivity toward BR and BV. The extent of BR and BV consumption largely depended on the NO species being analysed and on the half-lives of the pharmacological compounds considered. Of major importance, BR and BV decomposition occurred also {{in the presence of}} pure NO under anaerobic conditions, confirming the ability of <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> to scavenge the gaseous free radical. Increasing concentrations of thiols prevented BR consumption by nitroxyl, indicating that <b>bile</b> <b>pigments</b> and thiol groups can compete and/or synergise the cellular defence against NO-related species.
