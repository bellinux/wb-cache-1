Though praziquantel is often better at treating tapeworm infections, albendazole is used more often in endemic countries due to being cheaper and having a broader spectrum.|$|R
50|$|Tapeworm {{eggs are}} {{generally}} ingested through food, water or soil contaminated with human or animal (host) faeces. For example, if a pig is infected with a tapeworm, it may pass eggs or segments (proglottids) {{of the adult}} tapeworm through its faeces into soil. Each segment contains thousands of microscopic tapeworm eggs. These eggs can be ingested via food contaminated with the faeces. Once the eggs have been ingested, they develop into larvae, which can migrate out of the intestines and form cysts in other tissues such as the lungs or liver. This type of infection is not common with <b>beef</b> or fish <b>tapeworms,</b> but can occur with the pork tapeworm — called cysticercosis — and can also occur with dog and sheep tapeworms — called echinococcosis.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish {{that there is a}} very significant difference between intestinal human tapeworm infection and human coenurosis. Humans are the definitive hosts for some tapeworm species, the most common being T. saginata and T. solium (<b>beef</b> and pork <b>tapeworms).</b> This means that these species can develop into full grown, reproductively capable adult worms within the human body. People infected with these species have a tapeworm infection. In contrast, the four species that cause human coenurosis can only grow into mature, reproductively capable worms inside their definitive hosts, canids such as dogs, wolves, foxes and coyotes. Humans who ingest eggs from any of these four species of Taenia become intermediate hosts, or places where the eggs can mature into larvae but not into adult worms. When humans ingest these eggs, the eggs develop into tapeworm larvae that group within cysts known as coenuri, which {{can be seen in the}} central nervous system, muscles, and subcutaneous tissues of infected humans. People with coenurosis do not develop a tapeworm infection because the larvae of coenurosis-causing parasites cannot develop into worms inside of humans.|$|R
5000|$|The Taeniidae [...] are {{a family}} of flatworms. It is the largest family {{representing}} the order Cyclophyllidea. It includes many tapeworms of medical and veterinary importance, as Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (<b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm),</b> and Echinococcus granulosus. The Taeniidae are parasites of mammals and many are infectious to humans.|$|E

Taeniasis with T solium can lead to neurocysticercosis and threaten others by accidental ingestion of eggs released from asymptomatic Taeniasis patients. The 2003 World Health Assembly declared that T solium is of worldwide public-health importance, {{and that it is}} an eradicable parasitic disease worldwide. Adult taeniid tapeworms expelled from people in almost all Asian countries appeared to be T saginata (the so-called Asian Taenia), even though they ate pork. The organism is now named T asiatica, and has been found in Taiwan, Korea, China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. But it has been difficult to differentiate T saginata from beef and Asian Taenia from pork. STARTING POINT: Marshall Lightowlers and colleagues (Int J Parasitol 2003; 33 : 1207 - 17) recently demonstrated that recombinant oncosphere vaccines against several taeniid cestodes, including T ovis, T saginata, T solium, and Echinococcus granulosus, are highly effective. Protection was almost 100 %, in the laboratory and in the field. These researchers found several common features, including a predicted secretory signal sequence, and one or two copies of a fibronectin type III domain, each encoded by separate exons within the associated gene. WHERE NEXT? Molecular and immunological techniques, including vaccine research and development of animal models for differentiation of taeniid species in humans, have greatly advanced over the past decade. The clinical importance of infections by these taeniids, including T asiatica, in humans, and the potential for cysticercosis attributable to T asiatica in humans, needs further study...|$|R
50|$|Taeniasis is a {{parasitic}} disease due to infection with tapeworms {{belonging to the}} genus Taenia. The two most important human pathogens in the genus are Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (the <b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm).</b> The third species Taenia asiatica is found only in East Asia. Taeniasis is generally asymptomatic, but severe infection causes weight loss, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headaches, nausea, constipation, chronic indigestion, and loss of appetite.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the most}} common {{tapeworms}} in humans are the pork tapeworm (T. solium), the <b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm</b> (T. saginata), the fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium spp.), and the dwarf tapeworm (Hymenolepis spp.). Infections involving the pork and beef tapeworms are also called taeniasis. Tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus infect and cause the most harm to intermediate hosts such as sheep and cattle. Infection {{with this type of}} tapeworm is referred to as Echinococcosis or hydatid disease. Symptoms vary widely, as do treatment options, and these issues are discussed in detail in the individual articles on each worm. With a few notable exceptions like the fish tapeworm, most cestodes that infect humans and livestock are cyclophyllids, and can be identified as such by the presence of four suckers on their scolex or head.|$|E
5000|$|Cysticercus was {{discovered}} in the late 17th century CE as a parasitic bladder. It {{was believed to be}} a different organism from the adult tapeworm (Taenia solium), but still closely related to tapeworms for their similarly-looking scolex. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time another German Johann Zeder had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of Taenia solium as Cysticercus cellulosae, that of <b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm</b> (T. sanginata) as Cysticercus bovis, that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as Cysticercus ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as Cysticercus tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as Cysticercus longicollis. Even though, this system of naming is now scientifically unacceptable, it is still widely used, particularly for description of the infections by the different species.|$|E
50|$|Taenia saginata (synonym Taeniarhynchus saginata), {{commonly}} known as the <b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> is a zoonotic tapeworm belonging to the order Cyclophyllidea and genus Taenia. It is an intestinal parasite in humans causing taeniasis (a type of helminthiasis) and cysticercosis in cattle. Cattle are the intermediate hosts, where larval development occurs, while humans are definitive hosts harbouring the adult worms. It is found globally and most prevalently where cattle are raised and beef is consumed. It is relatively common in Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America. Humans are generally infected as a result of eating raw or undercooked beef which contains the infective larvae, called cysticerci. As hermaphrodites, each body segment called proglottid has complete sets of both male and female reproductive systems. Thus, reproduction is by self-fertilisation. From humans, embryonated eggs, called oncospheres, are released with faeces and are transmitted to cattle through contaminated fodder. Oncospheres develop inside muscle, liver, and lungs of cattle into infective cysticerci.|$|E
50|$|Taenia asiatica, {{commonly}} known as Asian taenia or Asian tapeworm, is a parasitic tapeworm of humans and pigs. It {{is one of the}} three species of Taenia infecting humans and causes taeniasis. Discovered only in 1980s from Taiwan and other East Asian countries as an unusual species, it is so notoriously similar to Taenia saginata, the <b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> that it was for a time regarded as a slightly different strain. But anomaly arose as the tapeworm is not of cattle origin, but of pigs. Morphological details also showed significant variations, such as presence of rostellar hooks, shorter body, and less number of body segments. The scientific name designated was then Asian T. saginata. But the taxonomic consensus turns out to be that it is a unique species. It was in 1993 that two Korean parasitologists, Keeseon S. Eom and Han Jong Rim, provided the biological bases for classifying it into a separate species. The use of mitochondrial genome sequence and molecular phylogeny in the late 2000s established the taxonomic status.|$|E

Niclosamide and praziquantel have proved effective for its treatment but treatment failures are well known. We report herein the results of nitazoxanide therapy. MethodsA prospective {{study was conducted in}} 18 children and 34 adults to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide in the treatment of niclosamide- and praziquantel-resistant T. saginata infection. Nitazoxanide was administered twice daily for 3 days in 500 -mg doses for those aged over 14 years and at 20 mg/kg body weight/day in children aged 5 – 14 years. Post-treatment follow-up was undertaken at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks for fecal samples for proglottides, and to check the presence, number, and viability of Taenia eggs. ResultsNitazoxanide cured 51 of 52 (98. 1 %) patients. Mild side effects occurred in seven patients, which resolved spontaneously. There were no abnormalities in laboratory parameters.

40|$|AuthorThe main aim of {{this study}} is to {{overview}} the past and present situations of human taeniases and cysticercosis in Indonesia and including future perspectives. Through joint projects from 1996, we have confirmed the occurrence of Taenia saginata (<b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm)</b> in Bali, of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) mainly in Papua and sporadically in Bali, and of Taenia asiatica in North Sumatra. These taeniases were caused through eating uncooked pork and pig viscera for T. solium and T. asiatica, respectively, and beef for T. saginata. The distribution of these tapeworms in Indonesia is basically highly restricted by the traditional cultural and religious backgrounds in each island. T. saginata is relatively common in Bali although people consume pork 'lawar' more than beef 'lawar'. Taeniases due to T. saginata or T. asiatica and T. solium and cysticercosis due to T. solium have also been sporadically reported in some other islands. Among these species, T. solium is exceptional since humans can be infected not only by larval stages (cysticerci) in pork but also by eggs released from human tapeworm carriers. Cysticercosis has been confirmed in Indonesia in humans, pigs and even dogs...|$|E

The Agricultural Resource Council (ARC) has found an ingenious way to overcome their clients´ reading difficulties - ´Infotoons´, or information cartoons. The Infotoons convey basic agricultural principles and offer guidelines for farmers, novices and children with different reading abilities. The strips are available in various formats: on CD-ROM, which also offers additional information on crop and livestock production for commercial farmers, in book form, and on the [URL] ARC website. The Infotoons are crisp and straightforward, explaining one subject at a time. Small livestock farmers can learn how to prepare fresh goat´s milk, for example, or how to slaughter their animals for meat.

40|$|Background: The Taenia solium cysticercosis-taeniasis {{complex is}} a Neglected Tropical Disease of {{significant}} public health importance in many impoverished communities worldwide. The parasite is suspected to be endemic in Lao PDR {{as a result}} of widespread risk factors including open human defecation, free ranging pigs and weak systems for meat inspection and carcass condemnation. Reported prevalences of human taeniasis throughout the country have ranged from 0 - 14 %, although few of these have definitively diagnosed T. solium, grossly indistinguishable from Taenia saginata (<b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm)</b> and Taenia asiatica. This short communication details the suspicion of a hyper endemic "hotspot" of T. solium in a remote Tai Dam village in northern Lao PDR. Findings. Initial antibody serosurveillance of four provinces in Lao PDR in 2011 indicated human taeniasis and cysticercosis prevalences of 46. 7 % and 66. 7 % respectively, in the village of Om Phalong in the north of the country. Subsequent copro-antigen ELISA on 92 human faecal samples from this same village, representing a total 27. 9 % of the target community, indicated a taeniasis prevalence of 26. 1 % (95 % CI?=? 18. 2 - 35. 9). Subsequent PCR and sequencing of samples (n?=? 5) all identified as T. solium; the other human tapeworms T. saginata and T. asiatica were not detected in any of the samples genotyped. Conclusion: This is potentially one of the highest documented prevalences of T. solium taeniasis to date in Lao PDR, if not the Southeast Asia region. This result raises suspicion that other "hotspots" of T. solium hyper endemicity may exist in the region, particularly in communities where the consumption of raw pork is commonplace {{as a result of}} cultural practices...|$|E
40|$|Intruder Noodles. Taenias are {{intestinal}} parasites of the phylum Platyhelminthes. They {{affect a}} large number of individuals, even now in the XXI century. The main species are Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (<b>beef</b> <b>tapeworm).</b> The etymology of the term Taenia is from Greek origin meaning strip or tape. It is estimated that there are approximately 2. 5 million people affected by T. solium worldwide and 77 million by T. saginata, including 32 million in Africa. Worms are large, flat, ribbon-shaped and segmented. T. solium is two to four meters in length but may reach eight meters. T. saginata, is fatter and heavier and is four to l 4 meters in length and, in extreme cases, may reach 25 meters. They can live for 25 to 30 years. As adults, they are composed of a fixative stalk (rostrum, head or scolex) and a tape shaped body, composed of a chain of segments called proglottides. T. solium is also called armed tapeworm because it contains a double crown of hooks on the rostrum. T. saginata is said to be disarmed for not having thorns 4. In general, perhaps due to some immunological factors, the individual is parasitized by only one specimen, so it explains the term “solitary”. A professor of parasitology brought a tapeworm for demonstration into the classroom. Immediately, a student said: It looks like noodles. In fact, the comparison of the appearance between tapeworms and noodles- pasta made from flour and eggs, cut into long flat thin strips- has some didactic value and is quoted in various educational sources 1, 2. My wife Zaíra, in a timely and happy inspiration, created the title above: “Intruder Noodles”, because the tapeworm parasite is persona non grata to the intestines and is never welcome to its definitive host, which, unfortunately, is the human being. The infection of individuals is recognized by almost daily elimination of proglottides mixed with the feces (T. solium) or through evacuation...|$|E
