5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E

25|$|O. bauri {{have the}} fastest moving predatory {{appendages}} within the animal kingdom. After stimulation {{of one of}} the four trigger hairs, the appendage will respond within 10ms. It has peak speeds of , with the jaws closing within just 130 microseconds on average. This is about 2300 times faster than the <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> an eye. The peak force exerted was in the order of 300 times the body weight of the ant. The ants were also observed using their jaws as catapults to eject intruders or fling themselves backwards to escape a threat.|$|E
25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina. A transient increase of only 10 °C can destroy retinal photoreceptor cells. If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within {{a fraction of a}} second, literally faster than the <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> an eye. Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near infrared range (400-1400nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to laser radiation with wavelengths less than 400nm and greater than 1400nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{observation}} of an intermediate state in the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> single CdSe/CdS core-shell nanocrystals. This state has a low quantum yield and connects the "on" and "off" states commonly observed in the photoluminescence <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> Individual nanocrystals. We find that the transitions between these two emitting states follow nearly single-exponential statistics. The transitions from the "on" state to this intermediate state result from changes in the surface passivation of the nanocrystal. The data are consistent with photoinduced, adsorption/desorption events that {{take place at the}} surface of the nanocrystals. The trion state leads to a reduction in photoluminescence in nanocrystals...|$|R

40|$|In imaging {{applications}} the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> {{quantum dots}} is an ambiguous phenomenon. Although unwanted in conventional imaging, <b>blinking</b> is <b>of</b> significant relevance for super-resolution microscopy. Recent studies report on excitation-wavelength dependent quantum dot blinking, while other studies do not observe this effect. To investigate this disagreement we have systematically studied {{the effect of}} the excitation wavelength on <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots that are commonly used in imaging applications. We recorded single quantum dot intensity traces for 14 different excitation wavelengths and determined for each excitation wavelength the probability to find short- (0. 5 s) lasting bright state periods. This represents a systematic study of a larger set of excitation wavelengths than heretofore reported in the literature. For the quantum dots analyzed, we find minor variations in blinking with excitation wavelength. These variations do not follow a trend and do not correlate with features in the absorbance spectrum of the quantum dots. Our results show that in practice changing the excitation wavelength for CdSe/ZnS quantum dots does not allow optimization <b>of</b> <b>blinking</b> for e. g. super-resolution microscopy and that the effect <b>of</b> <b>blinking</b> as a function of excitation wavelength is not a salient parameter in imaging applications...|$|R

40|$|A long-standing {{debate in}} the {{literature}} is whether attention can form two or more independent spatial foci {{in addition to the}} well-known unique spatial focus. There is evidence that voluntary visual attention divides in space. The possibility that this also occurs for automatic visual attention was investigated here. Thirty-six female volunteers were tested. In each trial, a prime stimulus was presented in the left or right visual hemifield. This stimulus was characterized by the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> a superior, middle or inferior ring, the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> all these rings, or the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> the superior and inferior rings. A target stimulus to which the volunteer should respond with the same side hand or a target stimulus to which she should not respond was presented 100 ms later in a primed location, a location between two primed locations or a location in the contralateral hemifield. Reaction time to the positive target stimulus in a primed location was consistently shorter than reaction time in the horizontally corresponding contralateral location. This attentional effect was significantly smaller or absent when the positive target stimulus appeared in the middle location after the double prime stimulus. These results suggest that automatic visual attention can focus on two separate locations simultaneously, to some extent sparing the region in between. CNPqFINE...|$|R
500|$|Musically, {{the band}} {{regarded}} the album as a 'new progression'. Bassist Nathan Cochran said that [...] "It’s not a sharp left turn; it’s a step beyond what we’ve ever done.

[...] "Here with Me" [...] has a musical vibe similar to alternative rock band Coldplay. [...] "Homesick" [...] is a ballad featuring strings from the London Symphony Orchestra.

In both these different systems, the <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> single molecules is found to obey analogous power-law statistics for both the on and off periods. The observed range for single-molecular power-law blinking extends over the full experimental time window, covering four orders of magnitude in time and six orders of magnitude in probability density. From molecule to molecule, we observe a large spread in off-time power-law exponents. The distributions of off-exponents in both systems are markedly different whereas both on-exponent distributions appear similar. Our results are consistent with models that ascribe the power-law behavior to charge separation and (environment-dependent) recombination by electron tunneling to a dynamic distribution of charge acceptors. As a consequence of power-law statistics, single molecule properties like the total number of emitted photons display non-ergodicity...|$|R
