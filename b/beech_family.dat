5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} on dead leaves {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the <b>beech</b> <b>family</b> (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E

The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the <b>beech</b> <b>family.</b> Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E

50|$|By 1850 Ripley Township's black {{population}} {{had declined to}} 349 persons. In subsequent decades the trend continued, especially after 1870, when only 268 African Americans remained in the neighborhood. Fewer than six <b>Beech</b> <b>families</b> remained by 1920. Most of Indiana's black rural settlements, including Beech Settlement, no longer exist.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1900s the community's {{population}} had significantly diminished, {{primarily due to}} the increasing costs of farming and the migration of the settlers' descendants to larger cities and towns to find better-paying jobs. When the Beech community's school and church closed between 1900 and 1910, the settlement no longer functioned as a farming community. Fewer than six <b>Beech</b> <b>families</b> remained by 1920. Sanford Hill, the last African American farming in Ripley Township, died in 1955. Beech's friends and the descendants of its former residents hold annual reunions.|$|R

5000|$|Beech Settlement [...] was a rural {{settlement}} in Ripley Township, Rush County, Indiana. Its early settlers were free {{people of color}} (most of them migrated from eastern North Carolina and Virginia) and {{a small number of}} free blacks, who came to the area with Quakers. Beech was one of Indiana's early black {{rural settlement}}s and also one of its largest. The rural neighborhood received it name because of a large stand of beech trees in its vicinity. By 1835 the farming community had a population of 400 residents, but largely due to changing economic conditions, including rising costs of farming, the settlement's population began to decline after 1870. Fewer than six of the <b>Beech</b> <b>families</b> remained by 1920. As with most of Indiana's black rural settlements, Beech Settlement no longer exists. Few major points of interest remain; however, the community's Mount Pleasant Beech Church serves as the site for annual reunions of its friends and the descendants of former residents.|$|R

40|$|The Basilicata {{region has}} a {{consistent}} forest heritage, its predominant specie being the Quercus Cerris (Turkish Oak). Since many years, {{the activities of}} the La. Te. C. (Laboratory of Technology of the Constructions) of the D. A. P. I. T. (Department of Architecture, Planning and Infrastructures of Transport) in the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Basilicata are focused on the realization of products in wood modified by hygro-thermal conditioning of Quercus Cerris, and particularly of elements in laminated wood for structural use. The Quercus Cerris wood shows some defects and a known difficulty of workmanship, both resolved by the definition of a protocol of treatment of the Quercus Cerris glued laminated timber, regarding the application of specific methods of thermo-hygrometric conditioning. Further tests of breaking strength performed on the material, after its modification, have highlighted its considerable mechanical strength: in fact, obtained results from the laminated wood are worthy of it being a Fagacea (<b>beech</b> tree <b>family),</b> and about four times as much as common laminated timber obtained from resinous ones. The research performed till now has shown the great interest on the use of “conditioned” Quercus Cerris to tackle the problems set by the recovery and the restoration of buildings in the historical centres, specially interventions concerning floors and trussed roofs. The high strength of the material makes it able to solve the problems of historical structures: the replacement of damaged load-bearing wooden elements with Quercus Cerris laminated timber, keeping the size of the section, allows to quintuple load charges. The laminated timber of “conditioned” Quercus Cerris may also be used in innovative structures as wooden floors of a new design, able to perform the role of linking structure and booster of structural masonry, in deformable and not indefinitely rigid way. In particular, models of intervention and abaci were developed for sizing and verification of reticular slabs in wood of conditioned Quercus Cerris, that, thanks to the modest dimension, can be contained in the thickness of the slabs, and are particularly suitable for use in anti-seismic structures...|$|R

60|$|One {{early summer}} morning a {{possible}} explanation suggested itself. I was sitting quietly by the brook, {{on the edge of}} the big woods, waiting for a pool to grow quiet, out of which I had just taken a trout and in which I suspected there was a larger one hiding. As I waited a mother-grouse and her brood--one of the old <b>beech</b> partridge's numerous <b>families</b> for whom he provided nothing--came gliding along the edge of the woods. They had come to drink, evidently, but not from the brook. A sweeter draught than that was waiting for their coming. The dew was still clinging to the grass blades; here and there a drop hung from a leaf point, flashing like a diamond in the early light. And the little partridges, cheeping, gliding, whistling among the drooping stems, would raise their little bills for each shining dewdrop that attracted them, and drink it down and run with glad little pipings and gurglings to the next drop that flashed an invitation from its bending grass blade. The old mother walked sedately in the midst of them, now fussing over a laggard, now clucking them all together in an eager, chirping, jumping little crowd, each one struggling to be first in at the death of a fat slug she had discovered on the underside of a leaf; and anon reaching herself for a dewdrop that hung too high for their drinking. So they passed by within a few yards, a shy, wild, happy little family, and disappeared into the shadow of the big woods.|$|R
