40|$|Abstract: Recently {{reported}} SEER data revealing {{an increase}} in the number of younger women who present with advanced <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> at diagnosis has led to much speculation regarding epidemiological factors that play a role in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>and</b> that may be modifiable by lifestyle. Molecular genomics has identified biological pathways that affect <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> prognosis <b>and</b> inform treatment decisions. Depending on menopausal status <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> subtype, evidence is emerging that lifestyle could be implicated not only in the risk for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> but also outcomes following <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> diagnosis. Several biologic mechanisms have been explored explaining the physiologic role of lifestyle <b>and</b> <b>cancer</b> risk <b>and</b> survival. In this report, we explore the interaction between lifestyle, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> phenotype, <b>and</b> outcomes and review potential molecular mechanisms linking lifestyle to risk and prognosis in order to establish a platform for future exploration.

40|$|<b>Breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is a {{heterogeneous}} disease characterized by multiple genetic alterations {{leading to the}} activation of growth factor signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation. Platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) is overexpressed in various malignancies; however, the involvement of PDGF-C in <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> the mechanisms underlying PDGF-C deregulation remain unclear. Here, we show that PDGF-C is overexpressed in clinical <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> correlates with poor prognosis. PDGF-C up-regulation was mediated by the human embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like protein HuR, which stabilizes the PDGF-C transcript by binding to two predicted AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3 '-untranslated region (3 '-UTR). HuR is up-regulated in hydrogen peroxide-treated or ultraviolet-irradiated <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. Clinically, HuR levels are correlated with PDGF-C expression and histological grade or pathological tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) stage. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying HuR-mediated <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> progression, <b>and</b> suggest that HuR and PDGF-C are potential molecular candidates for targeted therapy of <b>breast</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if there is a statistically and clinically significant difference in diagnostic performance (<b>cancer</b> diagnosis) <b>and</b> perceptual performance (microcalcification detection) when detecting left-sided or right-sided <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> microcalcifications. Methods: Eight radiologist readers (8 – 20 years experience in radiology, five current BreastScreen readers) read a set of 100 digital mammograms (23 / 100 had proven malignancies and 52 / 100 had confirmed microcalcifications) for three reads (random case order in each read). The same mammograms were presented on two reads, serving as the baseline reads. The data from these reads were used to calculate intra-observer variability (presented in an earlier study). The experimental read consisted of left–right mirror images of the original mammograms. In each read, the radiologists were requested to ‘clear’ or ‘call-back’ cases and to indicate if any microcalcifications (benign and malignant) were present on the mammograms. Reading conditions were standardised. Results: Comparison of intra-reader performance difference for left-sided versus right-sided <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> microcalcifications with intra-observer variability for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> microcalcification detection, respectively, revealed no clinically significant difference between left-sided and right-sided detections. Per-case analysis showed more left-sided <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> microcalcifications correctly detected. This left–right difference in detection did not reach statistical significance, P-value of 0. 28 for <b>cancer</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> 0. 74 for microcalcification detection. Conclusion: There is no statistically or clinically significant difference between left-sided <b>and</b> right-sided <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> microcalcification detection in a group of experienced radiologists. Individual reading patterns do not affect detection rates of left-sided <b>and</b> right-sided <b>cancers</b> <b>and</b> microcalcifications...|$|R
