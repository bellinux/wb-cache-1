25|$|Most modern {{railways}} use continuous {{welded rail}} (CWR), {{sometimes referred to as}} ribbon rails. In this form of track, the rails are welded together by utilising flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924 and the US in 1930 and has become common on main lines since the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of <b>welding</b> material possible. <b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as submerged-arc welding, due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation. Because of this necessity, <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> can be utilized for their simplistic design to be fed through automated welding machines efficiently.|$|R
40|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>weld</b> {{connection}} {{is one of}} the most commonly used connection types in steel structures, and its post-fire mechanical property is crucial for the estimation of the residual mechanical capacity of steel structures after building fires. To study the mechanical properties of <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> connections after being exposed to high temperatures, Q 235 and Q 345 <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens were designed, heated to various high temperatures between 400 °C and 800 °C, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Tensile tests were conducted on these <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens to obtain the force–displacement curves and relevant mechanical properties (yield and ultimate strengths) at various temperatures. The following conclusions were obtained from the test results: (1) The post-fire mechanical properties of the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens were affected by material grade and heating temperature; (2) when the temperature exceeded 600 °C, the yield and ultimate strengths of the Q 235 and Q 345 <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens began to decrease; the strength reduction of the latter was greater than that of the former; (3) when the temperature was 800 °C, the yield strength and ultimate strength of Q 235 decreased to 87 % and 91 % of the ambient-temperature yield and ultimate strengths, respectively; and (4) the yield and ultimate strengths of Q 345 decreased to 83 % and 87 % of those at room temperature. Computational formulas for the yield and ultimate strengths of the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens at high temperatures were also fitted and verified with test data to provide a safety evaluation method for steel structures after a fire...|$|R

The mechanical properties of the weld seam have been tested and the metallurgical structures have been analyzed. Conclusions have been obtained as follows: the metallurgical structure of multi-layer <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> is {{much more complicated than}} the monolayer ones; only the last weld layer has the obvious zones of weld zone, heat-affected zone (HAZ) and fusion area; the weld zone and the fusion area will be heat treated with the next layers weld finished; the mechanical property of the multi-layer <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> is much better than the monolayer weld determined by the corresponding organization...|$|R
2500|$|The {{preferred}} {{process of}} flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> involves an automated track-laying machine running a strong electrical current through the touching ends of two unjoined pieces of rail.

There have been incidents recently where cracking {{has been observed}} in the dissimilar metal weld. Weld-induced residual stress is main factor for crack growth, and thus, exact estimation of welding residual stress is important. For investigations of welding residual stress profile, the effects of geometric variables, i. e. the thickness and the radius of the nozzle {{and the length of}} the safe end, on welding residual stresses, are systematically considered and elastic-plastic thermo-mechanical finite element analyses are conducted.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective {{of the study was}} to examine factors that influence the strength of <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> and gain an understanding of the process of failure. The study was divided into several sectors. The first and primary part of the programme was to determine the extent to which the pipe system's long-term strength under both internal fluctuating and constant pressure is reduced by the presence of axially misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> The second objective was to examine fracture initiation sites and crack propagation paths of the failed aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> samples in relation to the melt flow zone and the weld bead in order to establish the cause of failure. Finally the project considered the influence of selected welding parameters on the fatigue performance of aligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> and an investigation into the influence of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing technique on the basic material's properties. Fatigue and stress-rupture lifetimes were found to decrease significantly with increasing axial misalignment at the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> in 63, 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipe systems at 79 °C in a water environment. In the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> having axial misalignment of 20 per cent of the wall thickness and above, the reduction in the fatigue and stress-rupture lifetime was greater than 50 per cent compared to the aligned weld. It was not clear whether there is a pipe size effect or not; there was no marked change in the fatigue performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> for the three pipe diameters examined. However, the fatigue performance of the aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm was noticeably better compared to 63 mm pipe systems. The stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipes was more than halved compared to those in 63 mm pipe systems. Both the fatigue and stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> could be explained in terms of amplified axial stress and in general, the Ory expression for evaluating the increase in axial stress due to misalignment appears to be valid. The temperature dependence of the fatigue performance of aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> in 63 and 90 mm MDPE pipe systems suggests that if continuous internal fluctuating pressure under the conditions examined is maintained, then the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> with axial misalignment of below 10 per cent of the wall thickness may well meet the design lifetime of 50 years at the service termperature. Under stress-rupture conditions, all the misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> considered in the three pipe diameters surpassed the minimum specified requirement of 170 hours at 79 °C. The fatigue was the most aggresive condition of the two for minor misalignment. Examination of the circumferential <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> failures revealed that the crack invariably initiated from the notch located at the inner weld bead and no preferred crack propagation path was taken in relation to the melt flow zone. It was proved that the notch was responsible for the observed circumferential failure of aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 63 mm MDPE pipes by testing these <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> where the internal weld bead was machined off. The failure site for the internal weld bead machined off sample was in the pipe remote from the weld inferring that the material in the melt flow zone does not constitute any weakness. The effect of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing in 63 mm HDPE pipe was found to increase the density (and crystallinity) signifying a slow annealing process in the material. However, the changes in these parameters were not of sufficient scale to strongly influence the performance. The main effect of elevated temperature testing in water environment appears to be the extraction of stabiliser from the base polymer as was indicated by the rapid decrease in oxidation induction time with the ageing times.

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of 25 mm aluminium-alloy {{full and}} partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> were investigated. Strain controlled fatigue {{tests of the}} 5083 aluminium-alloy base and 5183 weld metal were carried out to determine the monotonic and cyclic stress-strain properties. Crack propagation measurements were performed using center crack tension specimens. The weldments were tested under axial loading for R= 0 and - 1. For the full-penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack initiated at the weld toe, while for the partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack started at the weld root. The high stress concentration at the weld root decreases the fatigue strength of the welds with UP {{as compared to the}} full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> In presence of a tensile mean stress, the fatigue life is significantly shorter than under fully reversed loading. An analytical model was used to predict the lifetime of the weldments. The total lifetime is composed of crack initiation and crack propagation. Because of the high stress concentration at the weld root the period of crack initiation is negligible for the weldments with UP. The lifetime based on crack propagation can be simply described using the geometry factor of the center crack tension specimen. Considering of the extra material provided by the weld reinforcement is suggested. The model predictions agreed with the experimental results for the full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> While for R= 0, the most lifetime was spent in crack initiation (and small crack growth), for R=- 1 the relative amount of crack propagation is more dominant due to crack closure under compressive loading...|$|R
