5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> without free will, {{he argued that the}} possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault {{on the part of the}} agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
25|$|A craft unionist {{might argue}} the miners would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{sticking}} {{to their own}} business. After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed. But Haywood took away from this experience the conviction that labor needed more, not less, industrial unionism. The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E
25|$|When liberal Guadalupe Victoria {{became the}} first {{president}} of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better {{in the eyes of the}} Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. General Santa Anna was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the Mexican–American War (1846–48) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.|$|E

25|$|Domitius was Consul in 32 and {{appointed}} by Tiberius as a commissioner in early 37. His son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, later Emperor Nero, {{was born on}} 15 December 37 in Antium. According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends {{for the birth of}} his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero's reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if Nero's father had married someone more like the castrated boy.|$|E
25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E
25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied not on his own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership of the Christian coalition was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E

25|$|Shares in Eurotunnel {{were issued}} at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price {{had risen to}} £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during {{demonstration}} runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{if it had not}} been constructed.|$|E
25|$|Venables {{was signed}} by Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £80,000, and made his debut for the club in a North London derby defeat to Arsenal on 9 May 1966. His bad start to life at White Hart Lane {{continued}} when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on {{to have a good}} 1966–67 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2–1 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Ironically, earlier in the season Venables had bet £25 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out £500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the £500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; in fact after tax deductions, Venables would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> financially if Chelsea had won.|$|E

GameTrailers criticized the limited roster size, stating that the tag-based battling felt underdeveloped as a result. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer pointed out the lack of online features, such as a spectator mode, replays, and endless lobbies. Jordan Mallory of Joystiq reprimanded the game for its [...] "goofy and immature" [...] premise, sexualized art style, and unoriginal character movesets. Mallory concluded that the series would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> spending another year in development.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] for Tor.com, and {{admitted}} that he hadn't seen the episode since the original broadcast. He said that it was a [...] "trainwreck" [...] and even worse than he remembered, because other shows such as [...] and Stargate SG-1 had since done much better clip shows. DeCandido summed it up by saying that [...] "In all honesty, they’d have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> doing one fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike anyhow — and upping the budget on one of the other 21. Just an awful, awful episode." [...] He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten. Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V.

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if he never met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb. Before Homer can even answer what happened, Grampa remarks to Homer that he knew [...] "he'd blow it", and leaves in the cab he just arrived in, rather than getting in the car {{with the rest of the}} Simpson family.|$|E

500|$|An October 1981 {{review in}} Rolling Stone called the concert [...] "one {{of the finest}} {{performances}} of [...] ", one that [...] "vividly recaptured another time, an era when well-crafted, melodic pop bore meanings that stretched beyond the musical sphere and into the realms of culture and politics." [...] This reviewer noted that Garfunkel's voice was noticeably restrained in high passages, though still harmonious, and that the evening's only weak spot was the [...] "Kodachrome"/"Maybellene" [...] medley, because neither singer could raise the right level of emotion for the rock songs. A Billboard reviewer wrote in March 1982, [...] "This 19 song, two record set gloriously recaptures the past with sterling renditions {{of most of the}} duo's classics as well as a few of Simon's solo compositions filled out by Garfunkel's harmony." [...] However, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice dismissed the album as [...] "a corporate boondoggle—a classy way for Warner Bros. artist Simon to rerecord, rerelease, and resell the catalogue CBS is sitting on." [...] He felt Simon had <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> without Garfunkel since 1971 and quipped, [...] "live doubles are live doubles, nostalgia is nostalgia, wimps are wimps, and who needs any of 'em?" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opened to}} mixed feedback, and aired {{back-to-back}} with [...] "Good Mourning", as a two-hour season premiere special.

That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away." [...] Sepinwall also praised Wilson's, Ramirez's, and Chamber's performances.|$|E

Eremenko was {{positive}} towards the album's [...] "meticulously arranged music, and multiple stylistic layers {{ensure that the}} record does not wear thin {{after the first few}} listens". However, he furthered stated, [...] "but although Rock'n'Roll Circus is a testament to veritable professional skills of Hamasaki and her producers and songwriters, its emotional power is questionable, to put it mildly." [...] Although criticizing the album's addition of J-pop music, its additional [...] "clichés", and labelling the ballads as the [...] "worst offenders on the album", he concluded, [...] "This is Hamasaki's eleventh album, and so song writing routine is to be expected, to a degree, but she would have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> going all the way with the alt-rock gimmick instead of meekly complying with the already trite conventions of J-pop, even if she had created those herself." [...] Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was mixed in his review. Although he commended Hamasaki's transition to rock music and her song writing, he said he became [...] "worried" [...] about the production and found it regressive in comparison to Next Level.|$|E
