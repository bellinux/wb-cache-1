25|$|With stores mainly {{based in}} the North of England, the newly focused food retail group {{expanded}} further south in 1989 by buying the large format stores of rival Gateway Superstores for £705million. City estimates suggested that Asda had overpaid by around £300 million for 61 of the largest Gateway stores, two undeveloped store sites and a distribution centre. That was far above the net book value of the locations {{some of which were}} poorly sited. Asda has subsequently relocated or rebuilt more than 30 of the original Gateway stores since the late 1990s. This move overstretched the company and by 1991, it found itself in serious financial trouble and saddled with £1 billion worth of debt The situation was so dire Asda was close to breaching its banking covenants and came very close to bankruptcy. The city at that point widely regarded Asda as a <b>basket</b> <b>case</b> and predicted an early demise for the chain. As a result, it was forced to raise money from shareholders in both 1991, and 1993, through two major rights issues. Asda was back in the black by late 1993, and completely transformed and revived by 1995, {{in one of the most}} successful turnaround stories in British retail history under the leadership of Archie Norman, who later became a front bench Conservative MP. CEO from 1991, Norman was chairman of the company during the period 1996–99, and remodelled the store along the lines of the world's largest retailer, Walmart, sending protégé Allan Leighton to Bentonville, Arkansas to assess and photograph the systems and marketing deployed by Walmart.|$|E

40|$|Geographical Education Magazine article. Reports {{of chronic}} food shortages, {{malnutrition}} and famines in many Developing Countries are frequent. Food production is very low, in fact {{so low that}} these countries {{have come to be}} referred as international <b>basket</b> <b>cases</b> - implying that they are recipients of massive international food aid. The problem therefore is how to provide enough food to the starving and underfed millions of humanity inhabiting poor countries. Food aid is inadequate and cannot be relied upon indefinitely as it contains numerous political strings which reduce the dignity and self-reliance of the recipient country. Food productivity has to increase within the Developing Countries themselves. For a time, the Green Revolution which started in the countries of South East Asia was believed {{by many to be the}} long awaited messiah of poor countries especially in view of its 'miracle’ seeds which in some areas boosted productivity by at least a hundred fold. Disillusionment with the Green Revolution has largely come about because of its failure to boost productivity of the majority of the poorest rural farmers and its tendency to increase the affluence of the already affluent. Why has this been so? Are there any lessons for Africa and if there are, how do they affect the chances of an African Green Revolution...|$|R

40|$|Like it or not, {{knowing how}} {{to make use of}} online tools without being {{overloaded}} with too much information is an essential ingredient to personal success in the twenty-first century. But how can we use digital media so that they make us empowered participants rather than passive receivers, grounded, well-rounded people rather than multitasking <b>basket</b> <b>cases?</b> In Net Smart, cyberculture expert Howard Rheingold shows us how to use social media intelligently, humanely, and, above all, mindfully. Mindful use of digital media means thinking about what we are doing, cultivating an ongoing inner inquiry into how we want to spend our time. Rheingold outlines five fundamental digital literacies, online skills that will help us do this: attention, participation, collaboration, critical consumption of information (or "crap detection"), and network smarts. He explains how attention works, and how we can use our attention to focus on the tiny relevant portion of the incoming tsunami of information. He describes the quality of participation that empowers the best of the bloggers, netizens, tweeters, and other online community participants; he examines how successful online collaborative enterprises contribute new knowledge to the world in new ways; and he teaches us a lesson on networks and network building. Rheingold points out that there is a bigger social issue at work in digital literacy, one that goes beyond personal empowerment. If we combine our individual efforts wisely, it could produce a more thoughtful society: countless small acts like publishing a Web page or sharing a link could add up to a public good that enriches everybody...|$|R
