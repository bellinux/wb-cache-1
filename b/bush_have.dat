500|$|The {{flight deck}} is angled at nine degrees, {{which allows for}} {{aircraft}} to be launched and recovered simultaneously. This angle of the flight deck was reduced slightly in relation to previous carriers, as the current design improves the air flow around the carrier. Four steam catapults are used to launch fixed-wing aircraft, and four arrestor wires are used for recovery. The two newest carriers, [...] Ronald Reagan and George H.W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>have</b> only three arrestor wires each, as the fourth was used infrequently on earlier ships and was therefore deemed unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>have</b> been given [...] authority to negotiate trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN takes is a result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E

The ADL's amicus brief pointed out that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) requires courts to [...] "apply a strict standard for reviewing laws that substantially burden religious exercise." [...] The United States Department of Justice also submitted an amicus brief to support the county's position. As well as reiterating the requirements of RLUIPA, the Justice Department's brief affirmed that Islam was protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and emphasized that mosques should be treated no differently from churches or synagogues. The local U.S. Attorney, Jerry Martin, commented that the suggestion by the plaintiffs that Islam was not a religion was [...] "quite simply ridiculous." [...] He told a press conference that [...] "ll three branches of government have repeatedly recognized Islam as a religion.

2500|$|Many {{political}} {{leaders who have}} maintained some form of One-China Policy have committed slips of the tongue in referring to Taiwan as a country or as the Republic of China. [...] United States presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>have</b> been known to have referred to Taiwan as a country during their terms of office. [...] Although {{near the end of}} his term as U.S. Secretary of State, Colin Powell said that Taiwan is not a state, he referred to Taiwan as the Republic of China twice during a testimony to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 9 March 2001. [...] In the People's Republic of China Premier Zhu Rongji's farewell speech to the National People's Congress, Zhu accidentally referred to Mainland China and Taiwan as two countries. [...] There are also those from the PRC who informally refer to Taiwan as a country. [...] South Africa delegates once referred to Taiwan as the [...] "Republic of Taiwan" [...] during Lee Teng-hui's term as President of the ROC. In 2002, Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, referred to Taiwan as a country. [...] Most recently, former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated in a local Chinese newspaper in California in July 2005 that Taiwan is [...] "a sovereign nation". The People's Republic of China discovered the statement about three months after it was made.|$|E
2500|$|One of Congress's {{foremost}} non-legislative functions is {{the power}} to investigate and oversee the executive branch. Congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by Congress's subpoena power. Some critics have charged that Congress has in some instances failed to do an adequate job of overseeing the other branches of government. In the Plame affair, critics including Representative Henry A. Waxman charged that Congress was not doing an adequate job of oversight in this case. There have been concerns about congressional oversight of executive actions such as warrantless wiretapping, although others respond that Congress did investigate the legality of presidential decisions. Political scientists Ornstein and Mann suggested that oversight functions do not help members of Congress win reelection. Congress also has the exclusive power of removal, allowing impeachment and removal of the president, federal judges and other federal officers. There have been charges that presidents acting under {{the doctrine of the}} unitary executive have assumed important legislative and budgetary powers that should belong to Congress. So-called signing statements are one way in which a president can [...] "tip the balance of power between Congress and the White House a little more in favor of the executive branch," [...] according to one account. Past presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>have</b> made public statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it, and commentators including the American Bar Association have described this practice as against the spirit of the Constitution. There have been concerns that presidential authority to cope with financial crises is eclipsing the power of Congress. In 2008, George F. Will called the Capitol building a [...] "tomb for the antiquated idea that the legislative branch matters." ...|$|E

60|$|Most {{of us are}} {{familiar}} with the sumac-bush, which grows nearly all over the United States.
