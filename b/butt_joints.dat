40|$|The fatigue {{properties}} of welded <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> and base metal of MB 8 magnesium alloy were investigated. The comparative fatigue tests {{were carried out}} using EHF-EM 200 K 2 - 070 - 1 A fatigue testing machine for both welded <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> and base metal specimens with {{the same size and}} shape. The fatigue fractures were observed and analyzed by a scanning electron microscope of 6360 LA type. The experimental results show that the fatigue performance of the welded <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> of MB 8 magnesium alloy is sharply decreased. The conditional fatigue limit (1 × 10 7) of base metal and welded <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> is about 69. 41 and 32. 76  MPa, respectively. The conditional fatigue limit (1 × 10 7) of the welded <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> is 47. 2  % of that of base metal. The main reasons are that the welding can lead to stress concentration in the weld toe area, tensile welding residual stress in the welded joint, as well as grain coarsening in the welding seam.

This thesis explores arc weld theory to develop ideal submarine hull <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> designs and recommends preliminary testing {{to be used to}} develop improved <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> welding procedures at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Pulsed gas metal arc welding (GMAW-P) is the ideal process for shipboard hull welding applications, theoretically. <b>Butt</b> <b>joint</b> samples were created using HY- 80 steel plate so that the following comparisons could be made: 90 %Ar- 10 %CO 2 versus 95 %Ar- 5 %CO 2 shielding gases and their effect upon weld penetration, Miller brand versus Lincoln Electric brand power supply synergic GMAW-P algorithm performance, and Single-V versus Double-V <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> design.

30|$|The use of low-grade logs {{to build}} spirally wound {{laminated}} veneer lumber (LVL) has been studied and improved {{from the point of}} view of the gluing process, fiber orientation angle, and end joint of the LVL. The <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> appears to be the fracture point when the column is submitted to a compressive or bending load. Owing to the complexity of cylindrical LVL, we used a finite element method to simulate the mechanical behavior of part of its wall. This part was small enough to be considered flat but was representative of the structure, especially in the area of the <b>butt</b> <b>joint.</b> This allowed us to test the validity of different settings of the parameters involved in the manufacturing process. To feed data for this model, we used the results established for the linear and nonlinear behavior of raw hinoki in Part I of this series of articles. We then used this numerical model to improve the quality of the <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> by testing different settings of the joint. We show that reducing the <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> gap under 0.5 mm, which requires only a few changes in the production line, provides an important increase in the modulus of upture and nonnegligible improvement of the modulus of elasticity compared to that for a ≥ 1 mm <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> gap.|$|R

As a result, corresponding to fatigue life of = 2 × 106, the mean values of fatigue limit for corner <b>joint</b> and <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> are evaluated to be 162. 7 MPa and 173. 7 MPa, respectively.

50|$|There {{are many}} types of butt welds, but all fall within one of these categories: single welded <b>butt</b> <b>joints,</b> double welded butt joint, and open or closed <b>butt</b> <b>joints.</b> A single welded butt joint is the name for a joint that has only been welded from one side. A double welded butt joint is created when the weld has been welded from both sides. With double welding, the depths of each weld can vary slightly. A closed weld {{is a type of}} joint in which the two pieces that will be joined are {{touching}} during the welding process. An open weld is the joint type where the two pieces have a small gap in between them during the welding process.|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal joint quality control/assurance is {{essential}} to the successful performance of asphalt pavements and it has received considerable amount of attention in recent years. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the level of compaction at the longitudinal joint and determine the effect of segregation on the longitudinal joint performance. Five paving projects with the use of traditional <b>butt</b> <b>joint,</b> infrared joint heater, edge restraint by milling and modified <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> with the hot pinch longitudinal joint construction techniques were selected in this study. For each project, field density and permeability tests were made and cores from the pavement were obtained for in-lab permeability, air void and indirect tensile strength. Asphalt content and gradations were also obtained to determine the joint segregation. In general, this study finds that the minimum required joint density should be around 90. 0 % of the theoretical maximum density based on the AASHTO T 166 method. The restrained-edge by milling and <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> with the infrared heat treatment construction methods both create the joint density higher than this 90. 0 % limit.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to try and understand hypercompressor packing ring failures better with a view of ultimately reducing or even eliminating their occurrences. In order to gain further understanding of packing ring failures, we seek to obtain an appreciation of the stresses they experience during operation. First we consider a conventional simulation of an axisymmetric packing ring and cup subjected to the typical pressure loading conditions experienced by these components when installed in a hypercompressor cylinder. The key locations of interest are along the bimaterial interface, and in particular at the ends of the interface. These ends effectively represent a <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> in contact and a <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> under pressure. To begin to gain an appreciation of the stresses at these locations, we undertake a finite element analysis (FEA) of the configuration with traditional interface and contact conditions. Unfortunately the traditional analysis does not produce stresses that appear to converge at either end as judged by simple convergence checks. As is indicated by previous research, a singularity is expected to occur at the <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> under pressure, and thus diverging stresses. However, for the <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> in contact the situation is les...|$|R
