50|$|The elk live on {{the north}} shore of the lake at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hull</b> Mountain, and enjoy wild clovers and grasses, along with the green summer and fall foliage around Lake Pillsbury's edges. Mendocino National Forest and Los Padres National Forest are the only two {{national}} forests in California to have tule elk. There is a 10-day hunting season beginning on the second Wednesday in September each year.|$|E

50|$|Moon pool - An {{opening in}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> giving access to the water below, {{allowing}} access to the sea. Similar to wet porch.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, {{construction}} {{work of a}} modern commerce harbour in Fort de France uncovered the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> Amphitrite. Copper sheets <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> and other fragments were recovered and are now {{on display at the}} Service Régional de l'Archéologie.|$|R
5000|$|... "Deadrise" [...] {{refers to}} the line rising upward {{horizontally}} from the keel rabbet (the point where {{the top of the}} keel connects to the hull) to the chine (or sideboards). It rises {{on each side of the}} keel in a straight line, or [...] "dead rise," [...] creating the flat V shape <b>of</b> the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> The <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> is planked in a herring bone pattern with planks running diagonally from keel to chine. The sides are planked longitudinally. As a result, it is both useful in shallows and very forgiving when the Bay turns rough.|$|R
50|$|Draft- Vertical {{distance}} between the water line and the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the vessel <b>hull.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} [...] "bulb" [...] or [...] "can" [...] seen {{on top of}} the Akula's rudder houses its towed sonar array, when retracted. Most Akulas {{have the}} SOCKS hydrodynamic sensors, which detect changes in temperature and salinity. They are located on {{the leading edge of the}} sail, on the outer hull casing in front of the sail and on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> forward <b>of</b> the sail. All Akulas have two T-shaped doors on the aft <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> on either side. These are where the OK-300 auxiliary propulsion devices are located, which can propel the submarine at up to 5 kn.|$|R
50|$|The borough's name {{derives from}} an {{incident}} in March 1817, {{in which a woman}} was saved from a wrecked ship that had flipped over, after her rescuers used axes to cut through the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} {{through the}} Suez she was refitted, and the rivets in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> {{that had been}} worn by repeated landings were replaced in drydock. She finally returned to England in 1947 via Malta and Gibraltar.|$|R
2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this {{is provided by}} the structural keel, which projects from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed keels, including full keels, long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs. Deep-draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions ...|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{designed}} with a hydraulic-actuated bow with transom flaps, designed to aid hull skimming {{across the surface}} of the water. When activated the bow and transom flaps form a planing surface with the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> allowing the vehicle to go faster because hydrodynamic drag is reduced on the vehicle's hull.|$|R
50|$|Some diving {{support vessels}} have an opening through the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> called a {{moonpool}} to facilitate diver deployment. This {{is usually the}} part of the vessel with the least vertical motion in a seaway, which makes launch and recovery of the bell or stage easier, safer and more comfortable for the divers.|$|R
5|$|On 27 August 1928, Kommandøren ran aground at Opdalseldet in Bårdsundet off Tysnesøy Hordaland; she was refloated {{after all}} 350 {{passengers}} {{had been taken}} off. She ran aground yet again in April 1938, when she ran into the island Segløya while en route from Skjerjehamn to Eivindvik. The incident caused severe damage to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ancient bilge force pumps had {{a number}} of common uses. Depending on where the pump was located in the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the ship, it could be used to suck in sea water into a live fish tank to {{preserve}} fish until the ship was docked and the fish ready to be sold. Another use of the force pump was to combat fires. Water would again be sucked in through the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> and then pumped onto the blaze. Yet another suggested use for a force pump was to dispel water from a ship. The pump would be placed near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> so as to suck water out of the ship. Force pumps were used on land as well. They could be used to bring water up from a well or to fill high placed tanks so that water could be pressure pumped from these tanks. These tanks were for household use and/or small-scale irrigation. The force pump was portable and could therefore, as on ships, be used to fight fire.|$|R
50|$|The armour on the Bulat can {{withstand}} direct hits from 7.62 mm calibre weapons. The vehicle features prominent, high angled armour to deflect bullets and artillery shell shrapnel, in addition {{it features a}} V-shaped hull to increase protection against mines and IEDs, the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> can resist explosions equivalent to 1 kg of TNT. The Bulat is also fitted with mine resistant seats.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other clipper ships {{of the day}} she was {{constructed}} from wood and with three masts. Also in common with other clipper ships of the day her hull was painted black, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> lined with copper. Her black hull can be clearly seen, and the copper can just be seen above the waves in an 1858 painting by James E. Buttersworth.|$|R
50|$|On 17 September 1914, {{she sank}} during a storm off Portland Bill {{with the loss}} of 21 of her crew of 64. She was being towed from Portsmouth to Scapa Flow where she was to act as a {{receiving}} ship for seamen newly mobilised for World War I. She now lies upside down with the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> about 164 ft below sea level.|$|R
50|$|Hulls {{have several}} elements. The bow is the {{foremost}} part <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel {{is at the}} very <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> extending {{the entire length of the}} ship. The rear part <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a ship's rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.|$|R
25|$|The {{anodised}} duralumin fuselage {{was mounted}} below the lower wing, with the planing <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> made <b>of</b> stainless steel (as on the Singapore II) with a transverse main step. The use {{of stainless steel}} reduced the frequency of land inspections <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> The bimetallic corrosion problems experienced on the Singapore II hull had been solved; Short Brothers became the first company to master the technique of building seaplane floats and flying boat hulls in this combination of metals.|$|R
50|$|The {{components}} <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> {{were shipped}} out from Ontario in 19 freight cars. The hull itself {{was divided into}} 20 watertight compartments, and to allow as shallow a draft as possible, the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> was almost perfectly flat. The compound steam engines were highly efficient and had been employed in many ships, but {{they had never been}} used before on a sternwheeler. Bonningtons sternwheel was 25.0 ft in diameter and had 20 buckets, which was the steamboat word for paddles.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} {{protection}} also usually varies considerably throughout the individual vehicle too, depending {{on the role of}} the vehicle and the likely direction of attack. For example, a main battle tank will usually have the heaviest armour on the hull front and the turret, lighter armour on the sides <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> and the thinnest armour on the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the tank. Other vehicles - such as the MRAP family - may be primarily armoured against the threat from IEDs and so will have heavy, sloped armour on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
25|$|Based on ethnographic evidence, it {{is assumed}} that this kind of log could be cut by the use of some {{primitive}} stone or iron tools, but mostly by the use of controlled fire. After the log was cut, it was transported (moved on wooden rollers) to the construction site. At the site, work generally had to start from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> and followed by shaping the hull sides.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{earliest}} hulls were simple logs, {{but these were}} generally unstable and tended to roll over easily. Hollowing out the logs into a dugout canoe doesn't help much unless the hollow section penetrates below the log's center of buoyancy, then a load carried low in the cavity actually stabilizes the craft. Adding weight or ballast to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> or {{as low as possible}} within the hull adds stability.|$|R
5000|$|Among other innovations, Penn Yan {{was known}} for its {{patented}} [...] "Tunnel Drive" [...] concept, whereby a cavity was molded into the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the boat's <b>hull,</b> partially enclosing the propeller and drive shaft. [...] The tunnel drive system provided better boat speed and stability.|$|R
40|$|Methods <b>of</b> {{designing}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> ship’s <b>hulls</b> {{were only a}} small part of the process of building a frame-based ship in Portugal in the 16 th and early 17 th centuries, but they deserve a careful look. Using a number of geometric algorithms that were already well-known to Italian shipwrights of the 15 th century, Portuguese shipwrights obtained the co-ordinates of the turn of the bilge points of the central, pre-designed, frames without the need for making drawings...|$|R
50|$|Sealed-hull (unsinkable) craft were {{developed}} for leisure use, as derivatives of surfboards (e.g. paddle or wave skis), or for surf conditions. Variants include planing surf craft, touring kayaks, and sea marathon kayaks. Increasingly, manufacturers build leisure 'sit-on-top' variants of extreme sports craft, typically using polyethylene to ensure strength and affordability,often with a skeg for directional stability. Water that enters the cockpit drains out through scupper holes—tubes that {{run from the}} cockpit to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For example, if a {{boat with}} an LPS of 120 degrees rolls past this point, i.e. its mast is already {{at an angle}} of 30 degrees below the water, it will {{continue}} to roll and be completely upside down in the water. [...] Except for dinghy sailboats and multihulls, most larger sailboats (monohull keelboats) have lead or other heavy materials in their keel at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> their <b>hulls</b> to keep them from capsizing or turtling.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} when Clasper was {{starting}} to design racing boats, the standard boat <b>hull</b> was constructed <b>of</b> a number of strakes (or planks), with a keel projecting from <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> Together with Matthew Taylor, another Tyneside boat-builder, he worked to reduce the surface area and drag. They did this by placing the keel inside the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the boat and constructing the hull with a single strake on each side. The surface would then be given several coats of varnish to give as smooth a finish as possible.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the Type 63 is {{composed}} of welded rolled steel. The hull is 11 millimetres thick at the front, 14 millimetres thick at the upper sides and 10 millimetres thick at the rear. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull</b> are both 10 millimetres thick. This gives it protection against 7.62 mm calibre small arms fire and small artillery shell fragments, {{but it is not}} sufficient to protect from either heavy machine gun fire and bigger artillery shell fragments. The tracks aren't protected by any armour and are easily damaged.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Eckener {{rejected}} the idea that hydrogen could have been ignited by an engine backfire, postulating that the hydrogen {{could not have been}} ignited by any exhaust because the temperature is too low to ignite the hydrogen. The ignition temperature for hydrogen is 500 C, but the sparks from the exhaust only reach 250 C. The Zeppelin Company also carried out extensive tests and hydrogen had never ignited. Additionally, the fire was first seen {{at the top of the}} airship, not near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During 1958-1959, Baya was {{completely}} reworked at Mare Island Naval Shipyard to test LORAD, an experimental long-range sonar. The forward torpedo tubes were removed {{and replaced by}} a blunt bow with a mushroom anchor in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b> A 23 ft section was added between the former Forward Torpedo Room and the Forward Battery compartment, with quarters for twelve scientists. These modifications increased her overall length to 330 ft, and her submerged displacement to approximately 2,600 tons. Her maximum speed was reduced to 10.5 kn.http://www.subnet.com/FLEET/ss318.htm ...|$|R
5000|$|Chines - Are {{the abrupt}} change of angle where the topside meets the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> a <b>hull.</b> In a power or fast sail boat the chine deflect spray down wards when the hull is {{travelling}} at speed. A multi chine hull has 4 or more chines to allow an approximation of a round bottomed shape using flat panels. It also {{refers to the}} longitudinal structural members inside the hull which support the edges of these panels. Traditionally these were called chine logs especially in Eastern USA.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Heron has a Portsmouth Yardstick of 1346 when sailed single handed. In the US Sailing scheme {{it has a}} D-PN of 120.0.The Heron {{has been}} a popular {{entry-level}} sailing dinghy, due largely to its high level of stability. The craft design features hard chines. These are sharp angles between the sides and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hull,</b> giving it great stability even in rough weather conditions. This {{makes it easier for}} a relative novice to avoid capsizing. A round-hulled craft requires a lot more skill to keep upright.|$|R
