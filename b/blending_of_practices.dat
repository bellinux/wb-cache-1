We believe advocates of NLEs should consider the literature and research base indicating effective instruction {{is not based on}} a forced dichotomy between theoretical perspectives, but rather a thoughtful, pragmatic <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> <b>practices</b> based on evidence gained from various perspectives and lines of research. While unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are popular and intuitively appealing, these approaches ignore substantial evidence indicating these approaches are less effective and less efficient than instructional approaches that incorporate guidance of the learning process that is faded as internal guidance is developed (Kirschner et al., Educ Psychol 41 : 75 – 86, 2006). We illustrate how integrating evidence from multiple theoretical perspectives leads to the development of more powerful approaches to learning and instruction through a review of the premises, evolution, and research behind Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD) in the area of writing...|$|E

40|$|Communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> {{that occur}} {{naturally}} within an organisation enable the members to learn through participation in practice together (Lave & Wenger, 1991). However, when a community lacks expertise in 21 st century practices, learning these skills through shared practice becomes difficult. E-learning is often marketed {{as if the}} tools were easy to adopt and adapt, but effective professional development is required to support educators in learning to employ e-learning tools in their practice. Research shows that effective professional development is timely, relevant, flexible, and often collaborative in nature with examples <b>of</b> good <b>practice.</b> The research presented in this thesis describes the design and implementation of professional development which supports a community of practitioners in building the expertise to incorporate e-learning within its professional practice. The research was informed by {{a comprehensive review of}} literature on professional development, with a focus on the area of e-learning, the theory behind the communities <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> concept, and the application of that theory. A design-based methodology was employed to gather data from a range of sources of evidence, over two years, in four iterative cycles of collaborative design, implementation, evaluation and redesign. The context in which the research took place was a small educational organisation with an average of twenty staff members over the duration of the study. This staged implementation of an online environment, designed in collaboration with the community, supported the development <b>of</b> a <b>blended</b> community <b>of</b> online <b>practice</b> and provided timely, relevant professional development in e-learning. Analysis of the research findings produced two instruments: (1) a matrix of strategies for enabling and supporting the development <b>of</b> a <b>blended</b> community <b>of</b> online <b>practice,</b> and (2) a heuristic model to guide the investigation of the learning taking place within the online aspect <b>of</b> a <b>blended</b> community <b>of</b> online <b>practice.</b> These instruments are recommended to designers, developers or researchers supporting the development <b>of</b> a <b>blended</b> community <b>of</b> online <b>practice</b> and the professional development taking place in its online environment...|$|R

Originality/value - First, HRM practices used by emerging economy MNCs in an advanced economy have been identified. Second, the results suggest that MNCs from emerging economies behave differently from MNCs from developed countries such as Japan, the USA and Western European countries. Past research shows that MNCs from advanced economies such as Japanese MNCs in the UK tend to transplant the ideas and <b>practices</b> <b>of</b> so-called excellent human resource management systems from their own parent companies. However, Taiwanese MNCs deliberately adopt a varied HR approach to operate in an advanced economy as a result of dual pressures of home and host country effect.

Two research phases were conducted to collect data through a snapshot survey of all 100 Taiwanese MNCs and four case study subsidiaries. Results of survey show that a <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>practices</b> has been adopted by the subsidiaries, ranging from emulating home country practices, adapting host country practices, and a melange of home and host country <b>practices.</b> Evidences <b>of</b> the four case studies indicated that HQ's high controlling power and pull force from host country' cultural and institutional environments as well as working experiences and power held by actors within organisations are the main driving forces during the transferring process. This findings of this research support the convergence and divergence theory both in macro and micro levels. Moreover, this research rapports the arguments of literature {{on the evolution of}} international management in MNCs and that on the comparative study of national economic systems, called for by Westney (1999). Also, evidence revealed that nationally determined patterns of MNC behaviour is constant but diminishing - at time rapidly. Therefore, Taiwanese MNCs are the late corners for the internationalization production and employment, having seeking ways to accommodating to pressures from competitive international environment, borrowing more westernized HRM practices from pre-existing models of international operation.

40|$|Today, modern {{computers}} {{are based on}} digital technology. However, during the decades after 1940, digital computers were complemented by the separate technology of analog computing. But what was analog computing, what were its merits, and who were its users? This thesis investigates the conceptual and technological history of analog computing. As a concept, analog computing represents the entwinement of a complex pre-history of meanings, including calculation, modelling, continuity and analogy. These themes are not only landmarks of analog's etymology, but also represent the <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> <b>practices,</b> ways <b>of</b> thinking, and social ties that together comprise an `analog culture'. The {{first half of this}} thesis identifies how the history of this technology can be understood in terms of the two parallel themes of calculation and modelling. Structuring the history around these themes demonstrates that technologies associated with modelling have less representation in the historiography. Basing the investigation around modelling applications, the thesis investigates the formation of analog culture. The second half of this thesis applies the themes of modelling and information generation to understand analog use in context. Through looking at examples of analog use in academic research, oil reservoir modelling, aeronautical design, and meteorology, the thesis explores why certain communities used analog and considers the relationship between analog and digital in these contexts. This study demonstrates that analog modelling is an example of information generation rather than information processing. Rather than focusing on the categories of analog and digital, it is argued that future historical scholarship in this field should give greater prominence to the more general theme of modelling.
