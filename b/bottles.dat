5|$|Before {{technology}} in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter {{of the northern}} German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low alcohol content. According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall, tapered, and green hock <b>bottles.</b> Similar <b>bottles,</b> although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.|$|E

5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water <b>bottles.</b> Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving <b>bottles</b> became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke <b>bottles</b> whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico <b>bottles.</b> After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws {{have learned}} to peck open the foil caps of milk <b>bottles</b> left on the doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from <b>bottles</b> which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking <b>bottles</b> in future.|$|E
50|$|The label {{must also}} include {{the name and address}} of the <b>bottler</b> of the wine. If the {{producer}} is not the <b>bottler,</b> the <b>bottle</b> will say that the wine was <b>bottled</b> by X <b>bottled</b> for Y producer. Table wines may carry the name of the <b>bottler</b> and the postal code. The label must {{also include the}} country of origin.|$|R

5|$|In 2006, Sara Lee {{spun off}} its {{clothing}} sector into HanesBrands Inc., which now runs the Playtex apparel business. The next year Playtex Products acquired the Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen company for $83 million. Later that year Playtex Products {{was acquired by}} Energizer Holdings for $1.16 billion. Playtex Products was sued in 2008, when a mother accused the company of not adequately disclosing their baby <b>bottles</b> contained bisphenol A. After Canada considered banning the chemical, the company took it out of their <b>bottles</b> the following year. In 2008, Playtex Products was acquired by Energizer Holdings.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>bottling</b> {{agreement}} between Coca Cola {{and an independent}} <b>bottler</b> was in 1899 between the company and two young attorneys from Chattanooga. After being joined by a John T. Lupton, they divided their <b>bottling</b> rights among territories in the States. As a result, efficiency and <b>bottle</b> quality improved. By 1909, Coca Cola had almost 400 <b>bottling</b> operations, however; {{most of them were}} family-owned <b>bottling</b> plants.|$|R
5|$|In the Summer of 1917, {{businessman}} R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Works began purchasing Grapico syrup barrels from J. Grossman's Sons to <b>bottle</b> {{and sell}} the Alabama soft drink market. In that same year, Laurel, Mississippi based Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Company also became a wholesale customer of J. Grossman's Sons and began <b>bottling</b> and selling Grapico in Mississippi. In 1918, Rochell's Grapico <b>Bottling</b> Works opened a <b>bottling</b> plant in Hattiesburg, Mississippi as a second Mississippi <b>bottler</b> and seller of Grapico.|$|R
50|$|Water <b>bottle</b> {{flipping}} involves {{taking a}} plastic water <b>bottle</b> that is partially empty and holding {{it by the}} neck of the <b>bottle.</b> Force is applied with a flick, with the bottom of the <b>bottle</b> rotating away from the person. If performed successfully, the <b>bottle</b> will land upright. Additionally, the <b>bottle</b> may land upside-down, or on its cap. Doing this is significantly more difficult than flipping a <b>bottle</b> so it lands upright. The amount of fluid in the <b>bottle</b> greatly influences the success of the feat, and it has been shown empirically that filling the <b>bottle</b> about one-third of the way improves the rate of success. The type of water <b>bottle</b> also plays a role; for instance, the brand Deer Park Spring Water has been noted to make the task easier due to its unique hourglass shape with a third divot.|$|R

5|$|Investigators' suspicions {{began to}} turn to Stella Nickell when they {{discovered}} that she claimed that the two contaminated Excedrin <b>bottles</b> that she had turned over to police had been purchased at different times and different locations. A total of five <b>bottles</b> had {{been found to be}} contaminated in the entire country, and it was regarded as suspicious that Nickell would happen to have acquired two of them purely by chance.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} Polish Horseshoes is {{to knock the}} glass <b>bottle</b> off the stake either by hitting it {{directly}} or by hitting the stake. If the disc hits the stake and the <b>bottle</b> is knocked off, then 1 point is scored unless the <b>bottle</b> is caught before it hits the ground. If the disc hits the <b>bottle</b> directly and the <b>bottle</b> is knocked off, then 2 points are scored if the <b>bottle</b> hits the ground and only 1 point if the <b>bottle</b> is caught before it hits the ground.|$|R

5|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A record in worldwide shipping of Champagne (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million <b>bottles</b> {{was set in}} 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million <b>bottles.</b> Since the entire vineyard area authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now planted, various ways of expanding the production have been considered. The allowed yield was increased (to a maximum of 15,500kg per hectare during an experimental period from 2007 to 2011) {{and the possibility of}} revising the production region was investigated.|$|E

5|$|Apothecaries' {{measures}} eventually {{fell out}} of use in the UK and were officially abolished in 1971. In the US, they are still occasionally used, for example with prescribed medicine being sold in four ounce (℥ iv) <b>bottles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{are widely}} used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, {{embedded}} in resin, displayed in <b>bottles,</b> laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings.

5000|$|The <b>bottle</b> is styled after a Victorian rum <b>bottle,</b> {{with two}} hoop handles {{based on the}} {{tradition}} of hanging a <b>bottle</b> to prevent breakages.

The <b>bottle's</b> back label states that it is [...] "imported rum from the Caribbean blended with natural flavors." ...|$|R
50|$|Scoring examples: If a thrower {{hits the}} <b>bottle</b> {{directly}} and the defenders fail to catch both the <b>bottle</b> and the disc, the throwing team earns 3 points, {{one for the}} <b>bottle</b> hitting the ground, one for the disc hitting the ground, and one for hitting the <b>bottle</b> directly. If the defending team catches both the <b>bottle</b> and the disc, the throwing team only gets the 1 point (for hitting the <b>bottle).</b> If the disc hits the stake rather than the <b>bottle,</b> then 1 point is scored for each object that hits the ground (the <b>bottle</b> and/or the disc). If the defending team catches both, then no points are scored. If the <b>bottle</b> is not dislodged, but the receiving team fails to catch the disc, the throwing team gets 1 point.|$|R
5000|$|Michelob is a 4.7% ABV pale lager {{developed}} by Adolphus Busch in 1896 as a [...] "draught beer for connoisseurs". In 1961, Anheuser-Busch produced a pasteurized version of Michelob which allowed legal shipment {{of the beer}} across state lines. <b>Bottled</b> beer began to be shipped soon after, and the brand was introduced in cans in 1966. <b>Bottled</b> Michelob was originally sold in a uniquely shaped <b>bottle</b> named the teardrop <b>bottle</b> because it resembled a water droplet. The teardrop <b>bottle</b> was awarded a medal from the Institute of Design in 1962. Five years later the <b>bottle</b> was redesigned for efficiency in the production line. This <b>bottle</b> was used until 2002 when it was dropped {{in favor of a}} traditional <b>bottle.</b> The teardrop <b>bottle</b> was used again from January 2007 to October 2008.|$|R
