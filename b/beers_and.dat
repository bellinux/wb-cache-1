5|$|In many societies, beer is {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer. Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> food pairings.|$|E
5|$|The De Beers company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. De Beers is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De <b>Beers</b> <b>and</b> markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De <b>Beers</b> <b>and</b> its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De Beers, but by 2001–2009 the figure had decreased to around 45%, and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% in value terms and even less by volume. De Beers sold off {{the vast majority of}} its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s – early 2000s and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale). This was well documented in the press but remains little known to the general public.|$|E
5|$|While Governor, Edwards' first {{official}} {{role was to}} christen Alan Bond's America Cup challenger, Southern Cross. One of the couple's first visitors to the Governor's estate was {{a man by the}} name of Thomas Dunhill, who had consumed ten <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> wanted to see the house. Lady Edwards apparently found him in the pantry; he was arrested by the police but no charges were laid. Ill health forced Edwards to resign his vice-regal appointment on 2 April 1975, and he and Lady Edwards went to live in Sydney, where he continued in semi-retirement with commercial interests.|$|E

5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De <b>Beers</b> <b>and</b> investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used {{much of the research}} as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer {{producer}} launched a website to tell about {{the making of the}} beer product line and the story of the restoration of the stones. Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian <b>beers,</b> <b>and</b> the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several <b>beers</b> <b>and</b> games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
40|$|Food {{and wine}} pairings are {{commonly}} seen among empirical research. Minimal research exists concerning <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> food pairings, yet food analysts are taking note of {{higher rates of}} <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> food pairings occurring. As such, these exploratory studies examine young adults’, experts’ and novices’ knowledge of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> food pairings along with gender differences and sensory pairing of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> chocolate. A survey was used to identify both subjective and objective knowledge along with a test to determine appropriateness of expert and novice choices. It was found that males had greater objective knowledge of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> food pairing than females, while their subjective scores were similar. Industry experts more accurately paired beers with foods than novices. Another survey was used to identify demographics and how much each pairing was liked or disliked. Results demonstrated that males have a higher overall liking of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> chocolate pairings than females. Despite males liking the pairings more than females, the female sample still rated the pairings in a highly favorable manner. These studies are intended to aid in identifying young adults’ knowledge of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> food pairings, the differences between expert and novice consumer choices and gender differences {{between males and females}} when it comes to sensory pairing of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> food...|$|R

5|$|UNITA's {{ability to}} mine {{diamonds}} {{and sell them}} abroad provided funding for the war to continue even as the movement's support in the Western world and among the local populace withered away. De <b>Beers</b> <b>and</b> Endiama, a state-owned diamond-mining monopoly, signed a contract allowing De Beers to handle Angola's diamond exports in 1990. According to the United Nation's Fowler Report, Joe De Deker, a former stockholder in De Beers, worked {{with the government of}} Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, allegedly flew from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth $6million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's buying office in Antwerp, Belgium. De Beers openly acknowledges spending $500million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions.|$|E
