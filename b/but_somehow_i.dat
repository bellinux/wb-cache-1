During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, [...] "Sweden has a great culture around gaming." [...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011. On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, [...] "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos." [...] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a want to focus on his YouTube career, in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, [...] "Why does everyone get this story wrong? [...] I dropped out of university because I didn't like it. To drop out of university to pursue YouTube, that'd just be fucking stupid." [...] He added that [...] "industrial management and economics [...] boring as hell [...] I couldn't relate to fucking anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. <b>But</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> feel safe." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{face was}} like wax and his stare glassy, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> blind. <b>I</b> read utter exhaustion, but not fear ... Mussolini seemed {{completely}} lacking in will, spiritually dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did I {{tell you}} such things? I don't know. Silly sort of chap, I expect. I suppose I wanted to impress you. <b>But</b> <b>somehow,</b> now, <b>I</b> {{want you to}} know the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. I don't expect smooth {{sailing right}} along, and perhaps I'll fail altogether; <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> don't believe I will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{you know}} how it is in these matters, Miles--somehow, I scarce know why myself, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> feel bloody womanish this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Maud more patiently returned, [...] "I'm {{told all}} sorts of people are now doing {{wonderful}} things; <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> remain outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall mayhap," [...] thus closed that {{precious}} document, [...] "have {{no means}} of ascertaining definitely whether you will act in accordance with this letter. <b>But</b> <b>somehow,</b> Armand, <b>I</b> know that you will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{like to be}} {{away from}} mother," [...] she murmured, shaking her head. [...] "It is not that she is very ill now. <b>But</b> <b>somehow</b> when <b>I</b> am not with her I am more uneasy than ever." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stopped and}} talked {{all the time}} I was there to Irene; <b>but,</b> <b>somehow,</b> {{whatever}} <b>I</b> said, Césarine managed to intercept it, and I caught myself quite guiltily looking at her from time to time, with an inexpressible attraction that I could not account for.|$|R
60|$|I have a {{lot more}} of these repartees that I could insert here if it was necessary. <b>But</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> feel that it is not.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mean it that way--and I don't {{mean that}} she cheats; <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> never {{feel as if}} {{anything}} real came to me direct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes; <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> cannot fancy our Charley doing {{anything}} for grand, sound, musty reasons, such as look well marshalled {{out in a}} letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{then the}} sun was shining down, a-blazing on the little town, A mile or so 'way down the track a-dancing in the sun.

6000|$|... "I {{mean to do}} so. <b>But</b> <b>somehow,</b> {{treated as}} <b>I</b> am here, I am bound to tell my uncle of it first. And I cannot do that while Gregory is so ill." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I know that. <b>But,</b> <b>somehow,</b> <b>I</b> {{thought they}} had it all settled between 'em, and I {{certainly}} like Sam. He's a nice, clean-cut boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kit, {{with a laugh}} she liked. [...] "We're often {{dull and}} our womenfolk have helped us much. <b>But</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> did not expect--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well! it {{was rather}} dreary to see one thing going after another. <b>But</b> <b>somehow,</b> after <b>I</b> lost my own black mare, poor Minnehaha, I never cared so much {{for any of the}} other things. Once for all, I got ashamed of my own childish selfishness. And then, you see, the worse things were, the {{stronger}} the call for exertion. That was the great help.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Semitic, as you see, and {{positively}} appalling. He is entirely mother's choice. He arrived ten {{minutes after the}} evening papers were out, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> or other <b>I</b> don't fancy that we shall make anything of him. It's young Harbord, you know." ...|$|R
5000|$|This is a Southern story, {{with the}} setting {{laid in the}} small Lily of Tarleton, Georgia. Fitzgerald wrote that he had [...] "a {{profound}} affection for Tarleton, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> whenever <b>I</b> write a story about it I receive letters {{from all over the}} South denouncing me in no uncertain terms." [...] Written shortly after his first novel was published, the author also collaborated with his wife on certain scenes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you speak}} to me!" [...] I burst out. It was on my lips to tell him of the letter to Washington, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> kept silent.|$|E

60|$|I did {{not stay}} much longer, for I {{was eager to}} get home and tell my wife about my adventure, which seemed to me of a very rare and thrilling kind. I {{believed}} that if I could present it to her duly, it would interest {{her as much as}} it had interested me. <b>But</b> <b>somehow,</b> as <b>I</b> went on with it in the lamplight of her room, it seemed to lose colour and specific character.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what, Colonel," [...] said he; [...] "we {{have to have}} hands, of course. <b>But</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> wish this {{business}} of slavery had never been started!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but {{she wept}} abundantly. I felt like weeping too, <b>but</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> laughed. She hoped {{he had gone}} to heaven—but—I'm sick of that word 'but'—it is always {{tangling}} one's thoughts." ...|$|E
6000|$|Verrian {{could not}} help laughing. [...] "Well, passionate, then. I don't know why it should be so confoundedly vexatious. <b>But</b> <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> would have chosen Miss Macroyd--Is she {{specially}} dear to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Can’t stop no train now,” {{answered}} the porter. “We’se got to jest catch dem mice <b>somehow,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> dunno how it’s gwine to be done,” he went on, scratching his woolly head in perplexity.|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MIDGETINA,--When {{this will}} reach you, I don't know. <b>But</b> [...] <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> cannot, or rather I can, imagine you the cynosure of the [...] {{complete}} peerage, and prefer that my poor little letter should not [...] uprear its modest {{head in the}} midst of all that Granjer.

6000|$|... "Tell me all," [...] I said, growing stony, yet {{trembling}} {{from head}} to foot. [...] "Oh, Jack,"--I seized his hand,--"I don't know what you mean! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> trust you. <b>I</b> want to know all. I can bear anything--anything--better than this suspense. You MUST tell me! You MUST explain to me!" ...|$|R
