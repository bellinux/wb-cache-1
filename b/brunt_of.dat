Several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were made {{aware that a}} storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm would take a more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> the storm arrived.

5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond.

5|$|Four years later, Godwin {{remarried}} {{and his new}} wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought {{two children}} of her own into the marriage, most significantly—from Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective—Claire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> the attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E
5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this.

Christian was a particular target, always seeming to bear the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> the captain's rages.
