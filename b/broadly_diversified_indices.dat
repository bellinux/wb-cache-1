40|$|Most of {{the papers}} that study the {{distributional}} and fractal properties of financial instruments focus on stock prices or foreign exchange rates. This typically leads to mixed results concerning the distributions of log-returns and some multi-fractal properties of exchange rates, stock prices, and regional indices. This paper uses a well <b>diversified</b> world stock <b>index</b> as the central object of analysis. Such index approximates the growth optimal portfolio, which is demonstrated under the benchmark approach, it is the ideal reference unit for studying basic securities. When denominating this world index in units of a given currency, one measures {{the movements of the}} currency against the entire market. This provides a least disturbed observation of the currency dynamics. In this manner, one can expect to disentangle, e. g., the superposition of the two currencies involved in an exchange rate. This benchmark approach to the empirical analysis of financial data allows us to establish remarkable stylized facts. Most important is the observation that the repeatedly documented multi-fractal appearance of financial time series is very weak and much less pronounced than the deviation of the mono-scaling properties from Brownian-motion type scaling. The generalized Hurst exponent H(2) assumes typical values between 0. 55 and 0. 6. Accordingly, autocorrelations of log-returns decay according to a power law, and the quadratic variation vanishes when going to vanishing observation time step size. Furthermore, one can identify the Student t distribution as the log-return distribution of a well-diversified world stock index for long time horizons when a long enough data series is used for estimation. The study of dependence properties, finally, reveals that jumps at daily horizon originate primarily in the stock market while at 5 min horizon they originate in the foreign exchange market. These results are contrasted with the behavior of foreign exchange rates. The principal message of the empirical analysis is that there is evidence that a diffusion model without multi-scaling could reasonably well model the dynamics of a <b>broadly</b> <b>diversified</b> world stock <b>index.</b> ...|$|R

The results hold for mimicking portfolios based on fund holdings as well as when returns are measured net of expenses.

50|$|Pension funds, {{charitable}} endowments, and sovereign wealth funds {{control over}} $25 trillion in assets worldwide. As investors, these groups share two key attributes: first, they have unusually long time horizons.

Second, the holdings of these investors span every region and sector. They are too big and too <b>broadly</b> <b>diversified</b> to hide from market volatility.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the role}} of institutional characteristics of a country (governance) and the domestic financial system (depth, efficiency, stability, and capital openness) in determinants of emerging market corporate bond spreads issued in international market. We propose an econometric panel data with corporate bond spreads of CEMBI Broad <b>Diversified</b> <b>Index</b> {{in the period of}} 2002 - 2011 to twenty emerging economies. The sovereigns analyzed: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela corresponded to roughly 80 % of CEMBI Broad <b>Diversified</b> <b>Index</b> in July 2013. We conclude that policies that promote financial liberalization, capital openness, fiscal austerity, development of domestic financial system and improve governance institutional characteristics as rule of law and regulatory quality have the potential to reduce emerging market corporate bond spreads, especially in moments of global risk aversion. Results indicate that initiatives looking forward the improvement of institutional government apparatus and capital market development may help emerging market companies to increase the share of private capital investment...|$|R

More important is that they take into account the extent to which fund managers carefully allocate their risk budget across multiple investment strategies and have concentrated holdings in multiple market segments simultaneously.

40|$|Our {{contribution}} to the expanding literature on the globalization of research and innovation is to investigate {{the extent to which}} sector-specific developments in an emerging technology (such as increasing interdisciplinarity and complexity) affect inventive activities developed abroad. We look at how technological diversity and scientific excellence of host countries in the field of nanotechnology affect the development of inventive activities by US multinational companies (MNCs). We identify the most active US-based MNCs in nanotechnology-related patenting and examine location decisions of these companies and their international subsidiaries. Econometric results confirm our hypothesis that technological breadth of host countries positively influence the expected number of inventions developed abroad by US MNCs. S&T capabilities of countries also {{have a positive impact on}} the decision to invent abroad, while the influence of market specific factors is less clear.

40|$|Changes in {{prescription}} drug prices have broad ripple effects across the diverse portfolios that most institutional investors hold. Lower prices cut into pharmaceutical company profits, but improve the overall productivity and profitability of other investable {{sectors of the}} economy. This paper considers the net impact of cuts in drug prices on investor portfolios. We find that falls in pharmaceutical company profits resulting from price cuts would be largely if not fully offset {{by a combination of}} health plan cost-savings and increases in consumer spending power. Furthermore, falling drug prices benefit investors through the dynamic benefits from a healthier workforce with greater access to {{prescription drug}}s. We conclude that, {{from the perspective of the}} <b>broadly</b> <b>diversified</b> "universal investor", support for lower drug prices is consistent with a fiduciary duty to seek attractive long-term returns at the portfolio level.

40|$|Forest cover {{transitions}} {{in the developing}} tropics are conditioned by agricultural change. The expansion, intensification, and diversification of agricultural land uses are tied to regional economic/environmental regimes and decisions of local farming households. Land change science and agrarian systems research share {{an interest in the}} drivers of household strategies, land use impacts, and typologies of those land uses/drivers. This study derives a typology of farming households in southern Mexico based on emergent patterns in their land use combinations and analyzes their household and policy drivers. The results reveal <b>broadly</b> <b>diversified</b> household land use portfolios as well as three emergent clusters of farmstead production orientation: (i) extensive subsistence-oriented conservationists, (ii), dual extensive-intensive farmers, and (iii) nonextensive diversified land users. Household membership in these clusters is uneven and strongly related to tenancy, land endowments, wage labor, and policy subsidies. Although most households are following a nonextensive agricultural strategy incorporating off-farm incomes, the likelihood of a regional forest transition remains debatable because of the disproportionate deforestation impacts of the less common strategies. Conservation development policies in the region need to accommodate diverse smallholder farming rationales, increase off-farm opportunities, and target sustainable development with the assistance of community conservation leaders...|$|R
