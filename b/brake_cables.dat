5|$|Many of {{the band}} members grew up together: Dama, Dadah and Bekoto were playmates and {{attended}} the same primary school; during their secondary school studies, Dadah's older brother Nono likewise became {{a close friend of}} Raoul, the older brother of Dama. The high school offered a music program in which Dadah, Nono, Charle, Bekoto and Fafa participated together, with Fafa as a vocalist and Bekoto as a pianist. Beginning in 1970, Raoul became enamored with the acoustic guitar. He met frequently with Dadah and Nono to play together using guitars he constructed from wood and bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> available at a workshop attached to a center for the deaf and blind where his father worked; the trio began performing at school parties and events. As teens, the trio often listened to a radio show hosted by popular Malagasy journalist and ethnomusicologist Latimer Rangers, who recorded, broadcast and promoted contemporary and traditional music from villages across Madagascar. Rangers also broadcast foreign artists who were relatively unknown to the Malagasy public, such as Bob Dylan, described the meaning and history of the protest song and other foreign genres, and drew connections between Malagasy musical styles and American Blues music, South African music and other genres.|$|E
500|$|The most emblematic {{instrument}} of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither very similar in form {{to those used}} traditionally in Indonesia and the Philippines. The valiha is considered the national {{instrument of}} Madagascar. [...] It is typically tuned to a diatonic mode to produce complex music based on harmonic, parallel thirds accompanied by a melodic bass line. [...] The strings are traditionally cut and raised from the fibrous surface of the bamboo tube itself, although a contemporary form also exists that instead uses bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> for strings to give the instrument a punchier sound.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, Pino Maniaci's car, {{parked outside}} his home, was [...] "doused with gasoline" [...] and set on fire. This episode {{is part of}} what Maniaci claims is a {{constant}} process of threats, which manifests itself in [...] "countless attacks", such as slashed tyres or severed <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the cars he uses and even windscreens shattered by gunshots.|$|E
50|$|A detangler {{is usually}} only {{used for the}} rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b> The front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> can be routed through the stem, via a hollow stem bolt known as a Pott's mod bolt, and fork steer tube to avoid the {{tangling}} problem.|$|R
50|$|Jawa {{motorcycles}} orientated for sidecar use, {{as opposed}} to solo motorcycle use, feature smaller 15 or 16 tooth gearbox sprockets (18 teeth on solo bikes), an attachment on the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> pivot arm for the sidecar's own <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> to attach, a left footrest with an attachment for the sidecar <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> to fit into and modified wiring loom {{at the rear of}} the bike with electrical power coupling for the sidecar's lighting and accessories.|$|R

50|$|The tikit was {{introduced}} in 2007. Early versions of the tikit employed a pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the hyperfold mechanism. This mechanism permitted excessive flex in the handlebar stem when ridden.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{displayed}} innovation as {{the inventor}} of the Posi-Stop <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> guide. The Posi-Stop was a combination seat clamp and caliper <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> guide that was supposed to improve the performance of such brakes. It was later manufactured and sold by Oddessey under the [...] "Pozi-Stop" [...] (note adjusted spelling) name.|$|R

5000|$|In {{cars with}} rear drum brakes, the parking <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> usually actuates these drums {{mechanically}} with much less force than {{is available through}} the hydraulic system.|$|R
50|$|The detangler, Gyro or rotor is an {{invention}} for the freestyle BMX bicycle, allowing the handlebars {{to turn a}} complete 360Â° rotation without the <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> getting tangled up. SST oryg is another common manufacturer of detangler systems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>cables,</b> {{running over}} {{phosphor}} bronze pulleys, adjustable by ratchets below a sideways hinged 6"x8" [...] trap {{door in the}} floor in front of the riding mechanic. Cast steel ribbed brake drums; cast alloy brake shoes; cast iron segments lining.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle has no chain, pedals, gear box, {{mechanical}} <b>brake,</b> <b>cables</b> or levers. These {{functions are}} provided by a [...] electric motor and controller. The YikeBike has regenerative electronic anti-skid brakes. There are also built-in lights, indicators and horn for safety.|$|E
50|$|Some stems have a {{hole through}} the {{horizontal}} part to support the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on bikes with cantilever brakes such as cyclo-cross bicycles and older mountain bikes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|R
50|$|Some {{bicycles}} use a {{cable guide}} {{on one side}} of the seat cluster for a rear cantilever <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> rather than use a short length of housing between two housing stops.|$|R
50|$|Defending pole {{position}} and race winner Billy Arnold {{was having trouble}} finding speed {{over the past couple}} of days, but scrambled to make an attempt late in the day on Saturday. He wheeled to the line at 7:08 p.m., past the deadline for the track to close. Officials decided to allow the run, and his four-lap average of 113.848 mph tentatively took the {{pole position}}. After the run, some drivers protested, and during a post-qualifying inspection, it was found that Arnold's <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> were not connected. During the rush to get the car on the track, the crew had neglected to connect the <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> and technical committee chairman Louis H. Schwitzer disallowed the run.|$|E
5000|$|The Mondia [...] "Super" [...] racing {{frame was}} {{somewhat}} tighter and stiffer, {{and with a}} straighter front fork. Mondia Super frames used the less elaborate Prugnat chrome lugs with distinctive center cut-outs. Brazed-on guides for <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> on this model were centered {{along the top of}} the top tube.|$|E
50|$|In a {{development}} program costing $400 million, engineers initially used an Erector Set {{to visualize the}} complex interaction of the design and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> rear climate control lines, and rear suspension but precluded all-wheel drive (AWD).|$|E
50|$|The valiha {{generally}} has 21-24 strings. Historically these were formed of strips of the bamboo body, prised up and raised by small bridges, {{but in the}} modern day the strings are often made of unwound bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> though serious players may use standard guitar or piano strings.|$|R
50|$|SLR ("Shimano Linear Response") - Integration of {{a return}} spring into the brake lever, pushing the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> back when the lever is released. The idea behind this was that the return spring in the actual brake could be {{designed}} to be weaker, thus giving an overall feeling of easier operation.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are also}} remembered for their sculpture-like [...] "hand job" [...] cable hanger, which resembled a fist {{reaching}} up and grabbing the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b> The Hand Job took an overlooked {{part of every}} other bike {{and made it a}} focal point for an Ibis, and as such symbolized the company.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 a {{new version}} of the tikit {{replaced}} the pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> with a single, and much thicker, cable, plus other improvements to the handlebar stem and to the rear seat pin assembly. The resulting bike is much stiffer. Bike Friday provides an upgrade path for 2007 tikits which provides some of the 2008 features, notably the new cable assembly.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{development}} program costing $400 million, engineers used an erector set to initially help visualize the complex {{interaction of the}} design and redesigned underfloor components to accommodate the system â including the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> rear climate control lines, and the rear suspension. [...] Even so, the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system, effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans.|$|E

The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|R
50|$|The hut can {{be reached}} via a 3.5 km hike from the parking area (with 700m of {{elevation}} gain). The parking area is reached via a 45 km logging road from Brisco, North of Radium Hot Springs on Highway 95. BC Parks recommends that those who leave their cars here attempt to protect, with fences that are provided, their rubber hoses and cables (including <b>brake</b> <b>cables)</b> from the habits of the local porcupines. The hut is out of range of all cellular service.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, in bicycles, shifter cables are {{anchored}} on the shifter {{with a small}} cylindrical nipple, concentric {{with the}} cable. Bicycle brake nipples however, vary between mountain bikes (MTB), with straight handlebars, and road bikes, with drop-handlebars. MTB bikes use a barrel-shaped (cylindrical) nipple to anchor the brake cable at the brake lever, while road bikes have a pear-shaped nipple. Some replacement <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> for bicycles come with both styles, one on each end. The unneeded end is cut off and discarded upon installation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other side}} of the {{cylinder}} has a piece of small wood called [...] " [...] HÌá»³xng (à¸«à¸¢à¹à¸­à¸)" [...] that raises two cord lines made from bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cables.</b> The Saw bang has two strings. The first one is called [...] " [...] SÌÄy lá»Ì sÌeÄ«yng (à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¹à¸¥à¹à¹à¸ªà¸µà¸¢à¸) [...] "or Audio line out, itâs acted as the main cord and the other string called" [...] SÌÄy klÌxm sÌeÄ«yng (à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¸à¸¥à¹à¸­à¸à¹à¸ªà¸µà¸¢à¸) [...] " [...] which produces higher pitch. Each string makes a sound in conjunction with [...] "KhÃ¦n (à¹à¸à¸)" [...] and [...] "PÄ«Ì (à¸à¸µà¹)". Saw bang has a characteristic soft tone.|$|E
