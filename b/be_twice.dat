5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women were found to <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> {{as likely to be}} affected as men.|$|E
5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons look like small dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> Carl's size. There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E

5000|$|Aristides Quintilianus (writing {{probably}} in the 3rd century AD) enumerates the incomposite intervals: [...] "the smallest, so far as their use in melody is concerned, is the enharmonic diesis, followed—to speak rather roughly—by the semitone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the diesis, the tone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the semitone, and finally the ditone, which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> the tone".|$|R

5|$|Some Ediacaran strata {{with the}} texture {{characteristics}} of microbial mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils {{are almost always}} found in beds that contain these microbial mats. Although microbial mats were once widespread, the evolution of grazing organisms in the Cambrian vastly reduced their numbers. These communities are now limited to inhospitable refugia, such as the stromatolites found in Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Shark Bay, Western Australia where the salt levels can <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> those of the surrounding sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Stargate Command (SGC) base was {{supposed}} to match the real Cheyenne Mountain complex as much as possible. The set had to <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> as high for shooting as the 22 feet tall Stargate prop, but one of Hudolin's original plans of a three-level SGC set was rejected {{in favor of a}} two-level set. The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes. Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniel's lab, the cafeteria or the gym. The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's party now {{consisted}} of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the {{family of four}} and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> that in length.|$|E

5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E

25|$|The {{general theory}} for non-baseband and {{nonuniform}} samples {{was developed in}} 1967 by Henry Landau.

25|$|In other words, {{the son is}} aged 12, {{and since}} the father 22 years older, he must be 34. In 10 years time, the son will be 22, and the father will <b>be</b> <b>twice</b> his age, 44. This problem is {{illustrated}} on the associated plot of the equations.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape and}} area of peaks are {{indicators}} of chemical structure too. In the example above—the proton spectrum of ethanol—the CH3 peak has {{three times the}} area as the OH peak.

2500|$|With {{respect to}} the base plane the slope of a face (2) <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that of an edge (...) , {{corresponding}} {{to the fact that}} the horizontal distance covered from the base to the apex along an edge <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that along the median of a face. In other words, if C is the centroid of the base, the distance from C to a vertex of the base <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> that from C to the midpoint of an edge of the base. This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which <b>is</b> <b>twice</b> as long as the other (see [...] ).|$|R

25|$|Manipulation of the {{equation}} yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag.
