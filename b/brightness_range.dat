40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{statistics of}} the line-doubling phenomenon {{in a sample}} of 81 long-period variable (LPV) stars of various periods, spectral types and <b>brightness</b> <b>ranges.</b> When correlated with a mask mimicking a K 0 III spectrum, 54 % of the sample stars clearly showed a double-peaked cross-correlation profile around maximum light, reflecting double absorption lines. Several pieces of evidence are presented that point towards the double absorption lines as being caused by the propagation of a shock wave through the photosphere. The observation of the Balmer lines appearing in emission around maximum light in these stars corroborates the presence of a shock wave. The observed velocity discontinuities, ranging between 10 and 25 km/s, are not correlated with the <b>brightness</b> <b>ranges.</b> A comparison with the center-of-mass (COM) velocity obtained from submm CO lines originating in the circumstellar envelope reveals that the median velocity between the red and blue peaks is blueshifted with respect to the COM velocity, as expected if the shock moves upwards.

40|$|Diamond Light {{source is}} a third {{generation}} synchrotron facility dedicated to producing radiation of outstanding <b>brightness,</b> <b>ranging</b> from infra-red to x-rays. The short electron bunches that are accelerated around the storage ring are susceptible to the phenomenon of microbunching instabilities when the bunch charge exceeds a threshold. The primary feature of the microbunch instabilities is the onset of bursts of radiation in the THz range. The high frequencies involved in the emissions make detection and analysis challenging.

Understanding the spatial and temporal levels and patterns of this lighting is a key step in determining the severity of adverse effects on different ecosystems, vegetation, and habitat types.

40|$|We present CCD surface {{photometry}} of 16 nearby dwarf galaxies, many {{of which}} were only recently discovered. Our sample comprises both isolated galaxies and galaxies that are members of nearby galaxy groups. The observations were obtained in the Johnson B and V bands (and in some cases in Kron-Cousins I).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} new {{mid-infrared}} maps of NGC 6946 for {{variations in the}} color ratio of the 7 -to- 15 micron emission. Our preliminary findings are that this mid-infrared color is remarkably constant between arms and inter-arm regions, and {{as a function of}} radius in the disk, excluding the nuclear region. As surface <b>brightness</b> <b>ranges</b> by more than an order of magnitude and the radius runs from about 0. 5 to 3 kpc, the color ratio remains constant to about +/- 20 %. Our interpretation is that (1) hard UV radiation from OB stars does not dominate the heating of the grains radiating in the mid-infrared; and (2) that surface brightness variations are driven primarily by surface-filling fraction in the disk, and by radiation intensity increases in starburst environments, such as the nucleus of NGC 6946.

30|$|Because the {{brightness}} of the images obtained differs with different angles, times and illumination intensities, the experimental results have a great influence. Therefore, mural images obtained by frontal shooting under indirect sunlight during the same time period are selected for the experiment. Repeated experiments indicated that {{the brightness}} values of the pure earth layer images are distributed between 187 and 221, while the brightness values of the paint layers of intact mural images are mainly distributed between 78 and 174. Therefore, the <b>brightness</b> value <b>range</b> of 187 – 221 is used as the brightness segmentation threshold; the pixels with a <b>brightness</b> in this <b>range</b> are considered the flaking region, whereas the pixels with a brightness not in this range are not in this region.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple way}} of tuning the {{emission}} color in solution processed phosphorescent organic {{light emitting diodes}} is demonstrated. For each color a single emissive spin-coated layer consisting of a blend of three materials, a fac-tris(2 -phenylpyridyl) iridium (III) cored dendrimer (Ir-G 1) as the green emitter, a heteroleptic [bis(2 -phenylpyridyl) - 2 -(22 ̆ 7 -benzo[4, 5 -alpha]thienyl) pyridyl] iridium (III) cored dendrimer [Ir(ppy) (2) btp] as the red emitter, and 4, 42 ̆ 7 -bis(N-carbazolyl) biphenyl (CBP) as the host was employed. By adjusting the relative amount of green and red dendrimers in the blends, the color of the light emission was tuned from green to red. High efficiency two layer devices were achieved by evaporating a layer of electron transporting 1, 3, 5 -tris(2 -N-phenylbenzimidazolyl) benzene (TPBI) on top of the spin-coated emissive layer. A brightness of 100 cd/m(2) was achieved at drive voltages in the range 5. 3 - 7. 3 V.
