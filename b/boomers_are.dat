50|$|Demographers, {{studying}} population change, {{disagree about}} precise dates for each generation. Dating is normally achieved by identifying population peaks or troughs, which can occur {{at different times}} in each country. For example, in Australia the post-war population boom peaked in 1960, while the peak occurred somewhat later in the USA and Europe, with most estimates converging on 1964. Accordingly, Australian <b>Boomers</b> <b>are</b> normally defined as those born between 1945-1960; while American and European <b>Boomers</b> <b>are</b> normally defined as those born between 1945-64.
