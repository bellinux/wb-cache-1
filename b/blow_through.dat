In Yasna 68.11, {{the waters of}} Aredvi Sura are invoked to bestow {{radiance}} and glory. Khvarenah is also associated with the waters in other texts; with the world-sea Vourukasha in Yasht 19.51 and 19.56-57; with the Helmand river in Yasht 19.66ff. It is also identified with Haoma, together with which it plays a seminal role in {{the legend of the}} birth of Zoroaster. In these passages, khvarenah has a seminal and germinal implication, being both fiery fluid and living seed.|$|E

[...] Gawain accepts the challenge, and is then forced to follow the Turk until he decides to return the <b>blow.</b> <b>Through</b> the many adventures they have together, the Turk, out of respect, asks the knight {{to cut off the}} Turk's head, which Gawain does. The Turk, surviving, then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle contains a scene in which the Carl, a lord, orders Gawain to strike him with his spear, and bends over to receive the blow. Gawain obliges, the Carl rises, laughing and unharmed, and, unlike in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, no return blow is demanded or given. Among all these stories, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is the only one with a completely green character, and the only one tying Morgan le Fay to his transformation.|$|E
500|$|Gill Sans remains popular, {{although}} a trend {{away from it}} towards grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces took place around the 1950s and 1960s {{under the influence of}} continental and American design. Typefaces that became popular around this time included original early [...] "grotesque" [...] sans-serifs, as well as new and more elegant designs in the same style such as Helvetica and Univers. Mosley has commented that in 1960 [...] "orders unexpectedly revived" [...] for the old Monotype Grotesque design: [...] " [...] represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to <b>blow</b> <b>through</b> typography in the early sixties." [...] He added in 2007 [...] "its rather clumsy design seems to {{have been one of the}} chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the... prettiness of Gill Sans". As an example of this trend, Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert's corporate rebranding of BR as British Rail in 1965 introduced Helvetica and Univers for printed matter and the custom but very similar Rail Alphabet for signage, and abandoned the classical, all caps signage style with which Gill Sans is often associated. Kinneir and Calvert's road signage redesign used a similar approach. Linotype and its designer Hermann Zapf, who had begun development on a planned Gill Sans competitor in 1955, first considered redrawing some letters to make it more like these fonts before abandoning the design project (now named [...] "Magnus") around 1962-3.|$|E

[...] A figure of a man fishing on the shore to the left {{was thought to be}} a self-portrait of Giotto, as Vasari's Life records. [...] The composition was dominated by the fishing boat with its large sail, which represented a metaphor of the [...] "Ship of the Church", whose [...] "captain" [...] on earth was Saint Peter and his successors as Pope. [...] It was commissioned at a very difficult time for the Papacy, who were unable even to control the gangsterish nobility of Rome, and had therefore left the city, but the image promised that both church and Papacy were, with the help of Christ, [...] "unsinkable".

"Tonight in the threshingfloor": which afforded a fit {{opportunity}} of meeting with him, being at night, {{and out of}} the city, from his own house, and alone, and after a feast for his reapers and threshers of corn, seems, from Ruth 2:7 It was usual to have threshingfloors in an open place without the city, so to winnow at them, whereby the chaff was more easily separated from the corn, and that, in the evening, when in those countries there were the strongest breezes of wind to carry it off; hence the Targum here has it, [...] "behold, he is winnowing the barley floor with the wind, which is in the night." [...] For before the invention and use of fans in winnowing, it was only done by the wind carrying off the chaff, as the oxen trod the corn, for it was done in the threshingfloor, as here: hence Hesiod advises that the threshingfloors should be, [...] "in a place exposed to wind"; and so Varro observes, the floor should be in the higher part of the field, that the wind might <b>blow</b> <b>through</b> it; to this manner of winnowing Virgil has respect.
