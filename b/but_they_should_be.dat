They also claim to have contacts within the police of North Korea. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies professor Namkung Young says {{that members of the}} organization know the North Korean situation well, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more realistic with their goals. Furthermore, he noted that South Korean support for the organization could increase tensions between the governments. A U.S. military analyst was unaware of any independent sources supporting the claims that the North Korean military would be discontent enough to attempt a coup.|$|E

25|$|The new {{republic}} faced {{a dispute over}} the Åland Islands, which were overwhelmingly Swedish-speaking and sought retrocession to Sweden. However, as Finland {{was not willing to}} cede the islands, they were offered an autonomous status. Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the League of Nations. The League decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the Åland Islands, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> made an autonomous province. Thus Finland was under an obligation to ensure the residents of the Åland Islands a right to maintain the Swedish language, as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty was concluded on the neutral status of Åland, under which it was prohibited to place military headquarters or forces on the islands.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Ambeth Ocampo {{gives the}} opinion that arguing for Bonifacio as the [...] "better" [...] hero {{on the grounds that}} he, not Rizal, began the Philippine Revolution, is moot since Rizal {{inspired}} Bonifacio, the Katipunan, and the Revolution. Even prior to Rizal's banishment to Dapitan, he was already regarded by the Filipino people as a national hero, having been elected as honorary president by the Katipunan. León María Guerrero notes that while Rizal did not give his blessing to the Katipunan because he believed the time was premature, he did not condemn the aim of independence per se. Teodoro Agoncillo gives {{the opinion that}} Bonifacio should not replace Rizal as national hero, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> honored [...] "side by side".|$|E

2500|$|The {{texture of}} the thick double-coat is {{important}} in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is {{difficult to get a}} Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> bathed every 3–4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.

The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color: ...|$|E

60|$|It is true {{that mental}} {{disturbances}} and agitations of this kind can not be wholly avoided. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> avoided as far as possible; and the most efficient means for avoiding them is a firm, though calm and gentle, establishment and maintenance of parental authority, and not, as many mothers very mistakingly imagine, by unreasonable indulgences, and by endeavors to manage their children by persuasions, bribings, and manoeuvrings, instead of by commands. The most indulged children, and the least governed, are always the most petulant and irritable; while a strong government, if regular, uniform, and just, and if administered by gentle measures, is the most effectual of all possible instrumentalities for surrounding childhood with an atmosphere of calmness and peace.|$|E

"The biche de mer is {{generally}} taken {{in three or}} four feet of water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according {{to the size of the}} mollusca. Through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. The article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much or too little. They are then buried in the ground for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried, either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.) can be cured that way, I can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely to affect them.|$|E

60|$|The Committee {{has been}} {{informed}} that {{with regard to}} some of our museums, particularly the British Museum, they are very much overcharged with objects, and I apprehend that the same remark would be true as {{to some of our}} picture galleries. Are you of opinion that it would be conducive to the general elevation {{of the people in this}} country if our works of art, and objects of interest, were circulated more expeditiously, and more conveniently, than at present, throughout the various manufacturing districts?--I think that all precious works of art ought to be treated with a quite different view, and that they ought to be kept together where men whose work is chiefly concerned with art, and where the artistically higher classes can take full advantage of them. They ought, therefore, to be all together, as in the Louvre at Paris, and as in the Uffizii at Florence, everything being illustrative of other things, but kept separate from the collections intended for the working classes, which may be as valuable as you choose, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> usable, and above all things so situated that the working classes could get at them easily, without keepers to watch what they are about, and have their wives and children with them, and be able to get at them freely, so that they might look at a thing as their own, not merely as the nation's, but as a gift from the nation to them as the working class.|$|E
6000|$|Probably {{the most}} inattentive mind, {{even in the}} holidays, could [...] "tackle" [...] a {{catalogue}} like this, or another in which the snuff-box of Xerxes and the boot-jack of Themistocles should be offered for sale. These antiquities seem scarcely less desirable, or less likely {{to come into the}} market, than the scissors, pistols, and field-glass of Fernando Cortes. An original portion of the Tables of the Law (broken on a familiar occasion by the prophet), Hannibal's cigarette case, a landing net (at one time in the possession of Alcibiades), a piece of chalk used by Archimedes in his mathematical demonstrations, the bronze shoe of Empedocles, the arrow on which Abaris flew, and the walking-stick, a considerable piece of timber, which Dr. Johnson lost in Mull, may all be reposing in some private collection. Collectors do get very odd things together. Poor M. Soleirol had quite a gallery of portraits and autographs of Moliere, and a French mathematician, about a dozen years ago, possessed an assortment of apocryphal letters from almost every one mentioned in history, sacred or profane. The collection of Mr. Samuel Ireland was like this, and an English student possessed autographs of most of the great reformers, carefully written by an ingenious swindler in contemporary books. The lovers of relics are apt to be thus deluded, and perhaps we should not regret this, {{as long as they are}} happy. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> very careful indeed when they are asked to buy Alvarado's spear, though probably it is extant somewhere, as it certainly is in the catalogue.

6000|$|... 1. Paying the money. This is the {{simplest}} plan. If it is adopted, the money {{must be ready}} and be paid at the appointed time with the utmost exactitude and certainty. Having made the arrangement with a child that he {{is to have a}} certain sum--six cents, twelve cents, twenty-five cents, or more, as the case may be--every Saturday night, the mother--if it is the mother who has charge of the execution of the plan--must consider it a sacred debt, and must be always ready. She can not expect that her children will learn regularity, punctuality, and system in the management of their money affairs, if she sets them the example of laxity and forgetfulness in fulfilling her engagements, and offering excuses for non-payment when the time comes, instead of having the money ready when it is due. The money, when paid, should not, in general, be carried by the children about the person, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> provided with a purse or other safe receptacle, which, however, should be entirely in their custody, and so exposed to all the accidents to which any carelessness in the custody would expose it. The mother must remember that the very object of the plan is to have the children learn by experience to take care of money themselves, and that she defeats that object by virtually relieving them of this care. It should, therefore, be paid to them with the greatest punctuality, especially at the first introduction of the system, and with the distinct understanding that the charge and care of keeping it devolves entirely upon them from the time of its passing into their hands.|$|E
