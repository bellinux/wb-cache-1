50|$|Order-preserving, frequency-based {{compression}} (referred to as actionable compression) in BLU Acceleration {{allows a}} wide variety of comparative operations to be performed without decompression—and with efficient use of CPU memory (cache) and registers. With actionable compression, values that appear more frequently are compressed at a higher level than values that appear less often. (Actionable compression uses an entropy encoding algorithm for lossless data compression that was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT, as its <b>base.),</b> <b>Offset</b> coding is another compression optimization technique that is used in BLU Acceleration. Offset coding is very useful with numeric data; instead of trying to compress the values 100, 101, 102, and 103, for example, DB2 will store a single value (100) and just the offsets to that value (1, 2, 3, etc.). This is very similar {{to the way in which}} DB2 compresses index record IDs (RIDs)—one of three autonomic index compression algorithms that DB2 can dynamically apply to indexes.|$|E

Multi-granular switches are promising devices to match dynamic application needs while optimizing switch costs and feasibility.

OBS <b>base</b> <b>offset</b> time is strictly dependent on switching matrix {{set up time}} which, in presence of hybrid technology, is different from path to path.

40|$|Although {{computerized}} retinal image {{blood vessel}} segmentation {{has been extensively}} researched, there is still room for improvement {{in the quality of}} the segmented images. Since retinal image analysis is still widely used in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, efficient and accurate image characterization techniques are required. Previous work has mainly focused on improving segmentation accuracy rates with little regard to the false positives that are produced by illumination variation. This research work presents a hybrid approach towards the segmentation of retinal blood vessels. New approaches towards the reduction of background illumination variation are proposed using normalized Gabor filtering. These are the base-offset encoding and a modified version of an existing zero-integral kernel technique. The valley emphasis automatic thresholding scheme is used to segment the Gabor response images. Experiments are conducted on the DRIVE and STARE retinal image data sets. Accuracy rates of up to 94 % are achieved through the zero-integral and <b>base</b> <b>offset</b> methods. This is comparable with results from literature, where the same data sets are segmented using other classification techniques.

The science is clear. The global warming debate is over." [...] The Act caps California's greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020, and institutes a mandatory emissions reporting system to monitor compliance. This agreement represents the first enforceable statewide program in the U.S. to cap all GHG emissions from major industries that includes penalties for non-compliance. This requires the State Air Resources Board to establish a program for statewide greenhouse gas emissions reporting and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The legislation will also allow for market mechanisms to provide incentives to businesses to reduce emissions while safeguarding local communities, and authorizes the state board to adopt market-based compliance mechanisms including cap-and-trade, and allows a one-year extension of the targets under extraordinary circumstances. Thus far, flexible mechanisms in the form of project <b>based</b> <b>offsets</b> have been suggested for five main project types. A carbon project would create offsets by showing that it has reduced carbon dioxide and equivalent gases.
