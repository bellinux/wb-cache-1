To understand their ultimate signaling functions, {{it is important}} to identify the proximate mechanism promoting variation in coloration. Carotenoid-based colors combine structural and pigmentary components, but the importance of the contribution of structural components to variation in pigment-based colors (i. e., carotenoid-based colors) has been undervalued. In a field experiment with great tits (Parus major), we combined a brood size manipulation with a simultaneous carotenoid supplementation in order to disentangle the effects of carotenoid availability and early growth condition on different components of the yellow breast feathers. By defining independent measures of feather carotenoid content (absolute carotenoid chroma) and background structure (<b>background</b> <b>reflectance),</b> we demonstrate that environmental factors experienced during the nestling period, namely, early growth conditions and carotenoid availability, contribute independently to variation in yellow plumage coloration. While early growth conditions affected the <b>background</b> <b>reflectance</b> of the plumage, the availability of carotenoids affected the absolute carotenoid chroma, the peak of maximum ultraviolet reflectance, and the overall shape, that is, chromatic information of the reflectance curves.

40|$|Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an {{important}} structural property of surface vegetation. Many algorithms use LAI in regional and global biogeochemical, ecological, and meteorological applications. This dissertation reports several new, improved methods to estimate LAI from remotely sensed data. To improve LAI estimation, a new atmospheric correction algorithm was developed for the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. It can effectively estimate the spatial distribution of atmospheric aerosols and retrieve surface reflectance under general atmospheric and surface conditions. This method was validated using ground measurements at Beltsville, Maryland. Several examples are given to correct AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) data using the new algorithm. Next, a genetic algorithm (GA) was incorporated into the optimization process of radiative transfer (RT) model inversion for LAI retrieval. Different ETM+ band combinations {{and the number of}} "genes" employed in the GA were examined to evaluate their effectiveness. The LAI estimates from ETM+ using this method were reasonably accurate when compared with field measured LAI. A new hybrid method, which integrates both the RT model simulation and the non-parametric statistical methods, was developed to estimate LAI. Two non-parametric methods were applied, the neural network ((NN) algorithms and the projection pursuit regression (PPR) algorithms. A soil reflectance index (SRI) was proposed to account for variable soil <b>background</b> <b>reflectances.</b> Both atmospherically corrected surface reflectances and raw top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances from ETM+ were tested.

40|$|Developing and {{implementing}} methods of effective bridge rehabilitation {{is a major}} issue for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The nation spends $ 5 billion annually to replace, rehabilitate or construct new bridges. According to the National Bridge Inventory, over 100, 000 U. S. bridges are structurally deficient. About 40, 000 of these bridges have advanced deck deterioration. The most common causes of serious deck deterioration is delamination. Delaminations result when steel reinforcements within the bridge deck corrode, creating gaps that separate the concrete into layers. A reliable inspection technology, capable of identifying delaminations, would represent a power new tool in bridge maintenance. To date, most bridge inspections rely on human interpretation of surface visual features of chain dragging. These methods are slow, disruptive, unreliable and raise serious safety concerns. Infrared thermal imaging detects subsurface delaminations and surface clutter, which is introduced by foreign material on the roadway. Typically, foreign material which is not always evident on a video tape image, produces a unique IR <b>reflectance</b> <b>background</b> unlike the thermal response of a subsurface delamination.

Detection in such a case requires that the luminance or the color of the object differ sufficiently from that of its background for the optical signal reaching the observer to exceed his contrast threshold despite attenuation by the intervening water.
