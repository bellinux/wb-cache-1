Additional cargo diversity is achieved through cargo receptors, {{which include the}} Erv 14 /Cornichon family that mediates export of transmembrane proteins despite the potential for such clients to directly interact with Sec 24. The molecular function of Erv 14 thus remains unclear, with possible roles in COPII binding, membrane domain chaperoning, and lipid organization. ResultsUsing a targeted mutagenesis approach to define the mechanism of Erv 14 function, we identify conserved residues in the second transmembrane domain of Erv 14 that mediate interaction with a subset of Erv 14 clients. We further show that interaction of Erv 14 with a novel cargo-binding surface on Sec 24 is necessary for efficient trafficking of all of its clients. However, we also determine that some Erv 14 clients also directly engage an adjacent cargo-binding domain of Sec 24, suggesting a novel mode of dual interaction between cargo and coat. ConclusionsWe conclude that Erv 14 functions as a canonical cargo receptor that couples membrane proteins to the COPII coat, but that maximal export requires a <b>bivalent</b> <b>signal</b> that derives from motifs on both the cargo protein and Erv 14. Sec 24 can thus be considered a coincidence detector that binds simultaneously to multiple signals to drive packaging of polytopic membrane proteins. This mode of dual signal binding to a single coat protein might serve as a general mechanism to trigger efficient capture, or may be specifically employed in ER export to control deployment of nascent proteins...|$|E
40|$|The ErbB {{receptor}} {{family is}} dysregulated in many cancers, and its therapeutic manipulation by targeted antibodies and kinase inhibitors {{has resulted in}} effective chemotherapies. However, many malignancies remain refractory to current interventions. We describe a new approach that directs ErbB receptor interactions, resulting in biased signaling and phenotypes. Due to known receptor-ligand affinities {{and the necessity of}} ErbB receptors to dimerize to <b>signal,</b> <b>bivalent</b> ligands, formed by the synthetic linkage of two neuregulin- 1 Î² (NRG) moieties, two epidermal growth factor (EGF) moieties, or an EGF and a NRG moiety, can potentially drive homotypic receptor interactions and diminish formation of HER 2 -containing heterodimers, which are implicated in many malignancies and are a prevalent outcome of stimulation by native, monovalent EGF, or NRG. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this approach by showing that bivalent NRG (NN) can bias signaling in HER 3 -expressing cancer cells, resulting in some cases in decreased migration, inhibited proliferation, and increased apoptosis, whereas native NRG stimulation increased the malignant potential of the same cells. Hence, this new approach may have therapeutic relevance in ovarian, breast, lung, and other cancers in which HER 3 has been implicated...|$|R
