As for the {{impinging}} jets {{of single}} group slot nozzles, the heat {{transfer of the}} top and bottom strip surface is uneven which is mainly caused by the various jet distances of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>nozzle</b> to the strip surface and the effect of gravity. In this study, the convective heat transfer process of {{the top and bottom}} strip surface due to single group slot nozzles in the ultra-fast cooling (UFC) system was studied by the fluid-structure interaction finite element method. The distributions of the flow field and heat transfer for the top and bottom strip surfaces were obtained under the various parameters. The results showed that, the difference value of the average Nusselt numbe for the top and bottom strip surface was decreased with the increase of the jet velocity, but when the jet velocity was up to 5 m/s it remained almost the same. The uniformity of the top and bottom surface was improved by the jet impingement height (h) for the h < 45 mm. It was found that for h = 25 mm, the heat transfers of the top and down surfaces were more evenly, and the different value of average Nusselt number for the decreased by about 12. 6 %- 28 % as the jet impingement height increased from 25 mm to 45 mm when the slot width was 5 mm...|$|E

Hence; many researchers have carried out extensive model experiments by focusing on flow field’s structure using air bubbles. The bubble plume, which is a typical form of bubble flow, is {{known as one of}} the transport phenomena that have the capability to drive a large-scale convection due to the buoyancy of the bubbles. The technique of using a surface flow generated by the bubble plume is utilized as an effective way to control and collect surface floating substances in naval systems, lakes, seas, rivers, oceans especially the oil layer formed during large oil spill accidents. The surface flows generated by bubble plumes are considered to be key phenomena in various kinds of reactors, engineering processes and industrial processes handling a free surface. The motivation of this research is to broaden the understanding and demonstration of the following points: 1) The most important applications of bubbly flow and gas-liquid two-phase flow. 2) The differences of surface flow generation mechanisms among single-phase liquid jet, single phase buoyant plume, and bubble plume. 3) The relationship between the dominated parameters of bubbly flow that are demanded to describe the characteristics of the bubble generating surface flow.

40|$|A new {{experimental}} method is developed here to investigate agglomeration in spray drying towers operating with multiple nozzles. It allows studying independently {{the contribution of}} each spray to the product and obtaining a valuable insight into the agglomeration processes. The paper studies a two level swirl counter-current dryer of detergent in a full-scale production system. It shows that operation with two nozzle levels increases the energy efficiency {{compared to the use}} of single sprays, but in turn promotes both agglomeration and elutriation of powder {{from the top of the}} dryer. The product size distribution becomes bi-modal and the composition and porosity of the product more heterogeneous due to the different thermal histories experienced by droplets from each spray. The method described here controls the air temperature and humidity nearby the nozzles to quantify the agglomerates resulting from particle contacts within each individual spray or from their interaction. Particle agglomeration is shown to be suppressed at the bottom of the dryer where the heat transfer rates are highest and promoted at the top spray, which originates a second coarse mode in the size distribution. Both levels do not operate independently; the powder elutriated upwards from the <b>bottom</b> <b>nozzle</b> is captured entirely by the top spray when it is centrally located. By isolating the independent impact of each nozzle in a dryer, the method provides powerful data to correlate the agglomeration behaviour with local process conditions, and so facilitate the development and validation of spray dryer models...|$|E

The direct numerical simulations are first performed in channel, square and 2 : 1 aspect rectangular ducts to investigate the effect of magnetic field on turbulent flows. The rectangular duct is a more practical geometry for continuous casting nozzle and mold and has the option of applying magnetic field either perpendicular to broader side or shorter side. This work forms the part of a graphic processing unit (GPU) based CFD code (CU-FLOW) development for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent flows. The DNS results revealed interesting effects of the magnetic field and its orientation on primary, secondary flows (instantaneous and mean), Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets, momentum budgets and frictional losses, besides providing DNS database for two-wall bounded square and rectangular duct MHD turbulent flows. Further, the low- and high-Reynolds number RANS models (k-ε and Reynolds stress models) are developed and tested with DNS databases for channel and square duct flows with and without magnetic field. The MHD sink terms in k- and ε-equations are implemented as proposed by Kenjereš and Hanjalić using a user defined function (UDF) in FLUENT. This work revealed varying accuracies of different RANS models at different levels. This work is useful for industry to understand the accuracies of these models, including continuous casting. After realizing the accuracy and computational cost of RANS models, the steady-state k-ε model is then combined with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) and impeller probe velocity measurements in a 1 / 3 rd scale water model to study the flow quality coming out of the well- and mountain-bottom nozzles and the effect of stopper-rod misalignment on fluid flow. The mountain-bottom nozzle was found more prone to the longtime asymmetries and higher surface velocities. The left misalignment of stopper gave higher surface velocity on the right leading to significantly large number of vortices forming behind the nozzle on the left. Later, the transient and steady-state models such as LES, filtered URANS and steady RANS models are combined with ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry (UDV) measurements in a GaInSn model of typical continuous casting process. LES-CU-LOW is the fastest and the most accurate model owing to much finer mesh and a smaller timestep. This work provided a good understanding on the performance of these models. The behavior of instantaneous flows, Reynolds stresses and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis quantified the <b>nozzle</b> <b>bottom</b> swirl and its importance on the turbulent flow in the mold. Afterwards, the aforementioned work in GaInSn model is extended with electromagnetic braking (EMBr) to help optimize a ruler-type brake and its location for the continuous casting process. The magnetic field suppressed turbulence and promoted vortical structures with their axis aligned with the magnetic field suggesting tendency towards 2 -d turbulence. The stronger magnetic field at the nozzle well and around the jet region created large scale and lower frequency flow behavior by suppressing <b>nozzle</b> <b>bottom</b> swirl and its front-back alternation. Based on this work, it is advised to avoid stronger magnetic field around jet and <b>nozzle</b> <b>bottom</b> to get more stable and less defect prone flow...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work is to {{increase}} the knowledge of phenomena taking place during the initial stage in a top blown converter. The work has been done in a few steps resulting in four different supplements. Water model experiments have been carried out using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology. The system investigated was a fundamental top blown converter where an air jet was set to impinge on a water surface. The flow field of the combined blown case, where an air jet was introduced through a <b>bottom</b> <b>nozzle,</b> was also captured by the PIV. The work clearly showed that the flow field caused by an impinging top blown jet alone could not match that of the bottom blown case. The main re-circulation loop (or vortex) was investigated with respect to position and it was found that an increased flow rate pushes the center of the re-circulation loop downwards into the bath. However, for the top-blown case there is a point when the flow rate is too large to cause a distinguishable re-circulation loop since the jet becomes more plunging (i. e. penetrates deep into the bath) than impinging, with large surface agitation and splashing as a result. A numerical model with the same dimensions as the experimental system was then created. Three different turbulence models from the same family were tested: standard-, realizable- and a modified-(slight modification of one of the coefficients in order to produce less spreading of the air jet) k-ε turbulence model. It could be shown that for the family of k-ε turbulence models the difference in penetration depth was small and that the values corresponded well to literature data. However, {{when it comes to the}} position of the re-circulation loop it was shown that the realizable k-ε model produced better results when comparing the results to the experimental data produced from the PIV measurements, mentioned earlier. It was then shown how the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model could be coupled to thermodynamics databases in order to solve for both reactions and transport in the system. Instead of an air-water system, a gas-steel-slag system was created using the knowledge obtained in the previous simulation step described above. Reactions between gas-steel, gas-slag, steel-slag and gas-steel-slag were considered. Extrapolation of data from a few seconds of simulation was used for comparison to experimental data from the literature and showed reasonable agreement. The overall conclusion was that it is possible to make a coupling of the Thermo-Calc databases and a CFD software to make dynamic simulations of metallurgical processes such as a top-blown converter. A parametric study was then undertaken where two different steel grades were tested; one with high initial carbon content (3. 85 mass-%) and one with lower carbon content (0. 5 mass-%). The initial silicon content was held constant at 0. 84 mass-%. Different initial temperatures were tested and also some variation in initial dissolved oxygen content was tried. It was found that the rate of decarburization/desiliconization was influenced by the temperature and carbon concentration in the melt, where a high temperature as well as a high carbon concentration favors decarburization over desiliconization. It was also seen that the region affected by a lower concentration of alloys (or impurities) was quite small close to the axis where the impinging jet hits the bath. Add the oscillating nature of the cavity and it was realized that sampling from this region during an experiment might be quite difficult. QC 2010072...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop and apply coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) systems in reacting flows. CARS is a well established laser diagnostic technique for point measurements in reacting flows. Its accuracy has been extended to a larger temperature range (300 - 3000 K) along with the added diagnostic potential for simultaneous concentration measurements of relevant flame species, without {{a significant increase in the}} CARS system complexity. This advance has been made possible by the advent of two-beam pure rotational CARS (PRCARS), first demonstrated in this thesis research. ^ Two-beam PRCARS allows the use of a third laser beam, also a frequency doubled Nd:YAG output at 532 nm to simultaneously generate a vibrational CARS (VCARS) signal. The VCARS and PRCARS signals are separated from the other input beams in the detection channel, into two separate detection paths. Both signals are detected using one spectrometer. A 532 -nm mirror was mounted inside the spectrometer to reflect the PRCARS signal on to a second CCD camera. A single-bandpass filter was introduced in the VCARS signal 2 ̆ 7 s path in order to prevent any stray 532. 2 nm radiation from interfering with the PRCARS signal. The bandpass filter served a secondary purpose of reducing the flame-chemiluminescence entering the spectrometer and thus, enhanced the signal to noise ratio of the CARS signals. This new, combined CARS system has been used for measurements in a Hencken burner calibration flame. ^ Temperature measurements obtained in counter-flow diffusion flames (CFDF) helps combustion modelers validate chemical, transport and thermodynamic properties used in combustion modeling. Specifically, an understanding of combustion dynamics (via combustion modeling) in CFDF 2 ̆ 7 s can lead to improved design of systems using either H 2 or H 2 -based fuels. Two examples of such systems are power gas turbines and high-speed propulsion engines. VCARS thermometry was performed in laboratory scale H 2 -air CFDF. Mixtures of H 2 and N 2 flowed from the <b>bottom</b> <b>nozzle</b> as fuel, and air flowed from the top nozzle as the oxidizer. Temperature profiles were obtained along the center line of the nozzles of a novel counterflow burner by systematically varying dilution of N 2 in the fuel stream and by varying the global strain rate of the non-premixed flames. Global strain rate is defined as the ratio between the relative flow velocity (of the fuel and the oxidizer stream) and the nozzle separation distance. The counterflow burner has a modular design which allows various nozzle geometries to be used with variable separation between the bottom and the top nozzle. At a fixed global strain rate, the peak temperature and 2 ̆ 2 width 2 ̆ 2 of the temperature profiles were found to decrease with an increase in N 2 dilution in the fuel stream. Also a shift of the flame front towards the fuel nozzle was observed. At constant fuel composition, with a reduction in the strain rate, broadening in the temperature profile along with a reduction in the flame peak temperature was observed. Furthermore, the flame front shifted towards the oxidizer nozzle with decreasing strain rates. The experimentally obtained temperature measurements were found to be in good agreement with one-dimensional numerical solutions obtained using OPPDIFF software. Beyond a strain rate of approximately 450 s- 1, unsteady flow oscillations were observed in the flame which permitted only qualitative imaging of the flame structure. ^ The extinction limits for H 2 -Air non-premixed flames, with low percentage of H 2 in the fuel stream, were obtained qualitatively. The extinction limits were obtained by carefully increasing the global strain rate until the flames were extinguished. Extinction limits obtained using one-dimensional numerical solutions from OPPDIFF are in rough agreement with experiments. This suggests the need for more rigorous computational tools to predict extinction with more accuracy. Flame structure for one particular flame, containing 17...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBuckling {{collapse}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} failure modes of pressure vessel. But, in the past protection against collapse from bulking has not been implemented as required by codes, especially local buckling. The situation is attributed to two reasons. The first one is that pressure vessel code usually only provided design method by rules to protect against global bulking of shell under conventional loads, such as external pressure or axial compression load. However, local bulking may occur in some local discontinuity regions rather than global region and has to be evaluated using design method by analysis. The second one is that bulking analysis based on numerical method (e. g. FEA) is more sophisticated to implement compared to typical strength analysis due to non-uniqueness of result, initial imperfection, mesh generation and other reasons. The case studied in this paper is that a heavy attaching equipment was closely connected the main equipment by triangular steel structure instead of typical shirt support for the purpose of space saving. The key point of this project case is that the 240 -ton attaching equipment causes significant compress stress in the local regions such as the <b>bottom</b> of <b>nozzle,</b> shirt support of main equipment and triangular steel structure. Regarding the loads, not only weight but also wind, seismic load etc. and their load cases combinations should be considered in the bulking analysis. With this case, the paper introduced the basic principles, implementation procedures and software applications of local buckling analysis of pressure vessel. At the end, this paper proposed some suggestion for the Chinese code of bulking analysis through this typical case study...|$|R

40|$|Computational {{modeling}} is {{an important}} tool to understand and stabilize transient turbulent fluid flow in the continuous casting of steel to minimize defects. The current work combines the predictions of two steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models, a ‘‘filtered’’ unsteady RANS model, and two large eddy simulation (LES) models with ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry (UDV) measurements in a small-scale liquid GaInSn model of the continuous casting mold region fed by a bifurcated well-bottom nozzle with horizontal ports. Both mean and transient features of the turbulent flow are investigated. LES outperformed all models while matching the measurements, except in locations where measurement problems are suspected. The LES model also captured high-frequency fluctuations, which the measurements could not detect. Steady RANS models were the least accurate methods. Turbulent velocity variation frequencies and energies decreased with distance from the nozzle port regions. Proper orthog-onal decomposition analysis, instantaneous velocity patterns, and Reynolds stresses reveal that velocity fluctuations and flow structures associated with the alternating-direction swirl in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>bottom</b> lead to a wobbling jet exiting the ports into the mold.

40|$|Static {{electromagnetic}} braking (EMBr) fields affect greatly the turbulent flow pattern in steel continuous casting, {{which leads to}} potential benefits such as decreasing flow instability, surface defects, and inclusion entrapment if applied correctly. To gain a fundamental understanding of how EMBr affects transient turbulent flow, the current work applies large eddy simulations (LES) to investigate the effect of three EMBr ruler brake configurations on transient turbulent flow through the bifurcated nozzle and mold of a liquid-metal GaInSn model of a typical steel slab-casting process, but with deep nozzle submergence and insulated walls with no solidifying shell. The LES calculations are performed using an in-house graphic-processing-unit-based computational-fluid-dynamics code (LES-CU-FLOW) on a mesh of ~ 7 million brick cells. The LES model is validated first via ultrasonic velocimetry measurements in this system. It is then applied to quantify the mean and instantaneous flow structures, Reynolds stresses, turbulent kinetic energy and its budgets, and proper orthogonal modes of four cases. Positioning the strongest part of the ruler magnetic field over the <b>nozzle</b> <b>bottom</b> suppresses turbulence in this region, thus reducing nozzle well swirl and its alternation. This process leads to strong and focused jets entering the mold cavity making large-scale and low-frequency (< 0. 02 Hz) flow variations in the mold with detrimental surface velocity variations. Lowering the ruler below nozzle deflects the jets upward, leading to faster surface velocities than the other cases. The double-ruler and no-EMBr cases have the most stable flow. The magnetic field generates large-scale vortical structures tending toward two-dimensional (2 -D) turbulence. To avoid detri-mental large-scale, low-frequency flow variations, it is recommended to avoid strong magnetic fields across the nozzle well and port regions...|$|R
