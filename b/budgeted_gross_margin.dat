40|$|The data {{requirements}} for {{an assessment of}} the profitability of alternative farm management systems are the technical rates of substitution of one enter rise for another, and their price ratios. In a mixed arable system it is necessary to determine relative yields of cash crops, stocking rates and stock performance, and to assess the requirements of these enterprises for variable and fixed resources. While the basis of analysis would usually be average yields and current or expected prices, it is often desirable to explore the effect of variation in the critical parameters. Three methods of analysis are available, partial <b>budgeting,</b> including <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> analysis, full comparative budgeting, and mathematical programming. This paper is limited to a brief review of the relative profitability of cash crops under current prices, using <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> as the basis of analysis. In most situations, <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> per acre are of first importance, although, where operating capital or labour are most limiting, then it will be more appropriate to do the analysis iIi terms of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per unit of capital or labour.

40|$|The {{economic}} impact of different extension messages used was calculated using enterprise <b>budgeting</b> (<b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> analysis). Input data were gleaned from the literature, from participatory appraisals, {{as well as a}} field study, spanning 12 months, of small-scalecommunal goat farming systems in Jericho in the Odi District of NorthWest Province. The number of offspring weaned per annum, as a proportion of does owned, was selected as the desired output for analysis. This study has shown that small-scale communal goat farmers are not adopting or implementing extension messages to improve production capacity. In south Africa the majority of goats are slaughtered in the informal sector. If the informal sector is to be persuaded to market goats commercially through formal channels, then knowledge of the economics of goat farming on communal lands should be provided. The economic aspects of extension messages are probably an important factor in determining acceptance and sustainability yet appear to be seldom investigated. The probable reason for lack of adoption of standard extension messages, which promote improved nutrition, parasite control, vaccination and treatment of goats, was economic. In other words, the so-called 'poor management practices' used by communal farmers appeared to be economically more profitable than the 'good management practices' suggested to increase production. The price of communal goats was not related to their mass. A higher level of inputs would probably have resulted in a heavier kid, however it was established that this would not have influenced the price received as a majority of the goats were slaughtered for ritual purposes where age, colour and sex were more important to the purchaser than body mass. It is standard practice in commercial farming systems to evaluate the economic benefits of all management practices before they are implemented. Production animal veterinarians use veterinary economics to compare different scenarios to control diseases or select management practices in commercial herds. It is suggested that the inputs and outputs of small-scale farming systems should be carefully analysed and that veterinary economics should also be used to evaluate the probable impact of extension messages formulated by veterinarians and animal health technicians...|$|R

The analytical tool used includes descriptive statistics to analyze the socio-economic characteristics of the farmers and farm <b>budgeting</b> technique (<b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> analysis) for assessing the profitability of pigeon pea production. The study also identified the constraints encountered by farmers such as high cost of labour, inadequate processing / storage facilities, problems of access to credit/loans and weed/pest infestation.

An extension of the comparative statics of the expected mean-variance model was adopted by introducing a budget constraint into the constrained optimisation problem. A 10 -year expected mean-variance whole-farm model was solved for a farm in the wheat-sheep zone of Australia to provide an empirical example. Results were obtained using no planning horizon (the static model) {{and then with a}} five-year rolling planning horizon (the dynamic model). In addition, enterprise levels were constrained to match levels observed on the farm so as to compare incomes between the constrained and unconstrained models. For a cash constrained, risk averse, farmer it was found that they are likely to have larger expenditures than less risk averse operators in order to obtain the same indirect utility. Enterprise levels differed between the dynamic and static models, and a dynamic model was used to help explain inter-temporal decision-making.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is one of}} the largest industries in the United States and has major influence on the nation's economy. While there is information about industry-wide labor productivity, there has been very little specifically aimed at analyzing the key macroeconomic factors such as labor productivity and <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of the {{construction industry}} as a whole and at fourteen of its sub-sectors. To address these shortcomings, the objectives of this research are threefold: (1) quantify the macroeconomic performance of the industry as a whole and at fourteen of its sub-sectors in terms of labor productivity, <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> and labor wages, (2) investigate the relationship among the three key parameters over the study period from 1992 to 2007, and (3) develop a quantifying model that predicts the level of a firms' profit as a function of such parameters. In addition, the paper seeks to further examine the interdependence between <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> and labor productivity and wages by looking at the construction industry as a whole. First, data were collected from the 1997, 2002, and 2007 U. S. Economic Census reports generated by the U. S. Census Bureau. This raw data had discrepancies because of some missing values in data fields. This problem was then resolved by performing a bi-variate linear regression. Second, a one-way ANOVA and a general linear regression analysis was performed to investigate whether there was a statistically significant relationship among <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> labor productivity, and labor wages per construction worker. Third, a quantifying model was developed to predict the value of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> as a function of key parameters. Lastly, the proposed model was then validated with actual values of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> observed in three states, California, Florida, and Texas. The results of this research clearly indicate that there was no statistically significant relationship between labor productivity and labor wages per construction worker. In addition, it was seen that there was no significant relationship between labor wages and <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per construction worker. However, this study proved that there was a statistically significant relationship between labor productivity and <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> per construction worker, which suggests the importance of labor productivity. The validation study proved the reliability of the proposed model in predicting the value of <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> with little deviation. This study concludes that sub-sectors experiencing higher labor productivity resulted in more profits as represented by the level of <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> This finding conveys the important fact that as labor productivity improves, firm's profits also increase significantly.

40|$|The {{amount of}} milk {{produced}} on Swiss dairy farms is restricted by contracts between the farmers and their marketing agent. In the past, these contracts have been calculated on a yearly base. Due to a switch in agricultural policy, these yearly contracts are currently {{more and more}} replaced by contracts calculated on a monthly base. These new contracts are assumed to restrict the flexibility of farmers to react on changes in milk price {{as well as on}} changes in fodder availability. Thus, the contract design is expected to influence farmersâ ability to cope with risks and, thus, to influence the farmâs <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> variability. Applying a bioeconomic whole-farm model, the effects of price and weather risk as well as different risk-management strategies on the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> and the variability of the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> in Swiss dairy production are assessed under the 2 contract designs. We consider both risk-neutral and risk-averse behavior of farmers in our study. Results show that <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> is slightly higher under the yearly than under the monthly contract. Variability of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> is also higher under the yearly than under the monthly contract. If the farmer is assumed to be risk averse, under both contracts he can reduce the coefficient of variation of the <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> by almost 20 % at opportunity costs below 1 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> To reduce variability of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> under both contracts the size of the feedstock needs to be increased. This increase, however, must be considerably higher under the monthly contract than under the yearly contract. An additional risk-management strategy under a monthly contract is an increase in the area used as intensive pasture to ensure fodder availability in years with unfavorable weather. Under the yearly contract, an increase in the area used as extensive pasture is shown to be more favorable because it increases the amount of direct payments the farmer will receive. Additional restrictions in farm management due to a monthly milk contract do not lead to a higher variation in <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> However, if a farmer agrees to a monthly contract, he needs to adapt his risk-management strategies.

We examined 1) tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins,</b> sales, and profits in small shops, 2) differences by area deprivation and smoking prevalence, and 3) the role of e-cigarettes. METHODS: Sales data from 1447 shops covering two 2 -week periods in 2015 (weeks starting 1 June, 8 June, 14 Sept, 21 Sept) recorded by electronic point of sale systems (EPOS) in small shops in the UK were obtained from an EPOS company. Data were aggregated into weekly tobacco, non-tobacco, and e-cigarette sales values, <b>gross</b> <b>margins,</b> sales quantities, and transactions. RESULTS: For the week starting 21 Sept (N= 1416), mean <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> on tobacco products were 6. 6 % (SD= 2. 2) and 24. 1 % (SD= 4. 9) on non-tobacco products. Mean total sales values (tobacco+non-tobacco sales) =Â£ 14, 893. 58 (SD= 8543. 91) while mean tobacco sales=Â£ 3, 716. 17 (SD= 2087. 16), thus tobacco accounted for 26. 0 % (SD= 0. 08) of total sales. Mean total gross profits=Â£ 2, 894. 54 (SD= 1788. 81) while mean gross profits from tobacco were only Â£ 241. 80 (SD= 165. 41), thus tobacco accounted for 9. 1 % (SD= 0. 05) of total profits. Area smoking prevalence and deprivation were both positively correlated with tobacco sales values and tobacco gross profits, but negatively correlated with tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> (p< 0. 0001 for all). N= 550 shops {{had at least one}} e-cigarette transaction, with a mean of 3. 2 (SD= 5. 3) transactions and mean <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> of 43. 4 % (SD= 10. 5). Week 4 (N= 1416) was chosen for presentation because it was the most current and had fewer EPOS errors. Findings across the 4 weeks were similar although small differences were found, including tobacco and total sales values (p< 0. 0001). Tobacco <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> did not differ (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high sales values, tobacco has low <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> compared to other products. Tobacco sales values are higher in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas. The lower <b>gross</b> <b>margins</b> on tobacco in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas suggest that more smokers in these areas smoke cheap discount brands.

All the data used in the research was taken from U. S Census Bureau reports. The novelty of the research lies on its focus at a state level, by dividing states into pertinent clusters and then analyzing the trends in each cluster independently. The research was divided into two phases. Phase 1 of the research focused on identification of the most important factors contributing to <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> of a construction firm. The variables used were derived from the U. S Census Bureau data. Based on the independent variables and <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> all the states were divided into three clusters. Subsequently, a prediction model was developed for each cluster using step-wise backward elimination, thus, eliminating non-significant variables. Results of Model 1 gave impetus to developing Model 2. Model 1 clearly showed that labor productivity was the most important variable in determining <b>gross</b> <b>margin.</b> Model 2 was developed to predict <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> as a function of single most important factor of labor productivity. Similar to Model 1, states were clustered based on their labor productivity and <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> values. Prediction model was developed for each cluster. In this study, an excel embedded decision support tool was also developed. This tool would aid the decision-makers to view the state's level of <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> and labor productivity at a glance. Decision support tool developed was in the form of color-coded maps, each of which was linked to a spreadsheet containing pertinent data. The most important conclusion of the research was that there exists a positive linear relationship between labor productivity and <b>gross</b> <b>margin</b> at a state level in the construction industry. The research also identified and quantified other important factors like percent of rental equipment used, percent of construction work sub-contracted out and percent of cost of materials, components and supplies which affect <b>gross</b> <b>margin...</b>|$|R
