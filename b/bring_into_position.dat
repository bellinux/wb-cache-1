40|$|Supernumerary {{teeth are}} a {{disorder}} of odontogenesis relatively {{common in the}} oral cavity and characterized by an excess number of teeth. The term mesiodens is {{used to refer to}} an unerupted supernumerary tooth in the central region of the premaxilla between the two central incisors. The complications associated with mesiodens include: lack of eruption of permanent teeth, the deviation of the eruption path, rotations, retention, root re-absorption and pulp necrosis with loss of vitality, and diastema. Early detection of mesiodens is most important if such complications are to be avoided. This report describes the treatment of a maxillary central incisor impacted by a mesiodens. The case initially required only surgical treatment, to remove the supernumerary tooth. Successively, orthodontic therapy was done to <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>position</b> the left permanent central incisor, which erupted physiologically, but rotated 90 degrees around along its long axis...|$|E
25|$|One month later, Knight {{wrote that}} Gleaner had {{captured}} the French privateer Adelaide some six leagues WNW of Cape St Vito (Sicily). While both vessels were lying becalmed, the privateer used her sweeps to <b>bring</b> her <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to attack Gleaner. Adelaide was armed with six guns {{and had a}} crew of 46 men. Nevertheless, she struck to Gleaner. Adelaide was five days out of Naples and had taken nothing. Knight's letter was dated at Plymouth on 6 May, suggesting that Gleaner {{had been in the}} Mediterranean carrying dispatches, and then returned.|$|R

50|$|The {{revolving}} cannon {{was designed}} {{with the goal}} of increasing the fire rate of a cannon. The design was similar to that of a revolving pistol of the time, consisting of a cylinder which contained the rounds to be fired, with the rotation of the cylinder being used to <b>bring</b> a round <b>into</b> <b>position</b> at the breech of a single barrel.

2500|$|The leg movement, colloquially {{known as}} the [...] "frog kick" [...] or [...] "whip kick", {{consists}} of two phases: <b>bringing</b> the feet <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for the thrust phase and the insweep phase. From the initial position with the legs stretched out backward, the feet are moved together towards the posterior, while the knees stay together. The knees should not sink too low, as this increases the drag. Then the feet point outward {{in preparation for the}} thrust phase. In the thrust phase, the legs are moved elliptically back to the initial position. During this movement, the knees are kept together. The legs move slower while <b>bringing</b> the legs <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for the thrust phase, and move very fast during the thrust phase. Again, the goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimise drag during the recovery phase. In the recovery phase the lower leg and the feet are {{in the wake of the}} upper leg, and the feet are pointed to the rear. In the thrust phase all three parts create their own wake, and the flat end of the feet acts like a hydrofoil aligned to give maximum forward thrust. The resulting drag coefficient (or more precisely the frontal area) is thus doubled in the thrust phase.|$|R

She sank in less than a minute, taking 202 of her 273 officers and men with her. Those whose bodies were not recovered, were listed as ‘missing in action’ {{for a year and a}} day after the sinking. They were considered officially ‘dead’ on 12 September 1944.|$|R
2500|$|U-20 {{surfaced}} {{again at}} 12:45 as visibility was now excellent. At 13:20 something was sighted and Schwieger {{was summoned to}} the conning tower: at first {{it appeared to be}} several ships {{because of the number of}} funnels and masts, but this resolved into one large steamer appearing over the horizon. At 13:25 the submarine submerged to periscope depth of 11metres and set a course to intercept the liner at her maximum submerged speed of 9 knots. When the ships had closed to [...] Lusitania turned away, Schwieger feared he had lost his target, but she turned again, this time onto a near ideal course to <b>bring</b> her <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for an attack.

40|$|My project {{here is the}} {{appraisal}} of Michael Dummett's diagnosis that the inconsistency of Frege’s system in Grundgesetze is attributable to his neglect of the indefinite extensibility of fundamental mathematical concepts. I address a problem that obscures the usual intuitive characterisations {{of the notion of}} indefinite extensibility, and offer thereby what I believe to be the correct characterisation of the notion. En passant, some issues are reviewed about the "size" of indefinitely extensible concepts. And that will <b>bring</b> us <b>into</b> <b>position</b> to scrutinise the connections of the notion as characterised with paradox, and specifically the paradox that Russell found for Frege’s Basic Law V. It will be argued that Dummett’s diagnosis is apt for the Burali-Forti paradox, wrong for Cantor’s paradox, and correct for the paradox inherent in Law V only on the assumption that full classical imperative higher-order logic is indeed wholly logical...|$|R
50|$|The current bridge {{replaced}} {{a bridge}} built in 1931 {{that was only}} 19 feet wide and had two right angles on the Minnesota side. The bridge was constructed in a unique way: the 470-foot truss span was built on falsework on two barges out of the current and the main river channel. When the truss section was completed, engineers floated the span on its barges down the river. The bridge was positioned higher than the supports {{so it could be}} brought into place. Once the span was in place, they flooded the barges to <b>bring</b> the bridge <b>into</b> <b>position</b> vertically. This operation took only eight hours to complete.|$|R

Knight and his squad fight to reach McNamera and bring him to an LZ to evac him via helicopter. Captain Killinski tells Knight that a company of VC slipped through and are attacking the village. Knight's platoon arrives at the village and kill off the VC company. The platoon is then attacked by Mortar fire and Knight is hit by shrapnel, damaging his eye, but Sergeant Roach applies first aid. Roach brings a baby from one of the destroyed huts and explains the VC were after the villagers not the soldiers.|$|R
500|$|The first {{attack against}} the {{mountain}} line of the 24th Infantry came {{on the morning of}} August 18, when the North Koreans overran several E Company positions on the northern spur of Battle Mountain and killed the company commander. During the day, Lieutenant Colonel Paul F. Roberts succeeded Lieutenant Colonel George R. Cole in command of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry there. The next day, the North Koreans attacked C Company on Battle Mountain and routed it. Officers could collect only 40 men to <b>bring</b> them back <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> Many ROK police on P'il-bong also ran [...] from the fight, and only 56 of them remained in their defensive positions. American officers used threats and physical force to get others back <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> A [...] gap in the line north of P'il-bong existed in the 24th Infantry lines {{at the close of the}} day, and an unknown number of North Koreans were moving into it.|$|R
60|$|Felix {{could not}} but think Alda might be wise, {{though it was}} not pretty wisdom. Go out alone and make the fortune! Ferdinand did not seem to think the {{separation}} possible. He said he would rather go to work in Peter Brown's office, where he had already a hold; and his familiarity with Spanish would secure him usefulness and promotion, and five or six years would <b>bring</b> them <b>into</b> a <b>position</b> to marry. He did not look fit for desk-work in London, but his mind was made up to any privation, so that he could be in reach of Alda, and hope to give her what he had once thought easily within his grasp.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the 42d {{was having a}} hard time of it. They had fought their way to the edge of the swamp, beyond which lay an immense Ashanti camp, and here the fire was so tremendously heavy that the advance was again completely arrested. Not an enemy was to be seen, but from every bush of the opposite side puffs of smoke came thick and fast, and a perfect rain of slugs swept over the ground on which they were lying. Here Rait's gun, for he was only able from the narrowness of the path to <b>bring</b> one <b>into</b> <b>position,</b> did splendid service. Advancing boldly in front of the line of the 42d, ably assisted by Lieutenant Saunders, he poured round after round of grape into the enemy until their fire slackened a little, and the 42d, leaping to their feet, struggled across the swamp, which was over knee deep. Step by step they won their way through the camp and up the hill. Everywhere the dead Ashantis lay in heaps, attesting the terrible effect of the Snider fire and the determination with which they had fought.|$|R
5000|$|For the Jets, it was simple: a win {{would qualify}} {{them for the}} playoffs, only a year after a {{disastrous}} 4-12 season. After the teams traded punts, Aaron Brooks completed a pass to Johnnie Morant for a first down, but David Barrett forced a fumble and Hank Poteat recovered. Brad Smith had a key run on the next drive, and Chad Pennington then tossed a 1-yard touchdown pass to Chris Baker. Oakland later went on a drive to the Jets' 10-yard line, but on third down, Kerry Rhodes sacked Brooks, forcing Oakland {{to settle for a}} Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Pennington led the Jets on a key score during a [...] "two-minute drill," [...] <b>bringing</b> the Jets <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for a Mike Nugent 35-yard field goal and a 10-3 halftime lead.|$|R
60|$|The city occupied, it now {{remained}} {{to reduce the}} fortress and bring its warrior-mistress to terms. Cesare set about this at once, nor allowed the Christmas festivities to interfere with his labours, but kept his men at work to <b>bring</b> the siege-guns <b>into</b> <b>position.</b> On Christmas Day the countess belatedly attempted a feeble ruse {{in the hope of}} intimidating them. She flew from her battlements a banner, bearing the device of the lion of St. Mark, thinking to trick Cesare into the belief that she had obtained the protection of Venice, or, perhaps, signifying thus that she threw herself into the arms of the republic, making surrender of her fiefs to the Venetians to the end that she might spite a force which she could not long withstand--as Giovanni Sforza had sought to do.|$|R
5000|$|Translated as [...] "crushing" [...] or [...] "smashing" [...] fist, Beng Quan is {{the most}} {{straightforward}} of the Xingyi dynamics, performed either as a grasp and strike or {{as a pair of}} strikes with the fist. The strikes are unified with the forward, three-step motion of the body. Two steps drive the fist forward. The third, or follow-step, <b>brings</b> the body <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for the next strike. The legs, which are strengthened in standing exercises, santishi, are kept bent and use the compression and release of the long muscles. The strikes or blows are driven up in a diagonal from the muscles of the rear foot, through the muscles of the torso and out the striking arm. This all combines to give Beng Quan a simple and straightforward power which utilises the entire body's momentum and mass.|$|R

5000|$|The major sperm protein (MSP) is a {{nematode}} specific small protein of 126 {{amino acids}} with a molecular weight of 14 kDa. It {{is the key}} player in the motility machinery of nematodes that propels the crawling movement/motility of nematode sperm. It is the most abundant protein present in nematode sperm, comprising 15% of the total protein and more than 40% of the soluble protein. MSP is exclusively synthesized in spermatocytes of the nematodes. The MSP has two main functions in the reproduction of the helminthes: i) as cytosolic component it {{is responsible for the}} crawling movement of the mature sperm (without flagellum), and ii) once released, it acts as hormone on the female germ cells, where it triggers oocyte maturation and stimulates the oviduct wall to contract to <b>bring</b> the oocytes <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for fertilization.

40|$|This {{research}} enters {{new ground}} by presenting comparative survey evidence on asset managers' views and {{behavior in the}} United States, Germany, Japan and Thailand. Relying on Hofstede's four cultural dimensions, we find that cultural differences are most helpful in understanding country differences which cannot be explained by pure economic reasoning. In short, controlling for various determinants, the dimension of more Individualism predicts less herding behavior, more Power Distance leads to older and comparatively less experienced managers in the upper hierarchy, Masculinity <b>brings</b> men <b>into</b> top <b>positions</b> and to higher volumes of assets under personal responsibility, and Uncertainty Avoidance is related to higher safety margins against the tracking error allowed and relatively more research effort. These consequences, i. e. the culturally different importance of herding, age, experience, gender, tracking error and research effort, clearly affect investment behavior, although in a complex way.

40|$|The strong metal-metal bonds {{inherent}} to the crystal structure of WO 2 have a pronounced {{effect on the}} electronic characteristics of this transition-metal oxide. The results of the bonding are clearly identifiable in the photoemission spectra of polycrystalline WO 2 samples. For the first time, single crystal surface studies have also been carried out. Single crystals of WO 2 with well-developed (012) faces were grown by a vapour transport method, and surface cleaning procedures involving ion bombardment and low-pressure oxygen annealing were developed. Photoemission spectroscopy and {{low energy electron diffraction}} were used to characterise the surface composition and long range order. LEED patterns reveal the expected c 2 mm symmetry, based on a model (012) surface unit cell of dimensions 5. 6 Å × 21 Å. Details of the surface structure were examined using high-resolution STM. The periodicity in filled-state STM images is determined by the separation between the centres of the metal-metal bonds rather than individual atoms. Rows of greyscale maxima are observed corresponding to the chains of WO 6 octahedra which run in the [100] direction. The terminating (012) ionic plane most probably has stoichiometry W 2 O 4. STM images demonstrate that the chains of paired WO 6 octahedra in this outer layer undergo pronounced lateral relaxations, <b>bringing</b> them <b>into</b> <b>positions</b> between the rows of chains in the underlying W 2 ionic plane. Atomic-scale steps and other defects have been identified. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A solo {{exhibition}} of 10 framed photographic ink jet prints with drawing (108 cm x 86 cm). The installation addresses issues of realism and fiction in photography, {{and the construction}} of utopias and dystopias through the conceits of paradigms of realism, furthering Timberlake’s work concerning humanity, science and landscape. Timberlake is specifically interested in what kind of truths we expect from photography and drawing, in the context of his continued engagement with landscapes of the imaginary, and the role of photography in the construction of histories. In this series contrasts in scale and grids were combined with shifting perspectives to create compelling, unsettling and provocative images. The use of a large format rail camera allowed for an extended plane of focus and angled horizons similar to that of aerial photography; albeit over a very small patch of photographed land. In this way a field of detail was produced with a fragmented map of imagined spaces replacing the figure/ground dyad seen in some of the earlier work (for example the “Another Country” series). In this way Timberlake has sought to <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> question the <b>position</b> of the viewing subject...|$|R

In the mean time the boat was swept down the torrent with fearful rapidity. It glided swiftly on amid boiling whirlpools and sheets of rippling foam, that were quite frightful to see. The buildings of the town here bordered the banks of the river on each side, and there were little jutting piers and platforms here and there, with boys upon them in some places, fishing, and women washing clothes in others. The boys in the boat did not call for help, and so nobody attempted to come and help them. Gerald's plan was to keep the boat headed right, and so let her drift on until she had passed through the town, in hopes of being able to bring her up somewhere on the shore below.|$|R
50|$|CISC Semiconductor GmbH defines {{itself as}} “design and {{consulting}} service company for industries developing embedded microelectronic systems with extremely short Time-To-Market cycles.” The company started in 1999, working on {{solutions for the}} semiconductor industry, but soon expanded its field towards the automotive branch and further extended business towards the radio frequency technology (RFID) sector in 2003. Since then, CISC gained significant experience and expertise in RFID, developing an own business segment and highly sensitive measurement equipment to test and verify RFID systems for different industries. Representatives of CISC Semiconductor are actively working on and contributing to worldwide standardization of future technologies like RFID, in different standardization organizations. This effort <b>brings</b> CISC <b>into</b> the <b>position</b> of being a leader in research and development, and thus {{being able to be}} “one step ahead of innovation”.

40|$|AbstractA novel {{mechanism}} for proton/electron transfer is proposed for NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) {{based on the}} following findings: (1) EPR signals of the protein-bound fast-relaxing semiquinone anion radicals (abbreviated as QNf-) are observable only {{in the presence of}} proton-transmembrane electrochemical potential; (2) Iron–sulfur cluster N 2 and QNf- are directly spin-coupled; and (3) The projection of the interspin vector extends only 5 Å along the membrane normal [Yano, T., Dunham, W. R. and Ohnishi, T. (2005) Biochemistry, 44, 1744 – 1754]. We propose that the proton pump is operated by redox-driven conformational changes of the quinone binding protein. In the input state, semiquinone is reduced to quinol, acquiring two protons from the N (matrix) side of the mitochondrial inner membrane and an electron from the low potential (NADH) side of the respiratory chain. A conformational change <b>brings</b> the protons <b>into</b> <b>position</b> for release at the P (inter-membrane space) side of the membrane via a proton-well. Concomitantly, an electron is donated to the quinone pool at the high potential side of the coupling site. The system then returns to the original state to repeat the cycle. This hypothesis provides a useful frame work for further investigation of the mechanism of proton translocation in complex I...|$|R
25|$|Adamson came to note as a rugby player while {{representing}} Durham School and Durham City Rugby Football Club. In 1898 he {{was made}} a member of invitational touring side The Barbarians. Although never representing the England national team, Adamson was invited to tour with the British Isles team on the first official tour of Australia in 1899. Adamson was the stand-out player of the tour, being selected in all 20 matches and amassing 136 points in all games. He scored 17 points from the Test matches, two tries, four conversions and a penalty goal, making him the Tour's top scorer. In total he scored 8 tries, 35 conversions, 3 dropped goals and 10 penalty goals, 136 point by 1899 IRB rules; 149 by modern (2009) scoring rules. In the First Test, Adamson was placed at centre, alongside Gwyn Nicholls; but after the British team lost the game, team captain Matthew Mullineux dropped himself from the team to <b>bring</b> Adamson <b>into</b> his <b>position</b> at half-back.
