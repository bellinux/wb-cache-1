5000|$|... in (I)jekavian or Jekavian {{pronunciation}} (ijekavski [...] or jekavski [...] ), it {{has come}} to be pronounced ije or je, depending on whether the vowel <b>was</b> <b>long</b> or short.

5|$|Amid {{the general}} {{euphoria}} in Poland – {{the acquisition of}} Teschen was a very popular development – no one {{paid attention to the}} bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles.

5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk is likely to <b>be</b> <b>long</b> lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{existing}} large-scale photovoltaic power stations are {{owned and operated by}} independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits, but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not <b>be</b> <b>long</b> before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, {{he called for a}} rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to <b>be</b> <b>long,</b> winding, and indirect.|$|E
5|$|Society {{became more}} liberal (as seen, for instance, in the {{achievements}} of the Polish Film School and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a civil society started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomułka's thaw would <b>be</b> <b>long</b> over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent would end up removing Gomułka from power in 1970ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.|$|E

5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints tend to <b>be</b> <b>long</b> and lean, modern breed preferences {{are for a}} square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|Back in her bedroom, Rapunzel is {{suddenly}} flooded by memories from her past. Realizing Gothel is a fraud, she finally finds {{the courage to}} rebel against her. However, Gothel, unwilling to lose Rapunzel, chains her up and gags her with a white handkerchief. When Flynn, having managed {{to escape from the}} castle, arrives at the tower, Gothel stabs him. Desperate to save him, Rapunzel promises to do whatever Gothel pleases in return. Gothel complies, but just as Rapunzel is about to heal him, Flynn cuts her hair short, causing it to turn brown and lose all of its magical powers and might never <b>be</b> <b>long</b> again, resulting in Gothel's death. Flynn dies in Rapunzel's arms and she cries bitterly. However, the flower's magic manifests itself through Rapunzel's tears and returns Flynn to life. Flynn returns Rapunzel to the palace, where she is finally reunited with her parents.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may <b>be</b> <b>long</b> or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E

5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a new report in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus could, for instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring the Soviets to expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably mean less damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would <b>be</b> <b>long</b> gone. This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators will <b>be</b> <b>long</b> and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E
5|$|The Congo Free State was a {{corporate}} state in Central Africa privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium founded and recognised by the Berlin Conference of 1885. What {{would later become}} Abir Company territory was the land between the Lopori and Maringa river basins, tributaries of the Congo River, {{in the north of}} the state. The local populace here were yam and cassava farmers who engaged in trade with river fishermen and pygmy hunters. In 1885 a force of the Manyema people, followers of Tippu Tip, the Swahili-Zanzibari slave trader, arrived {{at the head of the}} Lopori River from Stanley Falls. They took hostages from nearby villages to ransom in return for ivory. By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin. The Free State was concerned by this development and in 1889 had enacted the Monopoly Act which declared that all products in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone. The Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers, traders and the Manyema from the region, the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at Basankusu in May 1890. The campaign would <b>be</b> <b>long</b> but eventually successful and the entire basin was under Free State control by 1898.|$|E
